<HEADLINE> Likud Party to Hold Double Leadership Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The central committee of
Israel's right-wing Likud Party decided on Monday to hold double
leadership elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Likud will elect a leader in 90 days, and
will hold one more leadership election after two years.
</P>
<P>
The double elections proposal was made by Likud interim leader
Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the outgoing Foreign Minister, has insisted that the
first vote will yield a leader to rebuild the party, while
the second will decide who will take the party into the next
general election.
</P>
<P>
In the May elections, Likud leader, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was defeated by the left-wing Labor Party chairman
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud also failed to maintain its Knesset
(parliament) seats in the elections, getting only 19 seats,
compared to 32 seats in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has called on Likud to join the new government in
order to build a broad-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still difference in Likud on taking part
in the coalition government. Some Likud members insist that it
will be better for the party to rebuild itself by remaining
as the biggest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Considering the difficulties to join forces with Likud, Barak
reportedly is prepared to form a narrow coalition in
recent days.

<HEADLINE> African Customs Urged to be More Trade-Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 HARARE, June 14 (xinhua) -- African custom officers are urged
to be more trade-friendly and efficient, so as to collect more
revenues for their countries.
</P>
<P>
At a four-day Regional Valuation and Fraud Workshop started
here Monday, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said
there was need for the custom officers to build necessary capacity
to counter obstacles to legitimate trade.
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest challenges facing customs today is to
reconcile the apparently contradictory objectives of enforcing
government regulations while at the same time posing minimum
obstacle to legitimate trade, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"There had been repeated demands by governments and traders
within the continent that custom officials be more facilitative
and transparent in their operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was exciting to note that participants to
the workshop were going to discuss the implementation of the
valuation code by the year 2000 which played a very important
role in any modern tariff system.
</P>
<P>
"It is however sad to note that in efforts to collect revenue
for governments, we always meet those dishonest importers who
want to gain unfair competitive advantage by manipulating the
value of duty so that they pay little," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "it is therefore incumbent upon each customs
administration represented here to give full attention and
support to those instruments of the world Customs Organization in
the enforcement field in order to increase their capacity to
compact such practices."
</P>
<P>
The workshop running from June 14 to 18 attracted senior
customs officials from Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda,
Tanzania, Swaziland, Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lowers GDP Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIIROBI, June 14 (Reuters) -- Kenya's gross domestic product
(GDP) growth in 1999 is likely to be 2.0 percent, lower than an
earlier optimistic forecast of 2.5 percent, according to a monthly
official report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya said in a report that economic
recession would continue this year with all sectors showing
weakness.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's GDP grew 4.8 percent in 1995 and 4.6 percent in 1996
but then slumped to 2.3 percent in 1997 and just 1.8 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government had predicted an economic recovery this
year but its confidence has declined steadily in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The bank said GDP growth stood at 1.7 percent in the 12 months
to March, unchanged from January and February.
</P>
<P>
"Viewed against the population growth of about 2.4 percent
every year, the slowdown in economic growth, particularly in 1997
and 1998, implies that no substantial gains were made in the
fight against poverty and unemployment,'' central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It blamed the economy's troubles on poor infrastructure --
roads, telecommunication services, port operations and water
supply -- which limited production and marketing by increasing
the costs per unit of output across the economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank listed other problems such as reduced flow of
productive resources into the more efficient private sector,
insecurity in areas visited by tourists, and the loss of investor
confidence caused by the poor delivery of public services as well
as delays in implementing donor- led reforms.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund halted a three-year $205
million loan package to Kenya in 1997 in protest against
corruption. Last month, the Fund's board and Kenya's finance
ministry officials failed to agree a date to resume their talks.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's government had initially forecast 1999 GDP growth of
3.0 percent but the planning ministry last month lowered that to
2.3 percent. Investment analysts said even the government's
revised figure was far too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The central bank urged the government to quicken the pace of
privatization of Kenya Posts &AMP; Telecommunications Corporation,
Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Railways.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Cape Verde's Structural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Monday commended the government of Cape Verde for its
efforts in implementing comprehensive structural reforms and
improving the climate for private sector growth, but emphasized
the need for sustained efforts to consolidate the progress.
</P>
<P>
In an annual review of the economy of the West African country,
the IMF praised Cape Verde's improved fiscal position, ambitious
privatization process, and budget.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors (of the IMF) welcomed the authorities'
efforts to implement comprehensive structural reforms and improve
the climate for private sector growth, while pursuing sound
macro-economic policies," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Despite failing rains on a large part of the islands, the
country's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5 percent in
1998, fueled mainly by the development of tourism, of
export-oriented manufacturing, and of construction, stimulated by
rising workers' remittances. Inflation declined to an average of
4.3 percent in 1998, from 8.5 percent in 1997, reflecting prudent
monetary and fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, directors considered the medium-term outlook as
favorable, but underscored the need, nevertheless, for sustained
efforts to consolidate the progress achieved in both the
macroeconomic and structural areas," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the country's currency is pegged to the euro, and no
longer the Portuguese escudo, the IMF said it was essential that
monetary policy bring the rate of inflation to the level
prevailing in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also backed continued prudent expenditure policies, and
a further strengthening of the tax system and budgetary
procedures.
</P>
<P>
It applauded Cape Verde's progress toward deeper, more
competitive financial markets, as well as the positive results
from the diversification of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast real GDP would grow 6 percent this year,
spurred by a pick-up of exports and tourism, following the
substantial new investments in 1998. Inflation was expected to
fall to 3 percent in 1999. The IMF also saw a significant
strengthening of the official reserves of the central bank.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Reaffirms Support to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan Monday reaffirmed the
regional body's support to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its
territorial dispute with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states have "a firm stance toward Iran's occupation of
the three UAE islands" of Abu Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs in
the Gulf, Al-Hujailan told Kuwait News Agency upon arrival here
from Qatar for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"We support the UAE's sovereignty over the three islands
because the GCC states surely believe these islands belong to the
UAE," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC backs the "wise" call of UAE President Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nuhayyan for solving this issue through
peaceful means or through international court of justice should
negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chief urged Iran to end the issue in accordance with
Sheikh Zayed's call so as to open cooperation with all GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the three Gulf islands, which are controlled
by Iran but claimed by both countries, have been blocking an
improvement in bilateral ties between Tehran and Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
On the GCC foreign ministers' meeting held last Saturday in
the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Al-Hujailan acknowledged that there
were differences over the final statement of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The GCC top diplomats discussed a number of issues topped
by the UAE-Iranian dispute and the rapprochement between some
GCC members and Iran. But they concluded the meeting without
issuing a final statement.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hujailan said the ministerial council wanted to keep the
meeting open until all GCC countries have agreed on the
issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kuwait, Al-Hujailan will present Kuwaiti
Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah a report over the closed-door meeting
of the GCC leaders which was held in the Saudi western city of
Jeddah on may 10.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns of Future Gold Mine Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, June 14 (xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
said on Monday a number of gold mine closures are likely to be
witnessed in the world if the current low prices are sustained for
a prolonged period.
</P>
<P>
 In its latest Treasury Commentary, the bank said new mines or
those with substantially high costs due to dwindling ore reserves
or the increasing depth at which gold was mined were likely to be
affected first.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices last week hit a new 25-year low of 257 U.S .
dollars per ounce on the back of gold sales from Australia and
South Africa, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Sentiment in the gold market remains negative in the wake of
Britain's intended sales with the first auction of 25 tons
earmarked for July 6," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, however, those mines with reasonably solid
hedging or those that locked their prices by selling future gold
production were likely to be less affected.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold production country in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Plans for U.N. Civil Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. operation in
Kosovo, known as the United Nations Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK), has its first personnel on the ground to
facilitate the peace process in the Yugoslav province, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of UNMIK is under way," he said in his report
to the U.N. Security Council. "Humanitarian agencies have deployed
along with first contingent of the international security presence
and have begun to provide humanitarian relief."
</P>
<P>
An advance core headquarters had also been assembled at Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, and would be moved to Kosovo at the earliest
opportunity, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan did not give figures for the size or the cost of
UNMIK, but it is expected to number thousands of aid workers,
administrators and police. Annan's proposals for UNMIK's
composition must be endorsed by the 15-nation U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force in Kosovo, known as KFOR, will
eventually number some 60,000.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK is to have four components, including one led by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and
another by the European Union (EU), and will be headed by a
special representative appointed by Annan, the U.N. chief said in
his report.
</P>
<P>
He announced over the weekend that the post is temporarily
filled by the U.N. undersecretary-general, Sergio Vieira de Mello,
a 51-year-old Brazilian, who arrived in Pristina, provincial
capital of Kosovo, on Sunday by land, U.N. officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he led a humanitarian assessment mission to assess
humanitarian needs in Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led civilian operation will have the immense task of
resettling -- and providing an interim administration for -- up to
a million ethnic Albanian refugees who sought asylum in
neighboring countries as well as thousands of others displaced
inside Kosovo since the March 24 beginning of NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK will also help lead Kosovo toward a large measure of
autonomy, pending a final settlement of the status of the
province, where ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the
province's population of 2 million before the huge exodus of
refugees in the wake the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The task of institution-building, for which OSCE will be the
lead agency, might comprise four main functions, the final
structure to be decided in consultation with OSCE," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed four functions include: human resources
capacity-building, democratization and governance, conduct and
monitoring of elections.
</P>
<P>
"The tasks of reconstruction would be led by the European
Union, and should be aimed at rebuilding the physical, economic
and social infrastructure and systems of Kosovo and supporting the
reactivation of public services and utilities," Annan said. "The
range of tasks would be decided in consultation with the European
Union."

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania Get Loans for Boosting Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank
has granted a loan of five million U.S. dollars to help upgrade
the Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro international airports in
navigation facilities and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director General of the Tanzania Civil Aviation
Authority (TCAA) Mumtazhussein Roshan Alloo Monday told a news
conference here that Tanzanian and Dutch governments have also
offered 2.2 million dollars for better air services. !0The newly
formed TCAA, formerly known as the Directorate of Civil Aviation
(DCA), will use the loans to replace and rehabilitate air
navigation infrastructure,!1 he said.
</P>
<P>
Alloo said that the packages would focus on the improvement of
the civil aviation training on basic and refresher aviation
courses in air traffic control, aviation engineering and
communication, fire services and aviation security.
</P>
<P>
He said although the current air navigation facilities at the
two airports were Y2K immune, it was imperative to improve them
for better performance.
</P>
<P>
"There will be four new fire service tenders for DIA and KIA
expected in the country before the end of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Alloo disclosed that a team of the International Air Transport
Association officials was expected to arrive in the country on
June 24 on a two-day visit to check Tanzanian civil aviation
systems.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a state-own airliner, the Air Tanzania Cooperation
(ATC), and several small private-own ones.
</P>
<P>
ATC is one of East Africa's premier Airlines serving eight
domestic points in Tanzania as well as eight other cities
throughout East Africa and Southern Africa including Johannesburg,
Harare, Lusaka, Entebbe, Kigali, Bujumbura and Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
A once vigorous flag carrier with a nine-aircraft fleet and 100
percent coverage of domestic market, the 20-year-old ATC now owns
only two Boeing 737-200 and one Forkker Friendship 27 and covers
only 70% of the market share.
</P>
<P>
ATC also dry-leased a Boeing 737-300 from Australia early this
year when it cut 135 from its staff of 658 to boost the
competitiveness in the market.

<HEADLINE> Bush Outlines Positions on Controversial Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican front-runner
George W. Bush, a day after announcing he'll join the 2000
presidential race, outlined his positions Monday on a range of
controversial issues from abortion to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging news conference on his maiden campaign trip,
Bush, who arrived in New Hampshire Monday, said he would uphold
the dignity of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sure to provoke ire from social conservatives,
Bush told reporters he would not insist on an abortion litmus
test for judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the Texas governor, vowed to campaign on a message that
promotes education reforms, a stronger military and a reformed
Republican Party that stresses both compassion and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Bush said "I am concerned that we have a
settlement without a plan of implementation".
</P>
<P>
"And I just think it's important for the president to tell us
how long the troops will be there and to give us a sense of the
understanding that European troops should take the place of
American troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would develop and deploy anti-ballistic missile
systems and strengthen alliances in an "uncertain world".
</P>
<P>
Bush opposes racial quotas and abortion and favors reducing
taxes, cutting federal regulations, promoting free trade and
overhauling the legal system to reduce lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
He also advocates expanding programs to upgrade education and
help people find work "so that on one is left behind."
</P>
<P>
It's Bush's first trip to New Hampshire, where the first state
presidential primary will be held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Polls show Bush far ahead in the race for the Republican
Party's 2000 presidential nomination and holding a double-digit
lead over the Democratic front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, who
is set to formally announce his candidacy Wednesday in Tennesse.
</P>
<P>
Bush launched his campaign Saturday in Iowa where he drew
enthusiastic crowds. On Sunday, the Texas governor was in Maine
for a 75th birthday celebration for his famous father, former
president George Bush.

ADDIS ABABA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said that fighting
between the Ethiopian forces and the Eritrean army continued in
the vicinity of the Mereb River Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse was quoted by the
state Ethiopian News Agency as saying that Ethiopian army killed,
wounded and took prisoners over 7,800 Eritrean soldiers during an
offensive at the Mereb front on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia accused that the Eritrean army initiated the assault
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson claimed the Ethiopian forces had successfully
repelled Eritrean offensive on the Bure front on June 9-10.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian army killed, wounded over 480 enemy soldiers
during an offensive at the Bure front on June 10," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean foreign ministry also claimed Monday
that over 12,210 Ethiopian soldiers were killed or wounded during
the border fighting since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although both Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted the peace plan
 sponsored by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), they
haven't so far reached a cease-fire over their year-long border
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Chief Over Iran's Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq protested to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan Monday over Iran's recent missile attacks on
Iraq, urging the U.N. to pressure Tehran to stop "aggressive acts"
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf said that Iran's recent aggressive acts is a dangerous
escalation that threatens Iraq's sincere efforts to maintain
good-neighbor relations based on mutual respect for sovereignty,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged Annan to live up to his responsibilities by condemning
the latest Iranian aggression on Iraq and to press Tehran to
respect the international law and Iraq's good-neighbor policy.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities last Saturday said that three
surface-to-surface missiles were fired last Thursday at a
military camp of Iranian armed opposition Mujahedeen Khalq group
in the northern Iraqi province of Diyala.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said that last Wednesday, some Iranian agents committed
another crime in Baghdad by launching a car-bomb attack, which led
to the deaths of a number of Iraqi citizens and six members of the
Mujahedeen Khalq organization.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, when a bus carrying Mujahedeen Khalq members
was passing by the Hammad Shihab hospital in the northeast of
Baghdad, a pickup truck full of explosives hit it and exploded,
killing six members of the exile opposition and a number of
citizens nearby.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, which has a close relationship
with the Iraqi government, has more than 30,000 militarily trained
men and women in 17 camps near Iranian border. The group's
fighters often target Iranian government sites.

<HEADLINE> Blair Meets Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen,
on his way to South Africa via London, met with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair upon invitation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting, Blair repeated his apology to
China for NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last
month, saying that he understands the indignation expressed by the
Chinese people in this regard and hopes that related
investigations would produce satisfying results.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said that Britain has no intention
to interfere in the affairs of other countries, nor has NATO the
right to interfere in the affairs of other regions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kosovo could not be quoted as a model for any
other country in other regions.
</P>
<P>
Sino-British relations have been strengthened with the return
of Hong Kong to China and both sides share the wish to promote
their friendly cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Blair also expressed the wish that difficulties in relations
between the two countries arising from the Kosovo issue could soon
be overcome in the coming weeks, so as to ensure consolidation of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that with joint efforts on both sides, Sino-British
relations have enjoyed good momentum of development since Hong
Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
The successful exchange of visits by the prime ministers of the
two countries last year served to boost the expansion of bilateral
ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Along with constant growth of bilateral trade, the spheres of
cooperation have increasingly expanded, major projects of
cooperation have been proceeding smoothly, and exchanges in
cultural, educational, scientific and technological fields have
prospered, he added.
</P>
<P>
The development of Sino-British relations to the level of today
has not come the easy way, and therefore, needs to be cherished
and safeguarded, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government hopes to see the advancement of
Sino-British relations on a long-term basis and in a stable and
sound manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Qian said that the Kosovo issue was one of long-standing
ethnic conflicts of a particular area in Yugoslavia, and
unfortunately, had developed into a war in post-war Europe.
</P>
<P>
While the war is over, the original problems remained unsolved,
and a host of new problems have emerged as a result, he said. "The
lesson merits reflection," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
After going through the two World Wars and a full half-century
of Cold War, international communities had summed up and
formulated some basic norms guiding international relations along
with the principles and aims of the United nations, including
those on safeguarding the independence, sovereignty, and
territorial integrity of countries, non-interference of each
others' internal affairs, peaceful resolution of disputes,
non-resorting to force or threat by force, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Those guiding principles should continue to be respected and
upheld, instead of being given up, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the Kosovo issue should be resolved through
political dialogue in a peaceful manner based on the respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and on
guaranteeing the legitimate interests of all ethnic groups in the
Kosovo region, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the excuses, it should never be allowed to use force
against a sovereign country, and without the approval of the
Security Council of the United Nations, it will never work to take
military actions against a sovereign country, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Qian attended a luncheon hosted by British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. Both Qian and Cook expressed their
willingness to work for the promotion, deepening and expansion of
Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Also, Qian and Cook had further exchange of views on the Kosovo
issue and other international and regional issues.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Appeals to Donors to Resume Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The union government of
Tanzania made a special appeal Monday to the donor community to
resume aid to Zanzibar as the commonwealth-brokered reconciliation
accord has been signed.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal in the Tanzanian capital, foreign minister
Jakaya Kikwete said the resumption of aid will help residents in
Zanzibar build confidence in their future.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said at a post-Zanzibar reconciliation debriefing that
a poor region like Zanzibar depends on donor aid to complement its
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the donor community not to hesitate to open the
doors for Zanzibar as the provisions in the agreement are being
implemented," Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the commonwealth, Zanzibar's ruling party Chama Cha
 Mapinduzi (CCM) and opposition Civic United Front (CUF) reached
an agreement for national reconciliation last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 general elections, Zanzibar's CCM, under Salmin
Amour who was seeking a second term as president of the isles,
claimed a narrow victory over the opposition CUF whose candidate
was Seif Shariff Hamad, but CUF questioned the result and refused
to recognize the new government.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the donors have frozen all but essential
humanitarian aid programs on the islands, which lie off the
eastern coast of the mainland of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Although the two conflict parties have reached a consensus to
settle their political impasse, donors have yet to fully resume
their assistance to Zanzibar whose economy has worsened in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said lifting of the suspension of the aid will be a
great contribution on the part of the donors in the whole
reconciliation exercise.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister assured the donor community of the
commitment leaders of both CCM and CUF have vowed to honor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said it is high time the donor community
considered resuming economic co-operation with Zanzibar to make
the islanders realize the fruits of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising Unguja and Pemba, as well as a number of
smaller islands, joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the United
Republic of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Halt Construction of Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a U.N. conference on
Monday urged Israel to halt construction of Jewish settlements in
Palestinian areas and adhere to the peace agreements signed
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the opening session of the two-day fourth meeting
of the U.N. Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of
the Palestinian People criticized Israel's settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
"Building of new settlements and expansion of the existing ones
have destructive effects on the Mideast peace process," said
Seyyid al-Masri, Egypt's assistant foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The international community was surprised over Israel's
construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud
settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement,
al-Masri said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's activities have aroused fears over the devastating
consequences of its settlement policy on the peace process, he
added, calling on Israel to halt the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which always has ignored such discussions, did not
send a delegate to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials and delegates from member countries also started
preparations for a meeting in Geneva next month that could start a
process for dealing with Jewish settlements under international
laws.
</P>
<P>
That meeting, called by the U.N. General Assembly, is to urge
Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activities in the
Israeli-occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva
Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians maintain that construction of Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
violates the convention, which calls for protection for civilians
in wars. The convention bans usurpation of land by an occupying
power.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the meeting, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
called on the Palestinians and Israel to focus on building peace.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal for the political courage of the leaders on both sides
and call upon them to re-embark on the negotiations process in the
spirit of pragmatism and statesmanship," Annan said in the letter
read on his behalf by his deputy, Chinmaya Gharekhan.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive
peace talks largely due to Israel's settlement activities since
hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Dubai to Purchase Gas from Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Dubai, the second largest
emirate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has decided to purchase
6 to 21 million cubic meters of gas per day from Qatar, commencing
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a Memorandum of Understanding signed
Monday between the Dubai Supply Authority (DSA) and the UAE
Offset Group (UOG).
</P>
<P>
Dubai will buy the gas through Dolphin, a project launched by
UOG to stimulate industrial and commercial investment in the Gulf
region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
With a large investment of 8 to 10 billion U.S. dollars, the
project aims to develop gas in Qatar's huge north field and supply
it to the UAE, Oman and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, UOG signed an agreement with the government
of Oman to sell it 300-600 million cubic feet (9-18 million cubic
meters) of gas per day.
</P>
<P>
A similar agreement was reached on June 8 with the government
of Pakistan, under which Pakistan will import 1-1.5 billion cubic
feet (30-45 million cubic meters) of gas per day, starting in the
middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The gas will be transferred by a pipeline which starts from Qatar
and extends to UAE, Oman and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"The Dolphin gas will bridge the gap between energy supply and
demand which is expected to develop in Dubai over the next five
years as its economy expands," said Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al
Maktoum, director general of DSA.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Saif Al Mazrouei, deputy chairman of UOG, said that
"with the government of Dubai supporting Dolphin, the fundamentals
are now in place to enable us to start turning the concept into
reality."
</P>
<P>
"We have both supplies and markets confirmed," he added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Holds Further Talks on Government Formation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak held further secret talks Monday with potential
coalition partner leaders on issues concerning the formation of a
new government, especially the distributions of its posts.
</P>
<P>
A source from One Israel said that Barak has met heads of
Meretz Party, the Center Party, National Religious Party, Yisrael
Ba'aliya and Shiuni to discuss such issues as cabinet post
distribution, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Although no final decisions have been made in this regard,
Barak has informed the parties that his One Israel party would
like to include them in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, One Israel's negotiating team has been meeting with
representatives from these parties to hammer out details about the
coalition issues.
</P>
<P>
The coalition talks have entered a crucial stage and it is time
for Barak to decide on the coalition issues with leaders of these
parties which One Israel wants to be the coalition partners, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Barak hopes to complete the post
distribution talks by Wednesday before allocating the remaining
cabinet seats among his own party.
</P>
<P>
If Barak forms a narrow government with the five parties, which
can only garner 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
One Israel will get 12 of the 18 cabinet portfolios, with the rest
six going to its partners.
</P>
<P>
Another One Israel source said earlier that significant
progress had been made in a series of secret negotiations between
Barak's negotiating team and the representatives of the five
parties and a uniform coalition agreement had been drafted.

CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An oil tanker had a head-on
collision with a van in northern Egypt on Monday, leaving 13
people dead and six others injured.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when the speeding tanker was attempting
to avoid road work near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria,
220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The tanker slammed into the van coming from the opposite
direction, killing the van's driver and 12 of its passengers, and
seriously injuring six others.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead are an 11-year-old girl and three women, the

in the van.
</P>
<P>
Police are questioning the tanker driver, who escaped
unscathed. The six injured passengers were taken to a hospital in
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed and

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Resume Peace Talks with Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
urged Israel to resume the Mideast peace process, warning that
further delays will have negative effects, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Prolonging and disabling the peace process will have a
negative effect on the regional situation and the future of
peace," Mubarak said Sunday night on his way home after a two-day
visit to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects the talks to resume on all the tracks of the
peace process, the news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that the Palestinian question is the core of the
(Arab-Israeli) conflict and has priority, but we stress that the
Israeli withdrawal should include all Arab territory and that the
Arab land has to return to its owners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded that Israel withdraw from its Golan Heights
captured in the 1967 Mideast War in return for peace and Lebanon
called for unconditional Israeli pullback from its southern
territory occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Last month Mubarak praised Ehud Barak, leader of Israel's
moderate Labor Party and newly-elected prime minister, saying he
will work for peace.
</P>
<P>
Asked on Sunday about the continued stalemate in the peace
process, however, Mubarak said, "we have to wait and see. The (new
Israeli) government has not been formed yet."
</P>
<P>
Israeli paper Ha'aretz reported on Monday that Israel's Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has almost completed putting together a
minority government, which is likely to include Meretz, Shinui,
the Center Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Discuss Peacekeeping in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton had a telephone conversation Monday on
peacekeeping operation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed to intensify the dialogue and step up
military talks on a further implementation of the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation. They agreed that defense chiefs of the two
countries would meet over the next few days, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, the second in two days,
Yeltsin denounced the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),
which had issued threats against the Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The KLA has not ceased provocations despite the deployment of
the international forces. Its actions result in the continuing
flow of refugees of the Serbian and other nationalities and
jeopardize the peace process, Yeltsin was quoted as telling
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton advocated a strict compliance with the pertinent
clauses of the U.N. Security Council resolution, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will continue discussions on bilateral
cooperation during the G8 summit in Cologne slated for June 18-20,
the service said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Russia's top advisory Security
Council convened a meeting late Monday to discuss the country's
moves on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who chaired the session, said
Russia "must play a considerable role in the political resolution
of the Kosovo conflict, including the international peacekeeping
operation under the U.N. aegis.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of halting the NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia and
resuming a U.N.- steered political settlement in Kosovo was
attained through implementing the president's instructions and
thanks to Russia's persistent efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Just a first step has been made to ensure a lasting and
irrevocable settlement of the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our active work must be continued to enhance these
achievements, to grind to a halt the war in Kosovo, to prevent
violence and terrorism there. The political settlement must be
based on the principles of international law and preservation of
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, the Security Council secretary who also serves
as director of the Federal Security Service warned that the
situation around Kosovo should not be over- dramatized.
</P>
<P>
"A difficult process is underway of fitting together the
military formations of the countries which participate in the
Balkan peacekeeping operation. Talks on this complex issue are
conducted almost without interruptions. We have every reason to
believe that they will be successful," the Interfax news agency
quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia made an outstanding contribution to transferring to the
political stage of the Balkan settlement, Putin said. "The
government, pertinent ministries, agencies and services made
enormous efforts to carry out the Russian President's
instructions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lome Peace Talks on S. Leone Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean peace talks are at an
impasse over rebel demands of a coalition government and the
pullout of West African forces after three weeks of talks held in
Togolese capital of Lome.
</P>
<P>
During the peace talks, the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rolled out demands for peace in the country including a
power-sharing arrangement under which the position of the vice
president would be ceded to them.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians in Sierra Leone are reportedly threatening to
commence impeachment proceedings against President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah if he accepts the power-sharing deal with the RUF.
</P>
<P>
Julius Spencer, Sierra Leonean minister of information on
Sunday ruled out the possibility of setting up a transitional
government, saying that the president had no intention of
violating the country's constitution, reports reaching here Monday
said.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not have authority to do that. The
government cannot abrogate the constitution, what is being
discussed at the moment is how the RUF can be included in public
office," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that President Kabbah would meet with the
parliament during the week to explain his move, adding that an
emergency cabinet meeting was also initiated at the weekend by
Kabbah to discuss the draft agreement between the rebels and the
government. Last Friday, President Kabbah told MPs in Freetown
that he was firmly opposed to the withdrawal of the Nigerian-led
West African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, saying that ECOMOG
would remain in the war-torn country for "as long as possible".
</P>
<P>
Last week, Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current
chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
who is brokering the peace talks, held separate talks with both
sides to encourage more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year civil war in Sierra Leone has, according to U.N.
estimates, made more than 1.5 million people homeless and
destroyed almost all economic and social structure in one of the
poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 people were killed in the rebels' latest attempt to
capture capital Freetown in January.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government was forced to enter peace talks with
the rebels.

<HEADLINE> China Reports May Export Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China recorded its first export
growth in five months during May, according to statistics released
Monday by the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
May exports hit 15.53 billion U.S. dollars, up 4.2 percent on
last year's same period, with imports rising 21.5 percent to 13.66
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that the May trade surplus remained
steady at 1.87 billion U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The total import-export volume for the January-May period hit
to 128.03 billion U.S. dollars, up 3.4 percent. Exports dropped 5.
3 percent to 67.55 billion U.S. dollars, with imports growing 15.3
percent to 60.48 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts note that the margin for the decline during the
first five months of the year narrowed on a monthly basis and
exports are on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the decline to the drop of exports to major
trade partners such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Russia. For example,
exports to Hong Kong plummeted 32 percent during the first five
months.
</P>
<P>
However, China witnessed increased exports to the United States,
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, Canada and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Exports of agricultural, electronic products and machinery
continued to grow, with simultaneous declines in major export
goods such as minerals, chemicals, textiles, garments, footwear
and toys.

<HEADLINE> Pak Claims to Repulse Major Indian Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Monday the Indian
Army resorted to heavy artillery fire in Kargil and Drass sectors
on the Line of Control (LoC) and a major Indian offensive on
Pakistani positions was repulsed in the last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the media, Pakistan's military spokesman
Rashid Qureshi said the Indians launched a big offensive on
Pakistani positions in Kargil and Drass sectors on LoC in Kashmir
and their shells fell four to five kilometers inside the Pakistani
side of LoC.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that if India continued this hostile act,
it would receive the same fate, as they suffered in the last 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the Indian claim of capturing a peak in Drass
sector. "No Pakistani post fallen to enemy. The claims were only
made to boost the morale of Indian troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian attack was firmly repulsed by Pakistani
troops, inflicting heavy casualties on them.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that during the last 24 hours, the
Indians again resorted to heavy shelling and their attack was
again beaten back.
</P>
<P>
In other areas of LoC, the Indians continued fire, but there
was no Indian air activity on Monday, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> De Mello Named to Head U.N. Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has appointed Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N.
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, as Special
Representative to control the implementation of the international
civil presence to be set up in Kosovo, a Serb province, a senior
U.N. official announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Louise Frechette, deputy secretary-general, told a press
conference that the newly-appointed special representative arrived
in Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, Sunday with a team of
some 40 people from various U.N. agencies to "make a detailed
evaluation and assessment" on how the U.N. is to organize itself
for the mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
De Mello has made his first meeting with the commander of the
Kosovo peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, she said.
</P>
<P>
De Mello, a national of Brazil, has served as
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs since January
1998. He has extensive headquarters and field experience in
humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, including Bangladesh,
Sudan, Cyprus, Mozambique, Peru and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
De Mello returned late in May from a mission in Kosovo to
assess the humanitarian situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
"De Mello was appointed on an interim basis because
Secretary-General feels strongly that we had to be on the ground
very, very quickly," she said, "Clearly, the appointment of a
permanent representative will take a little time since
Secretary-General has to carry out his consultation with the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The appointment of de Mello is designed to enable the United
Nations to begin "very quickly" preparations for the
implementation of the peace plan on the civilian part, she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary-general is scheduled to travel to Geneva
on Monday night for meetings with leaders from European Union and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in European.
</P>
<P>
"I will be travelling to Geneva tonight to hold consultations
tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday morning with the various agencies
concerned," she said.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Indicates 50 Per Cent Debt Relief for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua)-The Group of Seven (G-7) wealthy nations
might decide at this week's annual summit to relieve the debt
burden of world's poorest developing countries by up to 50 per
cent, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Monday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing after his meeting with 16 bishops
from the debtor countries, Schroeder said, "without a drastic
reduction to their debt, the poorest nations will not be able to
be integrated into the globalised world."
</P>
<P>
Germany will sell its gold reserves in the International
Monetary Foundation (IMF) to sponsor the debt remission plan, said
Schroeder, who will host the summit in the city of Cologne this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The debt relief has nothing to do with alms, but is a chance
that benefits every developing country, and it must be better
interlocked with the fighting against poverty, stressed Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Those countries must deploy the resources that has been
released for development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, G-7 finance ministers agreed to raise the number
of highly indebted poor countries eligible for debt relief to 36
from the present 29. Final agreement on the debt relief package
is expected at the summit scheduled for June 18-20.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 bloc includes the U.S., Canada, Britain, Germany,
France, Italy and Japan. Heads of the seven countries are due to
meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin separately in Cologne
under what is known as the Group of Eight (G-8).

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Mbeki Urges Contact With People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South African president-elect
Thabo Mbeki Monday urged the legislative and the executive
branches of government to have more interaction with the masses,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly soon after being chosen
unopposed to succeed President Nelson Mandela, he said any
isolation of the government from the people would be inconsistent
with the democratic system it sought to build.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the recent election campaign, the people had shown
great interest in the issues raised by political parties.
</P>
<P>
At the same time they had shown willingness to themselves
participate in confronting the challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
"To help address both these issues and further entrench the
democratic system in our country, we would urge the members of
parliament (MPs) to reach out more regularly to the electorate,"
said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
This would require measures to enable MPs to spend more time
with their constituents.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the executive would have to strengthen the links
between itself and the people. This would give government the
opportunity to assess, directly from the people, whether its
policies were producing the intended results.
</P>
<P>
"If all of us stand tall today, as all of us surely do, it is
only because we are borne aloft by the firm hands of the ordinary
people of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The interaction between the executive and the legislature would
also have to be improved to ensure that both branches of
government were able to carry out their work effectively, while
enriching democracy.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki thanked members for the confidence they had shown by
entrusting him with the responsibility of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said he was aware that millions of people expected the
government to move faster in pursuit of a better life for all, and
equally aware of the negative consequences of any failure to do
this credibly and in a sustained way.
</P>
<P>
Many of these problems required the greatest possible unity
among South Africans so they used their massed strength for the
benefit of the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"And yet all of us are aware that our country continues to be
divided along racial and other lines and is, therefore, that much
more difficult to unite around common objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The new presidency will have to focus on all these matters, in
the interests of the country as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was elected president following his African National
Congress (ANC) won a landslide victory in the June 2 general
elections. The ANC has 266 of the 400 seats in the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Budget With Wild Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Millennium budget presented
by the Pakistani government last Saturday has been labeled by many
economists here as "a budget of good intentions and wild
expectations".
</P>
<P>
The budget for 1999-2000 (July 1-June 30), presented by Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar on June 12 under difficult economic
circumstances, put a remarked emphasis on the containing of fiscal
deficit, which has long been a nightmare for the country.
</P>
<P>
The government expects a much-increased resource availability
of 655.9 billion rupees (12.7 billion U.S. dollars) to cover the
expenditure of 642.2 billion rupees (12.4 billion dollars) and
decrease the fiscal deficit by 13.7 billion rupees (265 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As projected in the budget, the ratio of fiscal deficit out of
the GDP will be reduced to 3.3 percent in the new fiscal year from
4.7 percent in the outgoing fiscal year, in pursuance of the
guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) who requires
Pakistan to curb deficit ratio of GDP below four percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this objective, the government is determined to
collect 356 billion rupees (6.9 billion dollars) from taxes
through tapping internal resources, 15.6 percent higher than the
revised target of 303 billion rupees (5.9 billion dollars) for the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the first 10 months of 1998-99
fiscal year, the Central Board of Revenue collected only 229.6
billion rupees (4.4 billion dollars) of tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that it is almost impossible for the government
to collect more than 73 billion rupees in the remaining two months
to meet the four-time revised revenue target.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget proposal, one of Dar's "two
ambitions" in the coming fiscal year is to expand the much-talked
tax base.
</P>
<P>
However, to do so, the government will have to make a tough
struggle against tax evaders, including some members of the ruling
elite and prominent figures in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Pakistani government has been in a
winless war against tax evaders for a decade. However, the result
has not been satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The government has also promised to carry out the so-called
universal self-assessment scheme in the new fiscal year, under
which there will be neither any audits of income assesses nor
action against revelation of past income and even very low
payments can get a person clear of allegation of tax evader.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be a good initiative in present economic
circumstances, but there are still uncertainty on its effect at
extending of the tax net.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is the low credibility of the government
with the people, some economists say. The government has changed
the tax policies from time to time, hence people fear that those
who do enter the net this year might find a much tighter noose
next year.
</P>
<P>
To increase revenue, the present government, which came to
power in February 1997, is also contemplating on the extension of
General Sales Tax to the service sector, but under enormous
pressure from the business sector, it still find it difficult to
make a decision on it.
</P>
<P>
Coming to some other features of the budget: an increase of
38.4 percent is noticed in allocation for Social Action Program,
which is designed to improve social services from 64.6 billion
rupees (1.2 billion dollars) in 1998-99 to 88.6 billion rupees
(1.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 18.6 percent higher outlay for Public Sector Development
Program (PSDP) from 92.1 billion rupees (1.8 billion dollars) to
116.3 billion rupees (2.2 billion dollars) is putting money where
it is most needed, observers say.
</P>
<P>
Under the PSDP, the scheme to open up "farm to market" access
through constructing 5,000 kilometer roads and more than doubling
of governmental investment projected for housing programs are
regarded as two steps in right direction which are expected to
stimulate the stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
In the outgoing fiscal year, the GDP growth rate is estimated
at 3.1 percent, falling far short of the targeted six percent in
the budget, with a mere 0.4 percent increase in agriculture known
as the mainstay of Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting an acceleration of growth in the
upcoming fiscal year to a five percent GDP growth rate. However,
observers here are not optimistic about the forecast given the
poor economic performance in the current fiscal year and the
long-standing structural problems facing the economy.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Angola to Solve Social Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- World Bank senior official pointed
out here Monday that Angolan state budget has failed to consider
the degrading social crisis in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Kafka, director of the World Bank African Branch, said
she would discuss with the Angolan authorities the economic
situation there, so as to pave the way for the restarting of the
World Bank's aid programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official, who arrived here Monday for a
five-day visit, said though Angola had deregulated its foreign
exchange market, it is still far away from meeting the demands set
by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has urged Angola, one of the poorest countries
in the world, to strictly tighten its government expenses, curb
the hiking inflation and make the country's finance more
transparent.
</P>
<P>
She said the government has failed to properly use its budget
to development projects and was over-dependent to foreign aid. She
added that because of the civil war, Angola has spent 38 percent
of its budget in military expenses.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has invested ten aid development programs in the
African country with a total value of 250 million U.S. dollars,
which include projects in education, energy, transportation and
other infrastructures.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Seek Iranian Jews' Release by All Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry
will try its best to seek the release of the 13 Jews being
detained in Iran, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry denied once again that the 13
Iranian Jews had ever worked for Israel as spies as charged by
Iran, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government will work hard to get all these Jews
released, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barak asked Jordan to use its good office with Iran
to urge Tehran to drop the so-called spy charges against the 13
Jews.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been regarding Israel, the Jewish state, as its bitter
enemy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Iranian radio reported last Monday night that Iranian
authorities had arrested 13 Jews living in the southern Fars
province on charges of spying for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Espionage is punishable by death penalty in Iran. In 1977, Iran
hanged two people convicted of spying for Israel and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
When the espionage was initially disclosed, Israeli officials
refrained from commenting on the arrest, citing the sensitive
nature of the case. The Israeli government feared that any comment
would make things worse for the arrested Jews.
</P>
<P>
But last Tuesday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a
statement, saying not a single one of the arrested Jews had ever
been involved in espionage and no one of them had had in the past,
any connection with any Israeli intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is worried about these arrests which have occurred
only because they are Jewish. Israel is deeply concerned about
their fate and demands their immediate release," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> De Mello Named to Head U.N. Mission in Kosovo  (Updated with more information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has appointed Sergio Vieira de Mello, U.N.
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, as Special
Representative to control the implementation of the international
civil presence to be set up in Kosovo, a Serb province, a senior
U.N. official announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Louise Frechette, deputy secretary-general, told a press
conference that the newly-appointed special representative arrived
in Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, Sunday with a team of
some 40 people from various U.N. agencies to "make a detailed
evaluation and assessment" on how the U.N. is to organize itself
for the mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
De Mello has made his first meeting with the commander of the
Kosovo peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, she said.
</P>
<P>
De Mello, a national of Brazil, has served as
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs since January
1998. He has extensive headquarters and field experience in
humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, including Bangladesh,
Sudan, Cyprus, Mozambique, Peru and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
De Mello returned late in May from a mission in Kosovo to
assess the humanitarian situation in the province.
</P>
<P>
"De Mello was appointed on an interim basis because
Secretary-General feels strongly that we had to be on the ground
very, very quickly," she said, "Clearly, the appointment of a
permanent representative will take a little time since
Secretary-General has to carry out his consultation with the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The appointment of de Mello is designed to enable the United
Nations to begin "very quickly" preparations for the
implementation of the peace plan on the civilian part, she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary-general is scheduled to travel to Geneva
on Monday night for meetings with leaders from European Union and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in European.
</P>
<P>
"I will be travelling to Geneva tonight to hold consultations
tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday morning with the various agencies
concerned," she said.
</P>
<P>
De Mello is setting up the Pristina headquarters for the U.N.
international civilian mission which will provide a temporary
administration for Kosovo as mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolution, adopted on Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
The special representative will be the top civilian
administrator in Kosovo until the province is able to enjoy
substantial autonomy and self-government.
</P>
<P>
Working in close coordination with international security
forces, the U.N. Mission in Kosovo will oversee the return of
refugees, humanitarian assistance and relief, demining and
reconstruction, the establishment of democratic institutions,
protection and promotion of human rights and the formation of a
civilian police force.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led interim administration will also facilitate the
political process which will determine Kosovo's future status.

<HEADLINE> S. African Shares Up on Rate Cute Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South African shares opened
higher on Monday on hopes that a prime rate cut would be announced
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there was nibbling across the board as the South
African market followed Asia rather than the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully this is the start of a decoupling of our market from
the United States. That is justified by the fundamentals, as we
are just starting our upturn, while the United States is slowing
down," Bernie Montgomery, a dealer at stockbrokers O'Flaherty
Sundelson said, quoted by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.76 points to
10,490.15 on Friday on continued uncertainty over the direction of
U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market is hoping for some direction from the release
of May consumer price inflation data on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily repo rate in South Africa slid to 15.314% on Friday
from Thursday's 15.346% and Monday's 15.434% after being steady at
15.464% for 10 consecutive trading days.
</P>
<P>
On June 7 the SA Reserve Bank signalled an easier monetary
policy by over-providing by 10 million rand (1.7 million U.S.
dollars) at the daily repo tender.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks last announced a 100 basis point drop in their
prime rates to 19% on April 8, when the repo rate was 16.191%.

Asian markets were mixed today and the Nikkei 225 index in
Japan slid 9. 7 points to 17,188.8, but the Hang Seng index in

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
beginning "a new type of mission" in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province,
to facilitate the peace process in the province, a senior U.N.
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Louise Frechette, deputy secretary-general of the United
Nations, told a press conference that "This is a new type of
mission for the U.N. First of all, the military has its own
reporting chain of command, which distinguishes that from other
type of missions we've had in the past."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, this is the really quite innovative feature, this
mission is the delivery of the civilian mandate, given to the
Secretary-General by the Security Council, will be done through
both U.N. agencies and non-U.N. agencies," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, every aspect of the mission was carried out by
the United Nations personnel," she said, "This time around, we
have been asked by the Security Council to work out the
implementation of the civilian part of the mandate with the
assistance of other organizations."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we will have to have assistance on the ground,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary-general is scheduled to travel to Geneva
late on Monday for consultations with various organizations
concerned, such as the European Union and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks after an advance U.N. team, headed by
U.N. Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieira de Mello, arrived in
Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, by land on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
De Mello is setting up the Pristina headquarters for the U.N.
international civilian mission which will provide a temporary
administration for Kosovo as mandated by a U.N. Security Council
resolution, adopted on Thursday last week.

the U.N. regional coordinator for the Balkans. Griffiths leads the
Secretary-General's Core Advance Team, which will lay the ground
for implementation of the various sectors to be administered by

Alan Greenspan said Monday that recent increases in productivity
have been a principal factor holding down inflation, but
productivity cannot keep inflation under control forever.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day congressional summit on
high technology, Greenspan called the performance of the U.S.
economy outstanding. He credited U.S. investment in
productivity-enhancing equipment such as computers for the good
combination of strong economic growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
"An economy that 20 years ago seemed to have seen its better
days is displaying a remarkable run of economic growth that
appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in technology,"
Greenspan said in testimony to the congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that productivity, the amount of output per
hour of work, has been growing at an annual rate of around 2
percent since 1995, double the annual gains of the previous two
decades.
</P>
<P>
He credited these gains in part to a surge in business
investment in a variety of high-tech products from computers to
fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is considered the crucial element in raising
living standards because it allows employers to pay their workers
more without triggering inflationary pressures by having to raise
the cost of products.
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan cautioned that these productivity gains cannot go
on forever.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of productivity cannot increase indefinitely. While
there appears to be considerable expectation in the business
community, and possibly Wall Street, that the productivity
acceleration has not yet peaked, experience advises caution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan reminded the committee that he has cautioned a number
of times about the dangers in believing that the world has entered
some new economic era because of breakthroughs in technology.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Fed changed its policy bias to lean in favor of
raising interest rates and financial markets have grown
increasingly worried that Greenspan will announce on Thursday that
the Fed will soon start raising interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Intel Ships First Chip Built on 0.1 Micron Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation Monday
introduced two products that bring leading performance and
features to the mobile market segment.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the mobile Pentium II processor at 400
MHz is its first chip built using 0.18 micron manufacturing
process. Specifically designed for mobile PCs, the chip comes in
several tailored packaging designs in order to meet the demanding
physical size, thermal and power consumption requirements of
mobile users.
</P>
<P>
The other product, Celeron processor 400 MHz, is also available
in several tailored packages, providing solid performance for
today's applications and giving mobile consumers a great way to
get started on the Internet for a low price, Intel said. It is
manufactured on Intel 0.25 micron process.
</P>
<P>
Intel is the first in the chip industry with 0.18 micron
processor production. The technology allows the processor to
become smaller, faster and more powerful than its 0.25 micron
processors.

<HEADLINE> Socialists Lose Out in EU Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Socialists in the 15 European
Union (EU) member countries have suffered a big setback in the
European Parliament elections as final turnout showed early Monday
that center-right parties now have strong power to form the
biggest assembly group.
</P>
<P>
Final results showed the center-right European People's Party
(EPP) with 224 seats, rising from previous 201 seats, while
Socialists won 180, losing 34 seats in the outgoing parliament.
The major losses of Socialists were in Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The results obviously will put the 626-seat parliament on a
collision course with EU's mainly left-leaning governments.
</P>
<P>
European Union's center-right parties claimed victory late
Sunday in the elections with exit polls suggesting they could take
lead as a dominate group in the new European Parliament. "For the
first time in 20 years, the EPP will have 30 seats more than the
Socialists," the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Blegian government has resigned following a
resounding defeat for the center-left Chrestian Democrats in the
parliamentary elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, Europe's
longest-serving leader, said he took "full and sole
responsibility" for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here have blamed the result partly on the dioxin food
poisoning crisis in the country. Meanwhile, no group won enough
votes to command a majority and a scramble to form a coalition
government is expected.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections were held from last Thursday to
Sunday in all the 15 EU countries: Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
EU official reports said 10,527 candidates, distributed amongst
299 lists, are in the running to win the hearts of 297.9 million
voters.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, EU's only directly elected body, was
originally set up as a consultative assembly, but its powers have
gradually expanded. Now it has the right to amend or veto much of
the legislation agreed by the 15 EU governments.
</P>
<P>
The EU assembly's 626 members (MEPs), who serve a five-year
term, also can reject the EU budget, set up committees of inquiry,
sack the European Commission, the EU's executive body, and veto
international agreements or block EU expansions.
</P>
<P>
The number of MEPs and precise voting systems vary from country
to country among the 15 EU member states, but this is the first EU
parliamentary election held under proportional representation
across the whole of the European Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON. June 14 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets ended
lower Monday amid worries over U.S. interest rates and as the
world's biggest retailer prepared its entrance into Britain.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index of leading components retreated 0.8
percent, or 54.7 points, to close at 6430.1, about 30 points off
its session low.
</P>
<P>
British supermarket stocks began and ended the day at center
stage here after U.S. retailing giant Wal-Mart announced a 10.7
billion U.S. dollars agreed bid for the UK's third-largest
supermarket group Asda.
</P>
<P>
"Wal-Mart's bid for Asda came as a big shock," said one equity
salesman, adding "it has sent a major tremor through the sector
and will put them all under pressure to consolidate."
</P>
<P>
News of the bid sent investors in the sector scurrying for
cover amid fears that the powerful new market entrant will unleash
an era of fierce price competition.
</P>
<P>
Asda's rivals Tesco and Sainsbury slumped 6.7 percent and 5.1
percent, respectively. UK pharmacy chain Boots retreated 4.7
percent, while clothing retailer Next eased almost 4 percent.
</P>

In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax index closed down 4.49 points at
5291.52. Paris stocks listed on the CAC 40 finished 0.3 percent

TIRANA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of shop in Tetovo, about 50

<HEADLINE> Wireless Voice Services in U.S. Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Wireless voice services have
expanded in the United States dramatically since their
introduction in the early 1980s, thanks to decreasing prices and
technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by market research firm
Frost &AMP; Sullivan, revenues for the market in North America last
year were approximately 45 billion U.S. dollars. The market is
moving fast and can be extremely lucrative for companies that stay
abreast of important market trends, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The research company segmented the market into analog cellular
voice services, digital cellular voice services and personal
communications services. In 1998, analog accounted for more than
half of the revenues. But the company said that as more and more
users migrate to higher sound quality and improved communications
services of the digital segment, analog services are expected to
steadily decline.
</P>
<P>
As digital and cellular personal communications services
handsets become more popular with residential and business
customers alike, the company said, analog carriers are trying to
figure out ways to enhance the values of the original cellular
technology.
</P>
<P>
In another report also released Monday, Frost &AMP; Sullivan said
that new Web-based technologies are altering the ever-changing
face of the conferencing market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
While the traditional audio conferencing market continues to
grow, the company said, emerging Web-based solutions are having a
profound impact on the long-term future of the conferencing
market.
</P>
<P>
Internet-based conferencing is significantly less expensive
than traditional solutions, attracting the cost-conscious
customers. Increasing use of Web-based conferencing software in
business communications, the company said, is likely to reduce the
demand for traditional audio and document conferencing services,
which currently account for 81 percent for the total market
revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that 1,900 U.S. troops have moved into Kosovo and American
"Apache" attack helicopters are helping police withdraw Serb
forces from the province on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-third of the 50,000 Serb troops, police and special
forces scheduled to depart Kosovo within 11 days of an agreement
signed last Wednesday had already left on bad, congested roads,
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
</P>
<P>
"We estimate now that between 14,000 and 15,000 Serb army and
special police troops have left. We estimate that about 20 percent
of the tanks are gone."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 14,000 NATO troops had already flowed into
Kosovo, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington had been "reassured" by Russian officials
that there was no current intention to increase the number of
troops at the Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian troops entered Kosovo's capital city of
Pristina last week hours ahead of the NATO troops and occupied the
airport.
</P>
<P>
"I think NATO has made it very clear that it is interested in
cooperation, not conflict," with Russia, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met with Central
African President Ange-Felix Patasse here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China and Central Africa are developing countries
with extensive common interests. He stressed that the two nations
should support and sympathize with each other when dealing with
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said during Patasse's first visit to China, he will have an
opportunity to visit more Chinese cities in order to promote
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Central Africa have consolidated and
developed friendly relations and cooperation in all fields since
the restoration of diplomatic ties one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has provided economic aid to a number of
African countries including Central Africa, said Li, adding that "
China also encourages mutually beneficial cooperation between the
business circles of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation for Central Africa's "one China"
stance and for Patasse's contributions to the development and
restoration of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Patasse said he and Chinese President Jiang Zemin exchanged
views and reached a consensus on bilateral relations and
international issues during Monday talks.
</P>
<P>
He praised the NPC for its efforts to improve China-Central
Africa relations, and said Central Africa attaches great
importance to its relations with the NPC. He noted that the
Central African delegation includes some parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Patasse said Central Africa is committed to developing
cooperation on all levels and in all fields. He said Central
African law institutes hope to work closely with the NPC to
promote relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed with Patasse's call for expanding exchanges between
law institutes in the two countries. He said friendly exchanges
between the NPC and Central African law institutes will be highly
significant for promoting mutual understanding and friendship
between the peoples in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the Central African delegation of the functions of
the NPC and China's democratic and legal construction.
</P>
<P>
Patasse said his visit to China will further enhance mutual
understanding and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Quick Pace Urged for Canada's Web Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Quick pace is being urged in Canada
for shopping on-line in order to keep traditional customers while
expanding business operations.
</P>
<P>
Only 26 percent of top Canadian stores use electronic commerce
and web sites to attract consumers, compared with 50 percent of U.
S. major retailers, said a study released Monday by the leading
Canadian industry group for retailers.
</P>
<P>
IBM Canada Ltd. and the Retail Council indicated in the study
that even within the 26 percent of Canada's shopping on-line
businesses, more than 60 percent of the money goes to U.S. Web
sites, underlining a view that Canadians have been slow to enter
the E-retail race.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Canadian retailers establish an on-line presence in the
next six months, they risk losing traditional store customers and
new E-retail shoppers to global competitors," said David Marcus,
managing principal of retail consumer consulting at IBM of Markham,
Ontario, Canada
</P>
<P>
Canadian shopping on-line is predicted to increase from about
690 million Canadian dollars (about 472.6 million U.S. dollars)
last year to 1.15 billion (about 787.67 million U.S. dollars) this
year. It will soar to 12.75 billion (8.73 billion U.S. dollars) in
2003, according to forecasts by research house International Data
Corp.

<HEADLINE> China Hit Six to Qualify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China trounced Myanmar 6-0 here
on Tuesday to reach the final stage of the Asian qualifying
tournament for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We're happy to qualify, we're pleased to be in there," China's
English coach Bobby Houghton said at the post-game news conference.
</P>
<P>
Six different players came on target as the home side claimed
their fifth win out of as many Asian Group Seven qualifiers.
Their closest rivals the Democratic Republic of Korea, scoring a
same sized victory three days ago against Myanmar, was forced to a
1-1 tie by Vietnam on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's defensive wall cracked down at the 23rd minute when
Zhang Yuning headed in a long cross to take his tournament tally
to seven.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later Zhang's striking partner Li Jinyu, who plays
for the French first division club Nancy, also found the net with
a raking header.
</P>
<P>
A confident Houghton made three changes in the second half to
rest his first line players, and his decision paid off when
substitutes Wang Peng and Zhang Xiaorui both put their names on
the scoreboard later on.
</P>
<P>
But the goal of the match came from Sun Jihai, the English
first division side Crystal Palace defender who received a deftly-
delivered Li Jinyu backheel and unleashed a powerful shot into the
right corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
China could have finished 7-0 if mid-fielder Li Tie hadn't had
his penalty saved by Myanmar's goalkeeper in the 61st minute, a
moment after a Sui Dongliang header put China in front 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said his under-23 charge, who haven't dropped a goal
so far, put on a "significant" performance and the team's top
scorer Zhang Yuning, was simply "outstanding".

<HEADLINE> Indian Vows To Drive "Intruders" Away In Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes Tuesday echoed what Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee said on
Sunday that the ongoing military operations in Kashmir would
continue till the last "intruder" from Pakistan side was thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes told a gathering in Jammu, 583 km northwest of here
by road, that the "intruders" had only tow options, either to
surrender without further waste of time to Indian troops or being
killed, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
At a public meeting during his inspection tour in Kashmir on
Sunday, Vajpayee urged Islamabad to pull back its troops from the
Kargil sector of Kashmir and honor the line of control in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker prime minister laid the withdraw of Pakistan
forces from the disputed border area as a precondition for further
talks with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Vajpayee Sunday on
telephone when he was in Srinagar, capital of India-control
Kashmir, urging that the intense situation between the two
neighbors should not be allowed to escalate and steps should be
taken by the two sides to defuse it.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader maintained that it was Pakistan which started
the conflict and, therefore, the only way to defuse the situation
and avoid a costly escalation of the conflict was for Pakistan to
restore status quo ante on the line of control.
</P>
<P>
As a precautionary measure, the Indian army, navy, air force
and the coast guard were in a state of "high alert" along Pakistan
border, PTI claimed.
</P>
<P>
The media alleged that the measure followed Pakistan troop
movements along the line of control with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
as well as the entire India-Pakistan border.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and his Pakistan
counterpart Sartaj Aziz held what officially described as "serious
and business-like" talks here last Saturday on de-escalation of
the tension but without any progress.

Addressing at Stranmillis University College, Belfast, Blair
said that all sides must move forward together by his "absolute

He said, "Unionism must share power with the nationalist and
republican communities."
</P>
<P>
"There can no longer be a Northern Ireland based on anything
but the principles of justice, fairness, equality and recognition
that sectarianism is a thing of the past."
</P>

Blair will meet the first and deputy first ministers, David
Trimble and Seamus Mallon, later on Tuesday at Stormont to try
resolve the impasse in the peace process before the 30 June

<HEADLINE> Pak Armed Forces Determined to Defend Motherland: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Armed Forces are
determined to defend every inch of the motherland and are fully
prepared to meet any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by army spokesman, Brig. Rashid Qureshi, while
briefing newsmen in the southern port city of Karachi Tuesday
about the situation on the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed
Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to escalate the tensions and we do not want war
either", he was quoted by the Associated Press of Pakistan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said that Pakistan was aware of the preparations made by
the Indians in September and October 1998 and Pakistan took
control of the heights on its side of LoC where it can look down
on Kargil and Drass sectors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Mujahideen (holy fighters) are operating
inside Indian-administered Kashmir and that they are waging the
indigenous struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi, who is the director general of Inter Service Public
Relations, said the Indian government claimed that about 200
freedom fighters entered the Kargil and Drass sectors and 15,000
Indian troops were move to evict these 200 or so Mujahideen and
later the strength of the Indian troops was increased to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian side has suffered badly and in order to
cover it, Indians have been claiming that they have killed 400
Mujahideen and have killed many Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
About the Indian army's casualties during the recent conflict,
Qureshi said that more than 300 Indians have died and over 600
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that a total of 47 Pakistani troops were
killed and another 50 sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
For the past 15 days Indians have been bombing, rocketing and
shelling Pakistani positions deep inside, Qureshi noted.
</P>
<P>
"If the Indians stop fighting, we will also stop fighting but
if they fire one round we will fire 10 rounds because we hold
better ground," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said that the Indian air force is on full
alert and they have moved to forward operating bases which is a
threatening posture.
</P>
<P>
He said that whatever Pakistan does in response to that is the
minimum defense measures required.
</P>
<P>
To another question about the use of chemical weapons by India,
Qureshi said that "we have received report few days back that
Indians used shells we suspect contained chemicals and we have
sent them for examinations and as yet we have not come to the
conclusion."

<HEADLINE> Quick Pace Urged for Canada's Web Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Quick pace is being urged in Canada
for shopping on-line in order to keep traditional customers while
expanding business operations.
</P>
<P>
Only 26 percent of top Canadian stores use electronic commerce
and web sites to attract consumers, compared with 50 percent of U.
S. major retailers, said a study released Monday by the leading
Canadian industry group for retailers.
</P>
<P>
IBM Canada Ltd. and the Retail Council indicated in the study
that even within the 26 percent of Canada's shopping on-line
businesses, more than 60 percent of the money goes to U.S. Web
sites, underlining a view that Canadians have been slow to enter
the E-retail race.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Canadian retailers establish an on-line presence in the
next six months, they risk losing traditional store customers and
new E-retail shoppers to global competitors," said David Marcus,
managing principal of retail consumer consulting at IBM of Markham,
Ontario, Canada
</P>
<P>
Canadian shopping on-line is predicted to increase from about
690 million Canadian dollars (about 472.6 million U.S. dollars)
last year to 1.15 billion (about 787.67 million U.S. dollars) this
year. It will soar to 12.75 billion (8.73 billion U.S. dollars) in
2003, according to forecasts by research house International Data
Corp.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Licensed to Build and Operate CDMA Network in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Wang Jianzhou, executive vice
president of China United Telecommunications Corporation (China
Unicom), said here Tuesday that his company's plan for the
development of CDMA network in China has obtained supports from
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 4th CDMA World Congress, which opened Tuesday
at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Wang said that
China Unicom has obtained a license for construction and operation
of the CDMA network in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the CDMA network construction will start in 1999
in China's eastern regions and some major cities in central China
with the capacity of 2.6 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the CDMA network will reach the capacity of
10 million subscribers covering 250 cities above the county level
in most provinces in eastern and central China and some major
cities in the relatively underdeveloped western part of China,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
After 2001, a new capacity of 10 million subscribers will be
added annually to the CDMA network and by the end of 2003 the
network will reach the capacity of 40 million. The actual
subscribers will amount to as many as 28 million.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom was accepted as a member of the CDMA Development
Group (CDG) at the congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Paging Group of China Telecom is entirely
consolidated into China Unicom and the company was also licensed
for international long-distance telecommunication service.
</P>
<P>
Wang told representatives from some 100 member companies of the
CDG from all over the world that there remain tremendous
opportunities in the mobile market in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that up to April, 1999, the quantity of the fixed phone
subscribers was 94.74 million with the penetration of main line of
7.44 percent, and about the mobile, there were 30.24 million
subscribers with the penetration of 2.16 percent in China.
</P>
<P>
Outlining some principles for the CDMA network deployment in
China, Wang said that the CDMA network to be deployed in China
should be of high quality.
</P>
<P>
The new network will make full use of China Unicom's existing
communication resource and infrastructure of GSM, long-distance
telecom, and data communication networks, etc. in an effort to
reduce the market cost, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Providing a variety of new mobile phone functions, new products,
and first-class services, China Unicom will build the best product
image of CDMA, he said. The company also pays much attention to
evolving the CDMA network from the 2nd generation to the 3rd
Generation smoothly.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the object, further improvements are needed, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
UIM (User Identity Module) isn't available in CDMA system now
and this will cause inconvenience for users to change handsets, or
supplying prepaid card service, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, GSM subscribers can't share the supper quality
service supplied by CDMA network because GSM/CDMA dual-mode
handset is not available now, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Reciprocal Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Agreed between Mainland, HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government announced Tuesday that
consensus has been reached between the SAR and China's Mainland on
an arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards.
</P>
<P>
The existence of efficient arrangement for enforcing in one
jurisdiction arbitral awards made in another jurisdiction helps to
ensure fair business dealings and makes it less likely that
business people will renege on their contracts, SAR government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Hong Kong's return to China, the recognition and
enforcement in Hong Kong of arbitral awards made by other
jurisdictions, including the mainland, was governed by the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards ("the New York Convention").
</P>
<P>
The Convention continues to apply to HKSAR after Hong Kong
returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement arrangement with other jurisdictions remains
unchanged except for that with the Mainland, since the Convention,
being an international agreement, is no longer applicable to the
enforcement of arbitral awards between the mainland and the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangement is made in accordance with the spirit of
the New York Convention. To meet present day's needs, it will
allow awards made by over 100 mainland arbitral authorities with
relevant experience to be enforced in HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will sign a Memorandum of Understanding on
the arrangement with the mainland authorities shortly. It is
envisaged that the arrangement will come into effect later this
year upon the passage of the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill which
will be introduced into the Legislative Council as soon as
possible.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions Australia lived
up to its expectation as they reached the final of the women's
Champions Trophy field hockey tournament at Brisbane, Australia on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australians thrashed 1996 Olympic silver medalists South
Korea 6-0. The hosts led 1-0 at halftime and stormed away with
five in the second half, including four in the space of 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Australia is likely to meet Germany, who kept alive its hope of
reaching the final by rallying to blast New Zealand 4-1 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moira Senior gave the New Zealanders a shock lead at the 25th
minute before Nadine Ernsting-Krienke equalised two minutes before
half-time.
</P>
<P>
The Germans rebounded to score three times in the second half,
boosting its for-and-against tally, which stands at minus one
after four rounds.
</P>
<P>
The Germans lie three points behind the Netherlands but their
chances of qualifying for Saturday's final depend on a big win
over Argentina and the Dutch getting well beaten by tournament
favorites Australia in Thursday's matches.

<HEADLINE> OIP to Counter Western Cultural Onslaughts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Islamic
Parliaments (OIP) will put campaigns against western cultural
onslaughts into its charter, spokesman for the ongoing OIP
founding conference Taha Hashemi announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi said that the ratification of the OIP charter would
immunize Muslim states from cultural onslaughts, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from nearly 40 Islamic countries entered hot debates
on the OIP charter in closed-door sessions soon after the opening
session on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that cultural assault against the ethical
principles and civilizations has aroused sensitivities of many
countries, including European ones.
</P>
<P>
If Muslim countries reach consensus on their commonalities,
naturally all cultural inroads would be defused, he said. However,
he revealed no details about the OIP charter.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the opening session of the three-day OIP
founding conference, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
also warned of western cultural onslaughts against Islamic
civilization.
</P>
<P>
He called on Muslim lawmakers to take practical steps to fight
against "these destructive campaigns and adopt appropriate
policies for promotion of the rich Islamic culture, values and
beliefs."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also urged parliamentarians of the Islamic
countries to find practical ways to solve the problems facing the
Islamic world that "emanate from the pressures and atrocities of
its united enemies, and the weakness of its divided friends."

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday approved
to send civilian police officials as part of a United Nations
force overseeing East Timor's vote on autonomy or independence in
August.
</P>
<P>
However, the details of time frame and the form of sending, the
number and the kind of officials have yet been decided by the
Foreign Ministry, a Government House press release said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Government Spokesman Sakorn Prompakdi said that the
cabinet agreed with the Foreign Ministry proposal to send police
officials to join the United Nations Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) and to consider it an official mission.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes as the first batch of U.N. civilian police
prepare to deploy in the troubled Indonesian province ahead of the
ballot on August 8.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some 38 officers from Australia, New
Zealand, Spain, Ireland and Zimbabwe, the first of a 270-strong
UNAMET police contingent, will arrive in East Timor from training
in northern Australia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The civilian police will assist and advise the Indonesian
police on security matters ahead of the August poll, which will
decide the fate of the former Portuguese colony.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian striker Christian Vieri
shrugged off the media criticism for his world record transfer,
thinking it was normal in the soccer-crazy Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian daily newspaper Vatican labelled Vieri's 90 billion
lire (48.5 million U.S. dollars) transfer from Lazio to Inter
Milan "an offense against poor people".
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the rocketing transfer fee paid for soccer
players was "harming the values and ideals of the sport".
</P>
<P>
Vieri, who remained after playing for a World XI in Sydney,
responded by telling Australian television Tuesday that he was
unaffected by criticism of his move.
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a lot of money in soccer and there always
will be," he said. "It's a lot of money and that's how it is,
especially in Italy. My ex-team Lazio had this offer and it was a
lot of money and they couldn't refuse it," said the striker.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Ends His Three-day Visit to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
left for Bangkok on Tuesday afternoon, wrapping up his three-day
state visit to the Philippines after meeting with Philippine
President Joseph Estrada and signing four bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chuan Leekpai's visit also highlighted the celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations
between the two countries on June 14, 1949.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada and Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai held a
35-minute meeting at the Presidential Palace on Monday morning,
during which Mr. Chuan Leekpai congratulated Estrada in bringing
the Philippine economy back on the right track from the Asian
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to intensify cooperation in the areas of
trade, investment, tourism, human resource development, civil
aviation and science and technology to further strengthen the two
countries' 50-year-old bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On international front, President Estrada and Prime Minister
Chuan discussed the recently-concluded Indonesian polls and the
participation of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Both of them expressed hope that the plebiscite in East Timor
will likewise be peaceful and successful.
</P>
<P>
The visit also witnessed the signing of four bilateral
agreements, including a bilateral trade agreement, a memorandum of
understanding on joint oil spill response, an agreement on mutual
legal assistance on criminal matters, and an agreement on transfer
of offenders.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, President Estrada and First Lady Dr. Loi
Ejercito Estrada hosted a dinner at the Presidential Palace for
Prime Minister Chuan and his official entourage that included
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Foreign Minister
Surin Pitsuwaran.
</P>
<P>
Describing bilateral relations with Thailand as "among the
oldest and most fruitful in Philippine history," Mr. Estrada said
in the dinner that there was more than reason to be optimistic
that trade volume with Thailand will exceed last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Thailand ranked as the 12th largest trading partner of
the Philippines, with total trade amounting to 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total bilateral trade over the last five years grew at an
annual average of 26.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1998, investments from Thailand increased by 53.1
percent to total 701.6 million pesos (17.54 million U.S. dollars),
making Thailand the top ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations)
investor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were the special guests hosted Monday by the
Philippines-Thailand Business Council at the Manila Hotel where
they pledged continued investor and market-friendly fiscal
management measures to attract fresh investors to their respective
countries.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Leekpai also shared Mr. Estrada's view that the
Asian financial upheaval taught economists a very important lesson
that "we cannot survive alone in an increasingly independent
world."
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis, the prime minister said Southeast Asia
remains one of the most dynamic economic regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day working visit to Thailand in December last
year, Mr. Estrada invited Leekpai to visit the Philippines as part
of the celebration of the golden anniversary of diplomatic ties
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Urged Not to Fuel Iranian Jew Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday asked the Knesset (parliament) and the public not to
debate on the Iranian Jew issue, fearing any debate could turn
the senstive issue out of control.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also informed the Knesset that it has already
asked the United States, the European Union nations and other
countries to help solve this issue, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry denied on Monday for the second time that the 13
Jews arrested by the Iranian authorities have ever spied for
Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it will
also work closely with Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak in settling
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Barak asked Jordan to use its good office with Iran
to ask the latter to drop the so-called spy charges against these
13 Jews in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian radio reported on June 7 that Iranian authorities
arrested the 13 Jews living in the southern Fars province on
charges of spying for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made several weeks ago in the city of
Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials initiallly refrained from commenting on the
spying case due to its sensitive nature,  fearing that any
comment could make things worse for the arrested Jews.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that espionage is punishable by death penalty in
Iran. In 1977, Iran hanged two people convicted of spying for
Israel and the United States.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Chinese Premier Meets Central African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in a
meeting with Central African President Ange-Felix Patasse here
today, said that the Chinese government will support the Central
African government's efforts to maintain political stability and
promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that bilateral relations of friendly cooperation have
quickly resumed and developed since the restoration of diplomatic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have enjoyed frequent political contacts, with
good momentum for cooperation in wide-ranging fields, including
the economic and trade sectors, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
China joined in United Nations deliberations and justly
supported Central Africa's efforts to safeguard internal stability,
security and sovereignty, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that China has provided economic assistance to
Central Africa reflects the sincere friendship between people in
China and Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China attaches great importance to cooperation with
Central Africa in all fields and encourages and supports the
efforts of enterprises and corporations in both countries to carry
out direct economic cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis.
</P>
<P>
Each side has its own advantages, he said. For example, China
has technology, equipment and management expertise needed by
Central Africa, while Central Africa can offer China abundant
resources, vast market potential and huge labor resources,
according to the Chinese premier. The mutually complementary
advantages will enable the two countries "to seek common
development beneficial to citizens in both nations," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is delighted to see the Central Africa
government and people engaged in efforts to maintain domestic
stability, promote national reconciliation and seek economic
growth. The efforts have yielded tangible results, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Patasse pointed to the relatively recent restoration of
diplomatic relations and noted that the two countries have since
scored noteworthy achievements in cooperation in the political,
economic and healthcare sectors. He said the achievements have
established a solid foundation for the further growth of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The Central African president said his government and people of
Central Africa are grateful for China's support and he expressed
hope the current development momentum will continue.
</P>
<P>
Patasse said Central Africa is currently engaged in developing
its national economy and hopes to strengthen economic and trade
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the sound foundation and said Central Africa, a
country with vast resources, will continue to offer favorable
conditions and support for Chinese enterprises operating ventures
in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 15 (Xinhua) -- Conservative leader William Hague
sacked his deputy Peter Lilley on Tuesday in a radical reshuffle
of his shadow cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He promoted Ann Widdecombe and John Maples to become shadow
home secretary and shadow foreign secretary respectively, while
Theresa May takes over education and employment.
</P>
<P>
Lilley was widely blamed for sparking a Tory backlash after he
was reported to be moving away from the Thatcherite era of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The move comes the day after the Tories scored overwhelming
success in the European election.
</P>
<P>
A party spokesman said Hague would take over the policy review
the deputy had headed.
</P>
<P>
"One of the aspects of this reshuffle is that Mr. Hague wants
to take direct personal responsibility for the policy review," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"He feels that the clarity and the conviction he and the party
were able to bring to the European elections campaign needs to be
expanded into other areas of policy and he is very keen to see
that happening in the coming months," he added.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is understood to be part of a process that will
allow Hague to take a firmer grip on the party.

<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that it wants
the United States to have its share in a future aid for Kosovo
reconstruction, instead of making the European Union (EU) pay for
such an aid.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine as saying that the EU is not a "paying machine" for all
the costs of Kosovo reconstruction and economic development in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week that
since the U.S. had contributed most of the costs of the NATO
operation against Yugoslavia, the EU should pay "a lion's share"
in the future aid for Kosovo reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot agree with the idea that it is Europe which will pay
all, that Europe is a paying machine," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister said that U.S. and Europe are "
partners throughout the whole process" and the U.S. should not "
restrict Europe to the role of distributing checks."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will pay a visit to France on
Wednesday, during which he will discuss with French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin U.N. peacekeeping
and international aid to reconstruction in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Chirac will then attend in Cologne, Germany, a
summit of the Group of Seven most industrialized countries plus
Russia to be held later this week.

<HEADLINE> 300 Indian Soldiers Killed in LoC Clashes: Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistan military spokesman
Tuesday said that more than 300 Indian soldiers have so far been
killed while 1000 injured in the firing on the Line of Control
(LoC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Director General of
Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Brigadier Rashid Qureshi
said that the injured are being shifted to New Delhi because there
is shortage of space in hospitals in the India-held Kashmir,
according to the News Network International, a private news agency
here.
</P>
<P>
"We have received information that India has deployed two or
three brigades along Sialkot border from its Eastern Command. We
have also take all necessary arrangements to protect all the
geographical frontiers," said he.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani army will not budge from its positions and
will keep on retaliating to any firing from the Indian side.
</P>
<P>
The ISPR spokesman, however, said Pakistan army will stop
firing on the Indian positions in Kargil if India stops shelling
of civilian position on Pakistani side of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy shelling and air bombardment, the Indians failed
to evict Mujahideen (holy war fighters) from their positions in
Kargil, according to Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
"We are disturbed over the atrocities on Kashmiri Muslims, but
in spite of this, Pakistan is only extending political, moral and
diplomatic support to the Kashmiri brethren," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said India has intensified attacks on the LoC in the
past 48 hours and the Pakistani army has repulsed its four major
offensives.

project is in accordance with the choice of the locals, including
Tibetans, who have expressed their vigorous support," she added.
</P>

"Lawful rights of ethnic minorities there are fully protected,"

The project has no relation with any labor reform farm, she

"We call on all contributing countries to WB to observe the WB
Charter, adhere to the guideline of promoting economic growth of

</P>
<P>
"We expect WB authorities to approve the project on schedule,"

</P>
<P>
China places high importance on the poverty-relief project in
Qinghai, she pointed out. To implement the project as early as
possible, Zhang urged all contributing countries to "have a
correct view on its poverty-relief nature, strictly abide by WB's
relevant policy and regulations, and not be affected by the
ulterior moves plotted by anti-China organizations or do anything
detrimental to bilateral ties or hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
China's poverty-relief cause, which gains understanding and
support from countries worldwide, is proceeding smoothly, Zhang
said, adding that China welcomes overseas press to run on-spot
investigation in Qinghai "at any time."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Addresses National Education Work Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today stressed the importance of ideological and political
education for Chinese students.

<P>
The Chinese president made the remarks during an address to a
national work conference on education which opened today in
Beijing.

"The guiding principles, system and structure of China's
education system, as well as the content and methods of education
fail to adapt to the needs of the socialist modernization drive,"
said Jiang, adding that "the contradiction has gradually been
exposed."

<P>
"Colleges and universities should enroll more students to
fulfill the general public's demand for higher education," said
Jiang, adding that nongovernment sponsored colleges and
universities should play a supplementary role.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Environmental Protection Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase funding
for environmental protection, according to Xie Zhenhua, director
of the State Environment Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
China's inputs to environmental protection have increased on an
annual basis in recent years, with the 1998 increase representing
one percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), said Xie. The
SEPA leader made the remarks today in a Beijing news conference
sponsored by the State Council Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 0.7 percent of the nation's GDP was spent on
environmental protection during the Seventh Five-Year Plan Period
(1986-1990), with the figure for the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period
(1991-1995) standing at 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The percentage is highest for all developing countries, and is
also the highest compared when compared to developed countries
during the same stage of development," said Xie.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will continue to increase inputs to
environmental protection, but noted that even more funds will be
needed to achieve an overall improvement in the country's
environment.
</P>
<P>
China spent 72.2 billion yuan (nine billion US dollars) on
pollution control last year, up 43.7 percent on the previous year,
according to the annual SEPA environmental monitoring bulletin
released today.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the Chinese government has extended great efforts to
protect the environment, and has scored major progress in
controlling pollution affecting rivers and lakes, as well as in
introducing comprehensive pollution control in urban area. The
State Council has also issued the National Ecological Environment
Construction Program and initiated a nationwide natural forest
protection project.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China continues to face serious environmental problems
such as soil erosion, desertification and the extensive
deterioration of forests and grassland areas. Serious natural
disasters such as flooding, red tide and sandstorms affected
various areas in China during 1998.

under government's support which can permit a piece of land for
the construction of such a center.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China is gratified to see that
Sino-Indian relations have entered the process of improvement and
development following last year's serious disruption, Premier Zhu
Rongji said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told visiting Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh that
China has always placed high value on good-neighborly relations
with India. He expressed the hope that the two sides will expand
communications and contacts in order to iron out suspicions, seek
common ground while preserving differences, deepen mutual
understanding and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and India are two of the world's largest
developing countries and have experienced similar sufferings
throughout their histories.
</P>
<P>
The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated
by China and India constitute the political foundation for
bilateral ties, and have been recognized worldwide as the guiding
principles for handling nation-to-nation relations, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Acting in line with the five principles, China and India would
be good neighbors and co-exist peacefully, instead of posing a
threat to each other.
</P>
<P>
China and India not only have similar national conditions and
development levels, but also face similar problems during the
process of economic restructuring, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two countries should learn from each other,
further expand mutually beneficial cooperation and seek common
development, said Zhu, adding related actions will benefit the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Singh on China's economic situation and
position on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Singh said the Indian government values good-neighborly
relations with China, and is willing to advance the continuous
restoration and improvement of bilateral ties based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He said it is of practical significance to pursue the five
principles in the present international situation.

<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bulletin on Environmental
Conditions in China published today by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) shows that the country faces
serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Environmental pollution has not as yet been controlled in many
areas, with some areas facing worsening environmental conditions,
according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
China faces three major problems in terms of water resources,
water pollution, shortages of water resources, and both flooding
and water-logging.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of wastewater discharges dropped in 1998, but
the percentage of water pollution remained high, according to the
Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Various areas in east and northeast China have witnessed heavy
flooding and water-logging resulting from bad weather and
ecological deterioration. Some areas in northwest China, on the
other hand, suffer from water shortages.
</P>
<P>
The irrational use of fertilizers, pesticides and other
chemicals has polluted surface water in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Sulphur dioxide and both smoke and ash associated with burning
coal are the major sources of air pollution in China, according to
the bulletin. The volume of sulphur dioxide fell 7.8 percent in
1998 compared to the previous year, with the volume for smoke and
ash falling by 7.7 percent, and industrial dust discharges by 12.2
percent.

people injured and nearby buildings damaged.
</P>

"The mercenaries blasted a car, Toyota, full of explosives, " a
statement issued by the Iraqi General Security Directorate said on

</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
This was the second car-bomb attack in Baghdad in one week.
</P>

Last Wednesday, when a civilian bus carrying members of
Iraq-based Iranian armed opposition Mujahedeen Khalq was passing

pickup truck, full of explosives, hit the bus and exploded.
</P>
<P>
Mujahedeen Khalq held the Iranian government responsible for
the incident, which killed six members of the group and a number

</P>
<P>
Mujahedeen Khalq, which has more than 30,000 militarily-trained
men and women in 17 camps inside Iraq, often launched attacks on

<P>
"Such heinous crimes were drawn up by known circles through

<HEADLINE> Canadian Environmentalists Warns of Rising Greenhouse Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian environmental group is
warning of "rising greenhouse gas emissions at our peril" and
calls for "action to meet Kyoto targets" and changes in the way
Canadians use energy.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued on Monday, the Sierra Club of Canada said, "
1998 was the hottest year on record, with July of that year being
the hottest month ever recorded."
</P>
<P>
Heat waves in India are causing deaths with temperatures
soaring above 50 degrees Celsius. Killer tornadoes of
unprecedented strength are being witnessed. Droughts plague much
of the world, with Northern Mexico suffering the worst in history,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, low water levels in the Great lakes are being
witnessed while melting ice cover and drought has become a matter
of fact in Atlantic Canada. Toronto, in particular, is
experiencing freakish winds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group appealed to the Canadian government for
"much more action" to meet the greenhouse-gas-reduction targets it
agreed to in an international pact signed 18 months ago in Kyoto,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, Canada agreed to reduce emissions by 6
percent below 1990 levels, by 2012. But now the country is
estimated to be at least 25 percent behind that target. The main
source of emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels like
gasoline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, has expressed confidence in its
ability to devise a plan to tackle global warming by the end of
this year or early next year, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, are
produced largely when oil, coal and gas are burned.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Chief Secretary on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
said here Monday that Sino-U.S. relations are too important to
degenerate or to be affected by mistrust and lack of understanding.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region Government, expressed her concern
over the current deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations and called
for efforts to bring the ties back on track.
</P>
<P>
"A constructive relationship, constructive engagement between
America and China" serves the interests of the United States and
China, including Hong Kong, Chan told a press conference at the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"Mainland China and the United States are our two largest
trading partners, and any tension in that relationship has a
direct or indirect impact on Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan is paying a visit to Washington at a time when a debate is
under way on China's trade status on the Capital Hill. She
described China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
"a crucial important issue" and urged the U.S. government to put
it on the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"As the world's most populous country, it must be in everyone's
interest for China to open its economy and to be allowed to play
its part on the world stage," she added.
</P>
<P>
The chief secretary dismissed as "unfounded" charges by some
Americans that Hong Kong has been used as "a shipment center for
the diversion of strategic commodities and high-tech goods".
</P>
<P>
"We believe these accusations to be unfounded," and "we feel
that the Cox report is unfair to Hong Kong," she said. "All we ask
is for an opportunity to be heard, and to be judged by our actions
and not by perception," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed that Hong Kong remains a separate trading entity
and a separate customs territory, which has a physical border with
the mainland that is policed "by our own enforcement authorities."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a "very strict export, import and re-export
control" system which is "open and transparent," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We allow unlimited post shipment checks by your (U.S.)
authorities. We have your law enforcement agencies actually
stationed in our Trade Department, and they can see for themselves
how we implement these control regimes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan also refuted the allegation of "unrestricted access of the
PLA to computers in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has a legitimate role to play in Hong Kong," and they
have been "exemplary in their behavior since the first day they
arrived in Hong Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan applauded as "almost seamless" the political
transformation of Hong Kong that has undergone ever since the
establishment of a Special Administration Region there two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Government authorities have been exemplary in
keeping their hands off Hong Kong, while at the same time giving
us every support when we ask for it," she said.

<HEADLINE> World Industry Leaders Discuss Future of Wireless in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Industry leaders from all over
the world continued here Tuesday to discuss the future of wireless
telecommunications, particularly the development of CDMA, a
continuous digital transmission technology.
</P>
<P>
They are here attending the Fourth Annual CAMA World Congress,
the largest telecommunication conference in Asia, which presents
the latest information on the flagship technology of the CDMA
Group (CDG) -- the cdmaOne, third-generation (3G) evolution and
data services, as well as visions on the future of the wireless
marketplace at round-table discussions and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
CDMA, or Code Division Multiple Access technology, is a
traditionally U.S.-based technology, but a lot of the first-class
world technologies have been put into use in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDG, the number of subscribers worldwide to
its flagship technology, cdmaOne, totaled nearly 30 million by
March 1999, a one-year increase of over 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the technology is occurring in every region
of the world with the Asia Pacific leading the way with a one-year
net increase of 10.9 million. Worldwide, operators have added more
than 19 million subscribers since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Asia, where cdmaOne is widely deployed, operators have
a significant advantage as the technology supports 3G services and
increased capacity in existing spectrum bands," said Perry LaForge,
executive director for the CDG.
</P>
<P>
"CdmaOne is the future of wireless, making 3G a reality today,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The "explosive" growth of the Internet and the migration to 3G
technology make the future of wireless a very exciting prospect
for the cdmaOne community, said LaForge.
</P>
<P>
The CDG has achieved its goal of securing the future of
wireless globally with a 3G strategy that will enable the growth
of new information services, according to LaForge.
</P>
<P>
The first CDMA network was launched by Hong Kong telecom
company Hutchison several years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the congress the CDG accepted China United
Telecommunications Corporation (China Unicom) as its member. China
Unicom has been licensed for construction and operation of the
CDMA network in China, where CDMA services are still in a trial
phase in a few cities.
</P>
<P>
Many big companies of the wireless industry regard China as the
biggest untapped market.
</P>
<P>
The CDG is a non-profit trade association formed by 100
wireless operators and equipment manufacturers to foster the
worldwide development, implementation and use of cdmaOne
technology.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Western Cape Premier Elected Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Western Cape
New National Party (NNP) leader Gerald Morkel was re-elected
Tuesday as premier of the province amid angry protests by
supporters of the African National Congress (ANC) outside the
legislature building.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were demonstrating against the NNP-Democratic
Party coalition that has ensured Morkel a second term in office,
even though the ANC won the greatest number of votes in the
province in the June 2 poll, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ANC in the legislature made a symbolic bid to
block Morkel' s election by nominating its own leader, Ebrahim
Rasool, for the position. But Morkel won by 23 votes to 18.
There was one spoiled paper.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has 18 seats in the provincial legislature, the NNP 17,
the DP five and the African Christian Democratic Party and United
Democratic Movement one each.
</P>
<P>
The NNP and the DP are set to form a provincial coalition
government, and Morkel is expected to announce his cabinet Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rasool announced Monday that his party had refused the NNP-DP
offer of three posts in the 12-member provincial cabinet and had
opted to be the official opposition.
</P>
<P>
The ANC later on Tuesday boycotted Morkel's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Just before Cape judge president Edwin King was due to
administer the oath of office to Morkel, Rasool said he and his
party colleagues had to go to the mass rally outside the building.
</P>
<P>
All 18 ANC members walked out of the chamber, without leaving
even a token presence to watch the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 protesters had tried to storm the entrance of the
provincial legislature, but were pushed back by police.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, said today that unity and cooperation between
developing countries are of extreme importance for ensuring world
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should accelerate economic growth and
reinforce unity and cooperation in face of the far less than
tranquil international situation, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The chairman made the remarks during a Tuesday meeting with
Somon Mwila, deputy president of the Zambian National Assembly,
and his party.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development remain the theme of the current world in
spite of occasional disturbances, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation and gratitude for Zambia's adherence
to the "one China" policy and its support for China on some major
issues. The two countries have enjoyed good relations ever since
the two countries forged diplomatic ties some 35 years ago and the
two nations share similar or identical views on many international
issues.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC and the Zambian National Assembly play important
roles in their respective countries and further exchanges between
the two institutions will contribute to the further development of
Sino-Zambian ties, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Mwila noted that Zambia is pleased that cooperation with China
in various fields has been reinforced in recent years. He added
that Zambia regards China as an "all-weather friend" and hopes to
draw on China's political and economic experience. Chinese
entrepreneurs are welcome to invest in the country in order to
promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation, according to
Mwila.
</P>

<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Soccer hooligans charged for
attempted murder apologized on Tuesday to the French policeman
they cruelly attacked during last summer's World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Officer David Nivel, 44, attended the trial in Essen, Germany
on Tuesday for the first time since the June 21 assault to see his
four accused attackers. He will not be called however to testify.
</P>
<P>
Left blind in one eye from the June 21 assault and still
undergoing therapy to regain his speech and ability to walk, Nivel
stayed motionless while two of the hooligans, Frank Renger, 21,
and Tobias Reifschlaeger, 23, apologized to him at the court room.
</P>
<P>
Nivel was in a coma for six weeks after being attacked in Lens,
France, where the German team was playing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Lorette, accompanied him to the Essen courthouse
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He is no longer the same," Lorette said in court on Tuesday.
"Everything that he likes to do, he can no longer do."
</P>
<P>
Nivel cannot drive a car, play sports, read or paint, his wife
said. He can hardly talk. In addition to his diminished eyesight,
his hearing is poor and he has lost most of his sense of taste and
smell. He can no longer be an attentive father to their two
children. "Since that day, his life is no longer his life," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Also charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm are
Christopher Rauch, 23, and Andre Zawacki, 28. If convicted they
face sentences of up to 15 years.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokeswoman Refutes Allegation on China's Poverty-Relief Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue denied reports from western media and
Tibetan splitist organizations that China "assimilates Tibetans"
in a resettlement project to be funded by the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks at the regular press conference here
this afternoon, describing the reports as "with ulterior motives".
</P>
<P>
Certain western media and a few Tibetan splitist groups
recently alleged that a resettlement project in northwestern China
's Qinghai Province to be funded by the World Bank aims to "
assimilate Tibetans" and incorporate the buildup of a labor reform
farm so they required the World Bank not to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the project is part of the poverty-relief program
implemented by Qinghai Province to uproot poverty in the land-
locked province before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"The mission of the project is to remove a portion of the poor
population from their current living areas, where natural
conditions are so harsh that development cannot be realized, to
Dulan County of Haixi Prefecture in western Qinghai, where natural
conditions are relatively better," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Local residents from all ethnic groups, including Tibetans,
thus can shake off poverty and local socio-economic development
can also be improved," she said, adding that "the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Stabilizes in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the period March-May 1999 in Hong
Kong was 6.3 percent, the Census and Statistics Department (CSD)
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The provisional underemployment rate was 2.9 percent, according
to the latest labor force statistics released by the CSD.
</P>
<P>
For the period February-April 1999, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was confirmed to be the same as the previously
released provisional figure of 6.3 percent, while the
underemployment rate was revised upwards to 2.9 percent, from the
previously released provisional figure of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the period February-April 1999, the size of the total labor
force was 3,443,900, of whom 3,227,900 were employed and 216,000
were unemployed. In the same period, the number of underemployed
persons was 98,500.
</P>
<P>
For the period March-May 1999, the size of the total labor
force was provisionally estimated at 3,462,000, while the number
of unemployed persons and underemployed persons were provisionally
estimated at 216,000 and 103,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Elley Mao, the acting government economist, observed that the
unemployment situation showed some stabilization in the most
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Yet a close monitoring of developments was necessary, in the
light of the entry of fresh graduates and school leavers into the
labor market upon the start of the summer vacation, Mao said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing Tuesday, Secretary for Education
and  Manpower Joseph W. P. Wong said that the number of cases of
insolvency, cessation of business and retrenchment, and the number
of workers affected by these cases, as recorded by the Labor
Department, has shown a declining trend in recent months.
</P>
<P>
For the three months from March to May, 78 cases involving 3,
882 workers were recorded as compared to 93 cases involving 5,220
workers for the three months from December 1998 to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce said that the prospect of an improvement in the economy
in the second half of the year may encourage employers to take on
more staff, especially if local consumption and investment begin
to pick up in the third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, with the available labor force now growing at 4
percent annually and employment growing at only 1.5 percent, the
overall labor market will continue to be under pressure in the
months immediately ahead, the chamber said.

<HEADLINE> China, UNDP Expand Technical Adviser Recruitment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) signed an agreement on Tuesday to
expand the program supporting technology transfers to China and
recruiting more international technical advisers.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP Project -- "Senior Technical Advisers Recruitment (
STAR) -- will be expanded with a two million yuan (243,000 US
dollar) contribution from China and 240,916 US dollars from the
UNDP, according to the agreement signed by the UNDP, the China
International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges under
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
and the Touch Center under the Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the expanded project will be to recruit 300-odd
experts in 1999 and encourage the participation of more female
experts. The program is scheduled to run through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned funds will enable the project to finance the
increased number of experts, sponsor follow-up visits by national
experts to build long-term relations with STAR experts, create of
a roster of experts and establish transportation facilities,
according to a UNDP press release.
</P>
<P>
The STAR program, initiated in the 1980s, had recruited more
than 4,000 international experts to serve Chinese government
agencies, research institutions, state-owned enterprises and the
private sector by 1998, according to the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Some 241 foreign experts participated in science and technology,
economic reform and administration, social development,
agricultural development and environmental protection projects in
1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
The cost-effectiveness of the project rests with the fact that
experts provide their services on voluntary basis and receive only
travel expenses and daily subsistence allowances.

<P>
Guan also said China and Malaysia share the stand of opposing
interference by third parties in solving the dispute over the

Sino-Malaysia ties had taken on a new dimension with the signing
of a joint declaration of cooperation between the two countries in
Beijing last month.

Mubarak and Barak spoke by phone on Monday, Moussa said, adding
that Barak expressed keenness in the telephone conversation on
"resuming and activating the peace process immediately after
forming his cabinet."

Barak, leader of Israel's moderate Labor Party, was elected
prime minister last month. He has been struggling ever since to
form a broad coalition government. He has until July 9 to form his
government.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat stressed that the peace negotiations should
resume on all tracks, Moussa said. Israel's peace talks with both
Syria and Lebanon came to a halt in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moussa warned that if the the Syrian and Lebanese tracks were

He said Arafat and Mubarak also discussed the idea of holding a
pan-Arab summit to forge a unified position on the peace process

</P>
<P>
But he said "it is not necessary that the summit be held
tomorrow or in a week," adding that such a gathering might "take
one, two or three months to hold, depending on the current and
future circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Egypt after a two-day visit, Arafat expressed
hope that the Arab summit would be held as soon as possible. He
told reporters at the airport that there have been positive
responses from Arab leaders to the idea of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for Australian Farm Products Remains Bleak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for Australian farm
products continues to be bleak for some time with the nation's
chief commodities forecaster Tuesday predicting only modest price
increases for wool, wheat and meat in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
There was little good news for miners either, with the official
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE)
forecasting minerals and energy export earnings to continue
falling.
</P>
<P>
ABARE Tuesday released its June quarter update, slashing 320
million U.S. dollars from its earlier prediction for commodity
export earnings for the fiscal year of 1998-1999 ending on June
30.
</P>
<P>
It has now forecast commodity exports to be worth 64.7 billion
Australian dollars (42 billion U.S. dollars), down 3.3 percent on
the previous year, with earnings to fall further to 41 billion
U.S. dollars in the coming fiscal year of 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
While no significant improvement is on the cards, ABARE has
forecast rural exports to be worth 16.3 billion U.S. dollars in
the current fiscal year, down 2.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But ABARE has forecast better world prices for key commodities
including wheat, beef and wool in the fiscal year of 1999-2000
despite a higher Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Beef and lamb prices are expected to be forced up by lower
production, with the saleyard indicator price for beef forecast to
average 200 Australian cents (1.3 U.S. dollars) per kilogram
(dressed weight) next year, five cents up on the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The pool return for Australian standard wheat grade 10 (ASW10)
is forecast to increase by over four percent to about 188
Australian dollars (122 U.S. dollars) a ton in the coming fiscal
year of 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
But sugar prices are expected to continue falling as world
production outstrips consumption.
</P>
<P>
Wool exports are expected to fall by both value and volume in
the coming fiscal year, although slightly higher prices at wool
auctions are forecast for farmers.
</P>
<P>
For mineral resources, export earnings are forecast to fall by
3.8 percent in the current fiscal year to 39.6 billion Australian
dollars (25.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lower world prices for minerals and bulk commodities are also
expected to be responsible for a further 4.8 percent fall in
minerals earnings in the coming fiscal year of 1999-2000 to 24.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, average prices for Australia's major minerals and
energy commodities are forecast to increase significantly in 2000
as economic growth recovers, particularly in Asia, ABARE said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Political Leaders to Meet Over Inter-Korean Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
will meet leaders from ruling and opposition parties Wednesday for
the national security surrounding the inter-Korean military
conflict in the Yellow Sea Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to hold the meeting based on the judgment that both
the ruling and opposition parties need to share the same
understanding and recognition of the incident and jointly tackle
it," said presidential spokesman Park Joon-young.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday meeting to be attended by president of the
opposition Grand National Party Lee Hoi-chang, acting president of
the ruling party Kim Young-bae and Park Tae-joon of the ruling
partner United Liberal Democrats, Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae
will brief the political leaders on the inter-Korean military
clash, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Before the spokesman's press conference, the opposition Grand
National Party called for a meeting between President Kim and its
leader Lee Hoi-chang over the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party also urged Kim Dae-jung's government to
abandon its "sunshine" engagement policy toward the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, a DPRK torpedo boat was hit and sunken
while two South Korean patrol boats were damaged in an exchange of
fire in the Yellow Sea. Seven South Korean servicemen were wounded
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of crossfire, President Kim ordered his Defense
Minister Cho Seong-tae to tackle the conflict in a calm and firm
manner and he also directed the military to closely cooperate with
the United States and Japan in dealing the case, said the
president spokesman.
</P>
<P>
the South Korean Defense Ministry issued an order of "Def-Con 3
" for naval and marine troops off the west coast of the Korean
peninsula and then changed it to order of "Watch-Con 2".
</P>
<P>
"Def-Con 3" is issued for an emergent situation when serious
tension happens and could possibly lead to mass military
involvement while "Watch-Con 2" is designed to enhance
intelligence surveillance and analysis based on a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry spokesman Cha Young-koo said the tension
remains high at the conflict scene of the crossfire along the west
coast.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved our warships south of the buffer zone to avoid
any further collisions and escalation of tension, but we are
prepared for any further provocation," said the defense ministry
spokesman.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French rightwing parties experienced a black Monday as
the president of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic, Nicolas

</P>
<P>
-- The Serbs left the city of Prizren on Monday in columns of

by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

Prizren on Monday behind the tanks of German troops. Dini, the "
commander" of KLA and a former Yugoslav army officer, led about 1,
000 KLA soldiers into the city and settled in a house with a
garden. He threatened to drive the last Serb out of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed lower Tuesday as continued strength in the resources sector
and a stronger session on Wall Street Monday failed to offset
falls among banks and many industrial stocks on the Australian
market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index staged a recovery during the
day but closed 9.3 points lower at 2,940.9, off a high of 2,961.8.
</P>
<P>
Resources surged as base metal prices continued to rally, with
the all resources index gaining 10.2 points to 1,224.1, while the

</P>
<P>
The banks faced the brunt of Tuesday's fall, with the banking

</P>
<P>
"The banks have been under pressure really for a couple of
weeks," Hartley Poynton's Ian Parker said.
</P>
<P>
"There's interest rate fears which are driving them down," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Australia's largest bank, the National Australia Bank, lost
29.5 cents to close at 25.105 Australian dollars, the Commonwealth
Bank of Australia dropped 25 cents to 23.95 Australian dollars,
ANZ bank shed 25.1 cents to 10.66 Australian dollars and Westpac

dollars, after reaching an intraday high of 25.20 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
BHP added six cents at its close of 17.56 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index added 0.5 of a point to 819.0, with bullion

At the close the Australian dollar was 66.01 U.S. cents, from
the close on Monday of 66.21 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency traded as low as 65.85 U.S. cents

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Black Sea littoral
is contaminated with oil residues originating mainly in the
shipyards along the coast, the local Nine O'clock daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The whole 245-km coast has all been polluted by oil residues in
different degrees, an inspection team from the Ministry of Water,
Forests and Environmental Protection was quoted by the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The worst polluted beaches were at Eforie Nord and Eforie Sud,
which are two of the most famous coastal resorts of Romania, said
the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities are afraid that the pollution could spoil
the coming peak period of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team ordered the local environment protection
agency and the country's institute of marine research to take
urgent measures to decontaminate the beach, and to penalize
offenders and monitor non-stop potential sources of pollution at
sea.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Fight Against Crimes in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police is taking a
three-pronged special operation to curb the soaring crime rate in
capital Harare, the Herald newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Harare Monday, Assistant
Commissioner Wallace Banda pledged that "this operation will not
end until the situation is back to normal."
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Operation Hawk, was launched last
week, seeking to tackle armed robberies, car hijackings and
house-breakings, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five days, 16 suspected armed robbers and car
hijackers have been arrested by police with nine vehicles
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Police are now seeking dialog with the judiciary, the
Attorney-General's Office and the courts for the imposition of
strict bail conditions, as most of those arrested were suspected
of committing crimes while out on bail, said Banda.
</P>
<P>
Police were also seeking a permanent solution to the escalation
of crime in the capital city, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police officer noted that since last January, Harare has
seen about 800 vehicles stolen and property worth over 10 million
Zimbabwean dollars (some 260,000 U.S. dollars) lost to thieves.
</P>
<P>
The Herald also reported that recently armed robbers got away
with two million Zimbabwean dollars (some 52,000 dollars) in cash
in two separate incidents in the city center in broad daylight.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Oil Revenue Decreases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria earned a total of 8.56
billion U.S. dollars from crude oil exports in 1998, compared with
14.85 billion dollars in 1997, the Central Bank of Nigeria has
said.
</P>
<P>
In its yearly report and statements of accounts available here
Tuesday, the central bank said that the over 40 percent decrease
in oil export revenue reflected the slump in the price of crude
oil from an average of 19. 4 dollars per barrel in 1997 to 12.9
dollars per barrel last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the United States remained the largest
importer of Nigeria's crude oil, accounting for 49.3 percent of
total oil export, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The share of Western Europe in Nigeria's total oil exports
declined to 20.1 percent while the share of Asia stood at 17.6
percent, showing an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
The country's crude exports to other African countries are
still low, accounting for 6.3 percent of the total exports with
Cote d'Ivoire being the largest importer of the nation's crude in
the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil prices continued on the upswing this year,
recording 16.2 dollars per barrel Monday, giving the hope that the
revenue from the oil sector of Nigeria which is the sixth largest
oil exporter in the world would improve in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget projected income from oil sector at 4.289
billion dollars based on an official selling price of nine dollars
per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Churches Urges Cease-fire in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's churches and their
counterparts from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have
called for an immediate cease-fire in the DRC, the Herald
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A communique drawn by the church leaders Monday at the end of a
three- day meeting in Harare also called on the warring parties to
lay down their arms and negotiate on how to achieve peace and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The document also denounced war weapon manufacturers for
capitalizing on conflicts to boost their markets.
</P>
<P>
It will be presented to all heads of state and government
involved in the DRC war, the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), DRC rebel leaders and all churches which
participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Delegates charged that wars in Africa were a result of
superpowers interested in exploiting wealth and boosting their
military hardware markets.
</P>
<P>
"We affirm the importance of African solidarity in times of
peace and war," the document said.
</P>
<P>
It said the DRC war had led to loss of human lives, massive
displacement and uprooting of innocent people, fragmentation of
the DRC, destruction of fragile economies and mistrust for
political leaders and the international community.
</P>
<P>
The war was also a threat to the Organization of African
Unity's dream of "African Unity", it said.
</P>
<P>
"The war is causing untold suffering to the people of the
Congo, in particular, Zimbabwe and other countries in the
region.," it added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has sent more than 6,000 troops in aid of Kabila, who
is also backed by Angola and Namibia in the war against rebels
supported by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-hosted by the Zimbabwe Council of Churches and
the All- Africa Conference of Churches, sought to establish the
facts on the war, to find ways of engaging political leaders in
peace talks with the church and to explore strategies to mobilize
churches and engage key players in the conflict towards lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 delegates representing various church organizations
from the two countries attended the meeting.

Hasina Tuesday said that her government has a plan to reintroduce
train service between Benapole in southwestern Bangladesh and
Petrapole in India.
</P>
<P>
Since pre-liberation period there have been good train services
between the two neighboring countries specially in Darsana-Gede,
Rohanpur-Singhhabad, Birol-Radhikapur and Shahbajpur-Mohishashan
routes, Hasina said while replying to a question in the

countries has been expanded due to train service, and goods like
fertilizers, cement, stone, cement clinker, foodgrains, gypsum,
etc. from India and molasses, jute and fertilizers from Bangladesh
are being transported between the two countries by train.
</P>
<P>

goods from India during the 1997-98 fiscal year, she stated,
adding that the BR also earned another 25.2 million taka (0.52
million dollars) during the same period by exporting 64 tons of
goods to India and Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Blames Oil Firms for Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has said that the oil companies operating in the country are
mainly responsible for the current crisis in the Niger Delta which
requires joint solutions by the government and the companies.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in capital Abuja Monday when he
received President of ELF Aquitane Group Worldwide, Philip Jaffre.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted Obasanjo as saying that
his government had expected the oil companies to do much for their
host communities by way of providing community development
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that frustration among the youths resulting
from lack of opportunities for self-actualization and the absence
of basic necessities of life was one of the major causes of the
current agitation in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
He urged oil companies to create more jobs for qualified youths
in their areas of operation.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told the ELF delegation that he is far from being
satisfied with the current level of indigenization at key
managerial levels of the domestic oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government will expect oil companies in the
country to take urgent and visible action to train and integrate
more local people in their decision-making positions in the
country's oil industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the oil producing community of Warri in southern
Nigeria have killed reportedly about 300 people during two weeks
of renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
On gas flaring in the west African country, Obasanjo expressed
his displeasure at the continuation of gas flaring in the Niger
Delta, 21 years after he signed a decree imposing penalties
against the act in his past capacity as a military head of state.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that beside damaging the environment, gas
flaring has translated into burning money which the nation could
not afford to waste.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the oil companies to take urgent steps to
end gas flaring as he is prepared to initiate legislation that
would impose drastic penalties against them.

<HEADLINE> Case of Extraditing Rwandan Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The extradition case
concerning Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former army officer wanted by both
Rwanda and Belgium for his role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, has
been adjourned to June 29 because the accused asked for another
counsel to defend him.
</P>
<P>
The decision to adjourn the case was made Tuesday in the Kisutu
Resident Magistrate's Court in the Tanzanian capital by the
Principal Resident Magistrate, Projestus Rugazia.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in the court, Ntuyahaga's advocate, Dr. Jwain
Mwaikusa, said his client, who claims to have language problems in
communication, desires to have another lawyer, named Luc de
Temmerman, to defend him.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga said before he was brought to the Kisutu court, he
had long been represented in legal affairs by Temmerman, a Belgian
lawyer who can talk to him in French.
</P>
<P>
The former Rwandan military officer has asked Mwaikusa to work
with Temmerman, although the two lawyers had never met before.
</P>
<P>
Based on this situation, Mwaikusa, who is also a teacher at the
Law Department of the University of Dar es Salaam, proposed to
adjourn the case waiting for the arrival of Temmerman. The
prosecution side raised no objections to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Respecting wishes from both sides, the Principal Resident
Magistrate allowed to adjourn the case. However, it is not within
his jurisdiction to decide whether or not to permit Ntuyahaga to
have Temmerman as his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Mwaikusa later told reporters that it is the High Court that
has the power to grant the permission.
</P>
<P>
The case has been adjourned several times since it was opened
on May 12, but Mwaikusa said he does not hope to see that the case
is prolonged indefinitely as people would wrongly feel that there
is a fear about the case.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, the former Head of Logistics at Kigali
military camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peace-keepers
escorting her in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man fell into the hand of the Tanzanian
government in March this year after the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha in north Tanzania,
dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
him and released him in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He was re-arrested by the Tanzanian police shortly after the
release and is wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for extradition
and trial.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Chad Detain Any POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has denied that Chad
detains Rwandan prisoners of war (POWs), calling groundless the
claims by Chadian Foreign Minister Mahamay Saleh Annadif late last
week.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single Rwandan soldier held by Chad," the Rwanda
News Agency Tuesday quoted an official from the Rwandan Defense
Ministry as saying in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The Chadian minister had declared that his country holds 119
prisoners of war, including 27 Ugandans and a dozen Rwandans, in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
However, the unidentified Rwandan defense official said that
Chad could not hold any Rwandan POWs since the Rwandan army never
engaged Chadian troops who were based in northwest DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan troops are positioned in east, central, and
southwestern DRC where they have been fighting alongside Congolese
rebels, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan official claimed that the International Committee
of the Red Cross after verification found out that all the POWs
were Congolese, and that there were neither Rwandans nor Ugandans
among the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, together with Uganda, has long been accused of
sponsoring the DRC rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chad, along with Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, sent troops to
fight with DRC President Laurent Kabila against the rebels who
took up arms late last August.
</P>
<P>
Chad has reportedly withdrawn its troops from the DRC.

imports which rose to 2.597 billion dollars, 5.7 percent higher
than the same month of last year. This was the second consecutive
month of growth in imports after 13 straight months of decline.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' aggregate earnings from exports in April
amounted to 2.346 billion dollars, up 2.7 percent from April last
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that this April's two-way trade reached
4.943 billion dollars, increasing by 4.2 percent from 4.742
billion dollars last April, which marks the fourth straight
increase of monthly merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
Classified by major type of goods, raw material and
intermediate goods accounted for 43.8 percent of the total imports
for this April as payments grew by 18.5 percent to 1.138 billion
dollars from 959.88 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Payment for capital goods, which accounted for the second
biggest share of the import bill at 36.2 percent, went down by 8.2
percent to 940.97 million dollars from 1.025 billion dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the Japanese market was the top source
of imports for the month with a share of 21.4 percent, followed by
the United States with a 20.8 percent share.
</P>
<P>
Other major sources of imports for April were South Korea,
Singapore, China, Germany, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
For January to April, the country's revenues from exports
posted a 12.1 percent increase to 10.199 billion dollars from
9.101 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, expenditures for imports for the first four
months declined by 5.6 percent to 9.903 billion dollars from
10.494 billion dollars of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Total merchandise trade for January to April grew by 2.6
percent to 20.101 billion dollars from 19.595 billion dollars a
year ago, with a trade surplus of 296.0 million dollars, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded early Tuesday in an Israeli bombardment on villages in
south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ihmad Agli, 22, and Ibralim Salman, 40, were wounded when an
Israeli shell landed on the entrance to the Mansouri village,
about 10 kilometers south of the country's southern port city of
Tyre.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not give the reason for the Israeli operation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of the God, has been fighting
to dislodge Israeli occupation forces and its ally South Lebanon
Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Supports Convocation of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has expressed support for an Arab summit, saying it would help the
Arab people to tackle the challenges they face.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here Monday night after a meeting with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Arafat also appreciated
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's efforts towards convening such
a summit, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On his way back to Cairo Sunday night from a two-day tour to
Algeria and Morocco, Mubarak told Egyptian reporters that a
pan-Arab summit is "an inevitable necessity" to cope with the
situation and challenges facing the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
Arabs are talking about a summit aimed at forming a united
position on peace talks with Israel's new government under Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who has pledged to advance the talks
with the Palestinians and resume the negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, arrived here Monday
evening to have talks with Mubarak and Egyptian officials on the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Also at the news conference, Arafat played down differences
with the Syrians, saying "we regard our brothers in Syria as being
partners to us in everything." He disclosed that he would soon
meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
After Barak was elected Israel's prime minister last month,
Arafat and Mubarak called for a summit including Egypt, Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians to forging a united Arab
stance toward the coming stage of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, apparently angered by Arafat's signing of interim
peace accords with Israel, seems to have little interest in the
proposal.

<HEADLINE> HK to Be More Involved in China's Modernization: Business Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will be more involved,
not less, in China's modernization as the mainland's economic
restructuring continues.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), made the remarks at an international
telecommunications conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The last few years have been a time of great change as the
Chinese mainland grapples with a host of challenges, including the
restructuring of non-productive companies and industries,
enshrining of property rights, and official acceptance of private
enterprise, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes there are three "key areas" where Hong Kong
will play an important role in the next stage of China's
modernization: the reform of the state-owned enterprises, trade
liberalization and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, and
the opening up of China's services sector.
</P>
<P>
The need for funding and professional expertise to help these
companies modernize will increase dramatically, and much of that
will come from Hong Kong, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Some mainland enterprises have already come to Hong Kong and
listed on the stock exchange, eager to raise money in Hong Kong's
capital market, he said.
</P>
<P>
These so-called "red-chips" are companies now domiciled and
registered in Hong Kong, but still have most of their assets and
interests in the Chinese mainland economy, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Equally, some 100,000 Hong Kong expatriates are at work in the
mainland areas, offering management advice and expertise in a
variety of sectors.
</P>
<P>
Fung noted that China's eventual accession to the WTO will be a
"huge boost" to Hong Kong since the volumes of trade passing
through Hong Kong will be higher.
</P>
<P>
Services account for only 32 percent of China's GDP. And the
Chinese mainland wants to boost producer services like banking,
telecommunications and professional services -- the "very services
in which Hong Kong is strong, and the areas in which most
multinationals in Hong Kong specialize," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"Our traditional role as the gateway to China remains an
important consideration for many companies," the TDC chairman
noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in business going directly to the Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong still handles about 40 percent of all trade to
and from the mainland, and more than 50 percent of all foreign
direct investment, according to Fung.
</P>
<P>
Fung named several advantages of Hong Kong, including its sound
business environment and institutional strengths.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the best location from which to launch and manage
the region's telecoms revolution, Fung said, and it has the most
liberalized telecoms market in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The past year has seen tremendous change and progress in Hong
Kong telecoms, with the mobile phone and pager markets now
completely opened to outside competition," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"This open attitude is mirrored by Hong Kong's support for new
technology," he added.
</P>
<P>
More important than the technologically innovative environment
is Hong Kong's "undisputed" status of information and
communications hub of the Asia-Pacific region, he said.

ABU DHABI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) left here Tuesday for South Africa to attend the
inauguration ceremony of the newly-elected South African President
Thabo Mbeki to be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saeed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi
Seaport Authority who heads the delegation, will deliver messages
from UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan to both Mbeki
and the outgoing president, Nelson Mandela, the official WAM news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement before his departure, Sheikh Saeed said that
the UAE and South Africa have strong economic, commercial and
political relations, which witnessed tremendous growth during the
tenure of President Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is a symbol of struggle and democracy in Africa
and the developing world, "said the UAE official.
</P>
<P>
"Its leader, Nelson Mandela, who led the struggle against
Apartheid, has succeeded during his five years as president in
improving the living standards of the black majority in his
country and bring back South Africa into the international
community after decades of international isolation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, Mandela, as a special guest, attended
the 19th Gulf Cooperation Council summit meeting held in Abu
Dhabi, during which he also met with UAE President Sheikh Zayed.
</P>
<P>
"His visit to the GCC summit and his meeting with Sheikh Zayed
has significantly contributed to the cooperation and friendship
between the two countries," Sheikh Saeed said.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom announced here
Tuesday that it has changed its English name to Cable &AMP; Wireless
HKT and redesigned its logo to highlight its close links with its
London-based global parent company, Cable and Wireless plc.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the adoption of the new identity,
Hongkong Telecom chief executive Linus Cheung said that the
changes recognized the dramatic international expansion of the
company and its new horizon. No change is being made to the
company's Chinese name.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the company's competitive edge in Hong Kong
and the Asia Pacific region coupled with the global strength of
Cable and Wireless, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT would provide more cost-
effective and innovative integrated communications services to its
customers.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is to make Hong Kong the Internet hub and e-
commerce center of Asia, and to accomplish this we have already
poured 20 billion HK dollars (2.56 billion U.S. dollars) into Hong
Kong networks -- and we will continue to invest at least 5 to 6
billion HK dollars (641 to 769 million U.S. dollars) a year over
the next 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In reshaping our company we have had to globalize our
operations to handle ever-increasing consumer demand for
international connectivity 24 hours a day. This makes it easier
for our customers to do business, and also makes their lives more
profitable and enjoyable," Cheung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday underlined parliamentary cooperation among Islamic
countries to promote their understanding.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the founding conference of
the Organization of the Islamic Parliaments (OIP) here, Khatami
said parliamentary cooperation within an organizational framework
would give rise to more constructive dialogues and deeper
understanding among the Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation would also strengthen the solidarity among
Muslims while preserving their diversity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami believed that the OIP would provide a ground for
"revitalization and reconstruction of the comprehensive and
dynamic Islamic civilization, based on democratic values, and
enriched by the people's participation."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the newly-born OIP would function as a
center for assisting the governments and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) in dealing with challenges facing the
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the OIP to pay attention to economic and cultural
dilemmas, poverty and underdevelopment, the occupation of Islamic
lands by others, and the internal disputes and misunderstandings
of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Priorities also should be given to international issues such as
disarmament and global security, human rights, environmental
protection, political and social development, women and youth
problems, anti-drugs campaign and campaigns against discrimination
and oppression, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Visit Japan, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard is scheduled to make a 13-day trip to Japan and the United
States to settle economic disputes with the two countries and
promote trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The trip to the two countries, Australia's most important
political and economic partners, comes amid simmering trade
tension over Japan's decision to ignore international limits on
southern bluefin tuna fishing in South Pacific, and the U.S. push
to block Australian lamb imports.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, Howard said the trip was
designed to promote Australia's strong economic credentials and
the need to combat trade protection ahead of the APEC leaders
summit in New Zealand in September.
</P>
<P>
During his five days in Japan from July 5 to 9, Howard will
meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, followed by a meeting
with Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.
</P>
<P>
"My aim will be to reinforce Australia's strong economic and
political partnership with Japan," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"I will also discuss how Australia and Japan can best cooperate
in our region. We have both played an important role in helping
countries in the region emerge from the recent economic and
financial downturn," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The need to combat protectionist pressures through a strong
outcome at the forthcoming APEC leaders meeting and further market
opening through a new global trade round will be an important item
on my agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S., Howard will hold talks with President Bill Clinton
and Congressional leaders to reinforce Australia's commitment to
lowering trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is currently in
the U.S. to lobby against a push to impose new tariffs against
Australian and New Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due to announce a decision on the lamb tariffs soon.
</P>
<P>
Howard will also use the trip to address financial leaders in
New York and to promote Australia as a new global financial
center.
</P>
<P>
"My aim is to promote Australia's competitive strengths as a
base for global financial services," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Call for Better Monitoring of Mental Patients, Drug Addicts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 140 specialists from
China's rehabilitation centers for people with mental problems and
drug addicts are asking for better monitoring of mental patients
and drug addicts, especially those with a tendency toward violence.
</P>
<P>
This was discussed at the 8th national conference on mental
patients that ended last weekend in the city of Wuhan, capital of
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the meeting, the incidence of mental
illness in China is up to 14.5 per thousand from 10.5 per thousand
in the 1980s. Out of the 17.4 million mental patients in China,
about 1.2 million have a tendency toward violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
China also has about 600,000 registered drug addicts, not a few
of whom also have violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huanlin, director of the Public Security Ministry's Prison
Management Bureau said that mental patients and drug addicts with
violent tendencies are often trouble-makers who directly endanger
people's lives, and social and economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
Prison bureaus at all levels need to improve management
immediately at rehabilitation centers, Liu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Malawians go to the polls Tuesday
to elect their law makers and president for the next five years, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Malawi's polling committee as saying that it
has enlisted about five million eligible voters out of six million
qualified voters.
</P>
<P>
Three main parties are taking part in the political race in the
country' s second multi-party polls which have been delayed for
three times.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) and the Malawi
Congress Party (MCP) are challenging the United Democratic Front
(UDF), the ruling party of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Chakufwa Chihana of the AFORD and Gwanda Chakuamba of the MCP
have joined forces as running mates in the presidential race
against UDF leader Bakili Muluzi, the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
At least 100,000 eligible voters remain unregistered, and have
threatened to protest against being denied their right.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, James Kalaile
appealed to Malawians who have not enrolled to cast their ballots
to stay away from polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security forces have been deployed throughout the
country to ensure security of the voting.
</P>
<P>
Malawi held its first multi-party elections in 1994, which saw
President Muluzi's UDF defeat the MCP led by Kamuzu Banda.

<P>
China has 22 rehabilitation centers for people with mental
problems, with some 7,500 beds. These centers have to handle
mental patients with violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1998, the rehabilitation centers have treated some
75,000 people with mental problems, 30 percent of whom were
homicidal. They also helped assess the conditions of more than 24,
000 cases of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that he believes that the Public Security Bureau's
Jingxing Rehabilitation Center in Wuhan is one of the best for
drug addicts. The center's staff try to persuade family members to
show sympathy for the patients and expose the ugly side and
dangers of drugs to patients to keep them from returning to drugs.
</P>
<P>
Because of an insufficiency of funds and other reasons, he said,
China's rehabilitation centers for people with mental problems and
drug addicts are at different stages of development, and there are
even no rehabilitation center in 14 provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The development of rehabilitation centers for mental patients
and drug addicts can not be separated from government and public
support because it is an immense social and public welfare project,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tourist Injured After Fall From Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian tourist was extremely
lucky in surviving a 50-meter fall from the Great Wall on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital say
that Alex Schamacher, 56, was seriously injured but is out of
danger following a five-hour operation and treatment.
</P>
<P>
"I'll remember the Beijing people forever for they gave me a
second life," Schamacher said.
</P>
<P>
Schamacher went to the Great Wall with his family on Sunday and
climbed to a dangerous site at Shibadeng at 5:00 in the afternoon,
where he fell into a valley, breaking at least three ribs and
injuring the left sternum, left kneecap, left scapula, left shank,
left elbow and his head.
</P>
<P>
Nearby villagers tried to carry Schamacher to a township
hospital, 15 km away, on a litter, but it broke during the journey
because of his heavy weight so they called police for help.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 traffic and patrol policemen rushed to the scene and
carried Schamacher to the Great Wall by Monday morning from which
he was moved to PUMC Hospital by 2:00 p.m., Monday
</P>
<P>
The section of the Great Wall where the Schamacher family and
their friends were hiking is in Huairou county in the northeastern
suburbs, about 50 kilometers from downtown Beijing, and is not
officially open to tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are usually taken to Badaling to the northwest of
Beijing, but, individual adventurers sometimes prefer the remote
sections for their beauty and pristine state.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that Schamacher, who is a businessman working in
Beijing, should remain at the hospital for a week after which he
can be sent back to Canada for surgery.

GUANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China will shut down a number of small power plants this year to
control acid rain, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The plants have a combined installed capacity of 1.42 million
kw. They have helped ease the tight electricity supply but the
energy-consuming plants have also become a major contributor to
the increasing acid rain in the province.

To control pollution, Guangdong has not approved any new small
power plants since 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Guangdong had a total installed power
generating capacity of more than 29 million kw. It plans to give
priority to developing large coal-based power plants and nuclear
power plants.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Seen to Grow 4.5 Pct in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's chief commodities
forecaster Tuesday boosted its economic growth forecasts amid
early signs of a recovery in some of the financially-troubled
parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE), an official organization, lifted its growth forecast for
Australia to around 4.5 percent in the fiscal year of 1998-1999
ending on June 30, 1999, up from its earlier forecast of 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The prediction, contained in ABARE's June quarter outlook,
surpasses Australian Treasury's official expectations for a growth
of 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also lifted its 1999-2000 financial year forecast from
around 2.7 to 3 percent, in line with Treasury predictions.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said signs were building that economic recovery was
underway in some financially-troubled Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
In particular, it pointed to improvements in South Korea,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"With the Asian region accounting for a substantial portion of
Australia's commodities exports... economic development in Asia is
of particular importance to Australia's commodity sector," ABARE
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that the economic situation is improving
in Asia," it added.
</P>
<P>
ABARE expected Australia's inflation rate to average at 1.3
percent in the current fiscal year, before increasing to 2 percent
in the next fiscal year - broadly in line with Treasury forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was forecast to average around 67 U.S.
cents in the fiscal year of 1999-2000, up from ABARE's previous
forecast of 65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Given the low inflation outlook, interest rates were expected
to remain around current low levels in the short term, ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"At this assumed level, Australia's real prime lending rates
... would average around 6.0 percent in 1999-2000, compared with
the estimated average of around 6.5 percent in 1998-1999," it
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ruling Party Denounces Newspaper's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nation Media Group is steeped
in a treacherous campaign of disinformation to destabilize the
ruling Kenya Africa National Union (KANU), top officials of the
party said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The KANU officials accused the Nation Group of using media to
assert unpopular views in the minds of Kenyans with an aim to
encourage disaffection and create despondency in the country,
Kenya's major newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Led by Kenyan Vice-President and the party's national
vice-chairman George Saitoti and 10 other ministers and 14
assistant ministers, the KANU questioned the method used in the
survey published Monday in the Daily Nation, one of the most
popular newspapers in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"Which method was used? What geographical area did it cover?
Was it district by district or village by village? Who were asked
these questions?" Saitoti asked.
</P>
<P>
The Nation Group Monday published poll results claiming that
most Kenyans strongly disagree with Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi's plan to take the constitutional review talks back to
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional review has come to a stalemate due to the
distribution of the constitutional review commission seats among
different parties.
</P>
<P>
The KANU also said that in last year's second multi-party
general election, the Nation Group ran a similar public opinion
polls with an aim to discredit and underplay the popularity of the
ruling KANU but the polls turned out to be false when the KANU
routed the opposition to emerge as a winner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some experts dismissed the opinion poll a major
farce, Kenya Times, a paper squinting towards the ruling party,
reported Tuesday.

billion shillings (3. 4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank was closed by the central bank on May 19 for
insolvency, leaving money of more than 100,000 depositors locked
up in the bank. In the next day, the Bank of Uganda told
reporters that they decided to sell the bank.

<HEADLINE> Over 21,000 Ugandans Abducted by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 21,000 people have been
abducted by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) from
northern Uganda since the beginning of the insurgency 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Among the abducted, there are 6,652 children and the rest are
adults, the New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 3,703 captives are still in the hands of
the LRA rebels spearheaded by Joseph Kony, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
A security official was quoted by the paper as saying that the
number of the abducted children could rise to 8,000 because
another 2,000 or so names were not on the list.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels reportedly attack Uganda's northern districts
from bases in southern Sudan. They often cross the border to
abduct and rob.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have tried in vain to wipe out the
wrong-doers because of the poor infrastructure and complex terrain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni extended an amnesty to all those
fighting the government and offered a ministerial post for Kony if
he would come out to surrender.
</P>
<P>
However, this offer was categorically turned down by Kony who
demanded, among other things, to hold direct talks with government
and to secure more ministerial posts for his officers.

<P>
ABU DHABI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Tuesday called for support from its Gulf allies in solving its
dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The official Al Ittihad daily said, "the UAE has always been
committed to its responsibilities toward its Gulf allies, and now
it is time for all the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members to
reciprocate."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the UAE cabinet reviewed the result of a GCC
ministerial meeting, which gathered foreign ministers from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE, held in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the recent rapprochement with Iran by
Saudi Arabia and other GCC members, which the UAE accused was at
the expense of its interests.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Iran are competing for the sovereignty of Abu Musa,
the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, the three small but strategic
islands now occupied by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE complaints have touched off a war of words with Saudi
Arabia and the meeting concluded without making tangible
achievements.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Convoy Taking Food to Pristina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A convoy of Russian paratroopers
from the international force in Bosnia-Herzegovina left for
Pristina, Kosovo, early Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Russian Air-Borne Force Col. Gen. Georgy Shpak
said eight trucks and three escort vehicles with food, water, fuel
and pocket money are heading for the Pristina airport, where about
200 Russian troops are stationed.
</P>
<P>
The convoy is expected to arrive in Pristina by the end of the
day. It was not clear whether NATO was notified of the Russian
move.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops arrived in Pristina early Saturday, taking
NATO by surprise. Days of talks have failed to break an impasse
over Russia's peacekeeping role in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
NATO has divided five peacekeeping sectors in Kosovo to be
controlled by troops from Britain, the United States, Germany,
Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
Russia does not want its troops to be under NATO's command and
wants full control of a sector of its own in the northern part of
Kosovo where many ethnic Serbs live.
</P>
<P>
More talks are scheduled. Defense and foreign affairs chiefs of
Russia and the United States are expected to meet soon in Helsinki,
Finland, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S.
counterpart Bill Clinton will continue the talks on the Kosovo
issue during the G-8 summit scheduled for June 18-20 in Cologne,
Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will collect
80,000 tons of maize from farmers to recover fertilizer loans
given out in the past farming season.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are repaying the loans in the form of maize, which
will go to the Government Food Reserve Agency, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Agriculture Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh
Desai as saying that over 3,000 tons of maize have been collected.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the maize collected will be kept in reserve
while the government is also mobilizing resources to ensure that
more maize is bought.
</P>
<P>
Once the 80,000 tons are collected, the southern African
country will not import any maize for the reserves, said Desai.
</P>
<P>
He urged the food reserve agency to buy more stocks from local
farmers to supply the country for the four months between planting
and harvest.
</P>
<P>
"This year we are not importing any maize. What the farmers
have produced this year is enough for reserve," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zambia's maize production fell by 32.4 percent to
649,537 tons from 960,188 tons in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Protection for Tibetan Antelope (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jianwei, vice-director of the
State Forestry Administration's wildlife conservation department
today asked for international cooperation in protecting the
Tibetan antelope, which is on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been increased illegal hunting and
smuggling of the animal because of the profits involved from sales
abroad.
</P>
<P>
International understanding and cooperation is needed to better
protect the animal, Chen said, and that countries and regions
trading in or consuming the Tibetan antelope should take immediate
steps to stop.
</P>
<P>
Because of its value in research of the natural ecological
system of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Tibetan antelope is under
top protection in China. It is native to the grasslands of Qinghai
Province and the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibetan Autonomous Regions.
</P>
<P>
The animal's hide produces the "king of wool" and has been sold
illegally since the early 1990s. Shawls, called shahtoosh, made
from the animal's hair can bring as much as 10,000 U.S.dollars on
the world market.
</P>
<P>
According to Feng Zuojian, a wildlife specialist from the China
Academy of Sciences, the number of Tibetan antelopes has fallen to
some 50,000 because of the illegal hunting.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait saw its general
consumer confidence index fall slightly in May as people were
still not satisfied with the country's current economic situation,
according to an opinion poll published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Ipsos Stat, a local marketing research
company, and obtained by the Arab Times newspaper, showed that the
index dropped by one point in May to 62. They were 64 and 63 in
March and April respectively.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which is conducted monthly among 1,000 randomly
selected men, is aimed to reflect people's opinion on Kuwait's
current and future economic situation, the security situation,
expectations about future purchasing power and the level of
satisfaction with personal income. All index figures show the
ratio on a zero-to-100-point scale.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, the current economic situation index
reached 33 in May, down six points from April and the second
lowest level since the index fell to 28 in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of those questioned said the country's economic
situation was good, a drop of 10 percent compared to April.
</P>
<P>
However, exceptions about the future economic situation
remained positive, with the index dropping by only one point to
stand at 67.
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction with personal income remained unchanged at 66
points in May. Compared with expatriates, Kuwaitis were more
satisfied with their income.
</P>
<P>
Both Kuwaitis and expatriates were expecting an improvement in
people's purchasing power in the future as the index picked up 5
points to 59 in May.
</P>

Kuwaiti and expatriate consumers continued to feel secure in
the Gulf state, with security situation index gained one point to

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Air New Zealand pilots will
consider striking again if their message is not received by the
company, the Evening Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Adam Nicholson, advocate
of the Air Line Pilot Association of New Zealand, as saying that
their Monday's 5 a.m.-1 p.m. strike was in protest at Air New
Zealand's proposed eight percent salary base increase, offered on
May 21 after 60 negotiating days over 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said the company wants to increase flying hours and
cut operating costs to boost returns and the pilots want "a rise
that reflects that."
</P>
<P>
He said he is to write to the company soon, hoping to organize
preliminary talks for a new round of negotiations later this week.
</P>
<P>
About 440 of Air New Zealand's 650 pilots walked off the job
Monday, disrupting 15 domestic and 11 international flights.
</P>
<P>
However, the association will wait for a response from the
company before considering further action, the Evening Post said.
</P>
<P>
Air New Zealand spokesman Cameron Hill was quoted as saying
that his company is keen to return to the negotiating table
although no specific dates have been set.

TIANJIN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded enterprises in
north China's Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone
have recently signed contracts with the local environmental
protection departments on the waste water treatment, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises include Switzerland's Nestle, a coffee producer,

The development zone has always attached great importance to

and the annual need for the water in the afforestration is two
million tons. And the need will increase to more than 10 million
when the coverage rate reaches 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a waster water treatment plant with a capacity of 100,
000 tons and a treatment center of the waste water during the
electroplating have been set up there, which are expected to put
into operation within this year.

<P>
This means a large amount of clean water will be saved, the
cost of environmental protection will be lowered, and the problem
caused by the waste water discharge will be solved, said officials.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Committed to Investor-friendly Policies: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) --- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has said that his government will continue to pursue
investor-friendly policies to attract more investments into the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks Monday when opening the Nairobi Cargo
Center involving an investment of 1.2 billion shillings (some 20
million U.S. dollars) at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
which was named after Kenya's first president.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspapers Tuesday quoted the
president as saying that economic reforms in Kenya has paved the
way for increased private participation in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government would continue with its reforms to ensure
that the private sector plays a pivotal role in economic growth,
Moi pledged.
</P>
<P>
He noted that investments are the key to meaningful economic
growth, saying that the country's future economic expansion
depends on the amount of investment, both local and foreign, it
can attract and retain.
</P>
<P>
The president called upon local and foreign investors to take
advantage of liberalization within the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) and invest in the region and Kenya in
particular.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trade volume of the COMESA is worth 2.4
billion dollars among the member states.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Cargo Center, the president said, would help to
establish the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a preferred
passenger and cargo hub for the African region.
</P>
<P>
Total cargo handling at the airport has increased to the
present 116,000 tons from 80,000 ton in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Barak Promises to Continue Har Homa Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak
has promised to continue the controversial house constructions at
Har Homa, south of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the promise in an oral agreement with the National
Religious Party (NRP) leader Yitzhak Levy, when the two met Monday
in the Knesset (parliament) to discuss the formation of the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also contains a promise not to oppose a plan to
connect the Ma'ale Adumim settlement with Jerusalem, local
newspaper Ha'aretz reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak has refused to make any promises regarding
construction of a Jewish neighborhood at Ras Al-Amud, East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The oral agreement on Ma'ale Adumim and Har Homa will not be
included in the coalition platform, nor will they be included in
the coalition agreement with the NRP, as neither Barak nor the
NRP want the agreement publicized at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The coalition platform states only that "building in Jerusalem
will continue for the benefits of all its inhabitants," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa project was originally approved by the Laborite
Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, but tenders were only issued for
building on Har Homa by the out-going Likud-led government.
</P>
<P>
The construction at Har Homa in March 1997 had led the
Israel-Palestinian peace talks to another stalemate for more
than one year.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ale Adumim is one of the largest Jewish settlement on the
West Bank which is situated just east of Jerusalem. The government
issued a plan last month, intending to connect the settlement with
Jerusalem. This plan was strongly opposed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ras Al-Amud is the neighborhood of Palestinian residents in
East Jerusalem. Backed by American millionaire Irving Moskowitz,
several Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish groups tried to build
housing units there, but met strong resistance among the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
NRP strongly opposes territory concessions to the Palestinians
and played an important role in bringing down the government led
by Benjamin Netanyahu, although it is the coalition partner of the
Likud-led government.
</P>
<P>
NRP was the biggest loser in the May 17 elections, wining
only five Knesset seats compared to nine in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
But Barak wants to form a broad-based coalition and intends
to include NRP in its new government.
</P>
<P>
The oral agreement regarding Har Homa and Ma'ale Adumim showed
Barak will compromise on the settlement issue with NRP, but that
compromise will cause troubles with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Microcredit Works in Reducing Poverty: Bank Director (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi professor Muhammad
Yunus, a rural bank managing director, believes his microcredit
programs can help create "a poverty-free world."
</P>
<P>
Yunus, who has been managing director of the Grameen (Village)
Bank in Bangladesh since 1983, told Xinhua in an interview Sunday
that his Grameen Bank, a trust kind of arrangement aimed at
alleviating poverty and hunger through microcredit programs or
village banking, is of great feasibility across the world.
</P>
<P>
Yunus arrived here Sunday to attend this year's Rotary
International Convention and to receive the 1999 Rotary Award for
World Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Yunus first experimented with village banking in his own
country. Under this banking system, Grameen Bank gives poor
people, mostly poor women, access to collateral-free modest loans
(about 50 U.S. dollars each) to enable them to start small
business and make a living. Borrowers are grouped and group
members meet every week to make loan payments at commercial
interest rates and review one another's business plans. And those
who repay small loans on time can take bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
Yunus said that although Grameen Bank only works in Bangladesh,
similar microcredit programs are operating in about 60 countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said in addition to Asian, African and Latin-American
countries, such microcredit programs also work in rich countries
such as France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Poland and the United
States and most of the countries sent their staff to Bangladesh to
be trained.
</P>
<P>
Even in the United States, one of the most developed countries
in the world, he said, microcredit programs reach more than
150,000 Americans in inner cities like Chicago and Washington,
which have been running the programs for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Yunus said Grameen Bank now operates in 39,170 villages in
Bangladesh serving 2.37 million borrowers, one third of whom have
crossed the poverty line and another third are close to.
Cumulatively, the bank has disbursed 2.7 billion dollars in small
loans and the repayment rate has reached 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.2 billion people subject to poverty in the world
and the microcredit summit held in Washington in 1997 set the goal
of reaching 100 million poor families with microcredit by the year
2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yunus noted that rich countries have welfare systems but that
does not change the poor's situation and conventional banks will
not come to touch the poor because poor people can not offer the
collateral they seek.
</P>
<P>
So microcredit programs come to fill the gap because they are
not based on collateral but more on trust, Yunus said.
</P>
<P>
Banking can be done in many other ways than now on the basis of
collateral, he said.

<HEADLINE> Microcredit Works in Reducing Poverty: Bank Director (2) ...he said. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But how does Grameen Bank manage to maintain a repayment rate
of 94 percent and what would it do towards borrowers who fail to
pay back? Yunus replied that the whole thing "is in a social way."
</P>
<P>
Borrowers bring up the idea that whoever can not pay back is
their friend and they help to find out the root cause behind
nonpayment and lend him or her a hand to get out of the situation,
Yunus explained.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any legal instrument between borrower and
lender as our banking is based on people's mutual trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is a totally different thing from the practice of
conventional banks, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yunus recollected a sad experience that brought the idea of
microcredit programs to him.
</P>
<P>
"We had a terrible famine in Bangladesh in 1974 when I was
teaching economics at Chittagong University. I walked out of the
classroom and saw people dying in the streets of hunger. I tried
to understand why these people can not change their life and find
little food for themselves," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Yunus toured a village next to the university campus to see
what could be done. He knew he could not change Bangladesh, even a
village, but he could touch another human being's life in a
helpful way.
</P>
<P>
One day in 1976 Yunus met a woman in the village who had to
borrow 25 cents from a trader to buy bamboo to make bamboo stools.
The condition of the loan set by the trader was that she must sell
the product to him at a price he decided. Yunus toured the village
and came up with a list of 42 such people like the woman and the
total amount of money they needed was 27 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned by the fact that for the lack of a small amount
of money poor people fall victims to money lenders and traders who
can squeeze everything out of the poor people," Yunus said.
</P>
<P>
He gave this 27 dollars from his own pocket to the borrowers
and he was encouraged that he could help them. But when he tried
to introduce these poor people to a bank near the campus and
proposed small credit to the bank manager, the manager said the
bank could not lend money to poor people because they were not
creditworthy.
</P>
<P>
So Yunus offered himself as a guarantor, took money from the
bank and loaned the money to the poor people. It worked and people
paid back every penny they borrowed. He extended his work to two
other villages and then five villages.
</P>
<P>
The bank manager who loaned to Yunus never changed his mind. In
1983, Yunus created a bank called Grameen Bank.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Opts for Opposition in Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The African National Congress
(ANC) in the Western Cape has declined the offer, made by the New
National Party (NNP) and the Democratic Party (DP), of three seats
in the provincial cabinet, opting for an opposition role in the
province.
</P>
<P>
This means the NNP and DP will on Tuesday forge ahead with a
coalition government for the province, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have 22 seats between them, while the ANC has
18 and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and United
Democratic Movement one each.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's decision to go into opposition in the Western Cape
acknowledged the political realities of the election outcome,
provincial DP leader Hennie Bester said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the ANC's opposition in the Western
Cape would be loyal in the same sense that the leaders of
opposition parties on Monday pledged their support to
president-elect Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had expressed dissatisfaction with the coalition plan
from the interception as it won the most votes in the June 2
elections in the province.
</P>
<P>
The ANC made the decision on opposition after talks between the
ANC and the two traditionally white-dominated parties failed.
</P>
<P>
The ACDP withdrew from the coalition Saturday evening, saying
it would like to take a neutral position. However, its departure
did not change the balance of power in the province.

HOHHOT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A large area containing graves of
China's Xianbei ethnic minority was recently discovered in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the more than 130 graves are now being excavated.
Some of the corpses in them are either wrapped in birch bark or
put in wooden coffins. One coffin has two bodies with the female
on top of the male.
</P>
<P>
Most of the coffins contain funerary items like spears, swords,
and knives made of iron, bronzeware, pottery, some gold and pearl
jewelry, some bone objects, bronze mirrors, and coins.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say they believe the graves date to the late
Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) and show characteristics of the
Xianbei ethnic group and will shed light on the study of its
customs and political and military activities.

Command (UNC) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
Army failed to reach an agreement Tuesday in their talks on
reducing inter-Korean tension.
</P>
<P>
The talks at the truce village of Panmunjom were to solve the
naval conflict between the DPRK and South Korea but no agreement
was reached to ease the tension.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's talks were held after naval vessels from the DPRK and
South Korea exchanged gunfire in disputed waters in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK torpedo boat was hit and sunken while two South Korean
patrol boats were damaged in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the 90-minute meeting, the UNC proposed that Seoul and
Pyongyang withdraw their naval forces to their respective sides of
the Northern Limit Line, said a UNC press release issued Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth general officer-level meeting since the two
sides restored talks in March 1998 aimed at reducing tension on
the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday morning's crossfire, the South Korean military
authorities have declared a state of emergency along the west
coast of the Korean peninsula and more than 20 South Korean naval
ships were pulled back south of the buffer zone except high-speed
patrol boats.

<P>
XINING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The former residence of Xerab Gyaco,
a prominent Buddhist and Tibetan language scholar, in northwest
China's Qinghai Province was recently designated a patriotic
education base.
</P>
<P>
The residence in Salar Autonomous County has a memorial hall
built by the provincial government to display garments and musical
instruments he used and manuscripts and photos.
</P>
<P>
Xerab Gyaco began to study Buddhist scriptures at a local

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Labor Market Improves Slightly in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's labor market
improved slightly in the first quarter of 1999 with retrenchments
moderating and job openings increasing.
</P>
<P>
Spokespersons of the Singapore Ministry of Manpower told a
press conference Tuesday that although total employment continued
to decline, retrenchments in the first quarter of 1999 moderated
to 3,402, markedly lower than the 6,500 to 8,000 reported in the
previous four quarters, and the number of job openings increased
to 16,774 from an all-time low of 12,630 in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment eased to 3.9 percent in March from 4.4 percent
three months ago and the ratio of job vacancy to unemployed person
has risen to 44 to 100 in March this year from 34 to 100 in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the lower retrenchment to the effect of
cost cutting measures adopted in November last year, the pickup in
the economy driven by manufacturing and the progress made in
carrying out the four "R" strategy, namely, renewal of workforce
through training, re-deployment of displaced workers, realignment
of work process and employment and revitalizing employment
creation through seeding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The spokespersons also noted that total employment fell by
9,622 in the first quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of net
job loss, and there were 65,900 persons unemployed in March.
</P>
<P>
On employment outlook, the ministry officials said although
unemployment has declined and employment prospect improved in some
industries, unemployment still remains high compared with
pre-crisis levels and employers in general would still be hesitant
in recruiting additional staff unless the improvement in output
demand can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that continued improvement in labor market can
only materialize if economic recovery is sustained.
</P>
<P>
Even if the economy has bottomed out it would take some time
for employment creation to reach pre-crisis level, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
uncovered a well-preserved wharf from the Northern Song Dynasty (
960-1127) in Suixi County in eastern China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The wharf was built in the village of Luizi which was on a 40-
km canal built during the Sui Dynasty (581-618) to transport grain
from southern China to northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Close to the wharf site, they also discovered two boats about
five meters below ground, one made out of wood timber and the
other of wood blocks. The boats, built in the Tang Dynasty (618-
907), could carry nearly three tons of goods and were used to
transport grain.
</P>
<P>
Further digging and research are underway, and the discoveries
are considered important for the study of commerce and culture
during Tang and Song (960-1279) dynasties.

<HEADLINE> Exports Of ROK-Funded Enterprises Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises funded by the Republic
of Korea in China's Shandong Province had 740 million U.S. dollars
worth of exports during the January-April period of this year, a
rise of 11.5 percent from the same period of 1997 prior to the
outbreak of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This means that the ROK-funded enterprises have increased
exports again after a frustrating period caused by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The increase has been attributed to a series of preferential
policies supporting these enterprises, like relatively simple
Customs procedures and increased export refunds.
</P>
<P>
Traditional commodities like aquatic products, tourist items,
bags, shoes, and toys still dominate local exports, while some
electronics products like TV sets, radios, and radio
telecommunications equipment saw a slight decrease during the
period.

<HEADLINE> GIC to Back Gulf Privatization Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait-based Gulf
Investment Corp. (GIC) has announced its intention to back
privatization schemes in Gulf states, aimed to diversify their
revenue sources and decrease government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case of Kuwait, which has announced plans to
introduce a health insurance scheme to replace its free health
care system, GIC said the economic climate resulting from the
decline in oil prices is expected to accelerate the previously
announced privatization programs in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to assist Gulf states, as they prepare for
privatization by structuring utilities into corporations, rather
than government agencies, as is the case with the Saudi
electricity provider," the investment group said in its annual
report.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has decided to create a single share-holding
company that will absorb all its existing electricity companies
as a possible prelude to privatization.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that economic uncertainties of 1999 will
create further opportunities for the GIC in financing the projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, GIC had invested in 31 projects as part of
its direct investment activities.

BEIRUT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri has launched a new Arabic-language newspaper which
pledges to "move beyond existing notions of opposition and
pro-government stances," the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 copies of Al Mustaqbal, or the Future, were
distributed across Lebanon and Syria on Monday, according to
Fouad Naim, an editorial official with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Within a few months we plan to print and distribute issues in
London, Frankfurt and possibly Saudi Arabia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page editorial, editor-in-chief al-Fadl Shalaq said
that the newspaper's main mission would be to broaden political
debate, adding that it would seek to avoid the tag of being
pro-government or anti-government.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a construction tycoon who accumulated his fortunes in
Saudi Arabia, served as the prime minister between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by veteran politician Salim Hoss last December
and was seen as the main opposition to the current government.
</P>
<P>
He owns shares in a number of other leading newspapers and also
owns Future Television and Paris-based Radio Orient.
</P>

He was always accused by Hoss as using his massive media to
launch anti-government campaign.

DALIAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Port in Northeast China's

eight-sq.km. part of a 20-sq.km. area congested by marine products,
according to Xiong Guowu, who is in charge of transport security.

The excessive growth of marine products for the past several
decades in the port area has reduced the size of the channel area
and the number of accidents there has been on the rise in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
The clearing project, which is expected to be completed by the
end of this year, is taking both the state's and fishermen's
interests into consideration.

Dalian is one of the first ports in China to open to foreign
countries and is one of the most important of 14 large ports in
the country. It handled up to 80 million tons of cargo last year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch Youth Empowerment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is soon to launch a
youth empowerment program at the village level to arrest a suicide
rate which is among the highest in the world, the Presidential
Task Force on Suicide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Provision of opportunities to young people to discuss problems
and seek guidance and counseling on the stresses and strains of
life could contribute toward the many reasons behind attempting
suicide," the task force said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The task force, appointed in 1997, has made a series of
recommendations, focusing on the welfare of young people.
</P>
<P>
The program is a collaborative venture of the task force, the
Ministry of Cultural and Religious Affairs, National Youth
Services Council and the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
</P>
<P>
It will seek to empower young people in the areas of economic,
physical and psychological, political, cultural and social
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
Cultural centers will be established in every Divisional
Secretariat Division equipped with all facilities to implement the
program.
</P>
<P>
A team of young graduates selected for the relevant areas will
be intensively trained to manage these centers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to guidance and counseling, special programs will
be introduced, including music, dancing, drama, photography, films
and video, painting and culture, research and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The resources persons for these subjects will be selected from
among school teachers and other competent persons.
</P>
<P>
It is eventually planned to bring in a system of computer
networking among all cultural centers so that data bases can be
compiled and information exchanged on relevant issues.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Decline in Bad Loans in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Non-performing loans in Thai banks
and other financial institutions continued to decline in April,
with 107.7 billion baht (2.91 billion U.S. dollars) debts
restructured, bringing the total of such loans to 383.6 billion
baht (10.4 billion dollars), the Bank of Thailand's statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans began falling in February, but the
proportion of bad debt in the financial system was still high at
42.06 percent, down slightly from 42.31 percent in March,
according to the statistics available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, said some 15,637
companies owing a total of 817 billion baht (22 billion dollars)
were still involved in restructuring talks as of April 30.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has grouped 351 of the largest debtors, which
together owe 677 billion baht (18.3 billion dollars), into a
special category because of the complexity of their cases.
</P>
<P>
To date, 86 companies with a loan principal of 193.7 billion
baht (5.2 billion dollars) had been processed.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said another group of 316 companies with large
loans would be required to sign preliminary agreements with their
creditors by next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The high volume of bad loans has been a major obstacle in
returning the country to economic health. Banks have been
reluctant to make new loans or to lower lending rates while so
much non-performing loans are still on their books.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had also targeted between 300 and 500
companies, each owing less than 100 million baht (2.7 million
dollars), for further restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said earlier that he was
satisfied with the positive trend of debt restructuring though he
would like to see the process speeded up.
</P>
<P>
He said the government saw no need to intervene and would leave
negotiations to be settled by those involved.
</P>
<P>
Most completed restructuring deals involve industrial, services
and property companies.

<HEADLINE> 4 out of 10 Bangladeshi Babies Born Underweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Four out of 10 babies born in
Bangladesh with low birth weight (LBW) and start their lives with
lower chance to survive until their first birthday, according to
an expert.
</P>
<P>
If they survive, they are likely to be stunned, to learn more
slowly and to be less productive as adults, the Financial Express
daily newspaper Tuesday quoted Milla Mclachlan, a World Bank
expert, as saying at a symposium on LBW here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cost of LBW, which means a newborn weighs less than 2,500
grams, in social and economic terms to Bangladesh is enormous, he
observed.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each child who grows up stunned will
produce 1,150 U.S. dollars less in his or her lifetime, he said,
adding that this means more than 10 billion dollars over a 10-year
period, as a whole, for Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the symposium revealed that about 50 percent of
children are born with the LBW problem in Bangladesh, where more
than 3 million infants are born every year.
</P>
<P>
These children have high rates of infectious disease,
malnutrition and growth failure including stunning and are
estimated to account for about one-third of deaths in the first
year of their lives, the experts said, adding that they are also
more likely to have abnormal cognitive development, neurological
impairment and poor school performance.
</P>
<P>
More evidence indicate that adults who are born at LBW are also
at great risk of morbidity and premature mortality from
cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes compared with
their normal birth weight counterparts, they further stated.
</P>
<P>
About 11.6 million infant deaths every year in developing
countries, of which 33-40 percent or 3.8 million to 4.6 million
infant deaths each year can be attributed to LBW, they stated,
considering that 3.2 kilograms as a standard weight for a newborn
baby in the context of the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Prevention of LBW in Bangladesh and India alone can save lives
of nearly 700,000 children, they said.
</P>
<P>
About 17 percent of all births worldwide are classified as low
birth weight, and more than 90 percent of the world LBW infants
are born in developing countries, of which almost two-thirds occur
in the South Asian nations of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Authorities Concerned Over Environmental Damage by NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian environment protection
authorities have expressed grave concerns over potential threats
facing the environment in the aftermath of NATO's bombardment of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a report published by the People's Voice newspaper on Monday,
the authorities claimed that NATO's air raids against Yugoslavia
have inflicted serious damage to the environment and that they are
closely following the potential impact on the Hungarian
environment.
</P>
<P>
The report said Hungarian environmental experts believe that
NATO's bombing of industrial installations such as oil refineries
and chemical plants in Yugoslavia caused the emission of thousands
of tons of harmful and possibly carcinogenic substances into the
air and may have caused "immeasurable damage" to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The report cited NATO's bombing of a chemical fertilizer plant
in the city of Pancsevo as an example. The content of poisonous
substance in the air was 10 times the normal level following the
destruction of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The experts claim that over the past month, competent Hungarian
authorities have been monitoring the air quality by measuring the
content of sulphides and heavy metals such as lead in the air at
the Hungary-Yugoslavia border.
</P>
<P>
Although some believe harmful substances were carried away by
the wind, the experts refuse to rule out the possibility of air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
They noted that some missiles used by NATO contain light
uranium whose radioactivity could spread thousands of kilometers.
The missiles not only pose a threat to human life, but also could
cause air pollution. The report said the missiles can turn areas
they pass through into non-arable zones.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Automobile Sales Soar in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's total vehicle sales in
May jumped 42.8 percent over the same month last year to 15,340
units, the highest growth rate in the first five months of this
year, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total sales for the period from January 1 to May 31 reached
65,609 units, an increase of 10 percent compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Every market segment played a significant role in the May
increase, the newspaper quoted Narongchai Siriratmanawong,
spokesman for Toyota Motor Thailand Co., as saying. Toyota is
doing statistics for the automobile industry of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Narongchai, one-ton pickup trucks accounted for 59
percent of all markets in May, with sales jumping 63.7 percent
year-on-year to 9,069 units.
</P>
<P>
Car sales achieved double-digit growth for the first time this
year, rising by 29 percent to 4,858 units.
</P>
<P>
The steadily improving sales since February had resulted from
better sales of commercial vehicles including pickups, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of commercial vehicles have risen steadily from the
beginning of this year, signaling the start of an economic
recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by Toyota showed that commercial vehicle sales
in May rose 50.3 percent year-on-year as an economic stimulus
package, which reduced the value-added tax from 10 percent to 7
percent, had started to increase consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
If vehicle sales continued at the current pace, Narongchai
said, total sales this year would top 200,000 units.

<HEADLINE> US. Senate Majority Leader Backs NTR Status for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate will back
President Bill Clinton's decision to extend normal trade relations
(NTR) with China for another year, Majority leader Trent lott said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lott made the remarks at a meeting of the National Association
of Manufacturers, one of the major business groups that voice
support not only for continued annual NTR status but also a
permanent one for China after Clinton made the decision on June 3.
</P>
<P>
Lott emphasized that even if the house vetoes the presidential
extension, it is unlikely for the Senate to take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
Under law, Clinton's decision would come into effect unless the
two chambers pass a joint motion of disapproval within 60 days
after the current trade status expires on July 3.
</P>
<P>
The majority leader pointed out that anti-China sentiments have
increased this year as a result of alleged Chinese espionage,
illegal campaign donation and NATO's bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "We have to recognize that China is a big player
in the world economy, and we have to trade with them."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has stood firm on the trade status issue while seeking
resumption of talks with Beijing to finalize an agreement on China
's access to the World Trade Organization this year. The
administration's efforts have gained mounting support from the
business community and many Congressmen despite severe anti-China
rhetoric on the Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, the Congress has debated annually on
the NTR -- formerly called most favored nation (MFN) status to
China, but never succeeded in defeating the presidential decision
to extend the trade status.

BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 53 million one-child
families have appeared in China since the government began the
family planning policy over 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As part of the favorable policies, one-child families in urban
areas are provided with a certain amount of government subsidies
every month before the children are 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, one-child families can receive double amounts
of farmland and land for house building, and the parents are more
likely to get a job in township enterprises. They are also
provided with endowment insurance and pay less for the children's
education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that most of the one-child families are found
in urban areas and some developed rural areas in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Many urban one-child families have spent what they can in order
to provide better education and living conditions for their
children. However, experts note that many children have developed
shortcomings such as a weak sense of independence and team-work.
Some have even developed psychological problems.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Torpedo Boat Sunken After Crossfire: Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A torpedo boat of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was hit and sunken by South
Korean Navy in the Yellow Sea on Tuesday morning after an exchange
of fire for 10 minutes, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a DPRK patrol boat was targeted but it retreated to
the North side.
</P>
<P>
Three DPRK torpedo boats and two patrol vessels crossed the
Northern Limit Line (NLL) around 9:25 a.m. Tuesday and entered the
buffer zone off the west coast of South Korea's Yongyong Islands,
the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK torpedo boat which was sunken fired at and damaged one
of the South Korean patrol ships which were trying to block the
incursion of the DPRK military ships, it alleged.
</P>
<P>
It was the first exchange of fire between the two sides after
an eight-day military standoff in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean tension began Monday last week after several
DPRK patrol boats reportedly crossed the NLL escorting fishing
boats and entered the buffer zone every day.
</P>
<P>
South Korea regards the buffer zone, set up south of the
Northern Limit Line after the 1950-1953 Korean War, as its
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPRK does not recognize the existence of the
buffer zone and claims jurisdiction over the area, arguing that
the 1953 armistice agreement does not stipulate a maritime border
line between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's firing incident took place as general officers' talks
are going on at Panmunjom between the Korean People's Army and the
U.S. army.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, the DPRK side lodged "strong protest with the U.S.
military side against military provocations being committed by
South Korean naval vessels in the north side's territorial waters
off the west coast of Korea," the Korea Central News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
As tension escalates between the two sides, South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's "sunshine policy" of engagement with the
DPRK has come under strong criticism again over recent days.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Attracting High-Tech Personnel From Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has given the
green light to high-tech professionals who want to settle in the
city no matter where they are from.
</P>
<P>
The move, aimed to attract more talented personnel to
contribute to the development of Beijing, is also deemed as a
breakthrough in the registered permanent residence system.
</P>
<P>
A recent municipal government circular says that anybody with a
university degree and above who hopes to work in a Beijing-based
high-tech company or regional headquarters of a transnational
corporation can apply for a contemporary residential card, and
after three years, they can apply for a permanent residence permit.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, those with overseas education
background are especially welcome.
</P>
<P>
Under China's registered permanent residence system, people who
move to live in other places without an official permanent
residence permit have to face problems in education, social
welfare and employment.
</P>
<P>
Settling down in Beijing is particularly difficult due to its
status as the national capital and increasing population and
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has over 6,000 high-tech companies including 1,100
involving foreign investment. The city has made a decision that
development of the high-tech industry should be the engine of the
local economy.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
issued a directive prohibiting all state organizations from
involving in tobacco or alcohol-related advertisements and
sponsorships, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the government has issued instructions to ministries
in this regard after accepting recommendations of the Presidential
Task Force on Tobacco, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who won the World Health
Organization's Tobacco Free Award last month for her efforts to
curb smoking in Sri Lanka, set up the task force shortly after
being elected as president in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 30 million rupees (424,000 U.S.
dollars) to the Ministry of Sports for conducting national sports
activities which used to be funded by tobacco and liquor
companies, the country's biggest tax payers and sponsors of
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
Smoking and the sale of cigarettes have been banned in all
government institutions since the end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
However, pressure from the tobacco industry has delayed Sri
Lanka's plans to ban alcohol and cigarette advertising on radio,
television and print media from the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to establish a National Authority on
Tobacco and Alcohol to coordinate and implement the national
policy.
</P>
<P>
A master plan on combating illicit drugs and illicit liquor
prepared by the task force is being implemented by the police,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A recently-created unit at the Presidential Secretariat will be
coordinating and monitoring all activities before the National
Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol is established after legislation
is presented in the parliament this August.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Open Airspace for Russian Peacekeepers After Agreement Inked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will open its airspace to
Russian peacekeepers for Kosovo after NATO and Russia agree on
joint command and control of the peacekeeping forces, known as
KFOR, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova told the press
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova said that according to the Resolution of the U.N.
Security Council adopted on June 10, the international security
presence with substantial NATO participation should be under "
unified command and control."
</P>
<P>
Such a NATO-Russia joint command will prevent any risks of a
partition of Kosovo. Only thus can the Balkans be prevented from
Balkanization, from being partitioned into zones of influence, She
noted.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister observed that this has been Bulgaria's
consistent stand since the very beginning of the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Play Role in Presidential Election: Wiranto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI)
Commander General Wiranto has rejected calls for the military
representatives in the parliament to abstain from voting in the
November presidential election, national newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to increasing calls from military observers for TNI
to refrain from involvement in the next presidential election,
Wiranto argued that the military held equal rights with other
factions in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The military has been allotted 38 unelected seats in the House
of Representatives, whose members also serve in the MPR.
</P>
<P>
All the appointed military legislators will vote for the best
presidential candidate for the country, whether he or she is
nominated by major or minor political parties, Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Applying equal rights is part of an effort to eliminate
discriminatory treatment against a certain group in the parliament
as such discrimination means "killing the democracy itself," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar Party, former President Soeharto's political
vehicle, has named incumbent President B.J. Habibie to contest the
November election, challenging other leading presidential hopefuls
like Megawati Soekarnoputri (chairwoman of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle) and Abdurrahman Wahid (founder of
the National Awakening Party).
</P>
<P>
Asked if the military would support Megawati's nomination for
the presidency, Wiranto said the most important issue is that the
elected president fits TNI's criteria as "the nation's best
offspring."
</P>
<P>
TNI's criteria for the next president is the ability to cope
with the economic and political crises and maintain national unity
and acceptability to all parties.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the president's sex has been increasingly
sensitive with the candidacy of Megawati. Some public figures have
stated that a woman should not be permitted to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) Kwik Kian Gie said in Depok, West Java, that the
party supporters as well as cadres would understand if Megawati
was not elected president in the planned November general session
of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
"Cadres and supporters of PDI-P understand the regulations that
the highest power in the land lies in the hands of the MPR," Kwik
Kian Gie was quoted by The Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the latest tally showed that the PDI-P is expected to hold
its lead, scores of parties have now set their sights on the PDI-P
for a future coalition.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results collected by the official
Antara News Agency from provincial chapters of the Indonesian
Election Committee, the PDI-P with 25.3 million votes left the
other 47 political parties behind, accounting for 33.55 percent of
the total votes counted as of Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here are of the opinion that horse-trading and
political haggling are now high on the agendas of parties, with
the main players being the PDI-P, the National Awakening Party,
Golkar, the United Development Party and the National Mandate
Party.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie, meanwhile, said Megawati is yet to make a
decision concerning the establishment of a coalition.

<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
revoked an order to remove from the shelves all meat, poultry,
eggs and milk products imported from the Netherlands, France and
Germany, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin quoted officials of the country's Health
Department and Food Bureau as saying the government made the
decision on Monday following the issuance of certification by the
three European countries that their goods are free of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said that only products from Belgium
produced since January 15, 1999, are not allowed in all
supermarkets, duty-free shops and other outlets as they have a
high probability of contamination.
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door meeting Monday, the government together
with food manufacturers and importers agreed to withdraw from the
market all food products imported from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers were also ordered to refrain from disbursing
these products if the same source is indicated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez has instructed
the Health Department to purchase needed equipment to help
identify dioxin content in biological products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urban Youth More Open to Personal Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
Chinese urban youth have become more inclined to accept pre-
nuptial sexual relations and extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first of its kind in China, was conducted by
the China Youth and Children Research Center and China Youth
Development Foundation during September and October last year. It
polled some 6,500 14-28 year olds from all walks of life in 27
provinces, municipalities and cities, 47.8 percent were male and
52.2 percent female.
</P>
<P>
Some 35.1 percent of the surveyed hold that pre-nuptial sexual
relations are immoral and should be inhibited, while 32.2 percent
agree that such relations are the natural outcome of love, and 20.
2 percent agree that such relations are acceptable if the two
people involved have no objection.
</P>
<P>
About 33.9 percent believe that extra-marital affairs should be
condemned and punished, but a higher 34.4 percent think that such
affairs were not blameworthy if the two involved have applied for
divorce or have been in poor relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a massive 62.9 percent think that couples should
keep their activities private.
</P>
<P>
Though pre-nuptial property agreement has only recently emerged
in China, about 52.4 percent of those surveyed agree with it.
</P>
<P>
Most urban youth still choose to get married and then have
babies. Only 11.9 percent prefer to be celibate.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Says Mobile Phones Free of Virus Infliction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar posts and
telecommunications authorities have said the use of digital mobile
phones in the country is safe in the wake of the recent infliction
of computer virus in some countries.
</P>
<P>
"No damage has been found in the mobile communication network
of Myanmar or that of the neighboring countries," The New Light of
Myanmar newspaper Tuesday quoted the state-run Myanmar Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the MPT warned domestic digital mobile phone users
that mobile phones can be damaged through infliction of computer
virus.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar introduced the cellular mobile phone system in 1995 and
by the end of March 1998, the number of such phones reached 8,947.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities have planned to add 20,000 cellular
phones in Yangon this year to boost the city's local and
international direct dialing capacity.

<HEADLINE> Children-Burnt Accidents Rise in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The amount of children-burnt
accidents in Chile  jumped from 50,000 in 1997 to 160,000 in 1998,
according to statistics published by the Chilean Society of Burns
(CSB) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that 10 percent of the burnt children are
needing intensive care, and 42 percent are between two and five
years old, the majority being boys.
</P>
<P>
The accidents mostly happen between 6 and 8 p.m. when families
normally get together having coffee or a meal, said CSB.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicated that 59 percent of the burnt accidents
were caused by spilling of hot liquids, and 27.7 percent were
attributed to accidents of ovens, while only 5.5 percent of the
children-burnt accidents occurred because of the fire.
</P>
<P>
CSB President Mario Hitschfeld said the first CSB congress will
be held during this week, which is very important not only for the
professional workers in this field, but also for all the other
social assistants, such as nurses, nutritionists, psychologists
and occupational therapists as well.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Women's Singles Coach Resigns From Badminton Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian women's singles coach
Retno Kustijah officially resigned from the National Badminton
Center on Monday, The Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retno said she resigned because she wanted to focus more of her
attention on her club Jaya Raya, where she felt more needed.
</P>
<P>
"I think the club needs me more than the center. However, I
have brought my players to the international stage," she said.
</P>
<P>
Retno, better known as Kus, once coached the 1996 Olympic
silver medalist Mia Audina, world No. 7 Cindana Hartono and a
newcomer Yuli Marfuah.
</P>
<P>
Since Mia and Cindana joined the 1998 Uber Cup team, Retno had
only three athletes. They are juniors Yeni Dyah, Melissa Dewi and
Yuli.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) decided early
this month to expel both Yeni and Melissa due to their stagnant
achievements in international junior events.
</P>
<P>
But Yuli was promoted to the seniors, under supervision of
coach Liang Chiusia, due to her victory in the 1999 Singapore
satellite.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source as saying that Retno was unsatisfied
with the training system in the center as she had only three
athletes while Liang Chiusia had five. The source also said Retno
had just one court to practice on while Liang Chiusia had three.
</P>
<P>
Retno, who partnered with Minarni to win the 1962 and 1966
Asian Games gold medals, said she had handed her resignation
letter to center training director Christian Hadinata on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Christian denied that he had received a resignation letter
from Retno.
</P>
<P>
"She didn't tell me she would resign. She only said she wanted
to concentrate on her club. I told her to make an official
resignation to the chairman," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata also said he had
not yet received a resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
Retno, who along with Minarni, won Indonesia's first women's
doubles title in the 1968 All England competition. Retno's
assistant Lany also resigned following Retno's decision.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Forest Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A new campaign kicks off today
where Chinese forestry authorities join hands with more than 150
media in the nationwide, cross-century drive to increase
protection of forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
The media will concentrate its news coverage on exposing
illicit activities and individuals running forestry resources. It
is a bid to hold back the rising tide of these crimes.
</P>
<P>
The joint action will focus on other malpractices: reclaiming
land for farming by damaging forestry lands and rampant poachers
of wild animals, officials for the State Forestry Administration
said Monday, quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The action is expected to push forward national eco-
environmental construction, the protection of China's precious
forestry resources, and particularly, the preservation of China's
natural forests.
</P>
<P>
China's forest coverage rate is less than 14 percent, or only
half of the world's average.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Defend Copa America without Romario and Edmundo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will defend the Copa
America trophy without Edmundo and Romario, according to the squad
announced by coach Wanderley Luxemburgo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo, explaining his decision to leave the duo out, said
that discipline had been a major factor when he decided on the men
to appear in the tournament in Paraguay next month.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Romario and Edmundo was unexpected because
Romario had scored 25 goals for Flamengo since the start of the
year and Edmundo, back at Vasco da Gama, was thought to have a new
chance.
</P>
<P>
Eight players from last year's World Cup have been recalled,
including Ronaldo. Following is the squad:
</P>
<P>
Goalkeepers: Dida (Lugano), Carlos Germano (Vasco da Gama).

<P>
SOFIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO's fifth Maneuver in the
Cooperative Partner series, also the third hosted by Bulgaria,
started Monday near the Black Sea city of Varna.
</P>
<P>
The maritime war games, scheduled to last 14 days, are intended
to coordinate goals and objectives and establish uniform
requirements for operational capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Four NATO member states, France, Greece, Turkey and the United
States, and three partner countries, Georgia, Romania and Bulgaria,
participated in the exercises, while Azerbaijan and Albania sent
observers.
</P>
<P>
"The Alliance believes this type of exercises to be extremely
important despite the considerable decrease in the size of present
exercises," Colonel Robert Wesley, director of the exercises and
chief of the allied headquarters, told a news conference Monday
that "the considerable decrease in scale is due to the withdrawal
of NATO marine units to other parts in connection with operations
in Kosovo," he explained, adding that two U.S., one Greek and one
Turkish ship were expected to replace them.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine announced Monday morning that it would not send its two
ships, and gave no reason for the pullout.

<HEADLINE> Sampras and Hingis Named Wimbledon Top Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete Sampras,
fresh from retaining the world number one position, was named top
men's seed for Wimbledon tennis championships on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, bidding to win a record sixth singles title, won the
London grasscourt championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, also the world number one, headed the women's
seedings.
</P>
<P>
Defending women's champion Jana Novotna, still injured after
spraining her ankle at the French Open, was seeded according to
her ranking -- fifth.
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, who beat Switzerland's Hingis in the French Open
final, was seeded second, one better than her ranking, as she bids
for her eighth singles title at the world's most prestigious
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Pat Rafter was seeded second in the men's singles
behind Sampras, who regained the world number one spot from
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The American has won five of the last six Wimbledon titles and
needs one more to become the most successful men's singles player
at the championships this century.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Andre Agassi, who won the French Open title in
stunning style earlier this month, was seeded fourth, his current
ranking, behind Kafelnikov for the two-week championships starting
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Wimbledon did not faithfully follow the rankings when they
named the 32 seeds for the singles.
</P>
<P>
They downgraded clay court specialists such as Carlos Moya and
Gustavo Kuerten and pushed Goran Ivanisevic, three times a
Wimbledon finalist, up the seedings ladder.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Kuerten, ranked seventh in the world, was made 11th
seed while Spaniard Moya, another French Open champion, dropped
two places below his ranking to 12th.
</P>
<P>
There was no place for eighth-ranked Alex Corretja. It was
unclear whether the Spaniard had pulled out of the championships
like world number nine Marcelo Rios of Chile, said to be suffering
from a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Ivanisevic was seeded five places above his world
ranking at 10th -- he lost last year's final in five sets to
Sampras. Another big server, Mark Philippoussis of Australia, was
seeded seventh compared with his ranking of 11.
</P>
<P>
Graf's grass pedigree and heroics in Paris where she beat
Hingis in a controversial French Open final saw the German
promoted above third-seeded American Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
The women's seedings followed the rankings more closely, except
that Nathalie Tauziat, who last year became the first French woman
to reach a Wimbledon final since 1925, swapped places with
compatriot Mary Pierce to become eighth seed.
</P>
<P>
Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo has withdrawn, organisers said,
allowing Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, a semifinalist last year, to
be named 16th and last seed.

BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation is no longer a
campaign confined to the government and the poor, and young urban
professionals are helping fight the problem.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 young volunteers, mostly successfully teachers,
doctors and engineers, have answered the Chinese Communist Youth
League's (CCYL) call since last year.
</P>
<P>
These selfless people have temporarily put aside their careers
to combat poverty in 50 poor countries.
</P>
<P>
They have been living on modest subsidies provided by the
government and some enterprises, and have introduced new ideas and
technology to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The number of volunteers will reach 3,000 in 150 counties, by
the end of the year, said Bayin Chaolu, member of CCYL's central
committee secretariat, quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy's Main Parties Lose Support in European Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Italy's main four parties which
have dominated Italian politics in recent years all lost support
in the European Parliament (EP) elections of last Sunday,
according to the final results of the votes issued Monday by
Italian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Left Democrats party of the ruling center-left coalition
slipped from 19.1 percent in the 1994 European vote to around 17.4
percent this time, winning 15 EP seats of the Italian parties'
total 87 seats in the Strasburg-based Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The other key party in the ruling center-left coalition, the
People's Party, crashed from 10 percent in 1994 to around 4.2
percent this time.
</P>
<P>
Forza Italia, the opposed center-right party of Italian media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi, emerged as the winner of Sunday's vote
with about 25.2 percent, compared to 20 percent in the last
national elections.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Forza Italia's vote was still a step back from
the 30 percent it won five years ago in the European Parliament
Election with followed Berlusconi's election as prime minister
after his lightning entry into politics.
</P>
<P>
National Alliance, Berlusconi's main ally in the opposition
Freedom Front, scored about 10.3 percent lower than 1994's 12.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The big winners from the Sunday's vote were the Democrats party
newly formed by European Commission president-designate Romano
Prodi.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, led by former anti-graft prosecutor Antonio di
Pietro and Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli, pulled in about 7.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Democrats had probably taken many of their
votes from the Left Democrats and People's Party electorate, both
of whom opposed the birth of Prodi's creation.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Minister Massimo D'Alema of the Left Democrats
Party said Monday that "the result confirmed its pre-eminence in
the center-left and would not be a cause of instability in the
governing coalition".
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also said the center-left parties supporting his
government had won over 40 percent of the vote, a threshold which
opposition leader Berlusconi had predicted it would not meet.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi had said D'Alema should resign if his coalition was
beaten by the opposition center- right alliance.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema ruled this out and said his administration had the
right to stay in power until the end of the legislature in 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. First Lady Starts Fund Raising for Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton is setting up a New York bank account to raise money for
the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
Harold Ickes, advisor to Mrs. Clinton, said Monday he was not
certain how much money had already arrived from early donators but
that an account would be established early this week to take care
of it.
</P>
<P>
Ickes said that checks didn't begin arriving until last week.
"She hasn't done anything in terms of making fund-raising calls
yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ickes said he expected Mrs. Clinton to begin those calls in
early July, shortly after she creates her Senate exploratory
committee.
</P>
<P>
Terence Mcauliffe, President Clinton's chief fund-raiser in
1996, will head the first lady's money-raising effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the first lady needs 15 million dollars
to 20 million dollars to run for the Senate seat being vacated
by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton, who is the first lady to run for the Senate,
will possibly compete with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
Creation of an exploratory committee allows a prospective
candidate to raise and spend money for campaign-like purposes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Interest Rates Rise in Treasury Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Interest rates on
short-term securities rose in Treasury auction Monday to the
highest level in roughly 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department sold 7.50 billion dollars in
three-month bills at a discount rate of 4.620 percent, up from
4.510 percent last week. Another 7.51 billion dollars in six-month
bills were sold at a rate of 4.855 percent, up from 4.760 percent.
</P>
<P>
The three-month rate was the highest since September 21, 1998, when
the bills brought 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the
highest since August 24, 1998, when the rate was 4.940.
</P>
<P>
The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors -- 4.753 percent for three-month bills with a 10,000
dollars bill selling for 9,883.20 dollars and 5.059 percent for a
six-month bill selling for 9,754.60 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, jumped to 5.12
percent last week from 5.08 percent in the previous week.

Market fears about higher interest rates were eased by Federal
Reserves Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin's comment on inflation.
Rivlin said inflation worries in the United States are
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Investors got worried about higher inflation and interest
rates after the Federal Reserve warned last month that it would
raise interest rates if inflation was building up in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserves Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before a
congressional committee did not have a big effect on the market
although private economists viewed his remarks as hinting at
interest rate increases in the future. Greenspan said technology
has changed business productivity but the gains from technology
can't go on forever.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese intervention in the global currency markets
pushed bond prices higher and its yields lower, making stocks
more attractive to investors. The Japanese government bought
U.S. dollars to slow the advance of the Japanese yen,

But Internet shares were weak on sensitive to higher
interest rates, pulling Nasdaq index lower.

NYSE volume declined to 667.30 million shares from 687
