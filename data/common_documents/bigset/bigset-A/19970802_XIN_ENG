<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Explains Market Access Offers to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
explained China's market access offers to WTO members at the fifth
meeting of the Working Party on China's Accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, China's chief trade representative and vice
foreign trade minister, said the Chinese side has once again
revised several annexes to the Accession Protocol and further
enhanced the transparency of its foreign trade regime after a
series of difficult coordination at home.
</P>
<P>
"The firm political commitment of the Chinese government to a
early accession to the WTO has been translated into concrete
actions" in the current round of negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's market access offers have been
substantially improved in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
- The Chinese government has decided to give up the right to
reintroduce export subsidies for agricultural products. This is a
new and major contribution the Chinese government has made to
strengthening the world multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
- The Chinese government has decided to make drastic and
cross-the-board reduction of the phase-out schedule of non-tariff
measures (NTMs).
</P>
<P>
China is prepared to shorten the phase-out period for 86 items
from the original 12 years to eight years which include
automobiles and auto parts, and has proposed maximum reduction of
the phase-out schedule of the remaining NTMs.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth elimination of the NTMs, China has also
proposed annual growth rates of the quota volume, ranging from 8
percent to 12 percent, during the transition, which will provide
foreign suppliers of automobile, other machinery and electronic
products of all WTO members with a gradually expanding market
access opportunity.
</P>
<P>
- Regarding tariffs, China has held tariff negotiations with
nearly 20 WTO members before this Working Party meeting. In the
course of such negotiations, the Chinese side has made progress
with all members to a different extent, and major progress with
some of them.
</P>
<P>
China has substantially improved its offers to all negotiating
partners, tabled the harmonized tariff proposal for over 2000
chemical and textile products, and further improved offers on auto
and auto parts, paper and paper products, some electrical home
appliances and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Once its tariff concession proposal comes into force, China's
overall average tariff level will be lower than the 15-percent
average tariff level already announced by the Chinese government.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas will leave here Saturday morning for Phnom Penh to meet
with Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, an official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official disclosed that Alatas' main mission
is to exchange views with Hun Sen on political crisis in that
country, but he did not elaborate on the topics they will discuss.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn and Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon will
also go to Phnom Penh tomorrow to meet with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
As representatives of ASEAN, the three foreign ministers had
met with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen separately last month in a bid to
help end the conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) now groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Cambodia was delayed to enter the
grouping because of political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said earlier that ASEAN will never interfere in
Cambodia's internal affairs. He said if one of the two warring
factions opposed the ASEAN efforts, ASEAN will stop its mediation.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also said an agreement between the two warring factions,
namely, Cambodian People's Party led by Hun Sen and the FUNCINPEC
led by Norodom Ranariddh, plays a significant role in ending the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Former British MPs Criticized by Parliament Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Four former British Conservative
MPs were criticized today by the Commons Standards Committee of
the British parliament.
</P>
<P>
The committee said former minister Tim Smith was found to have
accepted at least 18,000 pounds (29,500 U.S. dollars) from Mohamed
Al-Fayed, owner of upmarket London store Harrods, but had failed
adequately to declare he was working for Al-Fayed in the register
of MPs' interests.
</P>
<P>
The money was judged to have been in return for lobbying
services, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
It also recorded a similar verdict against Sir Michael Grylls, who
retired after 27 years as an MP at the May 1 election, saying he
had "deliberately misled" a Committee on Members' Interests about
lobbying fees he had received.
</P>
<P>
Two other former MPs, Michael Brown and Sir Andrew Bowden, were
less severely censured. Bowden has apologized for failing to
register an election donation of 5,319 pounds from lobbyist Ian
Greer.

<HEADLINE> Business Liquidations Up in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Business liquidations
increased 23 percent for the second quarter of this year as high
interest rates, a contraction of spending and the globalization
of the South African economy took their toll.
</P>
<P>
However, figures released by the Central Statistical Service
(CSS) showed that the sharp rise in liquidations was offset by a
9 percent drop in insolvencies for three months until May,
the local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CSS figures indicated that about 850
corporations and companies had been placed under final
liquidation compared with 690 for the second quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
There were 607 insolvencies during the period of March to May,
compared with 666 for the same period last year, said the CSS. It
added that the figure for insolvencies refers only to the number
of individuals and partnerships under final sequestration, not
the total number of people involved.
</P>
<P>
The general trend was a sideways movement, despite short-term
fluctuations, and the rising numbers of compulsory liquidations
of companies were still behind the upward trend, CSS said.
</P>
<P>
The number of voluntary liquidations fell 10 percent, owing to
a 20.9 percent drop in voluntary liquidations of closed
corporations.
</P>
<P>
Compulsory liquidations, however, increased 8.9 percent as
against the first quarter, it added.

<P>
ANKARA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A remote-control car bomb
exploded in central Anatolia today, wounding four people in a
prison vehicle heading for court, a Turkish official said.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Kirsehir Deputy
Governor Osman Gurbuz as saying that the bomb was detonated when
the armored prison vehicle passed a car parked on a road near the
town of Akpinar.
</P>
<P>
Gurbuz said two soldiers, a driver and a prisoner were wounded
in the explosion, as the soldiers were accompanying eight accused
Islamic militants to a hearing in the capital of Ankara, some 180
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were accused of causing a hotel fire in 1993
which killed 37 intellectuals in Sivas, central Turkey.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the attack. The defendants
have been taken back to a Kirsehir prison by another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large-scale operation was launched by the
government in a bid to capture troublemakers in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Floods Hit Grains Production in Central Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The severe flooding in central
Europe will significantly reduce grains production in the
countries of that area, according to the British newspaper The
Financial Times today.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and
Romania have suffered worst flooding for many years, which has
caused enormous damage to farming of those countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a grains specialist as saying, "It's too early
to say exactly how much the harvests will be affected in terms of
quantity, but it's absolutely clear that their quality will be
seriously damaged."
</P>
<P>
The International Grains Council (IGC) published its latest
world grains estimates for the current season, and revised
downwards its forecasts for central Europe.
</P>
<P>
The IGC now projects wheat production for the region will be
down by 1.5 million tons, to 32.4 million tons; at the start of
July its estimate was 33.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduced figure will still be considerably higher
than the 26.3 million tons harvested in 1996, according to some
grains specialists.
</P>
<P>
Poland, which along with eastern Germany has been the most
badly affected part of the region, is now forecast to see its
wheat crop reduced by 300,000 tons, to 7.9 million tons compared
with 8.5 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poland imported 1.8 million tons of wheat last year, and the
IGC was anticipating before the floods that it would import no
more than 500,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
But with some 140,000 hectares of grain fields swamped in its
southern and south-western areas, most analysts believe that
Poland's wheat imports will eventually match if not outstrip last
year's.
</P>
<P>
One specialist said he now anticipated overall losses of as
much as 2 million tons from the region, but added that this
figure was being constantly revised in light of the continuing
floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today condemned the terrorist acts in Jerusalem which took place
Wednesday and claimed 15 lives of innocent people, the Itar-Tass
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called the latest terrorist acts in Jerusalem a tragedy
and expressed condolences to families of the deceased and wounded.
</P>
<P>
He said that he sent a special letter to the Israeli
leadership, asking them to bring his condolences to each family.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin noted that he favors Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat's decision to arrest the leaders
of the main terrorist groups, one of which, in Yeltsin's opinion,
is responsible for the committed "unheard-of terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that his recent talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat have confirmed that the two sides
are divided by sharp difference.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a Jewish settlement is inconsistent with
the Land for Peace principle guiding the Middle East peace
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters that Israelis have not started
settling on lands in Arab areas of Jerusalem, although the two
sides proclaimed the slogan "Peace in exchange of Land."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," he said, "if they left lands, it could be possible
to sign a peace treaty."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Tourism Earns More in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
earned 322 million U.S. Dollars from 326,194 tourists who visited
the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Presenting budget estimates for her Ministry for 1997/98
fiscal year at the National Assembly in Dodoma, central Tanzania
today, Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Zakia Meghji, said
that this was 24.3 percent increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that the tourism growth trend was small in
comparison with the vast variety of tourism attractions available
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the small tourism market to poor
infrastructure, particularly roads which leads to the northern
tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, she said, Tanzania is not easily accessible by
tourists markets abroad due to very few international airlines
flying to Tanzania, compared to the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said the government has prepared an intergrated tourism
master plan aimed at promoting the sector. She said the first
phase of the program to start this year would involve development
of the tourist circuits.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies for developing the coastal belt as well as
historical buildings for tourism would also be undertaken in this
phase, the minister said, adding that the European Union has
pledged to provide fund for this phase.

<HEADLINE> Free Food Distribution System in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U. N. World Food Program
(WFP) today announced that a major operation of free food rations
distribution in the refugee-ridden Rwanda has been completed,
catering for large numbers of refugees.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here, WFP said that since the end of
January 1997, about 1.2 million Rwandan refugees have been
receiving a food basket monthly for food resettlement rations.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the agricultural production systems
would be the main tasks this year, according to WFP.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, more than one million Rwandan refugees
started returning home from camps in former Zaire and Tanzania,
said the news release, adding that in view of the developments,
WFP worked out a six-month free food rations program.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to help refugees quickly return to
their home villages, and rebuild their homes and rehabilitate
their farms, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that WFP planned to focus its operations in
Rwanda for the remaining time of 1997 on the rehabilitation of
the agricultural production systems and destroyed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Areas which are prone to drought and crop failure will
continue to receive a large share of food assistance, it added.

According to recent WFP Crop and Food Supply estimates, the
total crop production in Rwanda will increase only marginally
while it will have to feed 1.6 million more people this year than
last year due to the influx of returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
The WFP report predicted that the output of pulses, which is
the main source of protein for most Rwandans, for this season is
expected to fall by 25 percent compared with last season.
</P>
<P>
The release said that some 450,000 Rwandans would continue to
be assisted through WFP food-for-work projects.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Ready for Second Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side is ready
to go to Switzerland for the second round of U.N.-led direct
talks, government spokesman Manolis Christofides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the spokesman expressed the hope that
the Turkish Cypriot side will also respond positively and there
will be good will and cooperation toward a settlement of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash held their first round of face-to-face talks under the
U.N. auspices near New York from July 9-12 and agreed to continue
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Few days ago, however, Denktash warned that he would not attend
the second round of direct talks, scheduled for August 11 to 16 in
Switzerland, after the European Union reaffirmed last month a
decision to begin considering Cyprus' EU membership early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Denktash will announce his final decision
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the National Council, the top advisory body
to the President on the Cyprus problem, will meet next Thursday to
discuss a U.N. document presented to the two sides by Special
Advisor of the U.N. Secretary-General on Cyprus, Diego Cordovez,
during the first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "irrespective of progress to be made in
Switzerland, the question of missing persons should be resolved."
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were unaccounted for
after Turkey landed more than 30,000 troops on the eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash agreed Thursday to work together to end
the file of those listed as missing, Greek and Turkish Cypriots,
by exchanging information on the location of graves and, to the
best extent possible, have the remains of those dead returned to
their families.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President Voices Concern over Stalemated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine
Ben Ali today voiced deep concern over the stalemated Middle East
peace process caused by the Israeli settlement policy inside and
outside Jerusalem, the Tunisia-Africa News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the symposium of the
Tunisian overseas ambassadors and head of diplomatic missions,
the president urged the international community to take speedy
and decisive actions in order to save the regional peace process
and ward off the dangers facing the region.
</P>
<P>
The actions should ensure the restoration of the legitimate
rights of the Palestinian people and the establishment of its
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
These actions should also ensure the restoration of the
occupied Syrian and Lebanese territories, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the EU-Mideast dialogue, the Tunisian president said
that its actual take-off and success require settling the Middle
East dispute on the one hand and achieving the balance of
interests, solidarity and equal partnership on the other.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue should deal with all issues on the future of the
EU-Mideast region and not stop at the security dimension, so as
to consolidate the mutual trust, understanding and coordination
among all countries of the region, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
The annual symposium of the Tunisian heads of diplomatic and
consular missions opened last Wednesday here under the title "the
diplomatic action at the service of economic development."

<HEADLINE> Ousted S. Leonean President Condemns Junta's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah today condemned the decision of the military
junta to stay in power for four years and accused politicians of
manipulating the regime.
</P>
<P>
"This is an affront to all lovers of democracy and smacks of
hostility," Kabbah said on a clandestine, anti-junta radio station
broadcasting in the capital Freetown, quoted by a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Military ruler Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who seized power in
the May 25 coup that toppled Kabbah's elected government,
announced on Wednesday that the junta "will not hand over power
to a civilian government" until presidential election is held in
November 2001.
</P>
<P>
His announcement immediately led to the collapse of the peace
talks in session in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, between junta
delegates and the Committee of Four, made up of foreign ministers
of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The committee represents the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to bid for reinstating Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's new position also incurred condemnation from the
Commonwealth which suspended Sierra Leone's membership last month
as well as "deep concern" of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are bent on destroying the country would themselves
be destroyed," warned Kabbah in the broadcast, who has been in
Guinea since the coup.
</P>
<P>
"They will be hunted down even if they hide in rat holes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said the junta had adopted a "defiant and
uncompromising stand" because of advice from certain politicians
who "are manipulating the soldiers and urging them to stay in
power. But they shall not succeed".
</P>
<P>
He accused the politicians of "inciting the military to seize
power and promising them that the international community would
recognize them".
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Four earlier asked the Koroma regime
to hand over power to Kabbah's government or it would employ
embargo or even force to oust the military junta.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts noted it could be difficult to reach a
consensus among west African countries on ways to deal with
Koroma. Ghana has announced its aversion to the use of force in
resolving the Sierra Leone crisis. Cote d'Ivoire is reported in
similar view.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koroma has said the ruling Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, the highest governing body set up after
the coup, is "ready to defend the sovereignty of Sierra Leone to
the last drop of its blood".
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the blockade by the ECOWAS peace-keeping
force has resulted in short supply of foodstuffs and drugs in the
troubled west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Four has called for a tightening of economic
sanctions to force the step-down of the junta after the collapse
of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nigerians Turn to Worms for Cheap Protein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Some residents in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, have found a substitute for hard-to-come-by protein
in caterpillar worms as the hairy crawlers are now ready diet for
them, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Scores of youths and the elderly can now be seen in open
fields collecting the worms, attracting the attention of curious
passers-by within the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The worms caught are either for sell at the market or for
consumption in homes of these cash-strapped residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the worms sell for
about 50 Naira (some 0.59 U.S. dollar) per kilogram, as against
180 Naira (about 2.11 dollars) per kilogram of meat in the
market.
</P>
<P>
It said residents in Abuja started eating the worms "in
retaliation" for the destructive activity of the insects, which
usually invade farmlands and eat up the green leaves, thereby
decimating yields.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an old woman seen collecting the worms as
saying that the worms were "very good when cooked with
vegetables" and the people in the area had eaten worms for
decades without any serious side effect.
</P>
<P>
"The worms provide our home with 'meat' since we do not have
the money to buy real meat or fish," she said, adding that "my
soup now tastes better with the worms."
</P>
<P>
The old woman also made a little money from the sales of the
warms at the market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the worms are already finding favor
with the non-indigenous who have also ventured into having a
taste of the boneless worms if only to provide a cheap substitute
to meat that they could hardly afford now.
</P>
<P>
However, the booming worms business may soon crash as
excessive downpour drives the worms into hibernation, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Wants Russian Peacekeepers to Stay in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze today expressed the hope that the Russian
peacekeepers will continue to tackle the issue in the Abkhazian
conflict zone, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from Tbilisi,
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Shevardnadze said that the
Georgian leadership has not felt any pressure of Russia in
consideration of the stay of Russian peacekeeping troops in the
Abkhazian conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of the president, the next Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) summit should consider the stay of
Russian peacekeepers in the zone. "The problem of a stay of
Russian peacekeeping troops, a possibility to extend their mandate
and expediency of the prolonged peacekeeping operation, shall be
discussed and solved at the next meeting of the CIS Council of
State Heads," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that Georgia keeps to a peaceful way in the
settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. "The absolute majority of
Georgian residents and its leaders are strongly against a military
solution to the Abkhazian conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he has not had telephone conversations
with vacationing Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the recent
past.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "If the peacekeeping operation held in Abkhazia under
the CIS aegis fails to bring positive results, restore Georgian
territorial unity and return refugees to Abkhazia, Georgia
reserves the right to appeal in future to other international
organizations and countries, including the United Nations and NATO,
with a request to take part in a multinational peacekeeping
operation in Abkhazia aimed to restore Georgian unity and return
of refugees to Abkhazia."
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Georgia's National Security
Council "thinks it possible not to speed up" the withdrawal of
peacekeeping forces from the zone of the Georgia-Abkhazian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The council in its statement said the decision to this effect
was taken with account of the positions of the "U.N. Security
Council, Georgia's Friends group of states (the United States,
Russian, France, Great Britain, Germany) and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, warning of a possible aggravation of tension
if the CIS peacekeepers are withdrawn from the conflict zone at
the current stage."

seasonally adjusted 327.9 billion U.S. dollars, up from 324
billion dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased 0.3 percent, also the
second advance in three months. A growing backlog could mean
businesses may have to increase production facilities and manpower
to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, items such as computers and
communications equipment jumped 2.4 percent in June, erasing a 0.4
percent drop a month earlier. It was the biggest advance since
they shot up 3.4 percent in January.
</P>

transportation orders including both aircraft and motor vehicles.
But excluding this sector, orders inched up just 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>

electrical equipment edged up 0.2 percent and for primary metals,

products dipped 0.3 percent, also the second consecutive drop.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose
1.7 percent after falling 0.6 percent in May. These orders often
are a barometer of business plans to expand and modernize and have
been a major source of economic strength in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Orders for military goods shot up 13.4 percent after plunging
11.9 percent in May. Excluding military goods, orders rose 1
percent.
</P>
<P>

also representing the second advance in three months.
</P>
<P>
Inventories rose 0.3 percent, the eleventh increase in 12
months.

<HEADLINE> WFP Completes Distribution of Six-Month Free Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program today announced the completion of a major operation
in Rwanda which provided six-month food resettlement rations to
1.2 millions of Rwandan refugees in 153 communes.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of January 1997, hundreds of thousands of
Rwandans have been receiving a monthly WFP food basket comprising
12.5 kilograms of cereals, beans, vegetable oil, salt and
corn-soya blend, distributed to them by their home communes. This
food has been essential for returning refugees who until now, have
been totally reliant on relief food hand-outs.
</P>
<P>
"One of the ultimate aims of the program was to help
refugees quickly return to their home villages, thus avoiding the
creation of camps," said Gerard Van Dijk, WFP's Country Director
for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Although the initial six-month food ration distribution is
over, we will continue to carefully monitor the situation to help
people as need arise," said Van Dijk.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with the government of Rwanda, WFP's food
assistance program was part of an overall package provided by UN
and NGOs to help reintegrate refugees.
</P>
<P>
Intense efforts were made to help refugees rebuild their homes
and rehabilitate their farms in order for them to start producing
their own food.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Zambian Ties Hailed by Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The friendly ties between the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Zambia's ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) were highly praised by a visiting
Chinese delegation today.
</P>
<P>
A CPC delegation, led by Li Chengren, deputy head of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee, also spoke
highly of the relations between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The visiting CPC delegation held talks here this morning with
Sikota Wina, national Chairman of Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) on how to further strengthen the
cooperation between the two ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed satisfaction with the long-standing
friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two
countries and hoped that the bilateral ties will be further
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Wina said that the MMD will learn more from the Communist
Party of China (CPC) through the visit, especially CPC's
experience on party organization and economic development policy.
</P>
<P>
He praised the economic reform and opening to outside world
policy mapped out by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and the
great achievements scored as a result of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Wina noted that the success of revolution must be matched with
economic development and improved living standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Li Chengren said that the relations between the
two parties and two countries have stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
He said he highly appreciated the efforts made by Zambia under
the leadership of President Frederick Chiluba and the MMD to seek
a political model and development path suitable to its own
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese Communist Party has always pursued
four principles of complete independence, equality, mutual
respect of each other and non-interference in the internal
affairs of other parties.
</P>
<P>
Differences in social system and values should not hinder the
development of the relations between parties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation members also held talks with MMD
National Secretary Michael Sata in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese guests arrived here Thursday to start their visit
to Zambia and they will also pay visit to zimbabwe later.

<HEADLINE> Ross will Visit Mideast before Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Friday that he will first send mediator Dennis Ross to the Middle
East before considering any visit by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to the region.
</P>
<P>
"I have said all along I will send the secretary of state to
the Middle East at the appropriate time. But I want Mr Ross to go
there to do the work I am sending him there to do, to get the
reaction of the leaders and then we will make a decision (on a
trip by Albright)," Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Ross has been scheduled the Middle East trip this weekend but
was postponed as a result of suicide bombings at a Jerusalem
market, which killed 15 people and injured more than 150.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said: "It was appropriate to delay that (trip) in view
of the terrible loss of life and the bombing. Then we will see
where we are."
</P>
<P>
"When the period of mourning is over I will send Dennis Ross to
the Middle East to meet with the leaders there with our latest
ideas," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Middle East advisory, including Secretary of State
Albright, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and mediator
Ross, held a meeting on Thursday at the White House, making an
assessment of the situation following the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Albright was considering take her first trip to
the Middle East since she became the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Israeli
mourning period was believed to last seven days. Asked if that
meant Ross would travel at the end of next week, Foley said: "I
would say that's in the ballpark."
</P>
<P>
With regard to Albright's travel, Foley said: "The secretary
will likely travel some time after that. I can't say when
precisely that would be because that will depend in part on the
results of Dennis's mission."

<P>
In a press statement issued here today, he said that the
government would cut its expenditure for this year and take
sufficient revenue measures to safeguard the macro economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
"The government will initiate discussions with the IMF on a
possible economic 'shadow' program which does not involve
financial support from the IMF," said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF today decided to suspend the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) loan which was agreed upon
between the Kenyan government and the IMF in April last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF alleged that the measures the Kenyan government was
prepared to take fell short of meeting the clearly expressed
concerns of IMF member countries in the area of governance.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension, the local financial markets
witnessed an initial panic caused by short-term foreign "hot"
money.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi conceded that "this could have serious repercussions.
It could dent investor confidence, affect the Shilling (Kenya's
currency), affect inflation and it is something that could shake
confidence in the economy."
</P>
<P>
In response to the IMF decision, Kenya's Central Bank Governor
Micah Cheserem also said that the IMF decision had seriously hurt
Kenya's credibility, and he called for taking urgent measures to
limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
The three-year ESAF loan totalling 205 million U.S. Dollars
was approved last year but payments were conditional on Kenya's
meeting promises on constitutional reform, which is believed to
be able to help bring democracy into the country.
</P>
<P>
The loan was to be disbursed in six half-yearly instalments of
36 million Dollars each. The first instalment was released on
May 16, last year and the second one was due last November but
was withheld for "unresolved issues".

<HEADLINE> Investors Urged to Calm Monetary Market in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's business community today
urged all investors to act in solidarity to calm the local
financial markets in a bid to ensure economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The financial markets today witnessed an initial panic caused
by the decision of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
suspend a 205 million U.S. Dollars loan to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF today decided to suspend the three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility loan agreed on in April last year
between the Kenyan government and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The suspension decision has had serious repercussions on the
financial markets in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
A dealer of the Barclays Bank said today that "the Kenyan
Shilling opened at 59-59.50 versus the (U.S.) Dollar and then
depreciated to 60-62.50 within 20 minutes."
</P>
<P>
There were bids at as low as 64.50 for two leading commercial
banks but many banks were tied in the 60 to 63 band versus the
Dollar compared to around 59 at the close Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here today, the National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, and the Kenya Association of
Manufacturers said that the initial panic was caused by
short-term foreign "hot" money.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the government should stamp out
corruption, reduce dependence on donor aid and aid-funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Kenyans were capable of resolving their
problems internally and should not allow the economy to be ruined
by political squabbles.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone coup maker Tough as Talks Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Talks held in Cote d'Ivoire
aimed at returning Sierra Leone to civilian rule broke down
following a defiant statement from the country's military leader
major Johny Koromah, Cameroun Tribune reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Koromah who led the coup on May 25 that ousted the
democratically elected President Tejan Kabbah said a hand-over of
power will take four years (1997 - 2001).
</P>
<P>
Koromah made the statement to national television and radio
stations, emphasizing that his government will not be stampeded
and were prepared to fight any aggression to the last drop of
their blood, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), who have been mediating, accused the coup leaders of
coming to an earlier agreement to hand over power back to the
ousted President Kabbah. They called for the tightening of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But only hours after ECOWAS announced the tightening of
blockade on Sierra Leone, a ship with thousands of tons of rice
docked in the capital Freetown where crowds were said cheered its
arrival.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Security Council has expressed deep concerns
over the breakdown of the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today lifted a 20-year-old ban on the sale of advanced weapons to
Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
"The president has decided to establish a process for
case-by-case consideration of requests for advanced arms transfers
to countries of that region," White House spokesman Michael
McCurry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives a green light to Chile, which is considering
buying as many as two dozen American F-16s to replace its own
aging fighters.
</P>
<P>
"This decision puts U.S. arms transfer policy toward Latin
America on a par with our policy toward other regions of the world
and will be implemented in a way that serves our objective of
promoting stability, restraint, and cooperation in the region,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has changed dramatically from a region dominated
by coups and military governments to civilian control in the past
ten years.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership with countries in the region has reached a new
level of maturity, cooperation and dialogue," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long regarded Latin America as its backyard. But
Europeans have eyed the region for potential markets in recent
years. The European Union had a bigger trade volume with Latin
America than the U.S. last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Breast-feeding Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe today joined the
international community in launching the world breast-feeding
week, an initiative of the United Nations designed to encourage
maintenance of breast-feeding culture.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy stamps said at the
launching ceremony that Zimbabwe continued to promote
breast-feeding despite international speculation on the safety of
doing so while a mother is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence yet that HIV virus which causes AIDS can
be transmitted through breast milk," Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
"Having reviewed the situation in the light of currently
available information on the risk of HIV transmission through
Breast milk, we are determined that there is no reason to change
the ministry's policy based on the 1992 world health
organization, UNICEF and unaids consensus," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said what is important was to protect women against the
risk of HIV infection prior to and during pregnancy, and during
the period of breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
"HIV positive women should not embark on pregnancy,'' he said,
adding, ''human beings have a responsibility to stop the spread
of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
Breast milk was cheaper and could adequately nourish the baby
exclusively for the first six months, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Mideast Situation Extremely Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa described the present situation in the Middle East as
"extremely critical and dangerous" due to a prolonged peace
deadlock caused by the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
"With the recent violent operations, the situation has reached
a stage that dictates the immediate exertion of intensive efforts
in the real sense of the words to contain it," Moussa told
reporters in Alexandria, the Egyptian second largest city.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat in Alexandria, Moussa said that there is severe tension
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not simple," he said, calling for the revival
of negotiations together with "the elements of the peace process
as set down in the Madrid and Oslo accords."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Arafat is strongly convinced that the PNA
could not be held responsible for what has happened as
investigations into the suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem have
not so far led to results while there are Israeli mass punishments
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the explosion in a foodstuff market in Jewish
West Jerusalem killed 14 people, including the two suicide
bombers, and wounded 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian contacts will be sustained especially with the
Palestinian side with the aim of breaking the deadlock in the
peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister also promised all-out efforts by
Egypt to ease the sufferings of the Palestinian people and salvage
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the U.S. initiative would be launched as
soon as possible and would be balanced and based on various
considerations that bring the two parties back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative is an American and not an American-Egyptian
one," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a
"good and required" statement by saying Wednesday she was working
to renew U.S. aid to Palestinians despite the bombing of a Jewish
market and continued concerns about Arafat's commitment to
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
"Statements by Albright and U.S. President Bill Clinton point
out that the situation is grave and that the two parties should
honor their obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a balanced principle and a proper prelude to the
American initiative," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged restraint on both sides after the suicide bombing
attacks and said he would first send his envoy Dennis Ross to the
region before a visit by Albright.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's threats to re-occupy the Palestinian lands, Moussa
ruled out that Israel would carry out those threats.
</P>
<P>
He described the recent Jerusalem incident as "an addition to
Israeli considerations that harm the Palestinian side," referring
to recent punishments endorsed by the Israeli cabinet against the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Israel immediately imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip after the incident, barring tens of thousands of
Palestinians from jobs in Israel.

NANJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A recent photo show on the
Holocaust of World War II brought many visitors to Nanjing, where
Japanese invaders massacred hundreds of thousands of residents in
1937.

<P>
The exhibit is just one of the many cultural exchanges that
have taken place between eastern coastal Jiangsu Province and
Israel in the past few years, said Ji Genzhang, director of the
provincial Department of Culture.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1995, the department and the Israeli consulate
general in Shanghai co-sponsored a photo exhibition on daily life
in modern-day Israel. Israeli Consul General to Shanghai attended
the opening ceremony and said that he hoped more cultural
exchanges would take place between his homeland and
economically-developed Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Jiangsu chose over 20 children's paintings for
an international competition at the invitation of the Israeli
foreign ministry and a cultural foundation.
</P>
<P>
A photo show on the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
diplomatic activities was held in November, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ribeiro, the Golden Girl of Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Fernanda Ribeiro was seven years
old when her father offered her the first pair of running shoes,
and took her to a tiny village in northern Portugal where she had
her debut training.
</P>
<P>
Now, at 26, the gifted runner has conquered nearly all world
titles and looks set to defend her crown in the women's 10,000
meters at the current 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion and Olympic winner said here today after
the qualifying race:"I believe I am in a very good form. Before I
went to Sweden at the previous meet, I promised my mother that I
would be back with a gold medal. I made it - one gold and one
silver. Before Atlanta Games it was the same story. I'm looking
forward to do it again, right here in Athens."
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro had being asked, in her earlier days, if she'd like to
become Rosa Mota or Aurora Cunha, her former distance running
idols. Ribeiro replied: "No, I want to be even better and more
successful then they are."
</P>
<P>
She told the press a small story. When she was a small kid, she
was on the way to the training ground with her father, who used to
take her on his motorbike. It was raining hard, they fell down on
the slippery road and she injured herself pretty bad.
</P>
<P>
Covered with blood and full of pain, she had only one thing in
mind - not missing the training sesion. Her father forced her to
take a break, but she didn't.
</P>
<P>
"I am that kind of person. I have seven lives, like cats
do. Last year, I was injured for two months before the Olympics,
and only God knows what I've been through to make it there," said
Ribeiro.
</P>
<P>
After all her success she never changed, and nothing can get
her out of the track.
</P>
<P>
In one of her darkest moments - due to an injury - she promised
to walk from Oporto to Fatima (about 200 kilometers) in case she'd
win a gold medal in Atlanta. She did so, and fulfilled her
promise, walking down to Fatima in two days.
</P>
<P>
"I believe God is always by my side, giving me strength to run
and win. When I go to the starting line, I pray and ask our Holy
Lady from Fatima to protect me," revealed Ribeiro. "This time, I
will run the race with the same shoes I used at the previous
championships," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ribeiro qualified for the 10,000m finals with ease, but she
will face some challenge posed by Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia, the
1992 Olympic champion, Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, bronze medal winner
at last championships, and Elana Meyer of South Africa, 1994 World
Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
With China's world record holder Wang Junxia pulled out of the
meet, Ribeiro fears nobody, but she admitted that Wang's record is
well beyond her reach this time.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel for Tough Measures on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today accused Israel of having virtually
declared a war upon the Palestinians by toughening security
measures on them.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting this morning with Egyptian Leader Hosni Mubarak
in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Arafat also urged
immediate international intervention to prevent escalation of
violence.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with Mubarak as "important, useful and
constructive," Arafat told reporters that he briefed the Egyptian
leader on the serious measures taken by the Israeli government
following Wednesday's suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The bombings carried out by two Palestinian extremists in a
crowded market killed 14 people and injured 150 others. They are
the deadliest attack against Israelis since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Palestinian condemnation of the incident, the
Israeli government took advantage of the situation to launch a war
against the Palestinians, the Palestinian National Authority and
its leaders," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israelis should fight terrorism instead of picking
a quarrel with the Palestinians and taking such serious measures
as closing the Palestinian international crossing-points with
Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"The crossing-points should never have been closed," Arafat
said, adding that Israel has suspended the transfer of Palestinian
tax and customs revenues to the Palestinian coffers.
</P>
<P>
Israel immediately imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from jobs in
Israel. The closure was tougher than usual, restricting even
Palestinians' movements between their autonomous West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
Protesting the Israeli "mass-punitive measures which have
exceeded all logical limits," he added, however, what is going on
is part of the serious siege imposed on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This has always been the target of the Israeli government and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu," Arafat said, warning anew of
the Israeli government's plans to strike at the peace march and
evade the implementation of Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's intervention is needed at this
phase more than ever before, Arafat said, noting that the
agreements sponsored by both the U.S. and Russia, have to be
rescued.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's faith in the importance of the peace process is the
only way to escape the current peace crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has promised to take action on the various tracks to ease
the sufferings of the Palestinian people, according to the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Arafat called for holding an Arab League
extraordinary session to adopt a unified Arab stance in the face
of the Israeli practices against the Palestinian people and the
Mideast process.

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Noteworthy achievements have been

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers Beat Foreign Journalists in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers again
fiercely attacked and beat foreign journalists in the west city of
Hebron this morning, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when the reporters were filming
soldiers refusing Palestinian doctors and residents to enter
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers arrested a Al-Hayat Al-Jadihah reporter, beat and
injured a Reuters cameraman before arresting him. The report did
not give their names.
</P>
<P>
Similar incidents also took place in other West Bank
checkpoints. Journalists were harrassed and TV crew men were
prevented from filming checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians working with foreign press were even barred from
passing through checkpoints although they hold valid press cards
issued by the Israeli Government Press Office.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers quarreled with MBC TV (Middle East
Broadcasting Corporation, regional) crew at the northern Gaza
checkpoint, barred them from traveling to Jericho and threatened
to confiscate their camera cassettes after they filmed the
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Also in Hebron on July 13, five foreign journalists were
wounded by live ammunition or rubber bullets when they covered
clashes between Palestinian teenage stone-throwers and heavily
armed Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Press Association lodged a complaint to the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last week, soldiers even involved themselves in a diplomatic
incident. A Jordanian diplomat was detained at an army roadblock
near Maccabim between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for five hours. His
car was searched despite its diplomatic plate.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has presented an official
complaint to Israeli ambassador to Amman Oded Eran, saying that
the diplomat was insulted by the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak has
criticized the troops for the incident, according to a report of
the state-run Israel Radio today.

ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A jet fighter belonging to
forces opposing the Afghan Islamic Taliban militia today pounded
the militia's positions north of Kabul in an attempt to break a
week-long deadlock.

However, the frontlines were still located about 20 km north of
Kabul, where Taliban and their rivals have been fighting for the
last week, according to the reports monitored here today.
</P>

Both sides have failed to gain any significant ground north of
the beleaguered Afghan capital though they kept battling each
other's positions with heavy artillery and machine gun fire.

Slightly more than two weeks ago, the forces loyal to the
Afghan former military chief Ahmad Masood began a major offensive

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sets Targets for New Round of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, has worked out an outline for a new round of
economic development projects to turn itself into an international
economic, trade and financial center.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Shanghai's per-capita Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to top 3,000 US dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Lin, deputy director of the Economic Department under the
Shanghai Planning Commission, told participants at an
international workshop on development strategy that with this goal
realized, Shanghai would enter a new phase of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A new target has already been set: The city will try to raise
the annual per-capita GDP up to 5,000 US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
One of the key measures is to increase the share of the service
sector in the city's total GDP to 48 percent by the end of this
century from the present 42 percent. The service industry mainly
covers financial service, chain stores, entrepot trade, shipping,
tourism and information service.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will give priority to developing industries of
automotive manufacturing, electronic telecommunication, electronic
and machinery industry, biological engineering, new materials and
environmental protection, which is expected to take 56 percent of
the city's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
The official said Shanghai is likely to maintain a sustained
economic growth for the next 10 years, with its growth rate two
percentage points higher than that of the country's average.

<P>
MOGADISHU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Somali faction led by
Osman Hassan Ali Atto today accused the Italian special envoy to
Somalia Giuseppe Cassini of creating chaos, instability and
releasing false information about the country's situation.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page press statement issued today at the
headquarters of Osman Ali Atto in south Mogadishu, Cassini was
also accused of posing obstacles to the reconciliation efforts
undertaken by the National Salvation Council (NSC), the peace
efforts by the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and the implementation of the peace agreements
reached by Somali factions in Nairobi, Sana and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The United Somali Congress of Somali National Alliance
(USC/SNA) led by Osman Atto has called on the Italian government
to clear its political attitude towards Somalia and play a
neutral role in Somalia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Italian envoy as a person who has fallen far
behind being entrusted to lead the relationship between Somalia
and Italy, USC/SNA also accused Giuseppe Cassini for being
responsible for the failure of the recent Italian diplomacy in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Cassini has been lobbying for the creation of a local
authority for Benadir region in Mogadishu during his six-month
mission.
</P>
<P>
His political failure surfaced following the visit of Rino
Serri, Italian Under Secretary of State, in the capital four days
ago when the latter failed to bring all of the Somali factions
together.

GUANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, has reported retail sales of 38.233
billion yuan-worth of goods in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the figure represents a rise of
15.75 percent in a year-on-year comparison, and an increase of 1.6
percentage points over the national growth rate in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, prices for major consumer
goods such as cereal, edible oil, foodstuffs, meat, vegetables and
eggs have remained stable.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index of goods for the January-June period
dropped by 6.7 percentage points, while sales of 12 major items
have increased by more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the success of the macro-economic control
and the startup of new economic powerhouses are mostly responsible
for the stable market prices.
</P>
<P>
The provincial capital chalked up 73.771 billion yuan in GDP
(gross domestic product) in the period, a rise of 13 percent. The
comprehensive economic benefit index was 119.16 percent, up 5.8
percentage points.
</P>

US dollars-worth of goods in the first half of this year,
up 26.36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Port Handles More Containers in January-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai port in east China
handled 1.12 million TEUs of containers in the first half of this
year, up 31 percent over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Port authorities estimated that the port will handle 2.3
million TEUs of containers this year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, imports received at the port
amounted to 14.2 million tons, up 7.5 percent, while exports rose
22.8 percent to 8.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Xu Delin, an official of the port, attributed the increase to
the sound overall economic operation in China, the advantageous
location of the port, the upgrading of management, and the
expansion of sea, highway, and railway transport routes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Shanghai port handled nearly two million TEUs of
containers, ranking 17th among the world's large ports.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Counter-Attacks Conservative Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Tehran's liberal Mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi termed today the recent arrests of his
deputies as "a revenge" by the conservative camp for their defeat
in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The mayor made the remark at a press conference. This was his
first reaction to the arrests of his seven deputies who were
apprehended on July 27.
</P>
<P>
However, Karbaschi did not specify any person or group for the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
"The same group (conservative right) which was defeated in the
elections is behind these activities," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the rightists for breaking the law by sending armed
plain-clothes men to arrest his deputies without informing him in
advance.
</P>
<P>
"A certain armed forces called 'Justice Ministry's Security'
have committed illegal acts ... They arrested a group of people,
detained them and mistreated them in the municipal building," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the arrests showed that they were politically
motivated and were meant to put pressure on president-elect
Khatami who will be sworn in at the Iranian Parliament on August
4, he added.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi served as the ideologue of the liberal camp known
as G-6 that has supported the economic development policies of
Iran's outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign of Mohammad Khatami,
Karbaschi served as one of his strategists. Khatami won over 20
million votes, or 69 percent of the total votes on May 23,
defeating his main conservative rival Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who has been backed by Iranian Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei has
launched the nationwide anti-corruption campaign last month
against the outgoing government headed by President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who will officially step down Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president, his family members and his some
cabinet members have been under constant attacks by hardliners
for various kinds of corruption since the beginning of 1996.

FUZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province plans
to build a 17.5 km railway line from the special economic zone of
Xiamen to Haichang port.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways and the city of Xiamen will jointly

In 1989 the State Council approved the building of a special

SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's real estate market
has continued to prosper since the beginning of this year,
information from Shanghai Real Estate Trading Center shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, registered sales of the combined
floor space of open-market apartments for the first half of this
year went up by 92 percent in a year-on-year comparison.
</P>
<P>
And more Shanghainese are opting buy rather than rent an

Statistics from the center also reveal that the municipality
has reported a spiraling increase in the total floor space of
apartments sold in advance of occupancy. A 20 percent increase in
land transfers was also recorded.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute a number of factors to the city's thriving
real estate market, including the reduction of real estate
development costs, increased marketing efforts by real estate
developers, housing loans offered by different banks to
individuals and change in people's attitude toward buying
purchasing housing.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Publishes Law Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Attorney General Amos
Wako Friday published the Statute Law Bill 1997 which seeks the
repeal and amendment of certain laws, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in drafting the Bill, the government endeavored
to take into consideration the draft Bill put forward by the
National Convention Executive Council, an umbrella body of
Kenya's opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The repeal and amendment of some laws will enhance the
enjoyment of human rights by all Kenyans and facilitate the
freedom of assembly and expression in the country, Wako noted.
</P>
<P>
The Bill seeks, among other things, to establish an
anti-corruption authority with more powers to combat corruption
in the public services.
</P>
<P>
Western donors said that corruption is their major complaint
against the Kenyan government, adding that the losses from
mismanagement and corruption are greater than aid donations in
1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund Friday stopped a three-year
aid program to Kenya amounting to 215 million U.S Dollars for an
alleged government failure to show its commitment to fighting
corruption, according to a "East African Standard" report today.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 and 1992, the Kenyan government paid some 100 million
Dollars to a company, calling Goldenberg International, under a
gold and diamond export compensation scheme.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, the problem is that Kenya produces
little gold and no diamonds deposits.
</P>
<P>
Owner of the Goldenberg and four former government officials,
who involved in the scandal were charged with defrauding the
government in 1993, but the Kenya High Court
ended its prosecution in June this year after four years of
delay.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted one diplomat as saying that "what donors want
are practical steps in dealing with the Goldenberg culprits."

ALGIERS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Up to 80 villagers were slain by a
terrorist group last Thursday in the Algerian region of Blida, 50
kilometers south the capital Algiers, according to informed

number of victims since the parliamentary elections on June 5.
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims belong to one family including the old and
children with their throats slit.
</P>

</P>
<P>
During the combing operation, the security forces killed 130
terrorists at least and dozens of the terrorists surrendered.

All Africa Workshop seeking ways to use community service as an
alternative to imprisonment, Justice Paddington Garwe said on

</P>
<P>
Garwe said, community service was being widely viewed as a

Garwe was speaking at a ceremony to officially hand over the
community service scheme to the Zimbabwean government from a

note that both the European Commission and the British High
Commission will continue to assist the scheme.''

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: Israel Declares War on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed
Queria said today that the measures taken by Israel against the
Palestinians in the wake of the Jerusalem bombings on Wednesday
are tantamount to a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio, the
Palestinian official condemned the Israeli measures as "the
toughest ever to be taken against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's bombings which killed 15 people and injured
170 others, Israel suspended peace talks with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), imposed a total closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip and threatened to reenter Palestinian-ruled areas
to arrest militants.
</P>
<P>
"Declaring a war against the Palestinians would never
guarantee Israel's security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is the only one to be blamed for what
has happened, the Palestinian official said, adding that the
Israeli policies that include suspension of the peace march and
building of settlements have led to a state of frustration and
cast doubts on the outcome of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Queria called upon PNA President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet to "put matters to order
and decide whether to continue the peace march or not."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli measures aim at "isolating the
Palestinians and starving them," warning that the Palestinians are
in a state of turmoil and they would never accept anything that
might harm their dignity.
</P>
<P>
"The peace march is really in a fix and its destiny is
seriously threatened," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The anti-peace process militants launched the strikes just
days after the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators agreed to
resume talks that have been frozen for four months over Israel's
decision to build a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have died of snake
bite in Kanchanpur district of far-western Nepal since April, the
official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
They were among the 155 people brought for treatment in local
hospitals in the past four months, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
People bitten by snakes tend to go for traditional methods of
treatment, leading to the rising number of deaths, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, bites by cobras, which are common in this district,
are difficult to treat because this reptile tends to go for the
abdomen, chest, throat or forehead of its victims, the agency
quoted a doctor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fact that snakes started crawling into houses since the
monsoon set in contributes to the rising cases of snake bites, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Deaths of snake bites in other parts of the country were also
reported.

ATHENS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- World record holder and Olympic
champion Randy Barnes of the United States failed to qualify for
the men's shot put final here Saturday morning at the 6th World
Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
The pre-race hot favourite, who popped the year's best 22.03
meters in June, made a sensational upset in the qualifying
round. He opened a 19.23 and improved to 19.51 next round before
fouling the last throw. The poor result placed him 14th in the
qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion John Godina of the United States was the
only man who hit the ball over the 21-meter line. Godina was
beaten by Barnes in the last round at last year's Olympics, and he
finished fourth at the U.S. Trials, but the IAAF gave him a chance
to defend the title with a wild card.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon's final, not to be discounted is Finland's
Mika Halvari, who won the silver at the last championships and has
strongly recovered from the ruptured Achilles tendon that ruined
his Olympic hopes last year.
</P>
<P>
Three others with the ability to challenge Godina for the gold
include Aleksandr Bagach of the Ukraine, who has thrown a lifetime
best of 21.47 this season, and remaining Americans Kevin Toth
(21.78) and C.J. Hunter(21.34), both of whom hit their personal
bests at the USA Championships this year.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's Services Trade Might Be Freed by Two Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be allowed to liberalize
their services trades by two deadlines according to their
preparedness, a senior Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
Those members who are well placed for competition will be fully
liberalized by 2010, said Charin Harnsuebsai, deputy
director-general of the Business Economics Department of the Thai
Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Those members in a weaker position, or who want to protect the
sector for a longer period, will complete the process by 2020,
Charin was quoted as saying by local media today.
</P>
<P>
The new approach was proposed by Singapore and a working group
of ASEAN will submit related plans to the annual meeting of
ASEAN's economic ministers scheduled for October this year in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN agreed to free trade in telecommunications, transport,
finance services, tourism and business services in December 1995
and negotiations concerned are scheduled for completion by 1999.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now consists of nine members - Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Campaign Should Focus on Masterminds: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the country's anti-drug campaign should focus on
druglords, financiers and other masterminds in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"Let us now make sure that the focus is on the higher-ups,
meaning, the heads, the lords, the masterminds and the financiers
of the drug trafficking in the Philippines," he said.
</P>
<P>
To win the war against drug dealers and lords, Ramos said, he
would meet separately with key officials of law enforcement
involved in the anti-drug campaign, including the Department of
National Defense, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the
Department of Justice and the National Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The president met with Interior and Local Governments Secretary
Robert Barbers, Philippine National Police Director General
Recaredo Sarmiento and other top officials Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said during the meeting that he was determined to employ
all the three services of the armed forces in the all-out war
against drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ordered Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona,
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and Barbers to map out plans and
strategies to intensify the government's anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
Fighting drugs was not only the job of the law enforcement
departments, Ramos said, adding the battle could only be won with
the active support and participation of the community.
</P>
<P>
He also told the police leadership to utilize the country's
links with international law enforcement agencies including the
Interpol, a body of more than 120 countries that keep track of
transnational crimes with focus on drug trafficking and terrorism.

The first research recommends a pilot scheme for the setting up
of "youth mobile teams" to cater for those young people who hang
out at night and may be exposed to various bad influences.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, which will commence later this year and will
operate from 11 pm to 6 am, social workers would work to prevent
the so-called young night-drifters from falling prey to
undesirable elements or breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
The second research recommends the continuation of a pilot
scheme which has been proved effective.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, which serves young people put on Probation Order or
School Order and those cautioned under the Police Superintendents'
Discretion Scheme, provides structured programs and intensively
supervised activities for youths to reintegrate themselves into
mainstream education or workforce and thus minimizing the
likelihood of their turning to crime.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The total number of Hong Kong's
property sale and purchase transactions rose by 29 percent last
month compared with June to reach 22,574, according to today's
Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total considerations jumped 38 percent to 112.3
billion HK dollars (14.40 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
An analyst said the sharp increase in the July transactions did
not conflict with the significant slowdown in the mass residential
market caused by the government's announcement that the supply of
land for housing and production of flats would be increased
substantially.
</P>
<P>
The number of property transactions in July was the second
largest so far this year after the record high of 25,572 recorded
in April.

here today.
</P>
<P>
About 125 foreign delegates, mainly leaders, intellectuals,

Islamic and Arab world attended today's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The conference will review developments in the third world with

<HEADLINE> British PM Names Lords to Take on Tory Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
named 57 new peers today, the largest number of peers appointed in
a single announcement in modern times.
</P>
<P>
In the long list, 31 are Labor Lords as Blair begins his
attempt to reverse the inbuilt Conservative domination of the
upper House of Lords. The Conservatives had managed to stay in
power over the past 18 years until the May election.
</P>
<P>
The new Labor peers will boost the party's representation in
the Lords to 157, but the Conservatives, with 494 adherents, will
still be in a massive majority.
</P>
<P>
The list of new Labor peers was dominated by former MPs but
several industrialists, businessmen and writers were also elevated.
</P>
<P>
The new contingent of peers provides consolation for several
senior Tories who lost their seats in the election and a lease of
life for many Labor MPs who stood down before Labor regained power
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords is far less powerful than the lower House of
Commons, but still has the power to delay non-financial
legislation from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, Labor pledged to end the right of
hereditary peers, some holding titles dating back to medieval
times, to sit in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
This would leave it largely in the hands of "life peers," such
as those Blair named today, whose titles are not inherited by
their children.

in Dhaka. Another factory fire also claimed nine lives on July 16
while many more lost their lives in such incidents earlier.
</P>
<P>

taken within the next 30 days in all garment factories. These will
include building alternate staircase, installation of fire
extinguishing equipment and other emergency safety systems.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Facing a currency depreciation
after International Monetary Fund decided to suspend its loan to
the country, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi called the
countrymen to be confident in holding their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that his government would not succumb to threats,
intimidations or ultimatums, the "Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony held by Kenya Forestry
College in Kericho District, western Kenya, he said that Kenyans
should be allowed to decide their political own destiny. The
fruits of democracy could not be realized if the country was to
embrace tribalism at the expense of national cohesion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Head of State made the remarks following a decision
taken yesterday by the International Monetary fund to suspend its
215 million U.S. Dollars three-year loan to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
President Moi thanked the German government for its continued
development support to Kenya, especially the Kenya Forestry
College.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Michael Gerdts, German Ambassador to
Kenya, noted that President Moi had offered a number of
significant proposals and in doing so had extended an invitation
for dialogue to all political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said time had come for all groups in the East
African country to join in dialogue and present their views and
proposals as part of their contribution to the future destiny of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Only in a co-operative effort by all Kenyans, could unity of
the Kenyan people be preserved and a successful and prosperous
future of Kenya be assured, he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Shift to Service Trade in Export Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to give a
bigger role to its strong service sector in export promotion as
the country is seeking new ways to revive exports.
</P>
<P>
The government must do its utmost to promote other sectors that
could jump-start the economy when exports in the country had
dropped, Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee said at a service
trade exhibition which opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's service businesses, like health and beauty services,
medical service, amusement parks and golf courses, restaurants and
entertainment, have good potential for exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has seen the significance of the service trades
and plans to include them in the Ninth Social and Economic
Development Plan which starts in 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that currently, the most well-known Thai
service sector is the restaurant business with about 4,000 Thai
restaurants scattered around the world.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is working on plans to encourage local service
business operators to create brand-name services or products for
export.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat flew today to Alexandria, the second
largest city of Egypt, to discuss with Egyptian leader Hosni
Mubarak the latest development after two suicide bombings in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place three days after the two bombing attacks
which killed 15 people and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the third in ten days, comes within the framework
of coordination and consultations between the Egyptian and
Palestinian leaders, Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdein, who is
accompanying him on the trip, was quoted by Egyptian news agency
MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak summit will also cover the situation in the
region in light of measures adopted by the Israeli government
against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat Friday night received a phone call from Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the political situation in the
region and the worsening deadlock stifling the PNA-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Egypt's top diplomat on the negative consequences
of the Israeli army blockade of Palestinian self-rule areas as
part of a collective punitive policy against the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's bombings, Israel suspended peace talks with
the PNA, imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and threatened to reenter Palestinian-ruled areas to arrest
militants if Arafat failed to act.
</P>
<P>
Arafat Friday night called for holding an Arab League
extraordinary session to adopt a unified Arab stance in the face
of the Israeli practices against the Palestinian people and the
Mideast process.
</P>
<P>
The two deadly bombings, for which the Islamic Resistance
Movement has claimed responsibility, shattered renewed hope for a
possible breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process
just days after the two sides agreed to resume talks that have
been frozen for four months.

<HEADLINE> Man Pulled Alive From Collapsed Ski Lodge in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers have pulled a man
alive from under one of the two collapsed ski lodges destroyed by
a landslide two days ago at the Thredbo ski resort near Canberra.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Diver, 27, was pulled from the wreckage of the lodges
this evening, more than 64 hours after the landslide, with
multiple lacerations, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Ambulance Service Superintendent Allan Dent said Diver, who had
no shoes on his feet when rescued, was in a serious but stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
Twenty people were believed to be trapped in the wreckage in
the disaster, which occurred in the early hours of Thursday. Their
relatives have been told by police to expect the worst since then,
and six bodies have been uncovered from the ruins by about 400
rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
Police said paramedics of a special casualty access team first
made physical contact with Diver by punching a 10 centimeter hole
through the rubble early this morning.
</P>
<P>
One of the paramedics held hands with Diver and handed him a
torch so he could describe to rescue workers the debris
surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics pumped hot air via a tube into the cavity where he
was trapped to keep him warm and fed him warm electrolyte fluids.
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman said it was believed that Diver was buried
beneath three concrete slabs with a fourth underneath him.
</P>
<P>
Diver, who was staying in the Bimbadeen ski lodge with his wife
Sally, was a supervising ski instructor and volunteer fireman at
the Snowy Mountains resort, which is 150 kilometers southeast of
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
He was stabilized by paramedics and specialist trauma surgeons
before being placed in the helicopter's "virtual flying intensive
care ward" and airlifted to a Canberra hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police Superintendent Charlie Sanderson told reporters at a
press conference today that a "miracle has occurred."
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said the breakthrough came at 05:37 this morning
(local time) when rescue workers made what had become a routine
probe of the rubble with listening devices. Signs of life were
detected when muffled sounds from under the slab were heard.
</P>
<P>
The temperatures in the ski resort plunged well below freezing
point for the fourth successive night.
</P>
<P>
Among those believed trapped in the rubble are Mim Sodergren
and Mike Sodergren, ski instructors from the United States, and
New Zealand-born ski instructor Mary Phillips. Most of the other
unidentified missing people are believed to be Australians working
for the ski resort.

rise of the U.S. dollar against the French franc, but also by an
overall improvement of world economic situation, the arrival of
tourists from Eastern Europe, and better reception by France.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syria Call for End Israeli Occupation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Syria issued here Friday
night a joint statement, calling for an end to the Israeli
occupation of all Arab lands, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued at the end of a 24-hour unexpected
visit to Iran by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad urged Israel to
return the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and Palestinian
territories to Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran "vehemently supports the Syrian reasonable stance
demanding the return of Golan Heights to that country," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also expressed concern over the recent
military and security cooperation between Turkey and the Israeli
regime, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Calling the cooperation contradictory to the declaration of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Iran and Syria
called on Turkey to review its stance toward cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement also stressed the two countries' support for
territorial integrity of Iraq as well as the struggle by the
Lebanese Islamic and national forces to liberate the territories
occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
It said the Israeli efforts to participate in the economic
cooperations in the region is a prelude to expand its influence in
Arab and Islamic countries and called for Islamic countries'
comprehensive sanctions against the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the U.S. congress' decision to transfer
its embassy to Jerusalem, calling it "an antagonistic move against
Muslim nations" and an violation of all the relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Syria also called on the world community to confront
the Israeli regime's recent desecration of Islamic and Christian
sanctities, which the statement termed as "a racial and criminal
act" by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad arrived in Tehran on July 31 amid reports that Syria,
Iran and Iraq had been trying to set up a joint block in
confrontation with the Israeli-Turkish close military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He met with and had talks with all Iranian top leaders, but no
details have been reported about their efforts in forming the
block though they did discussed the "Iraqi issue".

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Erupts in S. Leone as Talks Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fighting has broken out in
Sierra Leone when traditional hunters known as Kamajures went
on the rampage, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajures attacked the fighters of ex-rebel Revolutionary
United Front and soldiers of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council on Friday as the country's peace process suffered setback.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted in the eastern town of Ningi when one of the
Kamajure leaders, apparently responding to the breakdown in peace
talks between the military administration and its neighbors,
ordered his men to attack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, the second round held in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire,
collapsed in session immediately after Sierra Leone's military ruler
announced a four-year transition program on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajure leader, simply identified as Norman, was quoted as
saying that his forces "were now fighting because the junta in
Freetown has refused to accepted that peace is better for the people
of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice than fight and bring back democracy and
reinstate the government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Norman stated his men would create a safe passage
for returning civilians who had fled the country in the wake of
the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
People have begun to trickle back into the areas after they fled
into the Liberian border town nearby to avoid further clashes.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the peace talks triggered "deep concern" of the
United Nations Security Council and incurred condemnation from the
Commonwealth which suspended Sierra Leone's membership last month.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is to
tighten economic blockade and embargo against Sierra Leone. And the
possible use of force in order to restore the ousted civilian
government has also been announced.
</P>
<P>
Earlier report said the blockade by the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG has resulted in short supply
of foodstuffs, drugs, fuel and other daily necessities in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the grim picture, a ship loaded with thousands of tons
of rice was reported to dock in Freetown on Friday, raising fears
of the effectiveness of the ECOMOG blockade.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Favor Pirated Cables TV Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese television viewers are
switching to pirated satellite channels following a cabinet
decision to shut down unlicensed audio-visual stations, Beirut's
newspaper the Daily Star reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The report said one week after the cabinet decision to close
unlicensed audio-visual media, more and more people began to flock
into the illegal cable market.
</P>
<P>
A supplier who wished to be anonymous, said that in the past
week alone, there had been 15 percent rise in subscription to his
illegal service which provides customers with a cable-supplied
array of channels at a fraction of the price of the satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
Satellite companies, on the other hand, have not experienced
any growth in sales since government's closure to unlicensed
audio-visual stations.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that at least 70 percent of the potential
satellite market has gone to illegal cable companies.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of illegal to legal consumers is 70 to 30. The
potential loss of sales is a combination of the unregulated
existence of illegal suppliers and the country's economic
status," said Tony Hayek, a leading satellite supplier.

<HEADLINE> Israel Vows to Arrest Palestinian Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has vowed to arrest Palestinian police chief
Ghazi Jabali on charges of plotting anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israeli state television Friday night, Mordechai
said that Israel had concrete evidence to prove that Jabali had
ordered the planned attack against a Jewish settlement near
Nablus last month.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was referring to the arrest of three Palestinian
policemen who were captured by Israeli soldiers on July 14 on
their way to carry out the attack. Israel has since been
demanding the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) arrest Jabali
and put him on trial.
</P>
<P>
Following Wednesday's two suicide bombings in Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehuda market which killed 15 people and wounded 170
others, the Israeli government has tightened the screw on the PNA
to crack down on terrorism. The militant Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) has claimed responsibility for the bombing
attack.
</P>
<P>
Jabali has strongly denied his involvement in terrorism and
laughed off the Israeli order to arrest him. He warned Thursday
that if Israeli agents were sent to Gaza to arrest him, they
would never return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Backing down from the threat to dispatch troops to capture
Jabali, Mordechai said that Israeli forces would arrest and try
Jabali only when he enters Israel.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the bombing attacks had derailed the peace process
when it was gathering momentum, Mordechai said any agreement
with the PNA should be based on promises that anti-Israeli
terrorism must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA officials blasted Israel's overreaction to the
Mahane Yehuda terror attack by reimposing a total closure on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, canceling the planned resumption of
peace talks and threatening to dispatch troops to reenter
Palestinian self-rule areas to arrest terrorists.
</P>
<P>
PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo told a news
conference held in Ramallah Friday that Israel's response to the
suicide bombings was irresponsible and attempted to weaken the
PNA led by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo insisted that the PNA has been doing its best to combat
terrorism and the punitive measure taken by Israel would only
backfire. He warned that there would never be peace under such
conditions of collective punishment by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, PNA Minister of Higher Education, added that
Israel's tough measures would only place the situation under
further crisis.

<HEADLINE> 16 Palestinian Cabinet Members Offer Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen of the 18-member
Palestinian cabinet have submitted their resignation to President
Yasser Arafat over alleged corruption and mismanagement of funds,
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Abdul Jawad Saleh announced at a weekly
cabinet meeting in Ramallah Friday night that he and all but two
colleagues are ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether Arafat accepts the resignation of
so many ministers. He is scheduled to fly to Cairo today for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak over the situation
following the two suicide bombings in Jerusalem Wednesday,
killing 15 people and wounding over 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential office confirmed that Arafat had been asked
to consider the resignation at a suitable time, but declined to
give details.
</P>
<P>
The development came a day after the 88-member Palestinian
Council (PC) gave Arafat one month to dissolve the cabinet. The PC
also asked the president to form a new cabinet that includes
qualified persons and technocrats. The PC decision was adopted by
a vote 56-1.
</P>
<P>
"If no change is made by the end of September, we will make
inquiries, and if the situation remains the same, we will then
take the necessary measures," said PC President Ahmed Queria.
</P>
<P>
The PC made the decision following a report compiled by a panel
of 9 PC members detailing instances of the alleged corruption
committed by certain ministers.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended putting on trial two ministers: Minister
of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath and
Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, who were the
only ones not offering to resign. The two ministers strongly
denied the allegation against them.
</P>
<P>
The PC decision is not legally binding, but does bear
pressure on Arafat.

<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Olympic runners-up China are
expecting a hard test at the China International Women's Softball
Challenge Tournament to be held here from August 5 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Organizers unveiled at a news conference here today that China
will not call back veteran players from abroad for the event,
which as well features Olympic third-place Australia, six-place
Chinese Taipei and Chinese Youth team.
</P>
<P>
The newly-reshuffled Chinese team, with only five players from
the silver-winning team at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, are
expecting tough challenge from Australia, who come along with 11
Olympic bronze medalists, according to the Chinese Softball
Association.

The Chinese women's softball, on the ebb tide right now, are
trying to have their young players gaining experience at the
competition in preparation for next summer's World Softball

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed
with CPO physicals lower and the other two higher.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the CPO physicals market received a boost
Thursday when two cargo surveyors, Caleb Brett and SGS (M) Private
Limited, put July palm oil exports at 722,389 tons and 710,836
tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
These two figures were higher compared with their previous
estimates for June at 634,753 tons and 611,368 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
August South ended the week at 1,202.50 ringgit (about 462.5
U.S. dollars) per ton compared with 1,207.50 ringgit (about 464.42
U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the CPO physicals' rising trend at the end of this
week is unlikely to be sustained next week due to technical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the market should be corrected next week when
players would have the opportunities for profit taking from recent
gains.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), trading was quite
cautious this week, with the instability of the local currency
ringgit keeping players on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the KLTM, which surged last week, ended
sharply higher as price rose 30 sen to 14.15 ringgit (about 5.442
U.S. dollars) per kg with accumulated turnover amounting to 751
tons compared with 515 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the upside potential of the KLTM was positive as
it should be further supported by a favorable outlook expected
from the LME next week.
</P>
<P>
The LME impact on the KLTM will be tremendous next week and the
KLTM is set to record further gains next week, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, the rubber prices ended the
week higher.
</P>
<P>
August RSS One settled the week five sen higher to 250.50 sen
(about 96.346 U.S. cents) per kg and SMR 20 firmed 5.50 sen to
250.00 sen (about 96.154 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for July 31 was at 192.87
Malaysian/Singapore cents (sen) from 189.60 cents (sen)
previously.
</P>
<P>
The five day moving average was at 192.06 cents (sen) against
187.89 cents (sen).
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber prices are expected to extend its firm
trend next week in range-bound trading with the market awaiting
fresh factors to help determine short-term market direction.
</P>
<P>
Foreign inquiries are expected to be extended further,
especially from the Far East and Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Wages All-Out Anti-Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drug campaign kicked off
by the mayor of Manila a month ago has quickly spread to other
parts of the Philippines, sparking off a nationwide war against
illegal drugs and drug lords and pushers.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Manila Mayor Afredo Lim launched an all-out war
against drug pushers by mobilizing the police force in Manila to
raid the lair of wanted drug lord Florencio Parena. Parena eluded
arrest, but policemen uncovered 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamine
hydrochloride (shabu) and some high-power weapons.
</P>
<P>
The white-haired mayor also adopted a new measure to cope with
the drug traffickers. He ordered the police to spray in red paint
"This Is Drug Pusher's House, Please Keep Away" outside the houses
of suspected drug pushers and "Drug Pushers, Don't Destroy the
Young People's Future" at school gates.
</P>
<P>
Lim's campaign was welcomed by all students and ordinary
citizens. So far, the police have sprayed at least 235 houses in
Metro Manila. Lim said he would continue to do so to 100 other
public and private schools in the capital.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos threw his full support behind Lim,
describing the drug problem as the biggest threat to the country's
interests. Urging all local mayors to follow Lim's example, he
sought the overhaul of the 1972 Dangerous Drugs Act to ensure drug
lords and drug pushers their conviction.
</P>
<P>
"We will employ the full force of government against the
criminals and outlaws, especially their masterminds, the drug
lords and the financiers who persist in challenging the rule of
law and undermining the moral fabric of our society. We will hit
them hard, again and again," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Following the president's order, the police and military
quickly stepped up the crackdown on drug lords and drug
traffickers. In the past month, they killed six members of a drug
syndicate, rounded up 264 drug pushers, arrested seven scalawags
in the police and cremated 253 kilograms of shabu seized in the
country's largest drug sale.
</P>
<P>
Pressured by the powerful offensive, Parena gave himself up to
the police. After an initial interrogation, he confessed that he
sold 10-million-peso (350,000 U.S. dollars) worth of shabu every
week before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
The military is now going after 10 big-time drug syndicates in
the country, one of them reportedly much bigger than the 14-K gang
led by Alfredo Tiongco.
</P>
<P>
To capture Tiongco, the No.1 drug lord in the Philippines,
President Ramos has directed Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona
and National Bureau of Investigation Director Santiago Toledo to
seek the help of the international police in tracking down him.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Congress also took concerted action. At present,
the lawmakers are considering approving nine anti-drug measures to
enable law enforcers to have more powers.
</P>
<P>
The bills would allow the seizure of drug lords' assets,
electronic surveillance of drug gangs and probe of bank records of
people charged with serious drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
The Congressmen are also mulling over the passage of
anti-racketing and anti-money laundering bills and proposing to
lower the amount of drug for death sentence conviction.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been a key transshipment point for
international drug syndicate due to its easily penetrable airports
and seaports and a long irregular coastline providing ideal entry
and exit points for drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The country becomes more vulnerable to drug traffickers given
its geographic closeness to major sources of illicit drugs, in
particular the "golden triangle" -- an area bordering Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos -- in Southeast Asia.
There are reportedly 560,000 drug pushers in Manila alone, where
the deal of shabu, the most popular drug, is reaching 9.5 billion
U.S. dollar a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippines itself is turning into a big
consumption market of illegal drugs. According to the latest
report by the Narcotic Group of the Philippine National Police,
the number of drug users has risen by 250 percent to 1.7 million
over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Most of these drug users were aged 15 to 29 and took an average
of 15 grams of drugs per head a month.

<HEADLINE> Thai Islamic Spiritual Leader Dies at 70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Islamic spiritual
leader Prasert Muhammad died of heart failure in a local hospital
Friday at the age of 70, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prasert had served as an adviser to King Bhumibol Adulyadej on
Islamic affairs since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Thai Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn presided over burial
rites at Marus Misideen Mosque in Bangkok Friday evening, which
was also attended by Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and
Interior Minister Snoh Thienthong.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry is expected to call a meeting of 29
provincial Islamic leaders to select a new Islamic leader to be
approved by King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
Muslims are Thailand's largest religious minority. Out of the
more than 60 million population now in the country, 95 percent are
Buddhists while about 4 percent are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Islam might be introduced to the Malay Peninsula by Arab
traders and adventurers during the 13th century. Most Thai Muslims
are of Malay decent.
</P>
<P>
Muslims in Thailand are mainly concentrated in the southernmost
provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Satun. The Muslim
leader in Thailand is also known as Chularajamontri, or state
counselor for Islamic affairs.

<HEADLINE> India Seeks 55-100 Pct Bindings on Customs for Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- India has sought between 55 and
100 percent bindings on customs duties for 18 agricultural
products including wheat, rice and grains, and 150 percent
bindings for edible oils in order to open up imports of farm
products, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
India's several major trading partners are reported to have
sought much lower bindings than being sought by India. Bangladesh,
for instance, is seeking bindings of between 15 and 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the balance of payments (BOP) consultation meeting in
January this year, India was unable to indicate any timetable for
phasing out import controls of farm products because the country's
Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra objected to the removal of
restrictions on import of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Mishra set up a committee to examine the issue and the
committee suggested that imports be opened up, but very high
tariffs be retained in the agriculture and other sensitive
sectors.
</P>
<P>
At the early negotiation of agricultural bindings, India
started by asking for extremely high bindings for most of the
agricultural products ranging from 150 to 300 percent for most of
the items, but its major trading partners found these
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In fact, even the current bindings of 55 to 100 percent are
being considered very high by India's major trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Fiat, Peugeot Likely to Forge Alliance in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian automobile major Fiat
and its French rival Peugeot are likely to strike a strategic
alliance in India, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the probable alliance, Peugeot may share its existing
manufacturing facility in the country with Fiat for the latter's
world car "Palio" project in India.
</P>
<P>
Fiat and Peugeot, which share manufacturing facilities through
similar alliances in other parts of the world, might repeat the
experiment in India as well once Fiat's acquisition of a majority
stake in India's Doshi-controlled Premier Automobiles Ltd. (PAL)
is finalized.
</P>
<P>
With its controlling stake in PAL, Fiat will hold a significant
stake in PAL-Peugeot and thus become a joint venture partner of
the French automobile giant even when the two compete in the
marketplace with their respective models, reliable sources said.

<HEADLINE> Albania to Promote Relations With China, Say President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
said today his new government will further develop relations with
China and carry out effective cooperation with it.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani said in an interview with Xinhua that China has
achieved rapid economic growth in the past decades, setting an
example for economic development.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised China's economic reform and the road it
adheres to, which had been initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed Hong Kong's return to China would
eventually lead to China's national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani said his government would follow a practical policy and
develop relations with big and small countries, especially its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian people desire cooperation with China in the
economic and other fields, he said, and the government should work
to improve the bilateral ties so as to benefit the two countries
and their people.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani said his government would make efforts to restore law

needed without which economic recovery will be affected,
especially foreign investment and economic assistance.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's industrial
production rose by 29 percent in the first seven months of this
year compared with the same period of last year, a senior
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic told reporters that in
the same period, the country also enjoyed a stable price and low
inflation of 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the economic growth to the successful
implementation of the government's economic plans in the key
economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to take firm actions to maintain
the stability of price and exchange rates between Dinar and
foreign currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's international standing, Sainovic said that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has signed about 170 agreements
with other countries on bilateral or multilateral cooperation.

BUCHAREST, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Colombia signed a
trade agreement today, replacing the one signed 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Industry and Trade Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu
and Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Carlos Ronderos Tarres signed
the agreement, local reports said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Price Index up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumer price index
(CPI) was 140.0 in July, up 4.9 percent on a year-on-year basis,
the Thai commerce ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was also 6 percent higher than that in June.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the CPI hike in July to higher prices
of food, beverage and oil as a result of the baht's de facto
depreciation following the Thai central bank's decision to float
the Thai currency on July 2.
</P>
<P>
The food and beverage sector index rose by 6.9 percent as
compared with the same month last year, while the non-food sector
index climbed up 3.5 percent, according to the statistics released
by the ministry's Business Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
Prices of rice and crop products, fresh chicken, eggs and fuels
recorded the highest increase last month.
</P>
<P>
The price of rice jumped up 4.7 percent from June and was up
30.1 percent year-on-year, while chicken prices rose 0.3 percent
from June and was 5.9 percent higher year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Thai commerce minister Narongchai Akrasanee Friday said that
the July CPI figures were reasonable under the current
circumstances and the inflationary pressure was under control.
</P>
<P>
Some commerce ministry officials said that food and fuel prices
are expected to continue to rise in august, even before suppliers
use up their inventories, and the august CPI is likely to rise
sharply.

<HEADLINE> 30-year Sino-US Deal Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of 35,000 tons of
aluminium oxide has arrived in Qingdao from the United States,
which marked the official beginning of a 30-year contract between
China and the United States, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by the China National Non-ferrous
Metals Industry Trading Group, a subsidiary of the China National
Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Corp. (CNNC), and the Aluminium
Company of America (ALCOA) in London last September.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, China will import between 400,000
and one million tons of aluminium oxide from the US company at
cost price each year for a period of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The CNNC invested 80 million US dollars in the project. And a
dozen foreign banks led by Credit Lyonnais of France also provided
160 million US dollars worth of preferential loans to the
project. The term of the loans is ten years.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the CNNC said quality was the decisive factor in
the choice of ALCOA. The contract will help ease the shortages of
the material in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Imports of aluminium products in the first half reached 112,600
tons, an increase of 23.7 percent year-on-year.

<HEADLINE> True Appraisals of Intangibles Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of State
Property (SASP) recently called for putting an end to inflating
appraisals of intangible assets, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rampant irregular appraisal of intangible assets could
jeopardize China's fledgling valuation business, warned Ni
Jixiang, vice-director-general of SASP's assets valuation center.
</P>
<P>
Intangible assets refer to non-material properties such as
patents, trade marks, copyrights, land-use rights, technologies
and business reputations.
</P>
<P>
Appraisals on intangible assets should be conducted only when
property rights need to be transferred according to set rules
and regulations concerning appraisals, said Ni.
</P>
<P>
However, some valuation agencies violated the rules by offering
business to some enterprises which only intend to advance their
images by using intangible assets vaulation, Ni noted.
</P>
<P>
The malpractice could lure more firms to pay excessive
attention to their intangible assets, thus distracting them from
concentrating on operating their tangible assets.
</P>
<P>
China Appraisal Society is drafting new national standards for
intangible assets appraisal which will be more scientific and
detailed than the existing rules, according to Ni, who is also
deputy secretary-general of the society.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The producers price
index (PPI) of Colombia fell 0.4 percent in July, the first drop

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
today called on Latin American countries to play a greater role in
regional integration and quickly revive regional economy.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Latin American Integration Association
(LAIA) in Montevideo, Frei said Latin American states should make
greater efforts to have their voice heard in the world to help
change the current situation of "marching in the rear of the
developed countries."
</P>
<P>
The association was set up in 1960 to promote regional trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
Frei, starting a visit to Uruguay Wednesday, urged the LAIA
members to take the initiative in the negotiations under way for
the creation of the Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) by 2005,
and within the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The 11 LAIA countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and
Peru, must define their interests and set common guidelines in the
negotiations with hemispherical and world trade bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the "dynamic, positive and integrating" role
played by LAIA, Frei called on the group to explore new avenues to
"create real interdependence among our countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign ministers preparing
to embark on a peace mission to Cambodia will present a "general
idea" for peace when they meet Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Friday night
that  the proposal, formulated on behalf of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), has already been accepted by
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, as well as Cambodia's King
Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Alatas along with Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
and Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn have been assigned
to meet Hun Sen to seek a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian
problem.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said Alatas was leaving here this
morning for Phnom Penh as a first step in ASEAN's renewed efforts
to help resolve the political crisis in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that now Prime Minister Hun Sen agrees to
hear ASEAN's views, which previously were seen by him as an
intervention in Cambodia's internal affairs," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"We will see how Hun Sen reacts, if we reach a point that
promises settlement, we will talk again with Prince Ranariddh and
perhaps also the King. The process will continue," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN admitted Myanmar and Laos as new members but deferred
Cambodia's entry into its ranks when its foreign ministers met in
Kuala Lumpur last month. ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> China Develops World's Largest Metal Cutting Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Technicians in China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China, have developed a
new rolling machine tool, an electric rolling machine that
is the largest and newest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The machine is light, simple, and compact in size -- useful
features for a new generation of machine tools.
</P>
<P>
The new machine can handle 500 to 1,000 grams of super hard,
super adhesive, super crisp and special electric conductive
materials per minute while the traditional model can only
process several grams per minute, said Ye Liangcai, the developer.
</P>
<P>
It consumes only two or three kwh of electricity to cut 1,000 grams
of metal, 20-25 times less than traditional machines, and its
service life is five to ten times longer than traditional machines.
</P>
<P>
The machine uses an electrofusion pop-in technique invented by
Ye Liangcai, head of a research institute for electrofusion pop-in
technology in the northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
The machine will be soon shipped to Canada which has ordered
it.

<HEADLINE> Peru Marks 50th Anniversary of 200-Mile Sea Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Peru commemorated today the 50th
anniversary of the declaration of its 200-mile territorial sea
limit.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ferrero Costa said at a party that the
200-mile thesis has been extended to other countries and
continents and recognized as a rule of international law.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot forget the joint action adopted by Chile, Ecuador,
and Peru after 1952, with the Declaration of the 200-Mile Maritime
Zone, or Declaration of Santiago," he said.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, 1952, Chile, Ecuador and Peru signed the
Declaration of Santiago on the maritime zone, a document that
became the first international instrument of multilateral
character that consecrated the 200-mile thesis.
</P>
<P>
With this declaration, the Southern Pacific states presented to
the international community their right, as coastal countries, to
protect, conserve, and use their natural resources in the marked
zones.
</P>
<P>
The declaration opened the door for the creation of the
Southern Pacific Permanent Commission, which marked the start of a
revolution aimed at getting international recognition of the
maritime rights of the Southeastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Declaration of Santiago, other Latin
American countries decided to adopt the 200-mile thesis. They
included Nicaragua, Argentina, Panama, Uruguay, Brazil, Costa Rica
and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The consecration of the 200-mile thesis was achieved during the
Third Conference of the United Nations on Sea Law in 1982.

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong businessmen established
108 firms in Beijing in the first half of the year, with a total
investment of 519 million US dollars, indicating that Hong Kong
investors are "confident" about their investment in the capital,
officials here say.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been Beijing's biggest business partner since the

businesses in the city have concentrated on real estate and
processing and service industries.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has certain advantages that attract investment,
according to Municipal Economic and Foreign Trade Commission
officials, and the growth of Hong Kong investment makes the city
even more attractive.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's mayor, Jia Qinglin, said recently that the city will

URUMQI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The "Spring Bud" Project has
helped over 2,000 young female dropouts in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, NW China, return to school.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program, "Spring Bud", jointly sponsored by the
All-China Women's Federation and China Children's Foundation, is
to help a large number of China's dropouts return to school.
Xinjiang, one of the program's ten major targets, is home to
110,000 female dropouts, some 90 percent of whom belong to ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the program enabled local education
departments to establish a special six-year course of study for
young females living in compact minority nationality communities
in remote poverty-stricken areas. The program enabled Xinjiang to
offer either tuition reductions or exemptions and to hire
additional female teachers.
</P>
<P>
The program places special emphasis on providing professional
training which enables female students acquire some practical
skills in areas such as aquatics breeding, agronomy, embroidery
and processing, as well as in culture and science.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels, all social sectors and military
units in Xinjiang have provided various forms of assistance,
including school buildings, living quarters and supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua)-- An automatic nursing bed has been
developed in China for the handicapped, the elderly, and patients
who suffer from chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The fully computerized bed was developed by the Beijing
Hangxing Machine Manufacturing Corp. and a Japanese research
center, and will mean greater convenience for people who are
confined to bed.
</P>
<P>
With this particular bed, a patient can sit up or lie down,
move to a wheelchair, take a bath, use the toilet, or even change
the bed sheet, all with just the push of a button. He or she will be
warned of possible machine failures, and if there are power
outages, it can be manually operated. Certain models even respond
to a spoken command
</P>
<P>
The number of elderly in China has been on a steady increase,
and the number of handicapped people had reached 60 million by the
end of 1996, and 8.8 million of those are disabled.
</P>
<P>
The country has set up more than 40,000 nursing homes, taking
care of nearly 600,000 elderly. The government also had provided
the handicapped with more than 700,000 different pieces of
equipment to help them, between 1990 and 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kunming, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 600,000 farmers, mainly
ethnic minorities, in China's Yunnan Province have begun to have
better lives thanks to an international aid-the-poor program.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the province began to get international assistance in
developing agriculture, and has used more than 300 million yuan in
loans for the effort from the World Food Program (WFP), the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Development Program of Yunnan Ethnic
Minorities in Simao Mountainous Areas started in 1992, with 280
million yuan in low-interest loans from IFAD for 35 townships of
540,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
The program has helped 20 percent of the people there escape
poverty, and 378,000 people have 235 kg more grain per capita, and
a per capita income more than one and a half times larger
</P>
<P>
The WFP spent 28.64 million yuan in three counties to help
120,000 poor people, and the project area produces 83,000 tons of
grain annually now, compared with 54,000 tons in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government donated 270 million Japanese yen to two
poverty-stricken counties to help add 52,000 tons of grain, and
helped more than double farmers' income.

months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that the personal spending was up
by 0.3 percent in June following a 0.1 percent rise in May.

Personal incomes rose to an annual rate of 6.87 trillion
dollars in June, up from 6.82 trillion a month earlier. The 0.6
percent increase was the biggest since an identical advance in
March.

Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component
of Americans' income, rose by 31.8 billion dollars, compared to a
gain of 12 billion in May.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- increased by 0.5
percent after advancing just 0.1 percent in April and 0.3 percent
in May.
</P>
<P>
The report said spending totaled an annual rate of 5.44
trillion dollars, compared to 5.43 trillion in May.

</P>
<P>
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the U.S. economic

<P>
The number of staff and workers in state-owned enterprises fell
by approximately one million, with the figure for collective

<HEADLINE> Kipketer, the Most Talented Runner Kenya Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- With Wilson Kipketer standing on
the track, even the most ardent Kenyan fans admit, their world
class runners have no chance to beat this 26-year-old Kenyan-born
Dane at the current 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
To most Kenyans, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia is versatile,
Morrocco's Hachim El Guerrouj and Salah Hissou may threaten their
middle and long distance glories, but their "own" Kipketer is a
sure bet to snatch the men's 800-meter title from his former
Kenyan brothers.
</P>
<P>
After equalling Sebastian Coe's 16-year-old world 800m record
of one minute 41.73 seconds early this month, Kipketer has been
tipped as the brightest shining star at the championships.
</P>
<P>
In a country where blood runs deep in the veins, Kipketer might
be a Dane, but Kenyans could not care less about him. "He is one
of us still. No medal is more valued and celebrted in Kenya than
the 800m gold. Our adults and youth alike think nicely of him, "
said Peter Njenga, a Kenyan journalist.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had a long history of winning the 800 meters in world
major competitions. Wilson Kipkurgut Chumo won Kenya's first
Olympic medal -- a bronze -- in the 1964 Tokyo Games. From the
Second World Championships in 1987, Kenya never let the event
world title slip from their hands. Billy Konchellah won the crown
twice in 1987 and 1991 before Wiliam Tanui and Paul Ruto's
triumphs in 1993 and 1995. But this time, Kipketer is the hardest
nut for gifted Kenyans to crack.
</P>
<P>
Moses Kiptanui, the 3,000-meter steeplechase world record
holder and triple world champion, may be the greatest
steeplechaser of his era, but is certainly viewed ordinary at home
if compares him with Kipketer.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer is a hero whose love for adventure has made him shift
base to Denmark. He joined the Denmark's nationality last
October. This, according to the majority of Kenyans, is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
They think it shows a man of determination and hard work.
According to Njenga, Kipketer has built a house in his rural
hometown in Kenya and brought his wife home. "So in the
championships, Kenyans will cheer him on and consider his gold
medal as good as theirs."
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Games champion Patrick Konchellah is tipped only
for the silver. The Kenyan is the only other runner beside
Kipketer to run under 1:44 in the world this season.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer said here yesterday that his aim at the meet is to
shatter the 800 meters world record. "I am a Dane right now, but
I don't hate my native country. The glory will also go to Kenya,"
claimed the defending world champion, who was denied by Kenya last
year to compete in the Olympics for Denmark.

of the athletics.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Azerbaijani Presidents Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
held talks on Friday with Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyer at
the White House and both leaders agreed that it was important to
expand the partnership between the two countries through
strengthening bilateral cooperation in the political, security,
economic and commercial spheres.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents' meeting followed a series of sessions this
week for Aliyer with U.S. senior officials, including Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
During the presidents' talks, a batch of deals were signed,
which was said to be able to clear the way for U.S. oil companies
like Chevron, Exxon, Mobil and Amoco, to participate in oil
exploration, development and production in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents said in a joint statement on U.S.-Azerbaijan
relations, issued after their meeting, that they would exert their
efforts to make U.S. companies extensively participate "in the
development and transport of Azerbaijan's oil and gas resources."
</P>
<P>
Last Week, U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
testified before a Senate committee that the United States is
managing to build a working relationship with Central Asian
nations because, if failed to do so, Iran waiting in the wings,
would step in whenever it gets any chances.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also supported to rescind sanctions against Azerbaijan,
imposed by the United states in 1992 because of the Azerbaijani
conflict with Armenia, which he said limited potential cooperation
between the United States and Azerbaijan.
