<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rises in Palestinian Autonomous Areas Because of Israeli Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment in the Palestinian
self-rule areas has reached as much as 76 percent due to the
Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip since late last
month, according to reports reaching from Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip following a series of suicide bombing attacks in israel
since February 25, which left more than 60 people dead and over
150 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel had eased aspects of the closure, allowing
Palestinian workers with work permits to return to their jobs in
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and part of the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
However, thousands of Palestinian workers, who have not been
able to go to their jobs in Israel due to the closure, are still
barred from entering the boundaries of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli embargo also caused sharp shortage in the
foodstuffs in the self-rule areas. Mohammad al-Kudwa, head of the
Palestinian Chamber of Commerce, said today that the Palestinian
self-rule areas are now getting only some 25 percent of their
needs of flour.
</P>
<P>
Riyad Zanoun, the health minister of the Palestinian National
Authority, also said that the blockade caused insufficiency in
medicines and adversely affected investments in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the closure, which
keeps 60,000 Palestinians away from jobs in Israel and costs their
impoverished economy millions of U.S. dollars daily, will stay in
effect until Palestinian police arrest all the militant leaders
wanted by Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ad Spending in Newspapers Up Sharply in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Spending in U.S. newspapers by
top 100 advertisers of the country jumped 12.8 percent to 13.3
billion dollars last year, the Newspaper Association of America
said today.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by growth in classified advertising, total newspaper
revenue from advertising grew 5.7 percent to 36 billion dollars in
1995, the newspaper trade group said.
</P>
<P>
The association represents 1,500 newspapers, most of them
dailies, in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
John Sturm, the association's president and chief executive
officer, said the growth in advertising revenue reflected the
confidence advertisers have in newspapers as a way to reach
consumers.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook of 1996, he predicted that total ad revenue of
U.S. newspapers would reach to 48 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue totals for 1995 showed that classified advertising
contributed 13.7 billion while retail and national advertising
accounted for 18 billion and 4.2 billion respectively.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Godfrey
Miyanda said today his government fully supported small business
enterprises because they would create more jobs for the people.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda made the remarks when he laid a foundation stone for
an industrial estate of the Zambia Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO) in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"As we pursue our privatization policy, there is no doubt at
all that small businesses will inevitably have to be the
cornerstone of the private sector industrial and commercial
activities and social development," Miyanda said.
</P>
<P>
He said in a situation of mass unemployment, poor technology
and financial constraints, small industries could flourish with
the relatively modest claims on resources and technology.
</P>
<P>
The small businesses were the most convenient vehicle for
promoting employment, economic participation and socio-economic
development to all corners of the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
There are tens of thousands of small industrial and commercial
enterprises in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Tajikistan to Accelerate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called on the Tajik government and the
Islamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan (IRMT) to accelerate their
efforts to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
"It urges them to negotiate constructively and in good faith
and to search for solutions on the basis of mutual concessions and
compromises," Legwaila J. Legwaila, current president of the
Security Council and ambassador of Botswana, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the the council regretted that insufficient
progress had been achieved during the continual round of the
inter-Tajik talks in Ashgabad towards the solution of fundamental
political and institutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale armed conflicts broke out in Tajikistan a few
months after it declared independence on September 9, 1991. The
Tajik government and the IRMT reached a cease-fire agreement on
September 17, 1994 in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was deeply concerned about the violations
of the Tehran cease-fire agreement and in particular about the
ongoing fighting in Tavildara region, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the importance of direct political dialogue
between Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and the leader of the
IRMT for the peace process and encouraged them to hold the next
meeting as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on the parties to cooperate fully with
the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan, which was
established in December 1994 to monitor the implementation of the
cease-fire agreement.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Delegate on Reincarnated Child of Bainqen Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan delegate today said the
confirmation of the reincarnated child of the late 10th Bainqen
Lama gives full expression to Chinese government's respect for the
religious beliefs of the Tibetans and the religious rituals of the
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Gunchok Tsering, a Tibetan member of the Chinese delegation to
the 52nd session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, said that
the 11th Bainqen Lama, determined by drawing lots from the gold
urn and approved by the Chinese Central Government, has won
wholehearted respect and support from the believers of the Tibetan
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in response to the charges made today by
some non-governmental organizations which said the Chinese move
was a violation of the freedom of religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"Far from violating the freedom of religious beliefs, it
constitutes part of the religious rituals to forward the final
choice of the reincarnated child to the Central Government for
approval," he said.
</P>
<P>
The titles of the Bainqen Erdeni and the Dalai Lama of the
Tibetan Buddhism were conferred by the Central Government of the
Qing Dynasty of China (1616-1911).
</P>
<P>
It has become a historical convention that the reincarnated
child of both the Bainqen Lama and the Dalai Lama must be
determined by drawing lots from the gold urn and with the approval
of the Central Government before ascending the holy throne.
</P>
<P>
After the Central Government of the Qing Dynasty introduced the
system of lots-drawing in 1792, more than 70 reincarnated children
were confirmed through the method and then approved by the Central
Government.
</P>
<P>
Gunchok Tsering said that the above-mentioned religious rituals
and historical convention were strictly followed in the location
and confirmation of the reincarnated child of the 10th Bainqen
Lama.
</P>
<P>
However, in total disregard of the religious rituals, he said,
the Dalai Lama announced a reincarnated child for the Bainqen Lama
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"This is totally null and void," he commented.
</P>
<P>
"Other Tibetan separatists in exile abroad, and a few who have
ulterior motives, with an attempt to throw Tibet into chaos, to
undermine China's national unity, and finally to split China, also
made a big issue to disrupt the normal searching process," Gunchok
Tsering said.
</P>
<P>
"As for the boy appointed by the Dalai Lama, he is now in good
health and leading a normal life. The so-called arrest and
persecution of him is nothing but a pure rumor," he added.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of Women Deputy Ministers Welcomed In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Women's National
Coalition (WNC) of South Africa today called on the three women
who were newly appointed deputy ministers to promote women's
rights and gender equality.
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet reshuffle announced by President Nelson Mandela
on Thursday, three women were appointed to senior position
in the government as a bid to address ''the national challenge of
the emancipation and empowerment of women''.
</P>
<P>
The three new deputy ministers are: Gill Marcus (finance),
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka (trade and industry) and Susan Shabangu
(mineral and energy affairs).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two other women were also appointed deputy ministers.
They are Sheila Camerer (justice) and Eileen Shandu (land
affairs).
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the appointment of these competent women
would help bring a sharper focus on the emancipation and
empowerment of women in all sectors of the society an essential
objective of the government.
</P>
<P>
The WNC also appealed these new women deputies to go forth and
create gender sensitive plans, budget goals and policies, that
uphold women's rights, as human rights.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on China's Religious Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate to the 52nd
session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
reiterated today that it is the Chinese govenrment's fundamental
policy to respect and ensure religion or belief.
</P>
<P>
"Respect for and protection of freedom of religion or belief is
separated from state political power and education," said Duan
Qiming, advisor of the Chinese delegation at the March 18-April 26
session.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government advocates impartial treatment of and
harmony among all religions, as well as equal treatment of all
people, no matter they are religious believers or not, and belong
to whatever religion.
</P>
<P>
In China, Duan said, hundreds of millions out of the 1.2
billion people are followers of religions ranging from Buddhism,
Taoism, Islamism, Catholicism to Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
According to Duan, Chinese authorities at all levels have over
the past decade or so made great efforts to help renovate temples
and churches for the conduct of religious activities, including
the allocation of several hundred million RMB (Chinese currency)
to this end.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are in China more than 2,000 religious
associations, more than 70,000 temples, churches and others sites
for religious activities, and 48 religious schools with a
religious staff of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
"Scriptures, books and periodicals are available on every
religion. For Bible alone, its issue has exceeded 10 million,"
said the Chinese delegate.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that "freedom of religion or belief includes
the freedom both to believe or not to believe in religion. Whereas
the government must protect its citizens' freedom to be religious,
it has the obligation to safeguard the freedom of those who choose
not to be religious."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Duan stressed that the law of China provides that
all citizens and organizations, religious or not, are equal before
it with the same rights and obligations, permitting no exception.
</P>
<P>
"No one, no association and no religion can be allowed to
violate national law, infringe upon the interests of people,
foment splits among its nationalities and sabotage national
unity," Duan added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Will Never Attend Conference That Only Condemns Violence in Israel: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to a U.S. criticism of a
Lebanese absence from a world anti-terrorism summit earlier this
month, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed here today
that Lebanon would never attend any conference that only condemns
violence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on U.S. criticism of the Lebanese boycott of the
world "Summit of Peacemakers" held at the Egyptian resort of Sharm
el Sheikh on March 13, Boueiz pointed out that although Israel
commits daily aggressions against Lebanon, no international
conference has been held to denounce that.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday
that Lebanon, alongside Syria, made a "mistake" by boycotting the
Peacemakers Summit in Sharm el Sheikh as well as meetings of its
follow-up committee, which are being held in Washington by
representatives of the countries that participated in the Sharm el
Sheikh conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians and the Lebanese had a chance to attend the Sharm
el Sheikh conference," the state department spokesman said, "and
they would have been welcomed here, but they decided not to
participate. this is a mistake."
</P>
<P>
"When we refused the participation in the summit, we gave
basical justifications for the non-participation," the Lebanese
foreign minister told a press conference in his office today.
</P>
<P>
One of the main justifications is, Boueiz said, that Lebanon
suffers from Israeli agressions, raids and operations against the
Lebanese people and that the U.N. Security Council has not held a
single conference to "denounce this matter or take relevant
measures."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that his country would never agree to participate
in a conference whose topic was nothing else but to condemn
violence which was practiced in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Lebanese foreign minister said, "we have also
said the non-participation was related to the consideration that
this summit was focused only on improving the situation of
(Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres in Israel after the events
which had taken place."
</P>
<P>
He said that the atmosphere of the summit made it impossible to
put forward in the summit Lebanon's position on a necessity to
distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate resistance
against foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that such violence was a result of political
problems and it could not be eliminated without treating its
basical and major reasons.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz welcomed a plan raised by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher to aid Palestinians in the Palestinian
self-ruled areas of the Gaza Strip and West Bank that were
affected by an Israeli blockade imposed after a wave of suicide
bombing attacks that killed around some 60 people in Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of terrorism, Boueiz said that in Lebanon there
are lands occupied by foreign forces. As long as this occupation
exists, he added, it is impossible for any Lebanese government to
prevent its people from resisting such occupation.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I stress the necessity to differentiate it (the
resistance) from a prevalent common understanding of terrorism,"
the Lebanese foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Rwandan Prisoners Shot Dead While Trying to Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Tutsi-dominated troops
shot dead three Hutu prisoners today as they tried to break out
from a village jail in the north, the state-run radio said in a
report in Kigali monitored here.
</P>
<P>
As nearly 70,000 Rwandan Hutu genocide suspects were dumped
into overcrowded, small prisons in the central African country,
some of the inmates managed to break out and escaped at Byumba,
northern Rwanda before dawn, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops are now combing the area in a bid to hunt
for the escapees.
</P>
<P>
Population in the jails has grown to near explosion since
Tutsi-led National Patriotic Front fighters swooped back from
Uganda and seized power, turning into the government army in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
This had stopped the genocide of up to a million minority
Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and radicals
who now became refugees in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The genocide was triggered off by the shooting down of a plane
which killed the late president of Rwanda on board on April 4,
1994.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Diesel is to go up by seven cents a liter and
illuminating paraffin by one cent.
</P>
<P>
According to a CEF statement, principal reasons for the hikes
are the three cents a liter fuel tax announced by Finance
Minister Chris Liebenberg, who resigned on Thursday, in the
1996/97 budget and the local currency Rand's recent poor
performance against the US Dollar which will also cost motorists
three cents.
</P>

Increases in international prices of gasoline and gas oil also
add two cents to the local petrol price and one cent to diesel.

</P>
<P>
At a meeting held earlier today at the Irish parliament, Tian

<HEADLINE> Arms Issue May Stall Peace Talks: Bruton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
warned the British government that all-party talks on the future
of Northern Ireland to be convened on June 10 may be "logjammed"
by the arms decommissioning issue stressed by Britain.
</P>
<P>
The talks may also be jeopardized by unionist posturing in the
elected peace forum, Bruton added.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview with Britain's Financial Times newspaper
since he took office 15 months ago, Bruton also urged the british
government to offer compassionate treatment for Patrick Kelly, a
dying Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoner, who is serving a
20-year sentence in Ulster on a conspiracy charge and is reported
to be terminally ill with cancer.
</P>
<P>
Bruton maintained that the all-party talks must not become
logjammed by concentrating on the single issue of decommissioning
IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Bruton indicated that his government agreed to back the
elections in Northern Ireland designed by the British government.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the elected forum, in which unionists
would have a built-in majority, should not become a place where
those engaging in future negotiations will be constantly
second-guessed by people sitting on the sidelines to inflame
public opinion in an unhelpful way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), the
largest Catholic party in favor of the reunification of the whole
island of Ireland, said that it had not decided whether to
participate in the May 30 elections in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
An SDLP spokeswoman said that no decision would be forthcoming
until the British government clearly spelled out what, if any,
linkage there would be between the forum and the future
negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
The SDLP was also dismissive of Sinn Fein's call for a joint
boycott of the elections. It indicated that the party would make
its own decision on the future strategy.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Maastricht Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The intergovernmental conference,
which started today with the EU special summit, has started
negotiations on the revision of the Maastricht Treaty and the
future shape of the EU.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of talks in a refurbished workshop of Fiat
group and a working lunch, the heads of state and government were
on their way home, leaving their foreign ministers to put the
finishing touches on a broad agenda for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, also the rotating
president, said in a presidency conclusion of the summit that the
conference "will provide the opportunity for dealing more
effectively with the internal and external challenges of the
coming years."
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government set the main focuses for the
conference, which is likely to last at least 15 months, on a union
closer to its citizen, institutions in a more democratic and
efficient union and the strengthened capacity for external action
of the union.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged the intergovernmental conference to base its
work on the fact that the citizens are at the core of the European
construction, and respond concretely to their needs and concerns.
</P>
<P>
The summit set the fight against unemployment as the priority
task of the union and urged the conference to examine how the
union could provide the basis for a better cooperation and
coordination in order to strengthen national policies.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the EU institutions and pave the way for
future enlargement, EU leaders stressed the need to look for the
best means to ensure that they function with greater efficiency,
coherence and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The summit billed the future enlargement of the EU as "a
historic mission, a great opportunity and also a challenge for the
union." "In this perspective, institutions, as well as their
functioning, and procedures have to be improved," the summit
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders also decided that the conference should address
the questions of the extent of majority voting, the weighting of
votes and the threshold for qualified majority decisions.
</P>
<P>
Although the summit set these as the major themes, member
states are free to raise any subject they like and questions such
as openness in the environment, football's transfer system and
animal welfare are also expected to come up.

CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today received a telephone call from U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, according to reports reaching here from Gaza
City.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed during their telephone conversation the latest
developments of the peaceful march on the palestinian-Israeli
track in the light of the ongoing experts' meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Christopher reiterated his commitment to maintain the peace
process, and the U.S. understanding of the Palestinian stance and
the sufferings facing the Palestinian people, a Palestinian source
said.
</P>
<P>
He said certain proposals on easing such sufferings were
raised, the source added.
</P>
<P>
After a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel starting
from February 25, Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, barring thousands of Palestinian workers from
entering Israel to prevent further attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority estimated that losses from
the closure are at 2 to 3 million U.S. dollars a day from salaries
alone, and about the same in loss of trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The fourth ministerial
meeting of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South
Atlantic (ZPCSA) will be held in South Africa's Western Cape
Province on April 1-2.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a statement of the South African
Department of Foreign Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was accepted as ZPCSA's newest member in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The department said an initiative by Brazil in the early 1980s
to mobilize all South Atlantic countries to endorse the idea of a
military-free and nuclear-free ocean had evolved into an ideal to
bridge South America and West African countries politically,
economically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the global emergence of regional groupings
further enhanced opportunities for similar cooperation within the
South Atlantic rim.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the meeting would be of particular importance
to South Africa within the context of South-South cooperation, an
important element of South Africa's foreign policy. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua)-- Secretary-General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Bingu Mutharika
today urged member states to reduce dependence on rain-fed
agriculture through extensive irrigation schemes.
</P>
<P>
Mutharika said in a statement released here that COMESA
intended to help its members utilize the vast water resources in
the region's rivers and lakes through construction of irrigation
schemes.
</P>
<P>
He said a COMESA irrigation project had already been
implemented with financial assistance from the African
Development Bank amounting to over 195,000 US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He called on the member states to feed themselves even during
drought periods, adding that therefore it was necessary to
overcome the problems facing the agricultural sector in the
region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, grouping 23 states in the region, was born out of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Affica (PTA) in
December 1994. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President-Elect Sworn In Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's civilian
government was sworn in today as President-elect Alhaji Tejan
Kabbah took over power from the military.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking the end of the four-year military rule,
President Kabbah told the audience that the top priority for his
government would be the pursuit of peace and reconstruction of
homes for 4.2 million Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue the deliberations of the Yamoussoukro meeting
until lasting peace is achieved," he said, referring to the peace
talks between former military leader Julius Maada Bio and rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
"And I'm looking forward to an early meeting (with) Mr.
Sankoh," he added.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader has already agreed to continue the
negotiating process with the new civilian government in an effort
to bring peace and stability to the West African state torn apart
by nearly five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's one-hour speech at the ceremony was also concentrated
on domestic issues such as wide-spread corruption, mismanagement
of public resources and ethnic conflicts which he said his
government would be committed to fight for.
</P>
<P>
He said his election is "all the more reassuring in that it
was brought about by hundreds of thousands of devoted, dedicated,
tireless and motivated Sierra Leoneans, young and old, who is
(are) determined to bring democracy to the country."
</P>
<P>
Amidst thunderous cheers, he declared: "This is indeed an
inauguration of all Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
"Today should mark the end of the old epoch and the start of a
new era," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he cautioned that the people of Sierra Leone are
faced with a difficult task of rebuilding the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
"The country stands virtually in ruins with thousands
slaughtered, tens of thousands maimed and mutilated and hundreds
of thousands displaced, traumatised and living in poverty while
the country's moral and physical infrastructure are destroyed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Around 10,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed and two
million others, nearly half of the total population of the
country, displaced during the war.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said he will outline the domestic and foreign policy in
his maiden speech to the parliament on April 2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bio, the 33-year-old outgoing military leader, told
the crowd that his move to restore democracy and peace "was not
due to any pressure whatsoever from anywhere other than in
fulfilment of the commitment to the values of democracy and the
attainment of a lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, foreign diplomats said foreign pressure was the major
cause for his handover of power.
</P>
<P>
The former military leader described the inauguration of a
civilian president as "putting to rest the doubts concerning the
sincerity of the military's intentions."
</P>
<P>
"It is now left to the incoming government to continue
sustained dialogue with the RUF as early as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The brigadier general also urged the army to defend the
country instead of intervening in the politics.
</P>
<P>
Though today was not declared a public holiday, many
government offices were closed as crowds of jubilant Sierra
Leoneans milled around the parliament building, adorned in
colorful attires with imprints of the palm tree, the symbol of
the ruling S. Leone People's Party.
</P>
<P>
The colorful and splendid sworning-in ceremony was attended by
over 40 foreign observers including Organization of African Unity
Secretary-General Salim A. Salim and Chairman of the Liberian
interim government Wilton Sankawolo, among others.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Decline in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
slipped by 1.3 percent in February, the first decline in four
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales of single-family homes
totaled 700,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from a
revised 709,000 in January.
</P>
<P>
The January rate of new home sales originally announced was
estimated to be 693,000.
</P>
<P>
The sales in February were the first decline since they fell
1.6 percent last October, the third drop in a row. The trend was
reversed in November as mortgage rates continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected a gain of about 1 percent in new
home sales in February because 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 7.17 percent, up from 7.03 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hike, mortgages in the country still are relatively
low compared to rates that topped 9 percent in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new homes during the first two months of this year
were 19.1 percent higher than during the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales in the Midwest plunged 24 percent, the
steepest since it fell 38.8 percent in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
But sales in other U.S. regions advanced last month. Sales in
the Northeast jumped by 23.4 percent in February after a sharp
fall of 42 percent in January. It also advanced by 8.7 percent
in the West and by 0.6 percent in the South.

<HEADLINE> US Steps Up Efforts to Support Bosnian Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
launching a new effort to shore up the fragile peace process in
Bosnia, American officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move came after an overall review of the situation of the
former Yugoslav republic some 100 days after the signing of the
U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, deeply concerned with the troubles
in the Bosnian peace process, is stepping up efforts to build new
government institutions and to prepare for late-summer elections
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the U.S.-led NATO peace implementation force
in Bosnia scrapped a previous prohibition and began helping
civilian authorities and private aid groups with reconstruction
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said that Washington is about to announce a
new "Federation Forum" designed to salvage the fledgling Bosnian
Muslim-Croat federation by forcing leaders of those two factions
to talk to each other about how to make their alliance work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House officials have redoubled their work to
prod the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress into approving a 200
million U.S. dollar grant that President Bill Clinton has pledged
as the U.S. contribution to international aid for the rebuilding
of Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for EU Support Over Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain today tried to persuade its
European Union (EU) partners that it had done enough to halt the
spread of "mad cow" disease amid signs London could extend
emergency measures in return for EU cash.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told the EU summit held here
today, "This is a European problem and we will be looking to our
European partners to find a solution."
</P>
<P>
The summit had been scheduled to focus on the start of
negotiations on the future of the EU, but the beef crisis which
sparked last week had threatened to divert the valuable time from
the summit's real business.
</P>
<P>
Major reiterated London's opposition to the export ban imposed
by the EU, and added that his government was ready to work
"constructively" with the EU on measures to lift the ban as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to senior British officials, Major has received
assurances of EU support on the crisis from some of its partners
in the bloc.

<HEADLINE> UK Global Trade Deficit Widens in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
widened unexpectedly and came close to trebling in January,
according to figures released today by the Central Statistical
Office (CSO).
</P>
<P>
The deficit jumped to 1.42 billion pounds (2.16 billion U.S.
dollars) from just 557 million pounds (846.64 million dollars) in
December. A total of 1 billion pounds (1.52 billion dollars) was
expected.
</P>
<P>
In January, exports shrank by 2 percent to 13.1 billion pounds
(19.9 billion dollars), while imports increased by 4 percent to
14.6 million pounds (22.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The CSO blamed the unexpected widening of the trade deficit on
changes in the oil and erratic items category, saying a quarter of
the monthly movement reflected fluctuations in the balance of
trade in oil and erratics.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with countries outside the European Union (EU)
expanded to some 1.02 billion pounds (1.55 billion dollars) in
February from an upwardly revised 956 million pounds (1.45 billion
dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
But the CSO said the underlying trend for the global deficit
was still narrowing.
</P>
<P>
The deficit actually fell to 2.6 billion pounds (3.95 billion
dollars) in the three months to January from 4.1 billion pounds
(6.23 billion dollars) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the global deficit will grow in 1996 as a
result of the economy gathering momentum, but if Britain starts
importing beef products as well on fear of mad cow disease, the
pickup will be more pronounced.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Shoots Up Again to 6-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit sharply
shot up in the first month of the year, amounting to 10.27 billion
U.S. dollars, according to a report from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
The department said today the January trade deficit was the
worst showing in six months and a 47.6 percent increase from a
December imbalance in goods and services of 6.96 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
While imports hit an all-time high, reflecting higher demand
for foreign oil and cars, exports declined, led by a huge drop in
civilian aircraft, which fell to the lowest level in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
For January, exports of goods and services dropped 2.2 percent
to 66.60 billion dollars while imports were up 2.4 percent to
76.86 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports was led by shifts in two main categories.
Exports of civilian aircraft dropped 726 million dollars to 493
million dollars, the lowest level since February 1978. The result
was partially blamed for the protracted strike by the Boeing
engineers and technicians last September.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some expectation, exports of telecommunications
equipment were down 420 million dollars to 1.44 billion dollars in
January. This category had shown a big rise in December.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, America's foreign oil purchasing rose to
5.15 billion dollars in January, an increase of 12.5 percent from
December. This is attributed to the increase in average price per
barrel of crude oil which went up from a December average of 15.86
dollars to 16.45 dollars in January. In addition, the quantity
also rose to an average of 7.43 million barrels per day, up from
7.32 million barrels in December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of foreign cars and parts in January rose by
472 million dollars to 10.79 billion dollars. By contrast, U.S.
exports of cars and parts were only up 79 million dollars to 5.39
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some market analysts had been predicting the January deficit
would worsen to around 9 billion dollars; the actual 10.27 billion
dollars was much higher than expected. For all of 1995, the
deficit was 111.04 billion dollars, the poorest showing in seven
years.
</P>
<P>
The department said deficits with Japan and China were both up
in January, but analysts noted that they were still well below
their record highs. The deficit with Japan was up 9.3 percent from
December to 3.79 billion dollars. Even with the increase, the
monthly deficit was the second lowest in more than two years.
Imports from Japan fell to the lowest since May 1994, but U.S.
exports to Japan were down as well.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit with Mexico increased to 1.3 billion dollars,
while the deficit with Canada declined slightly to 2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The small surplus of 66 million dollars with Western Europe
turned into a 935 million dollar deficit and the 83 million dollar
surplus with the newly industrialized nations of Asia turned into
a 1.6 billion dollar deficit as exports fell 17.3 percent. The 910
million dollar surplus with Central and South America also turned
into a deficit of some 48 million dollars.

field of economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first one by the Uzbek leader since the birth

gutted the Kebon Kembang shopping center in Bogor, West Java, on
Thursday rose to 77 today.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of four member
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) signed a
package of agreements here today to deepen their integration.
</P>
<P>
Boris Yeltsin of Russia, Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus,
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzia
signed the documents, thus pushing the relations among CIS
member-states to "a new level."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony in the Kremlin Palace, Yeltsin
stressed that "a new form of integration of independent states has
been found."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin pointed out that the integration is not just a matter
of expanding the customs union to include one more former Soviet
republic, it also entails free movement of people, goods, services
and capital and creation of a closer union of independent states.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the integration is first of all based on
preservation of independence and sovereignty of states.
</P>
<P>
He added that the integration is on a voluntary and equal basis
and will serve as an instrument to promote democratic and economic
reform and harmonize relevant laws of the states.
</P>
<P>
The integration also requires the formation of a joint
financial and industrial group, an effective payments and
accounting system, and an inter-bank union with a prospect of
introducing a single currency, Yeltsin outlined.

<HEADLINE> US, EU Steel Groups Try to End Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Specialty steel producers from
the United States and the 15 European Union (EU) member states
have formally proposed an international agreement that would
"directly contribute to fair and free trade in specialty steel
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The joint proposal, drafted by the Specialty Steel Industry of
North America, has been submitted to U.S. and EU government trade
negotiators late Thursday, officials of the U.S. Trade
Representative Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Donald Phillips, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, described
in a statement the proposal as "a very big plus" toward finally
negotiating an international steel trade pact.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other governments have been trying for
more than six years to craft an agreement to eliminate steel
tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and most steel subsidies.
</P>
<P>
European nations have been calling on the United States to
alter its law for dealing with subsidized or dumped steal imports,
but Washington has so far refused to make the concession.
</P>
<P>
The joint proposal by the American and European special steel
industry would not change existing national trade laws, but it
does call on steel producers to limit their resort to those laws
in subsidy disputes, U.S. trade officials said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would bar all new steel subsidies except for
environmental and research projects, plant closures and associated
social costs.
</P>
<P>
They said that EU and U.S. specialty steel-makers want the
governments concerned to negotiate a formal agreement by the end
of this year.

<P>
SOFIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government published
a decree today to lift control over personal and corporate
purchases of foreign exchange, a move apparently to absorb more
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign banks were allowed to sell foreign
currencies in Bulgaria, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The decision also granted other local banks in addition to the
National Bank of Bulgaria freedom in receiving foreign loans and
in participating in international payments and account settlement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Bulgaria, bothered by insufficient foreign
investment, issued the decree to help push up the influx of
capital.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Taste Home Comforts - But Stick With Old Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shenyang, March 29, (Xinhua)--For generations farming families
in northern China beat off winter blues by sleeping on a
traditional heated bed- - a kang.
</P>
<P>
The brick-built beds extended across the living rooms of
straw-roofed dwellings, a coal or log fire beneath the kang,
keeping everybody warm and cosy.
</P>
<P>
It was said that all rural farmers asked for in life was a
wife, children and a heated kang.
</P>
<P>
A typical kang in northeastern China is usually made of adobes
- unkilned bricks - taking the form of a hollow platform which can
be heated by fire, like a big fireplace in European countries.
</P>
<P>
In the long freezing winter nights when the cold wind is
blowing violently, farming families rely on Kangs to warm
themselves.
</P>
<P>
As a result the houses built of earth and covered by straw,
with the whole family on one adobe kang has long been a familiar
feature of rural cultural landscape across China's northeast areas.
</P>
<P>
Now time has finally caught up with this tradition. Better off
farmers are saying out with the old, and in with the new.
</P>
<P>
But it has not meant showing the door to the old style
kangs. In fact the traditional heated beds have undergone an
amazing 20th century transformation.
</P>
<P>
 "This new kang in my house seems like something hanging up
in the air," said Li Guozhong, 53, a farmer in Zaoli village,
Taben town, Fuxin county of northeast China's Liaoning
Province. "with only a few pieces of wood in the stove it will be
warm enough for the bed, and the whole house can also be heated."
</P>
<P>
Just 10 centimeters above the ground, the neat new kang is
quite different from those of traditional style.
</P>
<P>
The old kangs had one major drawback- - they often filled the
room with smoke.
</P>
<P>
The early spring sunshine lits up Li's home, and the clean air
also puts a smile of approval on his face.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Liaoning provincial rural
energy-saving office, the new kang, known as the Highly-Effective
Hollow Prefabricated Kang, is designed to improve the farmers'
housing conditions, as well saving energy.
</P>
<P>
The new kang, like a matchbox hanging in the air, can save as
much as 690 kilograms of standard coal annually. This is because
it spreads heat over a much larger area of the home.
</P>
<P>
With technical help, the new kangs have quickly become
widespread throughout villages as well as counties, and many local
farmers have learned to build such kangs themselves, according to
Li Guozhong, the 53 year old farmer.
</P>
<P>
He explained that besides saving energy, the new kangs are also
convenient and clean, compared with the traditional versions.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, with more and more money in the farmers' pockets,
the traditional living style in rural areas is quietly changing,
they are now seeking a more civilized and cleaner life, just like
people in cities", a local town head, Lin, said.
</P>
<P>
According to the town head, farmers are now saying good-bye to
their traditional image, and it is the time for the outside world
to view today's farmers in a new way.
</P>
<P>
At least 800,000 households have fitted new-style kangs- - and
the result is an estimated saving each year of 550,000 tons of
coal -- greatly reducing fuel-induced pollution.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in northeast China are slowly changing their ways by
catching up with modern times -- but they still cherish their
heated kangs - using modern technology to cling onto a link with
the past.

HANGZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today called for redoubled efforts to boost the export of
machinery and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference that opened here today, Li

clothing as China's leading export commodity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that China still enjoys an enormous potential
for increasing the export of machinery and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
"I think that increasing the export of machinery and
electronics products is the fundamental way out for expanding
China's trade with the rest of the world," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it is necessary to improve technological
standards, product quality and after-sale service, and transform
the operational mechanisms in export-oriented manufacturers, the
leader said.

<P>
BONN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France today expressed
their determination to promote the process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French counterpart
Herve de Charette today published a co-signed article in Europe's
three major newspapers. including Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
saying that the two countries are determined to push forward
European integration.
</P>
<P>
In the article, the two ministers advocated that the EU
organizations and the European Parliament should have greater
powers. While a vote of majority is needed for EU decisions, the
suggested, "big nations" should have more voting powers.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France has been advocating a "multi-speed Europe,"
or a "nucleus Europe," or a "two-tier Europe" that allows EU
member nations to adapt their own paces towards a common goal.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Charette suggested in their article that those EU
member countries with similar interests and views on economy,
diplomacy and defense further develop their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But in another article published in the same newspaper, Malcolm
Rifkind, British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth
affairs, expressed Britain's rejection to strengthing the powers
of EU's organizations.
</P>
<P>
On the voting mechanism of the Council of Ministers, the United
Kingdom has insisted on reaching consensus through consultation
before any decision is made.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said that inter-governmental meetings should assure the
Europeans that EU will not threaten the member nations'
independence but will continue to serve them.
</P>
<P>
However, the two articles agreed on one issue -- EU's
expansion.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Borrowing To Exceed 660 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Borrowing by the Zimbabwean
government during the current fiscal year ending in June is
expected to exceed six billion Zimbabwe Dollars (667 million US
Dollars) compared with the original target of four billion
Zimbabwe Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd said on Friday the
government borrowing will still be high despite a raft of
revenue-enhancing measures announced in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The bank said state finances will be affected by indications
that the foreign financing component will be far well short of
the 1.3 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (144 million u.s. dollars)
projected in the 1995/96 budget.
</P>
<P>
''Therefore, the domestic borrowing requirement will again be
very sizeable, at six to seven billion Zimbabwe Dollars (from 667
to 778 million Dollars),'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit in the current fiscal year is expected to
remain stuck at around 10 percent of the GDP, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> World Seminar on Food Security Policy to be Held in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, March 29 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on food
security policy, slated for April 1-3 in Brussels, is expected to
define the long-term strategy on the food issue.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, sponsored by the European Commission (EC), will be
attended by about 100 people, including representatives from
European Union (EU) member states, developing countries,
international organisations and major aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the forthcoming seminar will be experts and
researchers in the field of food security.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the world's biggest food aid donor, with a total aid
volume of 1.098 billion ECU (about 1.425 billion U.S. dollars) in
1994, equivalent to 53 percent of world food aid.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the EU Development Council adopted a common
position on the new framework regulations for food aid policy and
management.
</P>
<P>
The EU has stated that food aid will be used as a tool for
development in the future, and consequently integrated into the
food security policy of the recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
Recent researches have forecast an alarming food shortage in
some regions in Africa and Asia at the start of the next century.
</P>
<P>
In 2010, it is estimated that 600 to 800 million people will be
suffering from starvation, and developing countries' demand for
imported cereals may well have doubled by then.

ISLAMABAD, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Authorities destroyed three

last week, reports from Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier
province, said today.
</P>
<P>
The laboratories were located in Mohamand Agency, a tribal area
at the border with Afghanistan.

<P>
Some 3,000 acres of poppy, cultivated by tribesmen, was also

</P>
<P>
A rehabilitation project backed by the US government is
underway in the tribal area to encourage local people to give up
their poppy-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, tribal people are said to have no faith in the project
as it is focused on construction of schools, hospitals and roads,
which provides limited job opportunities and income.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has become one of the major producers of narcotics in
the world in recent years.

NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission (EC)
has identified 25 percent of the 543 Lok Sabha (lower house)
constituencies as "sensitive".

<P>
Of the sensitive constituencies, a majority of which are in
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar state. Around five percent of seats have
been categorized as "super sensitive", EC sources said here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Among the factors taken into account before declaring a
constituency sensitive are the degree of violence and incidents of
booth capturing in the previous elections, communal problem
insurgency, sharp divisions on party lines and keen contests, the
EC sources said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Uttar Pradesh and Bihar state, the constituencies which
have been categorized as sensitive are in the northeast, Andhra
Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal.
</P>

BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has found no case of "mad
cow" disease, which is creating a health scare in Europe and other
parts of the world, according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yanxi, vice-minister of agriculture, attributed this to a

"China has banned imports of cattle and beef products from
countries where "mad cow" disease has been reported since 1990,"
Zhang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has urged all animal and plant
quarantine stations to ban imports and transit of cows and beef
products from the disease-stricken countries, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Mailed beef products or those brought in by outsiders will be
confiscated at ports of entry. Beef on ships from the
disease-stricken countries is to be temporarily sealed when the
ships berth in China, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
So far, 26 countries have announced bans on the import of beef
and beef products from Britain, where the disease was first
discovered.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Coconut Industry to Recover in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines coconut industry,
heavily hit by three typhoons in 1995, is expected to be back on
its feet by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, typhoons cut wide swathes of destruction in key
agricultural areas across the country, and felled thousands of
coconut trees, hurting an industry that earns up to 35 billion
pesos (1.4 billion US dollars) yearly.
</P>
<P>
The country's coconut production, which reached 2.4 million
metric tons last year, is forecast to drop to 2 million metric
tons this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, coconut exports, which constitute about 80 percent
of total production, are forecast to fall from 1.1 billion dollars
to between 800 million and 900 million dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
Virgilio David, administrator of the Philippine Coconut
Authority (PCA), told reporters today, "We hope to be back on
track by late next year," barring adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
To quicken the pace of recovery, the PCA has decided to
reorient its marketing thrusts to focus more on Asian markets,
particularly China.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to target the Chinese market because, in terms
of size alone, it has the greatest potential," David explained.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, China is also closer than Europe and the US --
two major traditional markets of Philippine coconut oil and
coconut products.
</P>
<P>
Manila also wants to bank on China's preference for crude
coconut oil in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and
cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
"Our only problem is that we cannot produce as much as we can
export," David noted.
</P>
<P>
Aside from nature's fury, David indicated that the country's
coconut industry has to fight protectionist moves in Europe.
</P>
<P>
European countries have raised a proposal requiring exporters
to transport coconut oil and vegetable oil in "dedicated vessels."
</P>
<P>
Among the countries that will be adversely hit by the proposed
order are Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, which are major
producers of lauric oil.
</P>
<P>
David said, "this is not necessary because we make sure the
vessel is clean before the oil is loaded."
</P>
<P>
"We believe they are just raising a technical barrier to
protect domestic (European) producers of sunflower oil," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the world's No. one coconut producer and its
coconut exports account for some 60 percent in the global coconut
market.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Toll Booths Driven Off China's Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to drive illegal
toll booths off the roads in a major clampdown on malpractices.
</P>
<P>
During the past year almost 6,800 of the booths were abolished,
said Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national telephone conference today, Wu called
for effective measures to be taken to halt the erection of illegal
toll booths on roads, the collection of illicit tolls from
drivers, and the illegal imposition of fines.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments at various levels have already made
great progress in halting such malpractices.
</P>
<P>
Wu revealed that 6,745 illegal toll booths were abolished
throughout the country last year, reducing the number of booths by
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the problems have not been fully resolved, and they began
to crop up again earlier this year, he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored jointly by the Ministry of
Communications, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State
Council Office for Correcting Malpractices.
</P>
<P>
Halting misconduct on the roads is crucial to achieving a turn
for the better in the work style of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC), and the government, and the establishment of a socialist
market economic order, according to Wu, who is also a member of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Leading officials at all levels must implement the
orders of the central government to the letter, safeguard a
socialist market economic order, and bear the overall interests in
mind."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that malpractices on national and provincial
highways must be basically eliminated by later this year.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Bids Farewell to Old Iron Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The dismantling of a 72-year-old
iron-framed bridge over the Haihe River in this north China port
city started Tuesday, with many local residents coming to the
river bank to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
The local government decided to dismantle the 89-m-long Jingang
Bridge because of its deteriorating condition.
</P>
<P>
It used to be one of the city's symbolic architectures.
</P>
<P>
But its rusty framework has not been able to guarantee traffic
safety, and it was so narrow that it often caused traffic jams, an
engineer on the spot said.
</P>
<P>
A new bridge will be built by the end of this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> External Investments in Hong Kong on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of total net assets
attributable to inward direct investments in the non-manufacturing
sectors of Hong Kong totaled 686.3 billion HK dollars (88.6
billion US dollars), 8 percent higher than the amount at the end
of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Ho, commissioner for the Department of Census and
Statistics, said here today that it is the first time that
statistics on inward direct investments in the non-manufacturing
sectors were released in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Kingdom was the largest investor
country, accounting for 30 percent of the total at the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
That was followed by Japan and China, which accounted for 20
percent and 19 percent of the total respectively.
</P>
<P>
The United State was the fourth largest investor country and
accounted for 11 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that these figures reflect the strong economic linkages
 between Hong Kong and the four countries.
</P>
<P>
On the conceptual aspects, he said that inward direct
investment in a Hong Kong enterprise refers to investment in it by
 a non-Hong Kong resident investor.
</P>
<P>
Such investment, besides equity capital and reinvested
earnings, also includes loan capital provided by the external
direct investor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Industry Department has also conducted a similar
survey in respect of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the two surveys, the total value of net assets
attributable to inward direct investments in the manufacturing and
 non-manufacturing sectors taken together amounted to 730.2
billion HK dollars (94.3 billion US dollars) at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
That represented an increase of 8 percent when compared with
the amount at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the total value of net assets attributable to
inward direct investments in the manufacturing and
non-manufacturing sector taken together, the United Kingdom,
Japan, China and the United States were the four largest
investors, accounting for some 80 percent of the total net assets
at the end of both 1993 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> hke032942 --Roundup: Australian-Malaysian Relations Enter New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Australia and
Malaysia developed into a new stage as leaders of the two
countries met for the first time on Australian soil today.
</P>
<P>
During a 75-minutes talk, which was longer than scheduled,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad turned a new page on bilateral relations by
committing to mutual respect and understanding on issues of
differences.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he had achieved the goal of the meeting with
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed with each other that if problems were to emerge in
the future between the two countries, neither should hesitate to
get in touch with the other by telephone, if necessary, to discuss
some of those problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting was important, it was positive, it was
valuable," Howard said at a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders put old memories in the past, such as the
former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's "recalcitrant"
comment about Mahathir that chilled bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In a stop-over visit in Brisbane on his way home from an
official visit to New Zealand, Mahathir told reporters that he was
willing to deal with the Howard Government. He is the first Asian
leader who visited Australia after the Coalition Government took
office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he had exchanged invitations to visit with
Mahathir. He hoped that he would met with Mahathir "in the not
too distant future."
</P>
<P>
"I think the key to the bilateral relationship is mutual
respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should respect the right of each
other to have respective points of view.
</P>
<P>
"Don't expect that on everything we can agree, because we
don't. I made that point to the Prime Minister (Mahathir) and he
made it to me," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders discussed a whole range of issues that the two
countries didn't see eye to eye.
</P>
<P>
Howard showed more flexibility on Australia's attitude toward
the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) that Malaysia is actively
advocating.
</P>
<P>
"I said that I understood the desire of any group of countries
that believe they have things in common to meet and to have a
forum with each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not something that ought to contaminate our bilateral
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mahathir had indicated to him that "in no
way was the caucus intended to be a trade bloc," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia used to criticize Malaysia's proposal of forming a
ten-member EAEC that excludes Australia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has again turned down Australia's bid to participate
in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
"I reiterated the interest of Australia in those meetings. He
(Mahathir) indicated that at present it was felt that it was not
appropriate to increase the number of countries participating," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard told Mahathir that Australia was not part of Asia. In
the same time, he stressed that Australia had a cheek and jowl
relation with Asia. He said that Australia had permanent and
enduring interest in having close and productive relations with
the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"I mean, self-evidently, Australian is not an Asian country in
the proper sense of that expression. Self-evidently this country
has very close continuing and permanent links with Europe and with
North America," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Mahathir that the involvement of the United States both
at a diplomatic, defense and economic level in the Asia Pacific
region was "very important to Australia and beneficial to the
region."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on other issues such as
APEC and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir left Australia for home after the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
In separate meetings between Australian and Malaysian ministers
today, the two countries agreed to completely revise a trade
agreement that has not been updated since 1958. The Australian
Government also promised to implement a memorandum of
understanding on educational exchanges with Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Examinations for Civil Servants Expand in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Implementing the civil servant system is intended to make the
government bodies more efficient, honest and clean, as Premier Li
Peng pointed out. High-ranking officials from the Personnel
Ministry said it is a major reform of the current personnel system
to facilitate the market economic drive.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a provisional regulation on civil
servant system in 1993, and the Personnel Ministry made many other
detailed rules on examinations, training, awards, punishments,
promotion and dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Wang Limin has been one of the 13 farmers employed by the
government through examinations in Jilin. Hainan and Hebei
provinces took in many new personnel from outside their provinces
through examinations, and the local media of Shaanxi Province said
such recruitments are "transparent competition" for every step of
recruitment work and has been well supervised.
</P>
<P>
To further ensure the fairness and authority of such
examinations, the Personnel Ministry today invited 22 officials
from ministries, disciplinary and supervisional departments and
local personnel departments, as well as some non-Communist party
members, as examination supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Zhang Xuezhong presented letters of appointment
to the supervisors here today. And they are expected to start work
this year by looking into unfair and illegal incidents.
</P>
<P>
The examination mechanism shall continue to operate for the
central ministries, and to be further expanded to five other
provinces this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Personnel Ministry said that they will
establish a new management system on examiners and improve on
other rules, better enshrining the principle of "openness,
fairness and competition."

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Wang Limin's father did not think
his 26-year-old son would become a government cadre even he
passed the official examination to recruit civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"This was because he thought that his family would always be
bound to the soil and we didn't have the connections to bribe
somebody," the young man from Yongji County in China's
northeastern Jilin Province said.
</P>
<P>
However, after interviews and training, the junior Wang is
today an employee of the county procuratorate. And after one year
of working experience, if he proves qualified for his work, Wang
will have his rural ID card changed for an urban one.
</P>
<P>
Such public examinations have become the major channel
for all the ministries and bureaus of the central government to
take in new employees, and the new practices are expanding to
local governments across the country.
</P>
<P>
Ten provinces, major cities and autonomous regions have held
their first examinations to enroll civil servants, and many broke
the traditional boundaries of different regions and social
positions, said Zhang Xuezhong, vice-minister of personnel, here
today at a press conference, which Wang also attended.
</P>
<P>
This major change has evoked tremendous repercussions in
society, especially in the countryside, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
When Liaoning Province held its first such examinations, the
applicants were 20 times the number of vacancies.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our staff workers were really moved by the scenes," a
Personnel Ministry official who was once sent to the province as
supervisor said.

HONG KONG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's total
exports increased by 6.7 percent in February over a year earlier
to 90.4 billion HK dollars (11.7 billion US dollars), according to
the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Within the exports, the value of re-exports rose by 8.9 percent
to 76.2 billion HK dollars (9.83 billion US dollars) last month,
but the value of domestic exports dropped by 3.9 percent to 14.2
billion HK dollars (1.83 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of imports dropped by 3.7 percent to 96
billion HK dollars (12.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 5.6 billion HK dollars (723 million
US dollars), or 5.8 percent of the value of imports, was recorded.
</P>
<P>
This was significantly smaller than the corresponding deficit
of 14.9 billion HK dollars, accounting for 15 percent of the value
of imports, in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 1996, the value of total exports
grew 13 percent over the same period of last year. Among this,

<HEADLINE> Mcdonnell Douglas Sees Prospects for Cooperation in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The MD-90 project is even more challenging since the 150-seat
plane is technologically more advanced and complicated," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, compared with the MD-80, which used about 25 to 30
percent Chinese parts, the co-production of the 20 MD-90s expects
to rely on over 80 percent Chinese made parts. This is a matter of
pride for China's aviation industry as well as for overseas
Chinese," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to some large aircraft manufacturers, Mcdonnell
Douglas has never limited its cooperation with China to the sale
of aircraft. It wants, instead, to combine its advanced technology
with China's assembly and manufacturing strength and the relatively
lower costs of co-production, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 35 MD-80s, China has also produced over 50
noses, and a number of other parts, such as landing-gear doors,
horizontal stabilizers, electronics-bay doors, and service doors
for Mcdonnell Douglas. The company now also accounts for about 20
percent of China's civil aviation market.
</P>
<P>
"The potential of the China market is high but the competition
is tough. Mcdonnell Douglas should expand cooperation with China
by providing fine service and advanced technology," Fugh said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its drive, his company recently signed a letter of
intent with China North Airlines to jointly invest 50 million US
dollars in building an advanced pilot training center in Dalian
City.
</P>
<P>
An agreement for China to buy another 20 MD-80s and MD-90s is
expected to be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
The company is now also competing with other foreign aircraft
manufacturers for a place in the China-ROK jointly-developed
100-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
Fugh said that as a member of the Committee of 100 - an
organization made up of prominent Chinese Americans - he is
committed to furthering long-term cooperation and exchanges
between the US and China.

for rural areas and employment, today resigned from the P.V.
Narasimha Rao's government for being "humiliated by his senior
colleague, Haryana Chief Minister Bhajan Lal, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Before presenting his resignation letter to the prime minister,
he was reported to have tried to meet the latter, but he failed.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate how he was humiliated by the chief
minister, but he only said Bhajan Lal seemed to think that he
could humiliate anyone, however senior he may be, and the
situation was intolerable to any self- respecting person.
</P>
<P>
Ram Singh is reportedly joining the Bharatiya Janata Party, the
main rival of the ruling Congress headed by Rao.

<HEADLINE> Mcdonnell Douglas Sees Prospects for Cooperation in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- "The successful cooperation
between Mcdonnell Douglas (MD) and Chinese aircraft makers has
fully proved that China's aircraft manufacturing industry has
reached the world's standards," a senior MD official has said.
</P>
<P>
"As an American Chinese, I'm quite proud of this," John
L. Fugh, president of Mcdonnell Douglas (China), said.
</P>
<P>
Fugh was interviewed by Xinhua in his downtown Beijing
office. His relaxed manner belied the fact that he was previously
a high-ranking officer in the US Army and Judge Advocate General
of the army before he retired in 1993 at the rank of major
general. He was also the first Chinese American to attain that
rank in the US Army.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Fugh assumed his position here in September, 1995,
coinciding with the 20th anniversary of Mcdonnell Douglas's
cooperation with China and production of the first parts of an
MD-90-30. This product of Sino-US cooperation in Xi'an, Shaanxi
Province, represents the use of 21st-century technology.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy to get a chance to work here in Beijing,"
said the Beijing-born Fugh, who is 62, in Beijing dialect.
</P>
<P>
In less than half a year, He has already visited all four
Chinese manufacturers of the MD-90-30 in Shanghai, Xi'an, Chengdu,
and Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply impressed by their strong technology base,
well-trained personnel and good sense of partnership," he noted.
</P>
<P>
With the help of charts, Fugh elaborated on Mcdonnell Douglas's
cooperation with China: "In the past decade, China has already
successfully assembled 35 MD-80 passenger planes which were all
granted air-worthiness certificates by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). Among them, five planes are now flying in
the US. This has proved the level of China's aircraft
making," he said.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Spring Sowing in Full Swing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have found they
have been supplied with more, but slightly more costly, production
materials for this spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
A national survey of 832 counties indicated that the supply of
chemical fertilizer can meet 87 percent of rural demand, much more
than the amount provided in 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, the supply of chemical
fertilizers exceeded the demand in Anhui, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi
and Jiangsu provinces. However, farmers in northwest China's Gansu
Province could get only about half the amount of fertilizer they
needed.
</P>
<P>
Supplies of grain and oil-bearing crop seed strains can
basically satisfy the nation's demand. But the amount of cotton
seeds showed a sharp decline compared with last year. Henan, a
leading cotton producer in central China, lacks 42 percent of the
seed strains needed for current spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
Prices of many production materials continue to rise. The price
of farm materials in February rose 15.5 percent over the same
month of last year, according to the survey, conducted by the
State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the supply of chemical fertilizer stood at 23.4
percent and pesticide at 18.7 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
As farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain has risen, the acreage
sown to grain crops in the country will be increased by one
percent to reach 111 million ha this year. But the area sown to
cotton is expected to shrink by 0.5 percent to 5.46 million ha.

<HEADLINE> Daya Bay N-Power Plant to Shut Down Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant
in south China's Guangdong Province will begin the second
refueling and maintenance for its Unit 1 from March 31, a plant
official said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the regular work required by the plant's annual
checking plan, all of the present guide tubes of the control rods
in Unit 1 will be replaced by state-of-the-art tubes used in Unit
2, to make the dropping time of the tubes more accurate.
</P>
<P>
The annual check may take 80 days, the official said. He
estimated that the unit will re-connect with the power grid in
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
As for Unit 2, the official said the exciter went wrong during
the starting of the reactor on March 6, when the second refueling
and maintenance neared completion. He explained that the exciter
is part of the conventional island for providing electric current
to engines.
</P>
<P>
The damaged exciter has been transported to Britain for further
analyses and repairs, which may take nine weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
The official said that GEC-Alsthom has confirmed that the
mishap was an isolated case. Because the exciters on Unit 1 and
Unit 2 are equipment of the same type produced by the same
factory, these exciters can be exchanged for each other.
</P>
<P>
The exciter in Unit 1 will be transferred to Unit 2 after the
refueling and maintenance for Unit 1 start. The official said that
Unit 2 will generate power and connect with the power grid in
mid-April. Before that, strict checks and tests will be conducted
for Unit 2.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the exiter under repairs in Britain will
be transported back and installed in its original site at the end
of May, so that the refueling and maintenance work can be
completed in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the exciter belongs to the
conventional island, which will not affect nuclear
safety at all.
</P>
<P>
Relevant power grids have made arrangements for alternative
power supplies so that consumers will not be affected.

<HEADLINE> Grain Production Goals in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The three provinces in northeast
China have planned to increase grain output by 14.5 billion
kilograms in the next five years, to account for 30 percent of the
nation's increase in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province, China's largest market-oriented grain
producer, is set to have an increase of 7.5 billion kilograms,
Jilin Province, five billion kilograms, and Liaoning, the
country's largest industrial province, two billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this will make the Chinese government more
confident in relying on its own efforts to feed its nearly 1.3
billion people by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China has 13 million hectares of farmland, most of it
black soil rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and
stretches of barren land that is suitable for farming. Over the
past five years, the three provinces raised grain production
capacity by 12 billion kilograms, putting them first in the
country in grain increases.
</P>
<P>
China's cultivated areas account for seven percent of the
world's total, but it can feed 22 percent of the world's
population at present. To feed the increasing population and raise
people's living standards, the Chinese government has set a goal
of expanding grain output by 50 billion kilograms by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang is set to focus on the use of agro-techniques to
transform lower-yield farmland and open up barren areas.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure 10 billion kilograms in grain output by the end of
the century, double the present figure, we are popularizing the
use of sparse-planting of rice on dry farmland, the transplanting
of maize, and plastic-covering techniques imported from Japan,"
said Shen Liguo, head of the Heilongjiang Provincial Reclamation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
These techniques are expected to help increase grain output by
3.6 billion kilograms, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Heilongjiang will open up more land suitable for
farming, use scientific farming methods, and allocate 10 billion
yuan annually for agricultural development support to ensure an
increase in grain.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is getting government officials, scientists, and farmers
to work together for a contract system of building 300 grain
areas, covering two million hectares, in order to produce an
additional 2.5 billion kilograms of grain yearly.
</P>
<P>
The province has decided to invest 2.1 billion yuan in
improving low-yield farmland and opening up 67,000 hectares of
land to add another 2.5 billion kilograms of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, which has been self-sufficient in grain production
for five years running, will invest three billion yuan in overall
agricultural development, and 4.7 billion yuan in seven large
water conservation projects for irrigating 2.67 million hectares
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to spend one billion yuan on irrigation
ditches to provide water for 330,000 more hectares of land to
maintain self-sufficiency in grain by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economists here agree that northeast China's plan for
increasing grain output by 14.5 billion kilograms will play an
important role in stabilizing China's grain market and in
realizing the national goal.

<HEADLINE> China World Trade Center Pays Back Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The China World Trade Center,
China's largest enterprise in the service trade, paid back today
the last part of its outstanding debts totaling 30 million US
dollars owned to a syndicate of banks led by Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
This means the enterprise has paid back 280 million US dollars
in long-term loans more than three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The China World Trade Center is owned by the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. It consists of a
five-star hotel, a four-star hotel and an exhibition hall
totalling 10,000 sq m of floor space.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the project started in 1985, with a total
investment of 520 million US dollars, 280 million US dollars of
which were in loans from the syndicate.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements signed between the center and the
syndicate, the China World Trade Center had to pay back all the
loans in seven years and a half, which meant June 30, 1999,
starting in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since the center started operation in August, 1990, it has
achieved a revenue of over 700 million US dollars, 377 million US
dollars of which were profits and 556 million yuan was paid in
taxes. The center also provides around 3,900 employment
opportunities each year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the center has paid 396 million US dollars, including
interest and tax, to the syndicate. Some 100 million US dollars
was paid in 1995 alone.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Senior HK Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- After a leading team of the
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is formed it
will be responsible for the establishment of its Provisional
Legislative Council, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs of the State Council stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
This means that those senior officials working in the present
Hong Kong government who wish to take part in the government of
the Hong Kong SAR must recognize the provisional legislature and
at the same time co-operate with it.
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying," he told a reporter who asked a
question on whether senior civil servants of the British Hong Kong
government should present their views to the public to support the
decision on the establishment of the Provisional Legislative
Council if they want to serve the SAR government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Chinese side believes that the
civil servants of the Hong Kong government will understand this.
</P>
<P>
He said that it became necessary to make the decision on the
setting up of the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR after the "through train" arrangement for the members of the
last Legislative Council to directly become that of the first
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR was sabotaged by the
British side.
</P>
<P>
This was the only choice for implementing the principle of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and giving a high degree of
autonomy to the legislative department, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it is true that the Chinese side demands
that all senior civil servants express their views on the issue
related to the establishment of the Provisional Legislative
Council, the spokesman said this is not true.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see anyone exert pressure on civil servants
to express their disagreement with the provisional
legislature. Otherwise, how could they justify remaining in the
SAR government?" he asked.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China does not want to see the
British Hong Kong government become a "crippled" government, a
spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yet that will not depend on the Chinese side but on whether the
British side wishes to co-operate with China or not, he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a reporter's question on whether the main officials
of the Hong Kong government will have to leave their posts if they
join the executive leading team for the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), the spokesman said that the first
government of the SAR will be nominated by its chief executive and
then report to the Central government for appointment, not
excluding the possibilities of absorbing senior officials working
in the Hong Kong government now.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said, it refers to a issue of "double
loyalty".
</P>
<P>
In fact this issue was first raised by HK Governor Chris
Patten. He does not allow his officials to practise "double
loyalty".
</P>
<P>
So, the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR will not expect a
similar case in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the Chinese side hopes to solve this
issue through Sino-British co-operation.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The living conditions for
residents in the Chinese capital have improved rapidly with the
fast economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 the urban per capita income
reached 5,868.36 yuan, up by 24 percent over the previous year,
and the per capita income for rural residents stood at 3,223.82
yuan, representing an increase of 33.1 percent. The increase rate
has shown that the income gap between urban and rural residents
has become smaller, according to today's "Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
A survey carried among 3,200 urban and rural families show that
income gap between Beijing's urban and rural areas dropped from
1.95:1 in 1994 to 1.82:1 in 1995, and the consumption gap went
down from 2.47:1 to 2.06:1.
</P>
<P>
There are also differences in consumption patterns. Urban
residents spend much more on foodstuffs and clothing, and
household durable goods than rural residents.
</P>
<P>
The smaller income gap between urban and rural residents has
been attributed to increase of incomes of rural families.

<HEADLINE> Solar-Heated Sheep Sheds Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chifeng City in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made a success of promoting
solar-heated sheep sheds among its herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the city now has 3.09 million sq
m of solar-heated sheep sheds, which have enabled 1.1 million lambs
to survive winter and earned herdsmen an extra nearly 80 million
yuan in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Rural reforms in early 1980s produced great prosperity in Inner
Mongolia's husbandry. However, the severe winters used to cause
large-scale deaths among lambs and great financial losses to
herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Inner Mongolia is the second-richest region
in China in terms of solar energy, next only to the Tibet
Autonomous Region. The annual radiation per sq m is as high as
4,800 to 6,400 megajoule.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1986, the Regional New Energy Office and the
Committee of Science and Technology of Chifeng City began to
experiment with solar-heated sheep sheds in the Bairin Right
Banner (county). Large-scale promotion was begun in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since then, local people have built 11,000 solar-heated
sheep sheds totalling 620,000 sq m in floor space. Now 83
percent of the herding households in the banner use the new
sheds.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the new sheds can increase the
survival rate of lambs to 98 percent and speed up the time it
takes for them to reach maturity from three years to one year.

positive role in supporting peace and national unification of the
Korean Peninsula.

JAKARTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A big fire destroyed the
three-story Pasar Kebon Kembang market in Bogor, West Java,
Thursday, killing 39 people and destroying the stands of more than
1,000 traders.
</P>
<P>
The fire started at about 5:00 a.m. local time on the third
floor and lasted over seven hours, according to reports reaching
here today quoting eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
An Antara report here today put the losses at least around 20
billion rupiah ( 8.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some of the traders were running about in a mad flap to save
what they could. The others just watched the fire gutting their
kiosks helplessly.
</P>
<P>
Twelve fire engines from Bogor and Jakarta were dispatched to
the site, and traffic was practically brought to a halt.
</P>

Fire fighters said that they found it difficult to find water
in the market area, and also found it difficult to get into the
market as corridors and ground floor were all blocked by kiosks.
</P>
<P>
Bogor police chief Lt. Col. Ma Zainal Abidin said an intensive

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has spent about three
billion dollars in its bid to restore peace and self-government
in the war-torn Liberia,said Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has also despatched more than 8,000 Nigerian troops to
Liberia to assist in the quelling of the civil strife.

The troops were "fully financed and kitted" by the Nigerian
government, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi made the
statements yesterday in capital Abuja while briefing African
envoys in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi made the remarks to debunk widely held views that
Nigeria was a blood-thirsty nation, especially by a few countries
and international organisations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over 200,000 Nigerians have also been fighting
for peace in different parts of the world since the country
gained independence in 1960.

still being armed by their allies from within and outside Africa.

Referring to the United Nations' team coming to Nigeria for a
fact-finding mission, Ikimi said, "They are welcome to carry out

<HEADLINE> Turin to Serve as Bridge of Unity, Job Boosting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- From a refurbished workshop of Fiat
Group in Lingotto, a factory district of the Italian motor city of
Turin, a fundamental step will be taken Friday toward the
construction of a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Lingotto Conference center, which was originally built as a
Fiat workshop with one kilometer roof-top test track, will host a
meeting of the 15 heads of government of the European Union, who
are scheduled to ceremonially launch the negotiations which should
lead to the revision of the Maastricht Treaty and the EU expansion.
</P>
<P>
Turin, known for its motor industry, was chosen from the
numerous conference cities in Europe as the venue to inaugurate
this historic event partly because Italy is now serving as the
rotating president of the EU.
</P>
<P>
But a more important reason is that the European leaders want
to demonstrate their determination to solve the unemployment
problem while pushing the European integration forward.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are, somewhat, under the same overwhelming pressure
to do something to stem Europe's rising tide of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
France urged its European partners Wednesday to agree to put
employment at the center of all EU policies.
</P>
<P>
A French memorandum said, "when 18 million are out of work and
more than 50 million are threatened by social exclusion, the
European Union's duty is to respond to its people's worries."
</P>
<P>
The European public attitude to the union turned sour as
unemployment has risen to about 20 million. Italian workers staged
a demonstration here today, urging the EU leaders to put the issue
of unemployment into the agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
By choosing Turin as the venue, the EU leaders are trying to
build a bridge between supporters and opponents of the European
integration by linking the integration to a plan for job boosting
and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The current EU rotating president and Italian foreign minister,
Susanna Agnelli, said at a press conference here today that
employment will have to be one of the conference's strong points
</P>
<P>
He said that juvenile and long-term unemployment might have
seriously corrosive effects at the political and social
level. Italy has insisted that the next Treaty should include a
chapter on "employment."

PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two top European companies,
GEC-Alsthom and Siemens, have signed an agreement to cooperate in
marketing their different high-speed train systems outside Europe
and North America.
</P>
<P>
In a report released today, the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom
company said that the two groups will not create a joint venture
since the agreement is aiming to market their products and reduce
the cost of prospecting for customers and of bidding for contracts.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would cover "financial, human and technical
aspects of rolling stock, overhead connection arms, electrical
supply, signals and automatic equipment for railway networks".
</P>
<P>
After a year-long negotiation, the agreement was signed to end
bitter competition between the two industrial giants, notably in
China, Thailand, Burma, Malaysia and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Siemens of Germany, famous for its Intercity Express, and
GEC-Alsthom, known for its TGV high-speed train, said that their
cooperation will not involve any exchange of technology and that
they would continue to compete with each other in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But for projects covered by the agreement, they will select
products and sub systems made by each partner in accordance with
the requirements of the clients.

COLOMBO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Electricity Board
today announced that in order to avoid a complete blackout, it was
compelled to introduce power cuts without prior notice.
</P>

The Electricity Board made the decision due to rapidly

humid northeast monsoons in Sri Lanka. Rains are reportedly
expected only in the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The Electricity Board decided to impose six hour power cuts
without notice and avoid a complete blackout till rains come in
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
About 84 percent of Sri Lanka's electricity is generated by
hydro power.
</P>

Due to the crisis, the government is encouraging industrialists
to have their own generators by offering them incentives.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang
Province in northeast China, is to host its seventh trade fair
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, Wang Zongzhang,
vice-chairman of the fair's organizing committee and vice-governor
of Heilongjiang, said more than 6,400 businessmen from 39
countries and regions participated, inking business agreements
worth a total of 4.646 billion US dollars during last year's fair.
</P>
<P>
As the fair covers not only trade but also economic and
technical co-operation, and both cash trade and barter trade, it
is particularly attractive to businessmen from the Commonwealth of
Independent States and Eastern Europe. The fair has become one of
the four largest such events in China, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-governor, the fair this year will invite
some 6,500 foreign businessmen from about 50 countries and
regions. More than 20,000 kinds of exhibits in 20 categories are
to be on display.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100 exhibition booths have been booked by
businessmen from such countries and regions as Russia, Japan and
Hong Kong, and another 400 have been ordered by domestic companies
from some 20 provinces and municipalities.

<HEADLINE> Rainfall Not Expected to Quench Beijing's Thirst Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The four-month-long drought in
and around the Chinese capital is unlikely to be relieved in the
near future, Ding Deping, deputy director of the Municipal
Meteorological Station, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Since last November the average rainfall has been as low as 2.7
mm, one of the four lowest records since 1950, the "Beijing Daily"
quoted meteorological statistics as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation for 69,120 ha of wheat and 43,800 ha of other kinds
of spring-sowing crops in Beijing's countryside has borne the
brunt of water shortage, and some 20,000 people and 4,700 head of
livestock lack sufficient drinking water, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of 64 small reservoirs around the city, which provide
water for locals' farming and daily lives, have dried up.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures last winter were 1.3 degrees centigrade higher
than the average for years, which, together with frequent winds,
made Beijing's ground surface lose 159.6 mm of water on average, a
rise of about 30 percent over previous years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Now the drought is spreading to suburban plain areas from the
further mountainous areas," it said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal and district governments have organized suburban
farmers to launch projects to increase supplies of water.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with Beijing's drought, China's largest city
of Shanghai in the east has had rain non-stop for two weeks. And
the rain is set to continue.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts there say the amount of rainfall -- a fraction
under 180 mm so far -- has been rarely experienced this century.

students at 240,000. Some 35 percent of the urban area will be
covered with trees and grass, and per capita green area will reach
seven sq m., he added.
</P>
<P>
The city's total imports and exports are to reach nine billion
US dollars-worth, and exports alone will reach 4.1 billion US
dollars-worth. Realized foreign investment is expected to amount
to six billion US dollars, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years investment in fixed assets will increase
at an average 10 percent, with the total amount reaching 389.5
billion yuan. The increase of retail prices will be under 10
percent, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
To realize these targets the municipal government will devote
more efforts to further improving various contract responsibility
systems in rural areas and strengthen the construction of farm and
sideline produce markets, as well as projects to increase grain
and vegetable production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, importance will be attached to developing
energy-saving and high-yield industries, electronic information,
biological projects and new medicines, he said, adding that the
focus will be put on developing car, electronics and machinery
industries.
</P>
<P>
Priority will also be put on developing commerce, finance and
insurance, tourism, transportation, posts and telecommunications,
and information services. The real estate industry will be
developed at a moderate speed.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 overseas visitor arrivals will reach 2.4
million, bringing a profit of 2.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Development of hi-tech zones, technology-intensive industrial
belts, export-oriented industrial zones, and scenic spots will
also be strengthened.

<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has mapped out plans to
quadruple its 1980 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) by the
year 2000, which is expected to double by the year 2010, Beijing
mayor said here today.
</P>
<P>
By then, Beijing will become an international metropolis
opening up to the outside world in an all-round way, Xinhua learned
here today at the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session of the
10th Beijing Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a work report on the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) for Beijing Municipal Economic and Social Development
and the Outline of Long-range Goals to the Year 2010, Mayor Li
Qiyan said that in the next 15 years Beijing is expected to be
built into a city which boasts developed culture, science and
technology, a sound legal system and good ethics.
</P>
<P>
Local residents become more wealthier on the basis of being
well-fed, and the overall strength of social, economic and
scientific development is expected to reach or surpass the level
of advanced foreign capital cities, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years the local economy is expected to
develop at an average annual rate of nine percent, with local GDP
reaching 215 billion yuan by the year 2000. Counting the influence
of price increases, urban per capita income and rural per capital
net income are expected to develop at an average three to five
percent annually. By the year 2000 the per capita allocation of

<HEADLINE> Rural Migrants in Gansu, Ningxia Build New Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 550,000 people in northwest
China have resettled in the Gansu Corridor and areas irrigated by
water of the Yellow river since a major campaign to overcome
poverty was launched in Gansu Province and the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement in those places where living conditions are
better has been regarded as an ideal method to help 1.4 million
poorer farmers and herdsmen in the underdeveloped areas escape
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983 the Chinese central government has earmarked 200
million yuan each year for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 40 settlement bases have been established
and more than 85,000 ha of farmland has been developed in those
places.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 95 percent of those who have lived in
the new settlements for over the past three years enjoy adequate
food and clothing, and some 40 percent live a relatively
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
In Jingyuan County some 87 families are capable of earning over
5,000 yuan a year from plantation and livestock-raising. In Longde
County, the per-capita net income of these migrants stood at 600
yuan in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Foreign Minister
Tom Ikimi has cautioned African ambassadors and high commissioners
in Nigeria to resist any attempt by the western nations to
destabilise the African continent.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with African envoys yesterday in capital Abuja,

work together towards building a strong and united continent.

centre piece of Nigeria's foreign policy, a mission he said had
been on for 36 years.

all African countries, there is still need for african
governments to come together and tackle economic and social
problems facing the continent,he added.

raging in some parts of the continent should be quickly resolved
so that efforts would be directed towards economic and social

neighbouring countries, pointing out "Our policy is to settle all
boundary disputes throuh dialogue and without any foreign
intervention". Ikimi assured that very soon a meeting of the
heads of state of Nigeria and Camernoon will be convened over
the Bakassi Peninsula dispute.

<HEADLINE> Key Issues in Changing Economic Growth Pattern to Be Tackled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's endeavor to change the
pattern of growth in its economy is inevitable, according to an
article in "China Business Times."
</P>
<P>
The shift from a planned economy to a socialist market economy
and from extensive mode to intensive mode in economic growth
requires prompt solutions to seven major problems, said Cai
Changhua, a research fellow with the Social Development Institute
of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
First, an incomplete market mechanism and macro-control system,
and a lack of more efficient ways of separating government
administration from enterprise operation are the biggest obstacles
in changing the economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the existing two-track system, with a planned economy
and a market-oriented economy, will most help the extensive growth
mode, which plays a leading role in China's economic development,
and is the outcome of a planned economic system. It will continue
to be used in the two-track system.
</P>
<P>
In the planned economic system, a high degree of government
involvement, the disposition of resources, the unified financial
system and the distribution system were a breeding ground for
continuation of the old economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
These factors put little pressure on the government or the
individuals and enterprises to improve efficiency and management,
Cai noted.
</P>
<P>
Only with the redoubled efforts to alter government functions
and make fuller use of the market economy can the pace of change
of the economic mode be quickened, he added.
</P>
<P>
Second, the state-run enterprises, which play a leading role in
China's economic growth, have operated in an extensive way in
which economic growth was achieved mainly by increasing input.
</P>
<P>
This was because the majority of the state-run enterprises were
not genuine legal persons and lacked the ability and motive for
taking sole responsibility for their own profits and losses and
independent management.
</P>
<P>
Third, labor supply in China far exceeds demand and the
situation will only worsen in the course of a shift from
labor-intensive development to technology-intensive development,
Cai said. An army of the unemployed could present an obstacle to
fundamental changes in the economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, for a long period of time, China's investment in
developing human resources and science and technology was very
inefficient, and did not keep up with sustained economic
growth. It therefore posed a problem for changing the growth mode
in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, irrational regional development, technological research,
labor use, and product mix merely served to restrict changes in
the economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, the increasing gap that exists between China's eastern
regions and central and western parts exerts a great deal of
pressure on its overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Cai goes on to say that provinces in the eastern coastal areas
should make great efforts in this area and increase cooperation in
funding, technology, technology, and personnel with other regions.
</P>
<P>
Seventh, the long-time tendency to pay overdue attention to
output, quantity and speed to the neglect of input, quality and
return must be rectified, Cai says.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mayor on Chen Xitong-Wang Baosen Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing government should
seriously learn from the mistakes made by former Party Secretary
Chen Xitong and the crimes of former Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen,
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chen was removed from his post as local Party
secretary for some serious mistakes he made in his work and Wang
committed suicide when the crimes he committed were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 4th Session of the 10th People's Congress of
Beijing which opened here today, Li said: "This has left an
extremely bad impact and caused a great deal of loss. As mayor of
the capital, I should take some responsibility for this, and I
have to face it with a heavy heart."
</P>
<P>
Li added that, in the course of reforms and opening up to the
outside world, greater efforts should be made to keep government
clean and to stop corruption.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the mayor continued, we have continued to
learn from this and tried to work out or improve measures for
fighting corruption from the standpoint of regulations, structure,
and system.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of our increasingly strict anti-corruption
efforts, we feel the seriousness, complexity, and urgency of the
struggle in new circumstances," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all government functionaries, leading officials
in particular, should make every effort to guard against
corruption, bureaucracy, and failing to do their duty, and behave
more properly for clean and more efficient government.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the government to improve its internal and systemic
supervision and to prevent personal power or the use of public
power for private interest.
</P>
<P>
The government should also accept strict responsibility for
local legislatures, people at the grass roots, and various
non-governmental groups to improve democracy.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that local officials should unite around the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with General
Secretary Jiang Zemin at the core, to safeguard the authority of
the central government, and to consider the overall situation and
not regard themselves as infallible.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996 the local government should take greater
steps to fight corruption, including tightening the supervisory
mechanism, looking into cases which involve officials who violate
the law or regulations, and in continuing to assist the Party
Central Committee in investigating the case of Chen Xitong and
those involved in it.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher announced here today an emergency plan to help
Palestinians improve the economic situation in Gaza and the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of a two-day anti-terrorism conference,
Christopher said he was very pleased to know that all 29 nations
represented at Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, two weeks ago are
represented here at this meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Christopher asked the meeting to turn the vision of the summit
at Sharm el Sheikh into "a concrete set of actions that will both
strengthen security and enhance the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we must find ways to support the Palestinian
people as they too suffer the consequences of the Hamas terror."
</P>
<P>
After telephone conversations with Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Norwegian Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is the chairperson of the ad
hoc liaison committee on Palestinian assistance, Christopher said
that "we have agreed on an emergency plan designed to improve the
economic situation in Gaza and the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
The plan will facilitate the entry of construction materials
into the Gaza Strip, thus putting back to work Gazans who work in
construction and related activities.
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes establishing an emergency jobs program
in both the West Bank and Gaza and increasing trade between those
areas and Israel, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Christopher urged the representatives to the
meeting to translate the summit's decisions into a practical
series of recommendations, ones that can be presented to a meeting
of the foreign ministers in April.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that "we need measures that will deny
terrorists safe haven and prevent them from engaging in
recruitment, fund-raising and training."
</P>
<P>
"We must take steps to identify and choke off their sources of
funding and arms," Christopher noted.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Agriculture Forging Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The period of the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995) saw an accelerated growth of agriculture in east
China's Fujian Province, which played a leading role in the
take-off of local economy.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of local conditions conducive to
agricultural expansion, such as balmy climate, and mountainous and
coastal landforms, the province scored a jump in output of farm
produce, resulting in a big increase in farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
As a part of its effort for the comprehensive development of
agriculture, Fujian is developing multi-faceted and high-yielding
forestry, and oceanic fishing, with the aim of making them
agricultural pillars.
</P>
<P>
Also greatly contributing to agricultural growth are the
province's some 30 commodity grain bases, which bear 73 percent of
Fujian's grain quotas, and nine export-oriented bases producing
fruits, tea, edible fungi, vegetables, edible bamboo shoots or
flowers, and raising domestic animals and fowls.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the province's output of edible fungi
and aquatic products ranked first in the country during the
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the healthy and steady development of agriculture,
the province plans to shift its focus to the upgrading of the
processing industry and agricultural products market.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
arrested several suspects of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) overnight within the framework of army crackdown on the
Islamic group, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were apprehended in areas of Nablus, Ramallah and
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
370 Palestinians were rounded up by the security forces in a
pre-dawn sweep in the town of Bir Zeit and surrounding villages
north of Ramallah. The operation was the largest since the
implementation of the Oslo 2 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the cover of darkness, security forces, including
paratroopers, undercover units, and policemen, swept through the
town of Bir Zeit and the villages of Abu Kash and Shakheida,
banging on doors and hauling suspects outside from beds. Hands
bound with string and eyes covered with cloth, they were taken to
large compounds erected on the football field in Bir Zeit.
</P>
<P>
The arrests nearly doubled the number of Palestinians Israeli
forces have taken in since the beginning of the month. The army
said it was aimed at netting suspected terrorists and students
from the Gaza Strip, whose presence in the West Bank was declared
illegal following the recent suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
The operation of mass arrests prompted stern condemnation from
the Palestinian Authority for violating the Oslo 2 agreement. Bir
Zeit University issued a statement protesting the arrest of 10
percent of the University's student body.
</P>
<P>
Lt.-Col. Yitzhak, head of the Central Command military police,
told Army Radio that there is "no doubt the scope of today's
raids is not the norm these days."

CANBERRA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad held talks with his Australian
counterpart John Howard today during what was the first formal
meeting ever held between the top leaders of the two countries on
Australian soil.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir later described his talks with Howard in Brisbane as
"constructive," the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The local press said the meeting showed that the newly elected
Howard government has achieved some success in improving the once
strained relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the trade ministers of the two countries agreed
to renew a 38-year-old bilateral trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim
Fischer held talks with his Malaysian counterpart Rafidah Azid.
They agreed to hold a full scale ministerial meeting in June when
Azid leads a trade delegation to Australia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on updating the trade agreement which
has remained unchanged since it was signed in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will stay briefly in Brisbane before flying home. He
had held a 45-minute informal meeting with Australian Minister for
Foreign Affairs Alexandar Downer when he made a stopover in Darwin
on his way to New Zealand on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after it was elected on March 3, the Howard
Government sent a special envoy to Malaysia to invite Mahathir to
make a stopover in Australia on his way to New Zealand for an
official visit. Mahathir announced his blitz visit to Australia
just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he met with Howard to achieve "good relations
with Australia."
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries have gone through some
eventful periods. Despite their differences on regional political
issues, trade links have been growing smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Indian Farmers Likely to Face Surplus Oilseed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The bumper spring oilseed crop
this year in India is likely to pose marketing problems for
farmers because of the credit squeeze, Agriculture Ministry
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the cereal crops, oilseeds are not consumed directly but
have to be first processed by the industry. The spring oilseed
crop is estimated to be a record 10.3 million tons, but the
selective credit control has limited the buying capacity of the
edible oil industry, which is the main buyer and user of oilseeds,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had further tightened the
selective credit control on pulses, oilseeds and vegetable oils in
1994, which reduced the level of credit to 85 percent of the best
of three years ending October 1994. At the same time, the margin
money requirement was raised to 60 percent from 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> Virus Research Drawing International Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, March 29, (Xinhua)-- Researchers from the international
community are reported to be looking for cooperation with Chinese
scientists in looking for breakthroughs in the study of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin veterinary Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Science, which became known for developing a cure for
horse infectious anemia, has attracted the world's attention once
more because of similarities in the virus of horse infectious
anemia and that of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the institute started doing research on horse
infectious anemia. After several years of efforts, the institute
eventually developed a vaccine for horse infectious anemia in
1982. Up to now, it is still the only vaccine of its kind for
controlling the spread of the disease, a local source says.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the disease's virus is similar to the
AIDS virus both in the mechanism and in mutability.
</P>
<P>
"We may make a big step forward in dealing with AIDS through a
comparative study of these two viruses," said one researcher from
the institute.
</P>
<P>
According to the local source, researchers from Japan and the
US, along with Chinese scientists are making efforts at more
effective cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Makes Progress in Rural Electrification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in east China
has reported new progress in rural electrification, with the
recent approval of 15 counties as models in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The 15 counties, with a total population of eight million and
mostly located in mountainous areas, have achieved great success
in the development of small hydropower stations in the last five
years. Their annual electricity output soared from 1.14 billion
kwh in 1991 to 29.8 kwh in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient power supply has greatly boosted the local
economy. Official figures show that in the 1991-1995 period the
agricultural and industrial production of the 15 counties rose
from 10.6 billion yuan-worth to 60 billion yuan-worth, and their
per capita net income from 704 yuan to 1,805 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has been promoting a share-holding system to raise
funds for power development. In Qingtian County alone, 30 million
yuan was raised in this way for the construction of 20 power
plants.
</P>
<P>
Electrification has also reduced the felling of trees. It is
reported that in the last five years 678,000 households in the 15
counties have turned to electricity for cooking and heating, while
the local forest coverage has risen from 50 percent to 63
percent.

<HEADLINE> Italy Proposes to Add Employment Chapter in EU Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli proposed today that the revision of the Maastricht Treaty
should include a chapter on employment to help European Union
(EU) partners better coordinate their labor policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Agnelli said that employment
should be a major topic at the intergovernmental conference to be
formally opened on Friday by the EU's 15 heads of government.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Italy's proposal was in line with the
Maastricht Treaty provisions concerning Economic and Monetary
Union.
</P>
<P>
Despite overwhelming pressure for the summit to tackle Europe's
rising tide of unemployment, EU leaders remain deeply divided
about the need for new initiatives and the availability of funds
to create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli warned that youth and long-term unemployment might be
seriously corrosive at political and social levels.
</P>
<P>
However, employment is not included on the agendas to be set at
the special EU summit, to be held at a refurbished Fiat workshop.
</P>
<P>
Italian workers staged a demonstration outside the venue of the
summit today, demanding that EU leaders to put employment on the
agendas of the intergovernmental conference, which will last at
least 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The French government reportedly published a memorandum
Wednesday calling on its EU partners to agree to put employment at
the center of all EU policies.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 million people out of work in the EU
countries and more than 50 million people are in danger of being
left out of the mainstream of society.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls on Cambodia to Build Peaceful Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 29 (xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh
reiterated Thursday Vietnam's policy of working with all
neighboring countries including Cambodia to build their common
border into "one of lasting peace and friendship".
</P>
<P>
An official report here said the president made the remarks
during his meeting with Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Interior and National Security Sar Kheng, who is now
on a working visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Vietnamese leader spoke highly of the
results of the recent talks between delegations from the Cambodian
Ministry of Interior and National Security and the Vietnamese
Ministry of Interior.
</P>
<P>
The talks are designed to strengthen the two countries'
cooperation, particularly in the fight against criminals to ensure
security and social order in the border areas on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The talks, Le said, will make positive contribution to the
consolidation of the traditional Vietnamese-Cambodian friendship,
and to the peace, stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet Thursday also met with
the Cambodian senior official.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that his country's cooperation with
Cambodia in interior and security affairs is of great significance
in the national construction and defense of both sides.
</P>
<P>
It will help the two countries build their common border into
one of lasting peace and friendship, and protect both countries'
nationals now living or working in each other's territory, the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Vietnam has "strictly implemented" the
agreements his country has reached with Cambodia in developing
friendship and cooperation, and in resolving outstanding issues
between them.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister concluded that "There is no problem relating
to bilateral relations (between Vietnam and Cambodia), big or
small, remaining unsolved yet."
</P>
<P>
Local press said Sar Kheng also stressed there is no dispute
between his country and Vietnam, adding that outstanding issues
will be settled through peaceful negotiations on the principle of
respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng pledged Cambodia will do its best to consolidate and
enhance its friendship and cooperation with Vietnam, especially in
the combat against border crimes.

<HEADLINE> 100 Billion Yuan in Shandong Rural Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Shandong Branch of the
Agriculture Bank of China announced Thursday that savings deposits
in the branch and in the Shandong Rural Credit Cooperative now
exceed 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Peng Hanmin, head of the branch bank, said that by March 20,
saving deposits in the two banks were 106 billion yuan, up
considerably from early 1995's 80 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the remarkable growth to a prosperous
rural economy and increases in farmers' income. Statistics show
that basic income of Shandong farmers rose by 29 percent in 1995
to 1,715 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of new services, such as credit cards and
direct deposit of salaries in accounts and the use of computers
has also played an important role, the official said, adding that
Shandong now has the largest number of credit card users in China,
about 437,000.
</P>
<P>
Steady growth of saving deposits has allowed banks to put more
capital into the agricultural sector. In the first two months of
this year, they have made 1.1 billion yuan in loans to farmers
suffering from drought, the official explained.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A hotline is to be revived
between Indian prime minister's office (PMO) and Russia's Kremlin
soon, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect is to be signed during the visit of
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov to India on March 30.
</P>
<P>
A hotline had linked the Kremlin and the PMO during the days of
Indo-Soviet alliance under Leonid Brezhnev and Indira Gandhi. In
later years, however, the hotline fell into disuse and was
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
Both New Delhi and Moscow have been talking about a strategic
partnership since Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited
Moscow in mid-1994. The hotline is part of an effort by the two
countries to give more substance to their "strategic partnership",
the official said.
</P>
<P>
During Primakov's visit, both sides will make efforts to define
this partnership and put it in the context of a spectacular
improvement in their bilateral relations in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround in Indo-Russian relations has made both sides
confident to take a fresh look at Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's proposal for trilateral cooperation among India, China
and Russia, the official further said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Order to Evict Public Housing Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered eviction for anyone committing a violent or
drug-related crime in public housing.
</P>
<P>
The president signed a directive instructing Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros to issue national guidelines for housing
authorities to incorporate the policy through tenant screening and
lease agreements.
</P>
<P>
The policy means any public housing resident could be evicted
for being involved in a drug-related or violent crime, or for
allowing a guest to take part in those activities. Conceivably, a
family could be left homeless by the actions of one of its members.
</P>
<P>
"For some, one strike and you're out sounds like hardball.
Well, it is," Clinton said. "If you mess up your community, you
have to turn in your key. There is no reason in the world to put
the rights of a criminal before those of a child who wants to grow
up safe."
</P>
<P>
One-strike eviction has been on federal law books since 1988,
and it has been credited with helping reduce crime in a number
of places.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), the rule has reduced crime in public housing in Greensboro,
North Carolina, by 55 percent, and drug-related arrests in Macon,
Georgia, have fallen 91 percent in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
As part of today's order, the HUD must grade housing
authorities on their compliance with the one-strike rule. Those
with low scores would be less likely to receive certain federal
funds and more likely to be subject to increased federal
supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress today raised
the ceiling on the national debt to 5.5 trillion U.S. dollars,
avoiding a possible government default.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed the House of Representatives by a 328-91
vote. The Senate later approved it with a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's signature is needed by midnight Friday
to avert the first-ever federal default and White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said "the president is prepared to act...the minute
the legislation is available."
</P>
<P>
The higher debt ceiling extends federal borrowing authority
which allows the government to borrow money by selling bonds. The
current measure temporarily raising the national debt ceiling
expires on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Unrelated provisions in the debt-limit bill passed today
include an increase in Social Security benefits for working
recipients and new authority for small businesses to challenge
federal regulations in court.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton signs the bill into legislation Friday, the
U.S. government's borrowing authority will be extended through
September 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators are still apart over
an arms control accord at the second round of talks on Bosnian
disarmament after it was adjourned until April 7, the Easter
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Vigleik Eide, Norwegian ambassador to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said differences
remained especially on how to monitor each side in implementing
the arms control accord.

<P>
Eide said the agreement will set ceilings for the number of
heavy weapons each side in Bosnia is allowed to possess.

<P>
The Dayton peace accord required the agreement be reached by
June 6. If not, the Bosnian government will be allowed to maintain
a military force twice as strong as that of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Eide added that however, some issues had been solved at the
talks but he did not say in details.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks, sponsored by the OSCE, involved the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation, Bosnian Serbs, Croatia and the

<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two top European companies,
GEC-Alsthom and Siemens, have signed an agreement to cooperate in
marketing their different high-speed train systems outside Europe
and North America.
</P>
<P>
In a report released today, the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom
company said that the two groups will not create a joint venture
since the agreement is aiming to market their products and reduce
the cost of prospecting for customers and of bidding for contracts.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would cover financial, and technical aspects of
rolling stock, overhead connection arms, electrical supply,
signals and automatic equipment for railway networks.
</P>
<P>
After a year-long negotiation, the agreement was signed to end
bitter competition between the two industrial giants, notably in
China, Thailand, Burma, Malaysia and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Siemens of Germany, famous for its Intercity Express, and
GEC-Alsthom, known for its TGV high-speed train, said that their
cooperation will not involve any exchange of technology and that
they would continue to compete with each other in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But for projects covered by the agreement, they will select
products and sub systems made by each partner in accordance with
the requirements of the clients.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's national flag carrier,
the Royal Nepalese Airlines Corporation (RNAC), has decided to cut
back its international operations this summer as some of its
routes could not attract enough passengers as expected, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
RNAC announced earlier this week that it would cancel its
Frankfurt-Paris-Frankurt and Dubai-Paris-Dubai flights from April
to August this year, the Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airlines' Shanghai-Hong Kong-Shanghai operations
would also be cut down from the current two flights every week to
one during the May 15-July 10 period.
</P>
<P>
"The Paris flights have been postponed because we have not been
able to attract enough passengers," the newspaper quoted an
airlines official as saying.
</P>
<P>
RNAC's Shanghai operations would be reduced because of the lean
season in the summer, the official said.

MEXICO CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of the Guatemalan

YANGON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been awarded "Gulliver
of the Revelation of the Year" trophy by Salon Mondial du
Tourisme, a six-day world tourism fair being held in Paris, the

</P>
<P>
The award was chosen by the majority of journalists of the

</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from France to Myanmar has exceeded that

Italy, and the Myanmar embassy in France issues over 1,000 visas
per month compared with about 1,000 per annum in the past, the
report said.

Currently, the country is in preparation for "Visit Myanmar

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief: "European Defense Pillar" Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO is close to agreement on
reforming the trans-Atlantic alliance to include a "European
Defense Pillar," NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said today.
</P>
<P>
Solana, the Spanish chief of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, made the remarks during his first visit to France
since he was named in December to head the 16-nation alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a private meeting on Wednesday with French President Jacques
Chirac, Solana reportedly agreed with his host that NATO should
move to give Europe a greater defense role.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his two-day stay, he said foreign ministers of
NATO's member nations will meet in Berlin in June to adopt
guidelines for changing the U.S.-dominated military structure of
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
It was "time to send a clear message to the public that the
alliance is ready to face problems of the end of the century and
the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana and French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told a
press conference today that next step would be establishing
Combined Joint Task Forces to enable the European allies to use
NATO assets, especially logistic facilities, for their own
military operations when the United States chose not to join.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a phase of analysis, of debate between us on what
the NATO of tomorrow will be," de Charette said, adding that some
decisions are expected to be made before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Solana said he hoped for a full French return to the alliance's
integrated military command after 29 years of boycott.
</P>
<P>
France in 1966 quit the integrated command in protest at what
it called U.S. domination, and since then has maintained full
control over its conventional and nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
Chirac decided last December that France would participate more
fully in the alliance, allowing the French defense minister and
armed forces chief of staff to attend NATO meetings.

<HEADLINE> Polish Farmers to Get More Telephones in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government plans to
install 150,000 more telephones in rural areas this year as part
of a strategy to stimulate rural development.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Telecommunications put forward a strategic plan
six years ago to modernize telecommunications in rural areas to
boost economic development, said vice-minister of
telecommunications Stanistaw Popiotek.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 131,000 new telephones were installed in rural areas,
a rise of 53 percent over the previous year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of rural telephone subscribers reached 804,000
in 1995, an increase of 19.5 percent, while the rate of telephone
ownership among the rural population increased from 4 percent to
5.5 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still about 2,000 villages that do not have
telephones. The government will spend 13.5 million zloty (5.4
million U.S. dollars) to install telephones in 1,500 of those
villages, Popiotek said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also implement this year an experimental
plan to install wireless telephones in rural areas as these cost
less than installing fixed phones.
</P>
<P>
Installing a fixed telephone costs 1,500 dollars, against 800
dollars for a wireless one.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian National
Conciliation Commission will meet with guerrilla representatives
in San Jose, Costa Rica, during the Holy Week, Catholic Church
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Conciliation Commission and the Simon
Bolivar Guerrilla Coordination (CGSB) will be a new effort to
resume peace talks, suspended since 1992, between the Colombian
government and the rebels, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Monsignor Pedro Rubiano Saenz, president of the Colombian
Bishops Conference, will present a document outlining the
government's peace proposals to the CGSB representatives, who will
in turn hand over their proposals for the resumption of the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Rubiano Saenz, archbishop of Santafe de Bogota, asked the rebels
to call a truce during the meeting in San Jose because of Holy
Week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Transportation Advance Helps Poor Areas on Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A "Poverty Relief via
Transportation" scheme has brought roads to every remote villages
in inland Shanxi Province on the loess plateau, greatly promoting
the local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, where 70 percent of the land is mountainous, has 50
counties with the annual per capita income below the national
poverty line of 500 yuan (60.24 US dollars), accounting for 42
percent of the total counties in the province.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that the poor transportation conditions are a major
reason for the poverty, the provincial authorities launched the
scheme five years ago. So far, they have injected over 2.6 billion
yuan (313.25 million US dollars) into building or transforming
roads and highways totalling over 12,000 km in the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Lingchuan County in the Taihang Mountains, for example, has
built over 150 roads over the past three years, equalling to the
total roads built in the previous 40 years. This helped the county
push up the per capita income to 1,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, the poor areas still have 3.8 km fewer
roads in every 100 square kilometer area than the provincial
average, thus officials are vowing to intensify the efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The saving deposits of residents
of Jiangsu Province in east China had surpassed 213 billion yuan
by the end of February this year, bank sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the rapid growth of residents' bank savings
deposits is surprising, as the figure at the end of February 1994
was only 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the province's average bank saving deposits
per capita soared to 2,700 yuan from the 692 yuan at the end of
1990, hinting an annual growth rate of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the remarkable growth to massive salary
rises in urban areas and higher farm product prices in rural
areas, both resulting in increases in residents' cash incomes.
</P>
<P>
Higher bank interest rates and the necessity of saving for
housing, medical, education and other major family expenditures
also boosted people's savings enthusiasm, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> EU funds Sexual Health Projects in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A European Union-financed program
has developed two national and 25 provincial training centers on
controlling sexually transmitted diseases in China, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-year training program began in September 1994,
targeting the reduction of the incidence of HIV, AIDS and all
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), said Yin Dakui, Chinese
vice-minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Yin disclosed at a program handover ceremony in Beijing
yesterday that the two national centers are in Beijing and
Shanghai. The 25 provincial training centers have been established
at 11 anti-epidemic stations and 14 institutes for STD control in
21 different provinces.
</P>
<P>
Financial and technical help from the European Union (EU) worth
up to 2.8 million US dollars has provided the centers with
training materials and necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
Lectures invitations have been taken up by 12 renowned foreign
experts on AIDS and STD control, and six young Chinese
professional medical workers have received five-month training
courses in European countries.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to train a large number of Chinese
medical workers in epidemiology, the detection and treatment of
HIV and STDs, as well as teaching them related management skills,
according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
The sexual health program is the first Chinese health project
to be given financial support by the EU and is the largest AIDS
project supported by the EU, according to Endymion Wilkinson, the
EU ambassador leading its delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 over 300,000 STD cases were reported in China. But
experts estimate the total number of STD-infected people at over
three million.

<HEADLINE> New Panchen Lama Supported by Believers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading Buddhist scholar has said
that the 11th Panchen Lama, Jizun Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, is
indeed the only soul boy of the late 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Sarkam Gaqen Cering, a 67-year-old lama from the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Lamasery, the seat of the Panchen Lama, said that the boy's
movements bear a striking resemblance to those of the late 10th
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
"When he blesses a person by touching his or her head, waves,
prays or kowtows, we all feel as if the late 10th Panchen Lama is
alive again," Gaqen Cering, a Buddhism scholar, said.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims flocked to the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery from the city of
Xigaze, where the lamasery is located, the regional capital of
Lhasa, as well as from Qinghai and Gansu provinces. Many of them
come to pay respects to Jizun Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, the 11th
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Gaqen Cering, who is also the deputy director of the lamasery's
Democratic Administrative Committee, said there were even more
pilgrims present when the 11th Panchen Lama is in the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
Many old people were so excited at the sight of the Panchen
Lama that tears streamed down their cheeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the reincarnation of the former Panchen Lamas, Gaqen
Cering said the practice of drawing lots from a gold urn, to
decide the selection of the new Panchen Lama, is the most
convincing and fair method.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 11th Panchen Lama was chosen this way in
front of the statue of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, as the
reincarnated boy of the late 10th Panchen Lama,
</P>
<P>
"All Tibetan Buddhists trust this choice," he added.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the group in charge of searching for the soul
boy of the late 10th Panchen Lama, Gaqen Cering took part in all
the important search activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the search and confirmation of the soul boy complied
with historical conventions and religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
"Jizun Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu is the sole 11th Panchen
Lama," exclaimed Gaqen Cering.
</P>
<P>

HARBIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
provincial museum has asked for 1.21 million yuan in compensation
for a fossilized dinosaur skeleton that was destroyed by fire.
</P>

LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletics Federation (IAAF) will revise the schedule of the 1996

Mutola's chance at the same time.

The IAAF realized its mistake and decided to revise the

800 meters and 1,500 meters.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Developments in China's Urban Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Noticeable developments and
changes have taken place in the country's urban consumption in
recent years with the rapid development of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists have noted the following eight aspects based on a
survey in the 1992-1995 period:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of shops specializing in dealing with certain
kinds of commodities is increasing rapidly, accounting for one
fourth to one third of total number of stores; chain stores and
supermarkets have sprung up especially rapidly. In Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou there are more than 500 such
stores. Construction of large and medium-sized department stores
is continuing.
</P>
<P>
-- Middle-income consumers will soon take the leading position
among consumers of different levels. Statistics show that from
1992 to 1995 the proportion of middle-income consumers grew from
35 percent to 65 percent in the country's major cities. Influenced
by the low incomes of enterprise workers and the floating
population in urban areas, discounted goods are welcomed by most
buyers. Trade-in sales and presenting sample products are also
widely welcomed.
</P>
<P>
-- Acute competition among media organizations. Television has
the biggest influence on consumers and more than 70 percent of the
public buy articles under the guidance of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
-- Urban incomes are increasing rapidly, but the gap between
low and high incomes has been further expanded. Most urban
residents deposit their money in banks or buy state bonds. There
are more people investing their money in securities, real estate,
and precious articles nowadays.
</P>
<P>
-- Most of the public trust imported commodities and products
of Sino-foreign joint ventures. Such commodities of middle and
high-quality account for a large portion of the sales
market. There are more foreign products coming into China for
low-income consumers. In this situation, calls for maintaining and
developing domestically-made products has become louder.
</P>
<P>
-- Changes in dietary patterns and holiday activities, and
heavier work burdens have brought to urban residents psychological
and physiological changes. Occurrence of new diseases and increase
in the number of mental patients have lead to increasing demands
on medical services; the aging population and increasing number of
only children have stimulated services for the aged; consultation
is an service which has the greatest development potential.
</P>
<P>
-- Currently, telecommunications and transportation in the
country's urban areas are developing rapidly. In the country's 35
major cities the number of telephones per 100 people stands at 12
or more; reforms have been started in medical care, retirement
relief and service for the aged, and a reform of the financial
service system is also under way.
</P>
<P>
-- Teenagers have become the largest consumer group. A survey
has shown that in the country's urban areas one third of parents
save money for the education of their children. Some one sixth of
the urban per capita income is used to educate and rear children.
</P>
<P>
At present, youngsters under the age of 20 are only
children. They are the major consumers in their families. They
have high autonomy in buying food, entertainment and
travelling. Meanwhile, they are the group most easily influenced
by advertisements and fashion and have blind faith in overseas
commodities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Voices for PM's Resignation Rise in Dhaka (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Voices for the resignation of
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia is increasing
following the passage of a constitution amendment bill on
non-party caretaker government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas signed the bill Thursday, paving
the way for resignation of the prime minister and holding fresh
general elections under the caretaker government next May.
</P>
<P>
the mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League (AL) have been campaigning for the past two years for
elections under a neutral caretaker government and alleges free
polls are impossible under Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
They resumed their indefinite non-cooperation movement Thursday
morning after two days of relaxation for celebrating the 25th
anniversary of independence on March 26 and vowed to continue the
program till their demands including the immediate resignation of
the prime minister are met.
</P>
<P>
Despite a police ban on all marches and demonstrations around
the secretariat, the central administrative center of various
ministries, several hundred civil servants Thursday staged a
half-day sit-in at a complex housing most of the ministries to
demand Khaleda's departure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, the government workers including 35
secretaries, the country's top civil servants, met with President
Biswas to exert pressure for immediate formation of a neutral
caretaker government to solve the prolonged political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Different professional groups and cultural organizations
Thursday also expressed their solidarity with the opposition
parties at an indefinite "sit-in" in front of the National Press
Club to press home the demand.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Bangla Sramik Dederation, a workers'
organization, said that if Begum Khaleda Zia had any concern for
the nation, she should immediately step down to rid the nation off
the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
Qazi Shahidul Alam, secretary general of the Bangladesh Medical
Association, in a statement called upon doctors of the country to
join the "people's movement" demanding the prime minister's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
A group of ex-servicemen including some retired major generals
expressed their total solidarity with the opposition program and
called for fresh elections under a caretaker government
immediately after resignation of the present government.
</P>
<P>
President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI)
Ali Hossain also appealed to President Biswas to take decisive and
immediate steps to form a neutral caretaker government to free the
nation from the economic and administrative deadlock.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move late Wednesday, Khaleda Zia met Biswas to
request him to take immediate steps to form a neutral caretaker
government and sign into law the bill allowing its formation. She
also agreed to hold next general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) brought out
processions and held rallies in Dhaka and some other areas of the
country Thursday, congratulating the prime minister for passing
the non-party caretaker government bill.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the BNP is facing big pressure from
the people as the national economy is on the verge of collapse due
to prolonged government-opposition conflict. Some policy-makers
have realized that if the situation continues, the BNP would make
a big mistake because the party's popularity has been greatly
harmed by sustaining the power.
</P>
<P>
"Moves are under way to form a caretaker government," one
presidential palace source said, but he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
But the mass circulation daily, the Ittefaq, Thursday reported
that Khaleda had said the parliament should not be dissolved
before Sunday to allow legal coverage for 19 presidential
ordinances proclaimed over past months.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Tomb with Wall Paintings Excavated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists in north China's
Hebei Province have unearthed a tomb with wall paintings, which
dates from the Five Dynasties (907-979).
</P>
<P>
The tomb, located in Quyang County, has a gateway leading to a
door which connects two chambers and a side room by a narrow pass.
</P>
<P>
Although it had been robbed and only fragments of porcelain and
lacquer ware as well as a few coins were left, the experts value
the tomb for its fine wall paintings.
</P>
<P>
The colorful wall paintings depict a band playing and a
banquet. The ceilings of the chambers bear astronomical diagrams.
</P>
<P>
A gravestone decorated with a bas-relief was found in the front
chamber, on which is recorded the fact that the tomb occupant was
the governor of three prefectures in present-day Hebei Province
who died in 922.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the tomb, the best-preserved Five Dynasties'
one ever found in the province, will make a great contribution to
the study of the fine arts and astronomy of the time.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Plank Road Being Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Hanzhong City in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has invested one million yuan to restore part of
an ancient plank road built along the surface of cliffs.
</P>
<P>
The road, linking the province with neighboring Sichuan
Province, has been regarded as the third miracle of Chinese
architecture. The other two are the Great Wall and the Grand
Canal.
</P>
<P>
The most famous section of the road, Baoxie Road, stretching
some 230 km from Hanzhong to Baoji City, was initiated in the
Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and thrived in the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that Baoxie Road, having been
refurbished several times in the following dynasties, used to have
many buildings along it for military, post or trading purpose.
</P>
<P>
The road, with which many legends are connected, was later
destroyed and the last trace of it was submerged by a reservoir
project in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city government decided to restore 360 m of
Baoxie Road to meet the needs of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The project was welcomed by the locals, who have donated some
300,000 yuan, or nearly one third of the investment. It is learnt
that the first phase of the project will be completed next month.

<HEADLINE> Expert Delves into Origin of Chinese Legends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Astronomical and meteorological
observation, essential in an agriculture-dominated society, is the
source of Chinese legends, according to a newly published book.
</P>
<P>
The book, "The Archeology of Legends", was written by Lu
Sixian, a research fellow at the Institute of Archeology of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
After studying unearthed relics and historical documents over
the past decade, Lu found out that legends were created while
ancient people used totem poles to get information for making
calendars.
</P>
<P>
The totem poles told the time or even the season by the shadows
of indicators.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Lu's theory explains early legends, such as
that about Nuwa, a goddess regarded as the mother of the Chinese
people and who have collected colorful stones to repair the sky.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday outlined a series of working procedures it will follow
aimed at improving its consultations with troop contributing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out on behalf of the council by its
president, Legwaila J. Legwaila, the council decided not only to
hold regular meetings with representatives of troop-contributing
countries and the U.N. Secretariat, but also to convene ad hoc
meetings with them in the event of unforeseen development in a
particular peace-keeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Regular meetings should be held "as soon as practicable and in
good time before the council takes decisions on the extension or
termination of, or significant changes in, the mandate of a
particular peace-keeping operations".
</P>
<P>
Further, if possible, the council will hold meetings with
prospective troop-contributors when it considers establishing a
new peace-keeping operation
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security council, who will chair all
meetings with troop contributors, will report their views to the
council during its informal consultations, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement was taken under the urge of troop
contributing countries, which have been insisting on having the
right to be consulted by the council.
</P>
<P>
They based the request on the fact that they place their
military, police or civilian personnel at the service of the
international community for a peace-keeping operation, with the
possibility of putting their lives at risk.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, China's Reliable Partner: Chinese NPC  Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that Ukraine, as a reliable partner of China,
has similar views on some international issues, providing a
sound foundation for furthering bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Evgeny Marchuk,
Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, said bilateral relations have been
developing rapidly in the past few years, to the satisfaction of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk, for his part, said the joint communique signed last
year in Beijing by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma was a 21st century-oriented document.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of bilateral economic and trade
relations has great significance and there is a vast vista and
great potential for the two countries to cooperate in
ship-building, aircraft manufacturing and instrument production.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk expressed the hope that the parliaments of both
countries will make their contributions to and create a legal
basis for bilateral economic cooperation and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic cooperation, Qiao and Marchuk discussed
financial cooperation, the Taiwan and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk reiterated Kiev's One China policy, saying the Taiwan
issue is China's internal affair that should be addressed by the
Chinese people themselves.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said some foreign power adopted a very insensible
attitude, causing strong indignation among the Chinese people. He
expressed his thanks for Kiev's One China policy.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Qiao said some countries are intent on
interfering with China's affairs under the pretext of human
rights, but they themselves have too many problems in human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also met with Alexandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme
Soviet of Ukraine, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is the first leg of Qiao's four-nation tour which
will also take him to Russia, Cuba and Canada. He will also make

<HEADLINE> Perry Threatens Nuclear Retaliation Against Chemical  Weapon Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
consider nuclear retaliation if attacked with chemical weapons,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Perry said that any nation that would attempt to strike American
troops with chemical weapons would be devastated by the U.S.
military response.
</P>
<P>
But the Pentagon chief refused to specify exactly what type
of weapons the United States would respond with in the event of
a chemical attack from those nations.
</P>
<P>
Perry testified to promote U.S. government's campaign to win
approval by the Republican Senate of a treaty to ban worldwide
production and use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
So far, the international treaty has been ratified by 49
countries, 18 short of the number required to put its ban on
production, transfer and use of chemical weapons into effect.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, repeated during the testimony his belief that the
treaty could not be enforced because it was unverifiable.
</P>
<P>
"Nor do I believe it stands a chance of accomplishing
reductions in the arsenals of countries hostile to the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Perry and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged
in a joint statement the Senate to ratify the treaty, stressing
that the United States has the responsibility to promote the
ratification and implementation of the treaty.

<HEADLINE> (Updated)  U.S. Senate Passes Farm Bill Ending Subsidy Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) --The U.S. Senate today passed
comprehensive farm legislation that would abolish price-based
agricultural subsidies and government planting controls that have
dominated U.S. farm policy since the 1930s Depression.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill by a 74-26 vote and sent it to the
House, where passage also was expected later this week. Though
U.S. President Clinton has expressed "very serious reservations",
he is also expected to sign it soon.
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Farm Bill has been under debate and revision since
last spring. The U.S. House and Senate approved their separate
versions on February 6 and 29 this year. The House-Senate
compromise bill also covers nutrition and conservation programs,
dairy product management and peanut quotas.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year "Freedom to Farm" bill would end the link
between prices and subsidies, instead guaranteeing farmers
steadily declining "market transition payments" based on past
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government would no longer require land
to be idled or deny payments if farmers switch from their crop
planting.
</P>
<P>
The Senate legislators met administration demands by retaining
the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps environmentally
sensitive farmland out of production may paying landowners 10-year
leases and by guaranteeing 200 million dollars to protect the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
It also maintains the current food stamp program for another
two years while Congress works on welfare reform and continues
research programs for two years.
</P>
<P>
About one of the most contentious issues, the bill would end
the special tax on dairy producers and phase out the government
support for butter, powdered milk and cheese over four years.
</P>
<P>
Within three years, the Agriculture Department would have to
merge 33 regional dairy price-setting agreements into between 10
and 14, and make prices more unified.
</P>
<P>
The final bill eliminated House-passed provisions to penalize
peanut growers who don't sell if offered government support prices
or above. Instead, growers who refuse to sell for up to two years
are barred from the government support program for a year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the bill would reduce roughly 2 billion
dollars from farm spending over the next seven years.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Discontent with International Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik said today the Serb side was dissatisfied with
the treatment so far by the international community in the
implementation of the civilian part of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
krajisnik, in an interview to the Serb Radio Pale, supported
his views by stating the fact that those invited to Contact Group
meetings were representatives of the Muslim-Croat federation and
not of the Serb state Republika Srpska, which has equal rights ans
status with the Muslim-Croat federation under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany,
Russia and the United States -- held a ministerial conference last
Saturday in Moscow on the Balkan peace process which was also
attended by the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia, Croatia and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said that the international community had shown its
impotence both on the exodus of Serbs from the Serb-held Sarajevo
and on the release of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands OF Serbs had fled the Serb parts of Sarajevo
before the five sectors were taken over this month by the
Muslim-Croat federation in line with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the international community has failed to force
the the Muslim-Croat federation to fulfil the peace agreement in
terms of the release of pows, the Serb official said. But
according to U.N. officials, all the three sides in Bosnia have
failed to release the prisoners in compliance with the Dayton
agreement which demands all pows be freed by January 19.

<HEADLINE> World Steel Price Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- World steel prices are expected
to rise later this year after tumbling over the past year as
global steel output remained at high levels and users wrote off
inventories, a research group here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report of the PaineWebber, a major
research group in the sector, the world export price of hot-rolled
band, F.O.B. (free on board) Europe, fell from 475 U.S. dollars
per ton in April last year to just 260 U.S. dollars earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The price once fell to 250 U.S. dollars per ton at the end of
1995, before rallying to 270 U.S. dollars per ton in January this
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The price cutting in the flat-rolled sector began in the United
States, spread to the world export market, and then moved on to
western Europe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the new factor in the pricing change is that a
large number of steelmakers the world over who are unwilling to
cut back output when there are initial signs of weakening demand.
Individually they fear a decline in their market share, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in production are costly because fixed costs are so
high. "The first instinct of all producers is to export their
surplus," it said.
</P>
<P>
As for the outlook for 1996 and 1997, the group said "we expect
the first half of 1996 to be the foundation for the recovery
phase. World export prices should begin to rise. The second half
of 1996 could be one of a strong recovery in pricing."
</P>
<P>
The price collapse from late 1989 to late 1992 took 48 months.
The price collapse in 1995, during which period the fall in
hot-rolled band prices was about 90 percent as severe, occurred in
only nine months.

LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg announced this evening that the British government is
temporarily banning the sale of beef from newly-slaughtered cattle

</P>
<P>
However, the minister insisted that British beef is safe to eat
and he said that he would fly to Brussels on Friday seek
compensation for the above-said decision from the EU officials who

exports.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency debate on the mad cow disease in the House of
Commons, the minister promised to offer around 1.5 million pounds
(2.25 million US dollars) a week to help the rendering beef
industry which disposes of waste from slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
Farmers would also receive premium payments of some 100 pounds
(150 U.S. dollars) a head for all dairy calves slaughtered before
the age of 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Hogg said a further 35 million pounds (52.5 million US dollars)
would be made available to livestock farmers.

NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition, "Worlds within
Worlds:The Richard Rosenblum Collection of Chinese Scholars'
Rocks", was opened to the public here today.
</P>
<P>
On display are more than 70 pieces of rocks collected by
Richard Rosenblum, an American sculptor who first heard about
"Chinese rocks" in 1972 and has been collecting rocks ever since.
</P>
<P>
The rocks range in size from under six inches to over six feet.
Standing six feet tall, a rock is known as the "Old Man" for its
fancied resemblance to a legendary Chinese sage, which forms the
centerpiece of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
According to Richard Rosenblum, Chinese scholars' rocks
represent the rarely examined conjunction "where culture and
nature meet".

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 200 million U.S. dollar loan for a private
infrastructure finance project.
</P>
<P>
The funding is designed to assist in alleviating the Southern
Asian country's severe financial and institutional constraint to
the expansion of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Bank will also provide a 5 million
dollar credit to the Government of India through the International
Development Association (IDA), the Bank's concessionary lending
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
With the guarantee of the Government of India, the loan will be
provided to Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited
(IL&AMP;FS), one of India's top five non-banking financial companies
and a leading player in the field of infrastructure financing.
</P>
<P>
The project will assist IL&AMP;FS in financing infrastructure
sub-projects to be implemented on a build-operate-transfer (BOT)
basis and is expected to start within the next three years.

Supply (BSES), a privately-owned power distribution licensee,
which was also guaranteed by the Government of India.

program that preserves the privacy of the Lebanese society and the
public ethic and keep them away from licentiousness.
</P>
<P>
Mkari was commenting on the TV program El-Shater Yhki (the guy
narrates), which was presented by C 33 last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our keenness on dealing with delicate issues such as
man-woman sexual relations, we confine this treatment in the
medical and scientific framework, away from any infringement
of ethic, taste or proper education," he said.
</P>

He reiterated his call on the owners of the TV channels to
adopt his pro-ethic plan.

law, they will be punished according to the Publication Act," he

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Iraqi Claims on Spying Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait denied today claims by
Iraq that its authorities had arrested a group of people who were
allegedly spying for Kuwait, Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A kuwaiti official source said that "these allegations are
baseless and a repetition of a new play by the Iraqi regime aimed
at diverting the attention from its inhumane practices against its
people."
</P>
<P>
"They are an attempt to preoccupy the public opinion with
marginal issues and to involve Kuwait in the Iraqi interior
problems while the Iraqi regime knows well that the Kuwaiti
policy is based on non-interference in the internal affairs of
other states."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi allegations are also "an exposed attempt ... to
entangle Kuwait in a crisis with the United Nations peacekeepers
in an apparent Iraqi plan to ignite a battle with these forces."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said today it arrested a spying network involving six
Iraqis alleging they were recruited to spy for Kuwait and to carry
out attacks against U.N. observers along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi claims coincide with the issuance of the
U.N. resolution 1051 on monitoring Iraq's imports and exports, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the necessity of an Iraqi full compliance with the
U.N. resolutions relevant to the Kuwait liberation war, the
Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution
bringing into force a mechanism to monitor sales to Iraq of
dual-use items which could be used for the acquisition of banned
weapons.
