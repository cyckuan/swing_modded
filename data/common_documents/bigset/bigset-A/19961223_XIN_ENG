<HEADLINE> Russia, Iran Vow to Expand Ties despite US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Iran today vowed
to expand bilateral relations in all dimensions despite the
opposition by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov who arrived here
this afternoon for discussions on improving ties between the two
countries, said that "we believe our two countries are both
interested in seeing stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the first round of talks between Primakov and
his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, Primakov told
reporters that "Iran must be a full integrated member of the
international community."
</P>
<P>
However, the visiting Russian foreign minister did not
pointed his finger to the United States for its isolation policy
against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"And in this connection, we welcome contacts between Iran and
other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We should point out that the relations between the
two countries have useful outcomes and the landscape is good as
far as economic and political ties are concerned."
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation and close relations of the two countries are
very important in regard to normalization and stability of such
regions as Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Nagorno Karabakh," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said: "We had exchanges of opinion regarding the
Persian Gulf and we have reached the conclusion that it is in
the interest of both countries to have stability in the Persian
Gulf."
</P>
<P>
"So that there would be no increased military presence for
other countries and there would be peace and stability
prevailing in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister termed the first round of talks
with his Iranian counterpart as "very frank" and "satisfied."
</P>
<P>
While answering a question on the Middle East, Primakov said
"we are of the opinion that all agreements and understandings,
including the Oslo agreements, must be implemented thoroughly."
</P>
<P>
"We also call for the implementation of unofficial agreements
between Syria and Israel. We oppose any measure or step that
would impede the Middle East peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also told reporters that both sides discussed
various bilateral, regional and international issues in the
first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran-Moscow relations are better than at
any time in the past two centuries. "The two countries are
determined to improve ties between them in all dimensions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official visit by Primakov as foreign
minister, who visited Tehran in 1991 on the eve the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Tehran, Primakov is expected to
hold talks with Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, Iran and Russia signed a 1 billion dollars
agreement to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr on
Iran's Persian Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
The United States has urged Moscow to abandon the project,
saying it could bring Iran close to building nuclear
arms. However, Russia rejected the American demand.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thousands of Candidates in Run for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of candidates from
all major political parties of Pakistan have filed nomination
papers for a total of 700 national and provincial assembly seats
in the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The number of National Assembly seats has risen from 207 to 217
as franchise was given to tribals. And it is for the first time
that elections to both national and provincial assemblies are to
be held on the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, ballot papers and ballot boxes of various colors will
be used so that the people can distinguish while casting their
vote.
</P>
<P>
As promised by caretaker Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid,
none of the members of the caretaker government filed nomination
for the forthcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Election Commission a record
number of candidates have filed their nominations. The exact
number of candidates will be known within the next few days. The
scrutiny of the nomination papers will be held from December 26 to
28.
</P>
<P>
Almost all major political leaders had filed their nomination
papers before the deadline on December 21, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the fanfare and enthusiasm with which political
leaders used to file candidature were missing from the scene this
time.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of the candidates are believed to be new
faces in the run for the national and provincial assembly
elections. Former cricketer Imran Khan's Tehrik-Einsaaf (Justice
Movement) takes the lead in inducted new faces.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) claim that new
faces accounted for 20 percent of their party's candidates and
"corrupt people's applications for tickets were rejected."
</P>
<P>
The deposed prime minister and chairperson of the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP), Benazir Bhutto, filed her nomination papers
from two constituencies in Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Chief of PML-N Nawaz Sharif this time is contesting on three
national assembly seats, two in North West Frontier province and
one in his home town Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The PML-N chief this time is challenged by Imran Khan who will
be contesting polls for the first time. However, most people
believe that it will be a lopsided affair with Nawaz Sharif
winning polls by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Following the dismissal of the government of Benazir Bhutto and
the National Assembly by President Farooq Leghari on November 5,
all major political parties in this South Asian nation have been
enthusiastic about the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
However, as a local press report today said the hope that the
coming polls might see the political parties nominating better
individuals for the polls has largely turned sour.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to often-repeated pledges, most candidates are the
usual politicians who have contested in previous elections. The
most discouraging aspect of the situation is that some of the
candidates are known to have shifted their loyalties in the past.
</P>
<P>
This situation is expected to boost Imran Khan's chances. He is
using corruption as a major issue, which is in keeping with the
needs of the moment.
</P>
<P>
Beating candidates fielded by PPP and PML-N, the two largest
parties in Pakistan, is not going to be easy. However, there is a
strong possibility that more and more middle-class people will
vote for new faces.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers End Nationwide Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek farmers lifted today all
road and rail blockades to end a 24-day nationwide protest which
had cut off whole land links between regions in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The final withdrawal of the long army of 10,000 tractors,
parked on road and rail links, came today after the Pan-Thessaly
Farmers' Committee voted to lift the barricades in a gesture of
Christmas goodwill.
</P>
<P>
"We have a deep religious feeling and it never occurRed to us
that we would cause trouble to the Greek citizen these days since
Christmas is one of the greatest feasts of Christiandom," a
representative of the Farmers' Coordinating Committee said.
</P>
<P>
But as public clean-up crews were moving in to clear the roads
in various regions in Greece, he warned that the farmers had not
abandoned their demands but would continue their protest after the
Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance will depend on the government," the representative
said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers want lower fuel prices, higher price supports,
lower value added tax on equipment and the rescheduling of 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in debts.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who had stood firm in his
position that he would not meet with farmers' representatives as
long as the barricades were not lifted, had made it clear that he
would rather "go home" instead of bowing to protesting farmers'
demands.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, farmers in numerous places around the country
had de-escalated their protest action, culminating Saturday in the
decision of the farmers of Macedonia and Thrace to lift all
blockades until mid-January when they will review the situation.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation among Pak Parties Underway for Contesting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Muslim League
(Nawaz group)(PML-N) and Pakistan People's Party (Shaheed Bhutto
group)(PPP-SB) may cooperate in the general elections scheduled
for February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Ghinwa Bhutto, chief of PPP-SB, who
called on Nawaz Sharif, leader of PML-N, at the latter's residence
in Lahore, the capital city of Punjab province, today.
</P>
<P>
Ghinwa, sister-in-law of deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
discussed with Sharif the current political situation in Pakistan
with specific reference to the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ghinva said that both PML-N and PPP-SB were
important parties in the political arena and capable of ensuring
political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
She called for adjustments on certain seats with the PML-N in
the election campaign, which she said could be a healthy tradition
and good sign for better understanding and working relations
between the two parties in the future.
</P>
<P>
To consider seat adjustment, a committee has been set up with
four members each from the two parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghinwa did not say whether the seat adjustments would
take place in the future national assembly or provincial assembly.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also decided to hold a meeting with the
leadership of Mohajir Qaumi Movement, the most influential party
in urban areas of Sindh province, on seat adjustment in Sindh
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
PML-N is one of the two major parties in Pakistan political
scenario but it is difficult for PML-N to win a simple majority in
the upcoming elections for national assembly.
</P>
<P>
PPP-SB, a minority group of the Pakistan People's Party led by
Benazir Bhutto, is trying hard to make election alliance with
other parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The agitation by prisoners of
the Jessore Central Jail in southwestern Bangladesh has been
quelled in an operation by security forces.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources here tonight, in a three-hour
long operation Sunday, 5 people including a police constable were
killed and 150 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The security forces including police went into action against
the rebel prisoners at about 05:00 am Sunday, officials confirmed,
adding that the rebels put up strong resistance with lethal
weapons and the security forces shot rubber bullets and lobbed
teargas shells to disorganize them.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, demanding better living conditions, drove out
the warden and seized the control of the jail on Monday. Although
high officials talked several times with the agitating prisoners
following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's instruction to solve the
problem in a peaceful manner, the stalemate in the jail continued
for about one week.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Displeased with Efforts to Halt Its Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed
displeasure with moves aimed at halting its arms acquisition
program.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides
following a report that the United States, backed by Britain,
favors to include a reference, in a United Nations Security
Council resolution, to a proposed purchase by Cyprus of the
S-300 surface-to-air missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to be adopted Monday for the
renewal of the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, following Russian objections and French reservations
about the draft text, attempts are being made to amend it.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told Cyprus Radio that the government has an
obligation to boost its defenses. He noted that nobody has
complained in the past 22 years about the illegal transfer to
the island of armaments by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus Defense Minister Costas Eliades said
Saturday that arms acquisition program will go ahead as
originally planned, irrespective of outside objections.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the effort to boost our defenses is effective and
I can assure the people of Cyprus that their contribution to
these efforts are not in vain," Eliades said during a visit to
an army camp.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. estimates that there are now over 30,000 Turkish
troops in the northern areas of Cyprus, in addition to some
4,500 Turkish Cypriot troops, making the "northern part of
Cyprus one of the most densely militarized areas in the world."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy Premier Meets Turkish Party Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 22 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz met here today with leader of the Turkish Labor Party
Dogu Brincik and discussed with him bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz and Brincik discussed relations
between the Iraqi ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party and the
Turkish Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed keenness on developing cooperation
and relations between them to serve the interests of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deputy premier stressed the importance of
terminating the mandate of the anti-Iraqi coalition force headed
by U.S. troops in Turkish bases, which is due to expire at the
end of December. He urged stopping any interference in Iraq's
internal affairs under any pretexts.
</P>
<P>
The coalition force has stayed in southeastern Turkey to
provide protection for Iraqi Kurds from President Saddam
Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly renewed the mandate for the U.S.-led
alliance force based on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Turkey has the right to resort to the
U.N. charter to compensate the losses it suffered due to the
U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Iraq and Turkey will expand
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said that it has sustained the economic losses of 30
billion U.S. dollars due to the sanctions against Iraq and
requested the U.N. permission to enjoy exemption from the
U.N. embargo against Iraq to make up for the huge losses.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Labor Party delegation left here today.

<P>
HARARE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Airlines carrying travelers to
South Africa without required visas or work permits will be fined
1,200 U.S. Dollars per person as part of the effort to check the
entry of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The South African High Commission in Harare announced today
that companies employing people without work permits could also
face heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
After years of battle aimed at controlling the swelling number
of migrant workers, South Africa introduced a stricter visa
screening system.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations were introduced in July but implemented
starting from November 1. Some 1,060 visa applications for entry
into South Africa were rejected by its high commission in Harare
in November.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the South African Human
Sciences Research Council, there are between 2.5 million and 4.1
million illegal settlers in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 14,000 Zimbabweans were deported from South Africa and
another 28,000 illegal immigrants were arrested during the first
10 months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Spending Rises in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's business activity
in the wholesale and retail sector increased by an average 30
percent by June this year compared to the same period last year,
the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector which had for a long time suffered from
recurring droughts and increased import competition. But domestic
demand began to show signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Some chain store outlets experienced increased sales of up to
20 percent of basic commodities such as sugar, soap and salt and
5 percent on luxury commodities," said ZNCC senior economist
Edmore Tobaiwa.
</P>
<P>
The rosy 1995/96 season boosted consumers' buying power,
particularly of the rural folks, leading to increased purchases
of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Tobaiwa said increased commercial business activity was not
only because of the good harvest, but also due to massive
promotions done by many retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
With widespread predictions of another normal rainy season
next year, the fortunes of the retail sector looked much more
promising contrasted to the gloomy conditions prevailing the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Tobaiwa, however, believed that the commercial prospect of the
country depended heavily on the government's ability to reign on
its expenditure and to check the inflation which is currently
pegged at around 13.7 percent.

JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- At least South African
 99 schools involving matriculation cheats have been identified in
Johannesburg and Pretoria, informed sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Instead of getting their exam results on Friday, more than
1400 pupils and their parents will appear in court before a panel
of educators to hear charges against them.
</P>
<P>
If the charges hold, their results will be declared null and
void, and they could be barred from taking matric for the next
two years, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper "Sunday Times" also reported that private
schools with exam irregularities could also be barred from
administering matric exams and lose government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The education authorities, which have been probing the cheats
throughout the country after exam papers leaked, said after a
preliminary investigation that a number of teachers have been
involved in the scandal.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 94,352 people died
in Zimbabwe this year as effects of the deadly AIDS virus and
the long-running health sector crisis began took its toll on
Zimbabwe's population of 11.2 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Office, the figure was an
increase of nearly 20 percent over the previous year when 71,758
deaths were recorded.
</P>
<P>
Cuts in the health budget could have been another factor
contributing to the significant rise of death toll in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The strike, held by health workers and crippling the country's
major hospitals, resulted in several deaths as some of the
country's major hospitals only attended to emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's capital of Harare recorded the highest number of
deaths by December 7 this year with 17,352 deaths.

JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 606 people, 77
of them under the age of 16, have been killed by road accidents
in South Africa since the beginning of the festive summer holiday
season starting from December 3.
</P>
<P>
The National Traffic Information Centre (NTIC) announced here
today that approximately 44 percent of the children killed in
accidents were pedestrians due to the lack of education on road
safety.
</P>
<P>
Among them, babies and small children were the main victims,
said Christa Walt, a NTIC officer.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to parents to accept responsibility for the safety
of their children," said Walt, adding that educational
authorities should address traffic safety at school as a matter
of extreme urgency.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rafsanjani's Visit Deepens Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The state visit to Turkey by
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani from December 19
to 22 has further deepened relations between the two
neighboring Moslem countries despite the strong opposition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani wound up his successful visit to Turkey and
returned home this morning by cancelling his trip to the Black
Sea city of Trabzon due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Turkey attached great importance to Rafsanjani's visit as it
was the first time for the Iranian president to visit a single
country in his overseas trip and it was also the third official
visit to Turkey by the Iranian head of state since he came to
power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Before Rafsanjani's visit, the U.S. administration repeatedly
warned Ankara against signing any deals with Iran in any
field during the trip of the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey and Iran signed Saturday several agreements
on cooperation in trade, investment protection and maritime
transport. The two sides also signed accords on environment
cooperation and the establishment of a joint trade and industry
chamber.
</P>
<P>
During Rafsanjani's stay in Turkey, the Turkish-Iranian Mixed
Economic Commission decided to double the two countries' current
annual trade volume of 1 billion U.S. dollars in the next two
years and to set up a joint committee to increase the border
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told reporters at a press conference Saturday that
Iran is ready to cooperate with Turkey on border security in its
fight against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which
started fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey in August
1984.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey had responded positively to Iran's
proposed mediation on the PKK rebel issue and water dispute
between Turkey and Syria during his talks with his Turkey's
counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the welcoming ceremony for Rafsanjani at the
Ankara Esenboga Airport Thursday, Demirel said that Turkey and
Iran are two friendly neighboring countries which share the
same faith and deep cultural ties, adding that the visit by the
Iranian president would achieve important results in the
development of the economic and trade relations between the two
states.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rafsanjani said: "We are Moslem countries. We
enjoy a common history, a common culture. Our economies look
like each other."
</P>
<P>
Following the official talks between the two leaders, Demirel
said Turkey and Iran would make important contributions to
maintain stability in this region.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey and Iran could develop their relations on the basis
of mutual benefit, this will be beneficial to the international
peace and security, the Turkish president said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been accusing Iran of supporting
terrorism and repeatedly asks Turkey, member of its
allies, not to develop ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, soon after forming a coalition government, Turkey's
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan embarked upon his first foreign
visit to neighboring Iran in August despite a U.S. warning.
</P>
<P>
At that time, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the
d'Amato-Kennedy law to reinforce embargoes against Iran and
Libya by dissuading foreign companies and individuals from
investing heavily in the oil industries of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Without paying attention to the U.S. warning, Turkey and Iran
signed a 20-year deal of 23 billion U.S. dollars to transport natural
gas from Iran to Turkey during Erbakan's trip in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hold that what Turkey is doing shows Turkey's
determination for the further development of its relations with
neighboring Islamic Iran despite U.S. strong opposition.

<HEADLINE> Robert Hue Reelected French Communist Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Robert Hue, the 50-year-old
national secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF) since 1994,
was reelected the leader of the PCF at the closing day of the 29th
congress of the party today.
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 delegates to the congress also overwhelmingly
adopted a document drafted by the PCF leadership, which stressed
the party's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, and called for a
referendum in France on the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that in case of a victory of leftist
forces in the 1998 legislative elections in France, the PCF
leadership will hold consultations with all party members before
deciding whether to join a socialist-led government.
</P>
<P>
Hue said in his closing speech that the 29th congress has made
a decisive step toward "a new age of the French communist
movement."
</P>
<P>
"We were engaged in freeing ourselves of the burden of the
past. After years and years of efforts in this direction, we
decide to look with wide open eyes at our tasks for the present
and for the future, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the renewal of the role of the PCF does not
implicate any change of the party's ideals.
</P>
<P>
He again expressed his interest in setting up a new union of
leftist forces, especially with the Socialist Party, which he said
should be fully joined by the people.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the former socialist government of President
Francois Mitterrand, Hue said that the PCF would not accept a
leftist alliance which "begins with promises but ends with
disappointment" of the people.
</P>
<P>
The congress was also marked by the retirement of one
generation of old PCF guards from the organs of the PCF leadership
and the rising to the party's leading national bureau and national
committee of a new generation of PCF activists aged around 40.
</P>
<P>
Among the retirees are Henri Krasucki, Roland Leroy and
Madeleine Vincent, who have been PCF fighters in World War II and
under the leaderships of Maurice Thorez and Georges Marchais.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: US Containment Policy Against Iraq, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. containment
policy against Iraq and Iran in the Gulf region proved to be a
failure in 1996 in various events concerning the relations
between the world's only superpower and the two big Gulf nations.
</P>
<P>
The containment policy constitutes an important part of the
U.S. strategy in the whole Middle East aimed at strengthening and
expanding its political and economic interests in the Gulf
region. But it has met with intensive resistance from Iran and
Iraq and cautious opposition among the U.S. allies both in the
West and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. has been conducting a
containment policy against the two countries characterized by
military pressure and strike as well as various economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It continuously maintained and strengthened its military
existence in the Gulf area by deployment of advanced aircraft,
ground force equipment and a naval fleet including aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson and several other warships besides large
numbers of troops now totaling some 30,000.
</P>
<P>
It has also been conducting regular military exercises with
its Gulf allies, especially Kuwait, and selling military
equipment worth billions of U.S. dollars to them.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the U.S. pressed for economic
sanctions and oil embargo against the two countries which boast
22 percent of the world's total proven oil reserves, in an
attempt to tame them through depleting their economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
However, all this proved to be a failure, which was especially
shown in the two major events which attracted the whole world's
attention this year.
</P>
<P>
In early September, the U.S. launched 44 missiles against Iraqi
targets in two salvos following Iraqi troops helped one
pro-government Kurdish group to seize a city formerly held by the
other group in northern Iraq designated by the U.N. as a safe
haven for the Kurdish people. It sent 3,000 troops, stealth F-117a
fighters and Patriot rockets to Kuwait and ordered a second
aircraft carrier Enterprise to arrive at the Gulf to join Carl
Vinson in preparation for a possible larger scale attack against
Iraq after its troops attacked U.S. patrolling planes over the U.N
imposed no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. operation met with strong resistance from the
Iraqi people, denunciation by almost all the Arab countries, and
criticism and regret from the U.S. allies both in the West and
the Gulf region, except Britain and Kuwait which expressed their
support.
</P>
<P>
In mid September, the U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry
made a shuttle tour of the Middle East and Europe to seek
support from the U.S. allies for its prepared strike against
Iraq, but in vain. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, two main U.S. allies
in the Middle East, refused to allow the U.S. forces to strike
Iraq from the American bases on their territories.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. efforts in "containing Saddam Hussein in a box"
through forming a new anti-Iraq alliance like the one in the Gulf
War only resulted in the fact that Iraq was pushed closer to the
side of the Arab world and it won more marks than the
U.S. politically, although it was seriously hit militarily.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'amato bill
to punish non-American companies investing annually 40 million
dollars or more in the oil and gas industries of Iran,
intensifying its containment which has been characterized by
political isolation, economic sanction and military pressure to
crack down upon the Iranian economy.
</P>
<P>
But the bill harmed not only Iran but also the U.S. Western
allies. Some of its allies had filled the vacuum left by the
U.S. companies following Washington prohibited them to import oil
from and do businesses with their Iranian partners in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
So, the western industrial countries, defying the
U.S. threats, continued their operations in oil and other
commercial business in Iran. They accused the U.S. of
unjustifiably interfering in others' trade freedom. The European
Union Chairman, Ireland, on behalf of the 15 member countries,
warned that they would retaliate if their companies were
harmed. Turkey, in an act which shocked the U.S., signed three
major agreements including a 20 billion U.S. dollar gas deal
with Iran only one week after Clinton signed the bill into law.

<HEADLINE> Self-Service Buses Welcome in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- As the day's last No 52 bus
returned to the parking lot of the state-owned Guangzhou No 1 bus
Company in the late evening of December 14, the company ended its
40-year history of employing conductors to sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company's 1,436 buses running on 78 lines in
Guangzhou have been operating without conductors, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Instead, passengers put exact change into a money box installed
on the bus.
</P>
<P>
This means the company's goal was realized 56 months earlier
than the planned date of 2001.
</P>
<P>
As the conductor on the last bus that evening, Peng Caiyun felt
a bit sad saying goodbye to her four-year job.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she was happy that the change reflects the
advancement of society.
</P>
<P>
Peng, performing her routine work as usual to get money, tear
tickets and give change, said she would be transferred to another
post the next day and was confident about the job.
</P>
<P>
Passengers thronged onto the last No 52 bus of the day and were
excited to know they were the lucky ones that boarding the special
bus.
</P>
<P>
Some said they would welcome the new practice. Almost all the
passengers agreed on the better order and greater convenience the
self-service buses represented.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou No 1 Bus Co. was the first to introduce the
self-service system in the city.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, when the bus service made its debut in Guangzhou,
the novel practice has received positive response among citizens
and has become popularized among other bus companies and cities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Guangzhou Public Affairs Administration
Bureau indicate that by the end of this year, buses from the
Guangzhou Trolleys Co. and seven joint ventures involving public
transportation will introduce the same practice, increasing the
number of self-service buses to 3,390 and accounting for 86.6
percent of the total buses in Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Companies Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Companies and enterprises in
China will be classified into "A" or "B" categories according to
how well they obey the country's administrative laws and
regulations, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The categories were established under a new set of rules on
supervision and administration of enterprises made public over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, to take effect on January 1, were drafted by the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce (Saic).
</P>
<P>
"They are an important measure to improve supervision and
administration of enterprises and to standardize the annual
official examination of enterprise," according to Saic.
</P>
<P>
The annual examination has been carried out by Saic and local
administrations for more than 10 years. The examinations check
the performance of enterprises in following the appropriate laws
and to confirm whether a registered enterprise or company has
maintained the qualifications to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
The annual examination concentrates on more than a dozen items
including production, management and debt of an enterprise;
whether a company has conducted business within officially
approved guidelines; and whether a Chinese or foreign-funded
company has made investments in accordance with concerned
principles or contracts.
</P>
<P>
"All enterprises, companies and other business which have
business licenses must hand in relevant documents to
administrations for industry and commerce around the country for
annual examination between every January and April," according to
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
They impose for the first time a classification system of
enterprises and companies.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises which are able to pass the official yearly
examinations by obeying the concerned laws and regulations will be
given A-class status. Those that pass the inspection but have
violated concerned laws or regulations will be put into the B
group, and will not be allowed to apply for new registrations to
expand or establish branch offices.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also mandate that enterprises which fail to
participate in the annual examination will not be given the right
to continue in business.
</P>
<P>
Their business licenses will be revoked if they decline to hand
in the concerned documents for examination within 30 days of an
official notice, which will be issued before the annual deadline
of each examination period.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Expand Chain-store Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Chinese
capital are expected to have 100 supermarkets and 1,000 chain
stores in the next year as a result of the city's plan to expand
its fledgling chain store business.
</P>
<P>
People living in every 0.5-kilometer-radius area will have easy
access to at least a chain grocery, a supermarket, a snack bar and
some outlets for community services, a report of "China Daily"
said today.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores are asked to be in business at least 10 hours a
day and offer more than two kinds of services involving small
profits such as laundry, public telephones or tyre pumps, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the chief aims of these chain stores is to make things
easy for customers," the report quoted a local official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experience in chain-store management will be introduced
to help achieve the goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Beijing residents have 76 supermarkets and 559 chain
stores.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's chain store business took off only two years ago when
customers began to be drawn toward big supermarkets and street
vendors in large numbers. Many of these stores were transformed
into chain outlets, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Western China's Ethnic Region Sees Big Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 23 (Xinhua)-- The economy in Northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is developing into a stable and
healthy stage, thanks to China's westward shift of its emphasis on
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic region set a record high in this year's grain output
by 7.8 million tons, which was enough to feed its 16 million
people, with some to spare for inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
The central government decided to invest 9.4 billion yuan to
turn Xinjiang into the country's largest cotton base by the year
2000. And this contributed greatly to the region's one million
tons of cotton output, or a quarter of the country's total this
year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of livestock increased to 38.5 million, ranking
second in China.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and herdsmen benefited from the harvests, with their
per capita income reaching 1,330 yuan, up nearly 200 yuan over
last year, catching up with the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is expected to produce more than 70 billion yuan worth
of industrial products this year with a 12 percent rise. A total
of 41.3 billion yuan has been invested in fixed asset
construction. And 30 key projects are scoring good records.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports will reportedly hit 1.4 billion US dollars
by the end of this year. Fifty-seven overseas-funded enterprises
were approved, making up the total number to 800.

<P>
HAIKOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's tropical Hainan Island
is being turned into a favorable holiday resort -- to become an
Oriental Hawaii or a Far Eastern "Mediterranean coast".
</P>
<P>
And tourism experts have predicted that the island may surpass
many traditional Chinese tourist destinations such as Xi'an,
Guilin, and Yunnan, and even outdo Singapore, Thailand and Hong
Kong in the holiday stakes.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese and overseas tourists visiting the south
China province, known as "Hawaii of the Orient", soared by 44
percent on a year-on-year basis to 3.1 million in the first nine
months of this year, bringing over 60 million US dollars in
tourism earnings.
</P>
<P>
As an ideal winter resort, it is expected that tourist arrivals
will top 500,000 in November and December. Bookings for air
tickets have already begun for the Spring Festival of 1997.
</P>
<P>
After being designated as the country's largest special
economic zone in 1988, the long-time isolated island province
quickly took off economically, and tourism has become a
fast-growing sector, contributing about ten percent to the
province's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by numerous bays, beaches, favorable climates, and an
unpolluted environment, many overseas and Chinese investors have
been actively involved in tourism development in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province located southwest of Hong Kong across
the sea, has opened two international airports linking it with
Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and the
Republic of Korea. Over 300 tourist hotels and holiday resorts
have also been established
</P>
<P>
While conducting an inspection tour, experts from the World
Tourism Organization pointed out that Hainan is as important to
China as "the Mediterranean is to Europe, and Hawaii is to the
United States".

<P>
In May, Hainan won a prize for "the most hopeful new tourist
destination" in an international tourism fair held in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Because of its reputation and prospects, the province was
chosen this year as the main venues for national celebrations for
"China Holiday Resort Year", and for "World Tourism Day".
</P>
<P>
However, local tourism experts have remained sober, believing
that there is still much to do before the province excels in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals are over four million, about half of the
number from Hong Kong and Singapore. Among the arrivals, overseas
tourists only make up about 300,000, and tourism earnings are only
one tenth of that of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The name of Hainan is still unknown in Western Europe and North
America, and few people like to travel to an unknown place, a
manager of a local travel agency complained.
</P>
<P>
This, the manager believed, is partly due to the inadequate
tourism promotion budget which amounts to about several million
yuan (8.3 yuan equal to one US dollar) each year.
</P>
<P>
There is also much to do to improve transportation conditions
of the vast island province. Though a new express highway running
through the eastern part of the province has greatly alleviated
the problem, the lack of a railway between the island and the
mainland is always an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
Some tourists have complained about the price, hygiene
standards and social security conditions.
</P>
<P>
But buoyant provincial tourist authorities say the focus will
be on turning Hainan into a holiday resort for international
markets.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, apart from building facilities for golf,
diving, surfing, hot spring entertainment, and appreciating
folklore cultures, problems have to be solved gradually, they
point out.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture in Southwest China Province Climbs to New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture in Southwest
China's Sichuan Province has climbed to a new high in the first
year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that the total agricultural output value of
the province this year is expected to reach 181.9 billion yuan
(about 22 billion US dollars), up 4.2 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Grain output in the province is expected to hit another record
high, increasing by 1.1 billion kilograms, and reaching 46.92
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province has attached much attention to
agriculture, with various areas making greater investments in the
sector. Many practical problems that hindered the development of
rural economy have been solved.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, China's biggest pork producer, has also seen a
successive increase in its pork production. By the end of this
year, some 79.83 million head of pigs are expected to mature, up
2.6 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Production of aquatic products, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and
fruits has also kept growing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the total output value generated by rural
enterprises will increase a quarter to reach 68 million yuan. Net
income of farmers will reach 1,416 yuan, 260 yuan more than in
1995.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province has adopted measures to fire the
inititives of farmers for agricultural production. Various areas
have explored new forms of contracting land to farmers, tapped
land potential, and set new grain purchasing prices.
</P>
<P>
To support agricultural development, the province has also
increased its agriculture aid fund by 40 million yuan, accelerated
the construction of water conservation facilities, and introduced
new agro-techniques.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao Tightens Rein on Sham Performance by Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
Qingdao of Shandong Province, east China, have been found
conducting false cooperation and declaring false deficits, and
have been asked to stop all this.
</P>
<P>
Fifty inspection teams have been formed to examine the fiscal
and tax operations of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that some overseas partners did not put any
capital into co-funded projects, or they moved out their
investment upon arrival. Others shifted the profits abroad by
means of importing at a higher price, while exporting at a lower
price.
</P>
<P>
Another common practice was for the foreign sides to provide
poor quality or second-hand facilities at a high price, resulting
in losses of China's state-owned property.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that some overseas investors never took the
trouble to manage a business, but collected high interest income
from their shares, and evaded personal income tax.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 of the city's 4,000 joint ventures are on the
check list. The inspection will last until February.

Ramos has been undergoing a medical check-up at hospital since
Sunday morning to determine whether he needs a heart surgery, the
Presidential Press Office confirmed this morning.
</P>

said, adding that Ramos is okay and not in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, 68, went to the Makati Medical Center to have a complete
check-up Sunday morning following a systemic viral infection on
December 12 which had confined him to bed for three days.

Ramos' attending doctors said last week the president was in
good health for a man of his age but that he needs to slow down.
Both Ramos and his doctors denied reports that he had suffered a
mild stroke.

<HEADLINE> Dongxing, Open Border City in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A new city bordering on
Vietnam was established administratively today in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region with the approval of China's
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Dongxing township, which became an economic development zone
in the region's Fangcheng city in 1992, has now been promoted to
one of the country's 14 open border cities.
</P>
<P>
Dongxing city, also a category-one port, has an area of 481
square kilometers, and a population of 100,000 of many ethnic
groups. The city is the only place in the country where a total of
more than 12,000 Jinzu ethnic people live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
It has led the nation's 14 open border cities in its annual GDP
growth rate of more than 34 percent, which hit 492 million yuan in
1995, 5.6 times the figure of 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the city generated 226 million yuan in agricultural
output value, seven times the 1991 figure, with local rural
enterprises winning more than 1.1 billion yuan in total economic
returns, 8.2 times the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
During recent years the city has handled 2.1 billion yuan worth
of border trade with Vietnam, with tourists to or via the city
reaching 1.5 million a year. In 1995 the city ranked first among
the country's category-one ports, with over 2.1 million people
passing through the port.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months of this year, the city scored 652
million yuan in GDP, up nearly 25 percent over the same period in
1995, 63 million yuan in revenue, up 27 percent over 1995, with
incomes from tourism rising 20 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the local investment environment, the city
had invested more than 900 million yuan in fixed assets by
September this year, 400 million yuan of which were injected into
urban infrastructure construction, focusing on energy,
transportation and telecommunications. The big spending is six
times the total figure during the 1949-1992 period.
</P>
<P>
Local speedy economic development has attracted many investors,
with the local government having ratified 46 domestic and overseas
projects, with the total investment expected to exceed 400 million
yuan. Among them, four are foreign-funded projects, costing more
than two million US dollars in overseas investment.

 Kissinger: Palestinian Statehood should Be Deal First
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger advises the Clinton administration not to focus
on single issues in trying to spur the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state of the Nixon administration in 1970s'
appearing on the "Fox News Sunday" public affairs program, said
Israeli settlements and other Middle East disputes are secondary
to the issues of a palestinian state and what its borders might
be.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the troubled peace negotiations, he said: "The
key issues are, will there be a Palestinian state at the end of
this process, and what are the borders of that state going to be."
</P>
<P>
Kissinger believes if the statehood issue can be resolved,
other issues like Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank
city of Hebron and the expansion of Israeli settlements" will
become secondary."
</P>
<P>
"I believe the settlement issue should be dealt with in
relationship to the issue of borders, and ... in relation to the
political outcome of the Palestinian entity, state or whatever
ne wants to call it. Otherwise, one is engaged in a guerrilla
action, a settlement at a time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dublin Appeals for Restraint in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring appealed today to both sides in Northern Ireland to
exercise restraint in the coming days, according to a BBC
television report today.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed a car bomb attack earlier today in
Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland, on a 25-year-old leading
republican who suffered leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb explosion occurred less than 48 hours after the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility for shooting a
policeman guarding a prominent pro-British politician in Belfast
late last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident sparked fears that Northern Ireland might be
on the brink of a new cycle of sectarian violence, with loyalist
politician David Ervine warning that the bomb could mark "the
beginning of a spiral of violence."
</P>
<P>
However, Spring said there must not be a resumption of
tit-for-tat killing that had bedeviled Northern Ireland for years.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: US Containment Policy Against Iraq, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to Turkey's defiant acts, the U.S. could merely
express wishes that this will not harm their bilateral
relations. To deal with the European reaction, the U.S. indicated
that if European countries support the D'amato bill, Washington
would be ready to compensate their companies for the resultant
losses.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Washington recently made overtures to Iran for
dialogue as the U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
and other officials said the American government is "open to
dialogue" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the American containment policy against Iraq
and Iran mainly shown by the above-mentioned two major events can
be attributed to many interwoven factors in the whole Middle
East including the Gulf region. The following are some factors in
this regard:
</P>
<P>
-- People have seen clearly the American intention to protect
its own interests in the Gulf region at the expense of others
under the pretext of "combating terrorism" or "defending the
interests of the Kurdish people." Most of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states have also come to see that they could not
always depend on the U.S. to defend them and must eventually be
on good terms with the two big neighbors.
</P>
<P>
-- Close cooperation in confronting Israel has become a common
desire among the Arab countries. As it has not pressured the
Israeli right-wing government into changing its hardline policy
regarding the Middle East peace process, the U.S. would also balk
at going too far in offending the whole Arab world in order not to
lose more than it could gain.
</P>
<P>
-- Both Iraq and Iran have been striving to improve their
relations with the Arab world, especially Syria with which Iraq
signed a number of agreements and Iran's strategic partnership
has become stronger. Besides, the two formerly rival countries
have also embarked on a way of detente.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. sanctions against oil-rich Iraq and Iran were
considered in some of the industrial countries as sowing the
seeds of future oil market instability by preventing the
development of new production capacity as the world oil demands
are predicted to rise greatly in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
-- The Americans, in their practices to contain Iraq and
Iran, sometimes run into clashes of interests with their Western
allies, making them reluctant to give their support to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The failure of the American containment policy against Iraq
and Iran has shown that power politics and international
hegemonism could not always get the results as their promoters
expected. Neither economic sanctions nor military threats could
coerce a nation into submission.
</P>
<P>
As Iraq and Iran will strive to gain more international
support and sympathy through flexible diplomacy in continuing
their tit-for-tat anti-containment struggle, the U.S. may change
its current tough containment policy to a soft one.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediator Expects No Breakthrough over Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Ross, U.S. special
Middle East coordinator said today that he does not expect a
breakthrough on the Hebron agreement during his current trip
which is scheduled to end Monday night, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Saturday to push forward the negotiations
between the Israelis and Palestinians over the former's army
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. envoy met with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu the same day and then held talks with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in
the Gaza Strip late Saturday night to see what could be done to
energize the process.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians over the
redeployment have deadlocked over Israel's demand to tighten
security for the settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians seek to link the Israeli redeployment to
a further pullout elsewhere in the West Bank that was also
promised in the signed accords on autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
Jerusalem this morning. He said he did not expect Israel and
the PNA to reach an agreement over Hebron within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, the special envoy then held talks with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and briefed the Israeli
defense minister on the outcome of his meeting with Arafat,
which the PNA leader termed as "constructive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Ross also informed Mordechai of the U.S. effort to promote
the negotiations on the Hebron redeployment and reach a
conclusion over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reportedly told Ross that the Israeli government is
also ready and willing to advance the peace process and to wrap
up the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai said Israel would have to be ensured that
its essential security interests are not damaged.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister's office said that Mordechai told Ross
that Israel has already advanced toward compromises, and the
defense minister maintained that it is up to the Palestinian side
to take similar steps.
</P>
<P>
A decision by the Israeli cabinet to expand and grant benefits
to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has angered
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Arafat late Saturday night, Ross is to
hold talks with Netanyahu again this evening, in an attempt to
help the two sides reach an agreement on Hebron.

PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- France and Macedonia today
signed a defense cooperation protocol in the southern Macedonian
city of Ohrid, which includes training programs for Macedonian
army officers in France, reported the Agence France Presse (AFP).

French Defense Minister Charles Millon said that the protocol
could be the starting point for deepened cooperation between the
two countries in the defense and military fields.

He also said that bilateral defense cooperation between Paris

Millon is on a visit in the Balkans, where he will arrange the
deployment early this week of the Franco-German joint brigade in
Bosnia, as part of the new Stabilization Force (SFOR) of NATO.

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Israeli Ties Should Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel should
strengthen bilateral cooperation in an all-round way regardless
of domestic political changes, an Israeli envoy has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Turkish Daily News, which was
published today, Zevi Elpeleg, Israel's ambassador to Ankara,
said that growing Turkish-Israeli relationship was a reflection
of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
The driving force in developing the ties between the two
countries was the existence of pervasive mutual interests, which
have nothing to do with changes of both leaders and governments,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On some Arab countries' criticism on Turkish-Israeli ties,
Elpeleg said that the relations between Turkey and Israel were
not different from those of these countries with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Israeli ambassador also touched on a
host of other issues, including military cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The recent cooperation between Turkey and Israel has
reportedly aroused sharp criticism from some Arab countries,
especially after Turkey and the Jewish state started cooperation
in the defense field.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. DC-8 cargo plane
crashed Sunday evening in southwest Virginia and there was no
apparent survival of people on board, an Associated Press report
said.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many people were on the
plane. The Airborne Express officials said there were six people
while the Federal Aviation Administration suggested three.
</P>
<P>
The plane, flying for Airborne Express' subsidiary ABX Air,
based in Wilmington, Ohio, crashed at about 6:15 p.m. local time
(0:15 GMT Monday) in the Wolf Creek Mountain, near Virginia's
Jefferson National Forest. The crash occurred during a steady
rain, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the plane was flying from Greensboro, North
Carolina, to Wilmington, Ohio, on a maintenance trip and wasn't
carrying cargo, state police Sgt. L.W. Findley was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Virginia State police said there was no indication of any
survival in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The crash site was in a remote area and it is accessible only
by fire trails. Freezing rain was hampering efforts to fly a
helicopter to the site.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Help Vietnam in Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to offer
assistance to Vietnam to help it improve its national budgeting
methods and set up a value-added-tax system, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has expressed its desire for Thai assistance in these
areas at a recent bilateral meeting on finance and banking in
Hanoi, Mr. Chatumongkol Sonakul, permanent-secretary of the Thai
Finance Ministry, was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chatumongkok, who is also the chairman of Thailand-Vietnam
Joint Committee on Finance, said that Vietnam plans to change its
methods for formulating its national budget next year and the
country wishes to model the process after Thailand's budget act.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also expressed the wish to use the Thai value added tax
(VAT) system to help build up its own VAT system next year at the
joint committee meeting on cooperation in finance and banking, the
Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam believes that the existing system and practices of tax
collection in Thailand are applicable to Vietnam's conditions, as
it is not too technically advanced like those in western countries
where the tax systems are fully-computerized, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the emerging economies like Vietnam, foreign investments are
generally discouraged by uncertainties in rules and regulations,
and having an internationally accepted financial system would
clear the smoke for foreign investors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chatumongkok said that Vietnam also hopes to set up a stock
market within 1997 and Thailand will send experts to help Vietnam
to study the establishment of the market.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Rocks Track and Field World (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Three days after the fatal
bomb in the heart of Atlanta, Michael Johnson culminated all his
rage and energy in a humid summer night, rocking the world with an
even more dynamic explosion in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
The fabulous 19.32 seconds at the Olympics was an incredible
new world record and ultimatedly concluded the American's
unprecedented misison of the first men's Olympic 200-400 meters
double.
</P>
<P>
The bigoted American press immediately dubbed the 200m winner
as "the fastest man in the world", which ignited a vigorous debate
right away.
</P>
<P>
Donovan Bailey, a 28-year-old Jamaica-born Canadian, also did
something as miraculous on the Olympic track. The world champion
bolted off the blocks like a storm under the blue, obliterating
the men's 100m world record with a splendid 9.84 seconds, but he
found the fastest 100 meters still left him playing second fiddle
to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
As was expected, Johnson's phenomenal feat brought him the
honor of the Athlete of the Year, plus the Jesse Owens Award in a
third record time.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians claimed the world fastest flying sprinter should
go to Bailey, while the Americans insist that Johnson have every
reason to get the crown.
</P>
<P>
The controversy resulted in a bizarre showdown over 150 meters
between the two track giants, and the race was tipped "The
Challenge of Champions, " which slated to start on May 31 in
Toronto, Canada, next year.
</P>
<P>
A huge amount of money paved the way and brought the two
nemeses together. Obviously, the race can settle nothing, but it
offers each man 500,000 U.S. dollars as appearance fees, with the
winner taking home another one million.
</P>
<P>
During the Olympics in Atlanta, many defending champions lost
their laurels, but not so for Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Only few people believed that at 35 he could win the long jump
title, but the American twice delivered a big leap when it
mattered most.
</P>
<P>
Lewis astounded the world by winning his fourth straight
Olympic title in the same event, becoming the joint second person
in history with nine Olympic golds.
</P>
<P>
If Johnson was the king of Atlanta, then Lewis was the brightest
star of the Olympic pantheon.

The Centennial Games also saw Merlene Ottey of Jamaica lose her
final chance to win a gold in the 100 meters final in a
heart-broken manner. The 36-year-old was nipped again at the line
by American Gail Devers, a repeat scene at the World Championships
in 1993. That saddly ended Ottey's dream of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Ottey hit her top form at the Grand Prix final in
October, beating Devers soundly in the 100 meters with the year's
fastest clocking of 10.78 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Marie-Jose Perec of France emulated Johnson at the Atlanta
Games by sweeping the women's 200 and 400m gold medals, yet she
failed to make a big splash in the athletics world and had to rank
second to Devers in a poll dominated by American journalists.
</P>
<P>
China's Wang Junxia, who stunned the statisticians three years
ago when she slashed 42 seconds off the world 10,000m record and
grabbed the Award of Jesse Owens in 1993, came back strongly this
season by winning the 5,000m gold and 10,000m silver in
Atlanta. The slim Chinese was the only runner, both men and women,
to cover two distance events during the Games.
</P>
<P>
Russian Svetlana Masterkova, who had taken three years out to
have a baby, chalked up the women's 800-1,500m Olympic double with
ease. After the Games, she went on to smash world best times in
the 1,000 meters and mile.
</P>
<P>
The heat of the track and field didn't fade after the world
stars shifted their battle arena from Atlanta to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Salah Hissou reduced an already impressive world
10,000m record to 26:36.08 seconds in the Brussels Grand Prix last
August.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Komen, who coule not even qualify for the Kenyan Olympic
team, destroyed the world 3,000m and two-mile best marks.
</P>
<P>
A bunch of world records and world best marks fell during the
tumultuous year.
</P>
<P>
Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic improved his javelin world
record to another dimension in May, hurling the spear to 98.48
meters. George Emma of Australia bettered the women's pole vault
record and Melinte Mihaela of Romania set a new world mark in the
women's hammer.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletics Federation announced some
good news to the world elite at the end of the year. The IAAF will
take out 10 million U.S. dollars for athletes as prize money next
year for the Grand Prix circuit.
</P>
<P>
Prize money will be awarded at the World Indoor and Outdoor
Championships for the first time as well as at the Grand Prix
finals.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Undergoes Carotid Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today successfully underwent a minor operation on his neck
to tear off a carotid block caused by cholesterol deposits,
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres confirmed.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Ramos' health, Torres read out a
medical bulletin prepared by Ramos' surgical team.
</P>
<P>
The medical bulletin said the carotid blockage was removed from
Ramos' vein on the right side of his neck during the
more-than-one-hour-long operation performed at 7:45 a.m. at the
Makati Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, 68, is now conscious and all vital signs are within
normal limits, the bulletin said, adding that the surgical team is
confident that the president may be out of the hospital either on
Christmas day or after.
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, Vice President Joseph Estrada said
Ramos is still performing his duty and there is no need for him to
take over as acting president.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva denied an earlier press
release from the Presidential Press Office, which said Ramos might
need a heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
According to today's medical bulletin, significant cholesterol
deposits were found in Ramos' carotid during examinations
conducted when he was found suffering a systemic viral infection
on December 12. Another test performed Sunday afternoon showed
Ramos had a carotid block which can lead to stroke.
</P>
<P>
Ramos had been confined in the Makati Medical Center from
December 12 to 14 because of the alleged viral infection. Earlier
newspaper reports said Ramos might suffer a mild stroke instead of
the so-called infection, but the reports were denied by both Ramos
and his doctors.

<HEADLINE> Philippine International Reserves Surpass Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) reached 11.8 billion U.S. dollars as
of last Friday, higher than the planned target of 10.1 billion
dollars for the whole year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The heavy influx of workers' remittances and regular
intervention in the foreign exchange market by the Philippine
central bank pushed the country's international reserves to
increase steadily since early this year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A healthy GIR level assures a country's ability to service its
debts and finance its imports. It consists of the central bank's
gold holdings, foreign exchange and special drawing rights -- an
artificial basket of currency created by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Officials at the central bank were quoted as saying the new GIR
level was accumulated despite the government's scheduled foreign
debt payment of 200 million dollars for this month. The present
GIR level is equivalent to more than three months worth of import
payments, they said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank treasury head Sergio Edeza was quoted as saying
heavy inflows, both in workers' remittances and investments, have
led them to more actively intervene in the foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the central bank set its targeted GIR level
at 10.1 billion dollars after consultations with the IMF.

DHAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A corruption case has been filed

<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government loses
900,000 US Dollars monthly in taxes due to smuggling of
cigarettes into the country, reported the local daily the New
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Allan Bull, Finance Director of British-American Tobacco (BAT)
Uganda, was quoted as saying here on Saturday, ''smuggling of
cigarettes into the country from Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda has
underminded the performance of BAT bands in the country.''
</P>
<P>
He said 1996 has been a great challenge for BAT Uganda in the
area of business, due to competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we are not afraid of competition provided it is
principled and fair and that the ground rules are in place and
observed by every player in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
Bull expressed the company's commitment to investing in Uganda
continuously.
</P>
<P>
BAT Uganda, which holds the monopoly of the country's tobacco
industry, is a multi-national company, formed in 1984 with the
BAT owning 70 percent of the shares and the Ugandan government 30
percent. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hutchison Whampoa to Help Build Container Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong giant Hutchison
Whampoa Group is helping to develop a container terminal in the
port of Xiamen across the straits from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison is the owner of HIT (Hongkong International
Terminal), which is one of the world's largest container terminal
operations.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent agreement, the Xiamen International
Terminal Co. Ltd., a joint venture between Hutchison and Xiamen
Haicang Port Co. Ltd., will invest 900 million yuan (10.8 million
US dollars) in the Haicang Port Area terminal. Hutchison will
provide 41 percent of the financing, and the remainder will come
from the Xiamen company.
</P>
<P>
The No.2 and No.3 berths now in trial operation and the
surrounding area will be the Xiamen company's responsibility,
while Hutchison will buy equipment and support facilities.
</P>
<P>
The deep-water coastal area that extends for 10 kilometers
around the port, is known as the finest in the Xiamen area.
</P>
<P>
The development is of great importance for building Xiamen into
a modern port city and to pave the way for a direct connection
between Xiamen and Taiwan, local port authorities say.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed by the end of 1997, it is
expected that the annual container handling capacity of Xiamen
Port will be increased from the present 400,000 standard
containers to 500,000.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Promotes Wage System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in Shenzhen,
China's first special economic zone in Guangdong Province, have
been given a free rein to decide their own wage distribution
levels.
</P>
<P>
A local official said the city government does not interfere in
enterprises' total salary volume or individual distribution. It
only pays attention to planning, supervision and provision of
services.
</P>
<P>
The conventional eight-grade wage structure is being replaced
by a system of personal contract responsibility, piecework and
timework wages.
</P>
<P>
"My income increased several times as much thanks to the wage
reform, reflecting the principle of distribution according to
work," said one worker.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has achieved good results in its wage reform. The per
capita salary of workers income increased by 16.2 percent last
year, a 13.5 percent drop over the previous year, and also lower
than the increases of the GDP and the GDP per capita.
</P>
<P>
A new wage framework is taking shape in Shenzhen based on a
market-oriented system, independent distribution and government
macro-supervision.
</P>
<P>
The new system is characterized by the practice of minimum
wages, tax levies on high income earners and setting guidelines
for enterprises' salary distribution.

HARARE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Higher
Education is conducting investigations into allegations of fraud at
the University of Zimbabwe after discovering that the government had
been paying out millions of dollars to more than 1,000 non-existent
students, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education Ignatius Chombo confirmed that his

He said, ''We are carrying out investigations so that the law

Meanwhile, Chombo was concerned over the declining intake of
students at the University of Zimbabwe, saying it was unacceptable
considering that there was a serious shortage of universities in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the university was being underutilised. Currently,
there is 38 percent use of university buildings. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zambia Loses 200,000 Hectares of Forests Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia loses about 200,000
hectares of forests annually and there would be no more woodland
in the country in 50 years if the rate at which woodlands are
being destroyed continues unchecked.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made in a Catholic bulletin by a Catholic
Jesuit Priest Ronald Lesseps based at Kasisi Agricultural
Training Center.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Lesseps as attributing the forest
vanishing to population pressure, need for people to earn money,
the breakdown of traditional hierarchies and inadequate sectoral
policies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last January, Zambian Deputy Environment Minister
Gibson Nkausu attributed the large scale destruction of forests
in the country to charcoal burning and illegal settlements in
forest reserves. At present most of Zambian families are using
charcoal as their main fuels.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ruling Party to Continue Campaign After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling People's Action
Party (PAP) of Singapore pledged to continue hard campaign to win
all contested seats, although it has gained a majority in
Parliament on the nomination day today for the general election.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made the comment after
his team retained Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency
(GRC) unopposed.
</P>
<P>
At lunch time today, the PAP was assured to keep power as
nominations for the country's eighth general election closed. It
was unopposed in nine wards, all of them being GRCs.
</P>
<P>
This gave the PAP 47 seats in the 83-seat Parliament, with 36
other seats to be decided on the election day, which is yet to be
announced by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Lee Hsien Loong attributed his team's
victory to the opposition's inability to find credible candidates.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the opposition's by-election strategy would
not pose a problem for the ruling party in the election.
</P>
<P>
This was because Singaporeans realize their future prosperity
would be affected by whom they voted for, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting remarks made by the opposition that using housing
upgrading as incentive was unfair, Lee said that it was only right
that those who supported PAP policies receive upgrading first.
</P>
<P>
However, this did not mean that flats in opposition wards would
not be upgraded. They would just have to wait longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said after the PAP's
walkover at his constituency of Sembawang GRC that he was not too
worried about the percentage of votes the PAP will win in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
He said this was not a major factor because the number of
constituencies varied with every election.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, what was absolutely important was the overall
number of seats the PAP can win.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects VOA Reports on Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's nuclear power
authorities issued a statement Sunday, denying any program for
nuclear weapons, the official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Iran's Atomic Energy Organization
(IAEO) in a response to a VOA report on Iran's atomic program and
its construction of underground columns in the southern city of
Yazd.
</P>
<P>
The IAEO noted in the statement that the construction of the
Bushehr atomic power plant was an "undeniable right" of the
Iranian nation for attaining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Iran has time and again stressed that its activities were
based on peaceful purpose, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles created by the United States, it said,
Iran was to benefit from its huge investment in cooperation with
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the generation of
electricity required to meet the domestic shortage and
ever-growing energy need.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Iranian government has been a proponent of an
open door policy concerning the area of nuclear activity for
peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
The statement added Iran has always welcomed periodical
visits by the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
The statement stated "if there was a country in the world
which possessed valid proofs or documents against the Islamic
Republic of Iran which proves otherwise, we would like them to
submit them to the IAEO for a close scrutiny and that the
U.S. and Israeli empty accusations leveled against the Islamic
Republic of Iran are totally unfounded and entirely baseless."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the VOA's report on the construction of the
underground columns in the southern city of Yazd, the IAEO said,
"it was clear to the mining engineering experts that digging
tunnels and constructing columns were essential parts of mining
activities to guarantee the safety of the miners."
</P>
<P>
However, it added, the U.S. government's and the Israeli
regime's enmity toward Iran has made them suspicious of the
mining activities going on in Yazd.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that no country would carry out and conduct
underground nuclear detonation test in the uranium mines.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it added, Darkhoyen site, once proposed as a center
for the construction of nuclear power plant after 1979, was
totally destroyed during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and is now
under the administration of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
(IRGC).

<HEADLINE> Commercial Farming Threatened by Crime in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Commercial farming
activities in South Africa have been seriously affected by the
high incidence of crimes, said a source obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
The Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU), the largest of its
kind in South Africa, claimed that commercial agriculture, the
most important sector in the economy, is being crippled by the
authorities' inability to maintain law and order.
</P>
<P>
TAU President Dries Bruwer said in Pietersburg at the weekend
that the economies in some provinces, such as Northern Province,
are seriously threatened with collapse due to criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
In calling on farmers to establish their own self-protection
units, Bruwer said farmers could not allow criminals to dictate
their future in the country, but they would have to be vigilant
and bring criminals to book.
</P>
<P>
"If the authorities cannot guarantee the safety of farmers, we
will do the work of the overworked and demoralized police
service," said Bruwer.
</P>
<P>
However, he also urged farmers not to take the law into their
own hands, but to hand suspects over to the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's ruling People's
Action Party (PAP) was returned to power as it won a walkover
major in the Parliament when nominations for the general election
closed today.
</P>
<P>
The party was unopposed in nine wards, all of them Group
Representation Constituencies (GRCs). This allowed the PAP 47
seats in the 83-member Parliament, with the other 36 seats to be
decided on the election day, which will be announced by Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong later today.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that given the situation, there would be
straight contests between the PAP and an opposition party in seven
single constituencies, while there would also be a three-cornered
fight in Bukit Gombak and a four-cornered fight in Chua Chu Kang.
</P>
<P>
In all the six contested GRCs, there would be two-party
contests between the PAP and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp fielded a total of 39 candidates from five
parties and one independent candidate to contest the election.
</P>
<P>
The nine walkover GRCs are Marine Parade, Sembawang, Tanjong
Pagar, East Coast, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan-Toa Payoh, Bukit Timah,
Kreta Ayer-Tanglin, and Tampines.
</P>
<P>
Of the 47 PAP candidates who have already been returned due to
the walkovers, there are Prime Minster Goh Chok Tong, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Tony Tan, Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar,
Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng and Communications Minister
Mah Bow Tan.

<HEADLINE> S. African Broadcaster Denies Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has categorically denied reports
it is on the margin of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
It is "abominable journalism", South African Press Association
quoted SABC's Marketing and Communications Manager Enoch Sithole as
saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sithole was reacting to a report that quoted SABC TV head Jill
Chisholm as saying that unless the SABC received financial help from
either the government or a finacial institution within the next few
weeks, it would be unable to pay its employees' salaries by February.
</P>
<P>
Sithole said SABC indeed had noticed it was in the red in its
implementation of public broadcasting mandate, but the deficit could
be recovered by its cash reserves and did not therefore constitute
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that SABC was a self-sufficient organization which
would be able to run and fund its own operations.
</P>
<P>
Following the allegations that SABC is concealing the deficit
secret, the opposition National Party, a major party for the
white people in South Africa, has called for an independent
investigation into SABC's management and financial matters.

<P>
In addition to the nine walkover GRCs, the remaining six GRCs
will see straight fights between the PAP and opposition
candidates.
</P>
<P>
In Aljunied GRC, the PAP team led by Health Minister George Yeo
is challenged by a Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) team headed by
its vice-chairman Wong Hong Toy.
</P>
<P>
The Chen San GRC will see the PAP team led by Education
Minister Lee Yock Suan meeting the Workers' Party (WP) team led by
its secretary-general J.B. Jeyaretnam.
</P>
<P>
In the Hong Kah GRC, which was uncontested in the last election
in 1991, the fight will be between the PAP team led by Trade and
Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong and a team from the National
Solidarity Party (NS) led by its president Tan Chee Kien.
</P>
<P>
Pasir Ris, a new GRC, will be the arena of contest between the
PAP team headed by Environment Minister Teo Chee Hean and another
WP team, while in the West Coast GRC, National Development
Minister Lim Hng Kiang will be leading a PAP team in the battle
against the Workers' Party again.
</P>
<P>
In Jalan Besar, Labor Minister Lee Boon Yang will head his PAP
team to fight the SDP's team of Low Yong Nguan, David Chew, Mohd
Jufrie, and Ghandi Ambalam.
</P>
<P>
However, in the 30 minutes after the close of nominations, an
objection had been raised over one of the nomination papers filed
in this GRC. Therefore, the final tally of contested GRCs might
change, pending the Election Department's decision.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that although the ruling PAP has been
returned to power, it is not going to relax a bit in its battle
against the opposition in the contested constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after his team
retained Ang Mo Kio GRC unopposed that the PAP would continue to
campaign hard to win all contested seats despite having gained a
majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pledged Sunday that the PAP would
fight the general election as a "local government election",
pitting its ward improvement program against what the opposition
had to offer.

<HEADLINE> Israel Radio Reports Progress on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Progress has been made
on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank town of
Hebron after a night of intensive talks between Israeli and
Palestinian representatives, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
and U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross took an
active role in the negotiations, which was held at Arafat's Gaza
Office and lasted until early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Ross expressed cautious optimism following
the talks, but Ross admitted that difference remained between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's senior advisor Yitzhak
Molcho and head of the Israeli army planning branch Shaul
Mofaz headed the Israeli negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiators Mahmoud Abbas and Saeb Erekat, as well
as head of the Palestinian Preventive Security Forces in the Gaza
Strip Mohammed Dahlan, participated in the night-long talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross reportedly spoke with Netanyahu on the phone a number
of times throughout the night, while Arafat was in contact
with King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
PNA Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi said that there has
been progress in all directions in the night-long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi told reporters that the negotiators are working on
a package deal involving other issues in addition to the Hebron
issue, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Ross left Gaza this morning for Israel to report to Netanyahu
on the outcome of the latest negotiations, but the two
negotiation teams were continuing their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to leave here for Washington where he will
report to U.S. President Bill Clinton about where the talks on
the Hebron redeployment stand.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said it is possible that Ross will return to
the region in about 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Upgrade Industrial Mix Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic
powerhouse, is resorting to hi-tech applications to speed up the
improvement of its industrial mix restructuring,
</P>
<P>
It means the municipality is slowing down development of its
light industry, but gearing up heavy sectors.
</P>
<P>
The city's light industrial output value now accounts for
nearly 44 percent of the local industrial total, down from 56.3
percent in 1990, with the proportion of employees falling four
percentage points from 55 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In order to upgrade local industry, Shanghai is giving priority
to capital and technology intensive sectors, instead of
labor-intensive sections.
</P>
<P>
Of the local industrial output value total, that of metal
smelting and processing has risen from 8.4 percent in 1990 to the
current 15 percent, and automobiles, as well as manufacturing for
transportation sectors, from 4.8 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the output value of the local six leading industries,
involving automobiles, iron and steel, telecommunications,
household appliances, power station equipment, and fine
petrochemicals, also jumped from 31 percent in 1990 to the current
53 percent among the local industrial total.
</P>
<P>
In addition, output value of hi-tech sectors among the total
has risen to 12 percent from two percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Except for mining and lumbering, Shanghai has had a complete
industrial system. Since the 1990's the municipality has been
carrying out a large-scale industrial mix restructuring, in a bid
to develop into an economic, financial, and trade center by
attaching more importance to service trade development.

<HEADLINE> Study Says That China Has 250 Million Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- It has been generally accepted
that China has 900 million farmers, until recently, that is, when
a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CAS) reported
that the number is actually 250 million.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the labor force in China's countryside
amounts to 460 million, 250 million of whom are engaged in
agricultural production, more than 100 million are working in
township enterprises, and some 80 million are migrant workers in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the CAS Rural Area Development Research
Institute during the past few years, points out that it is
necessary to make distinctions between farmers, agricultural
population, and rural population, all of which were lumped
together for decades.
</P>
<P>
Yao Mei, who participated in the study, says that the
term 'farmers' refers to people who are engaged in agricultural
production and does not refer to just anyone living in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
She said that farmers and the people they support are referred
to as the "agricultural population", and that township enterprise
workers, migrant workers, and the people they support are
the "rural population".
</P>
<P>
Under the rigid planned economic system, farmers were not
allowed to randomly look for work on their own but but were tied
to the soil, she said, noting that, from the day they were born,
they were naturally regarded as farmers.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that, since the reform and opening-up policy
in 1979, non-agricultural activities began emerging in the
countryside and many farmers began taking jobs either in township
enterprises or seeking temporary jobs in cities.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of agricultural production, an increasing
number of people living in the countryside will earn their bread
in fields other than in agriculture, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Endorses Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The rightwing Israeli
government has given green light to Jewish settlers for
building a few dozen housing units in Qazrin, the Golan
Heights, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Regional Planning and Building Committee also
approved construction of 35 units as a part of the housing
program within the framework of the settlement expansion. The
construction will begin in a few months.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now organization has issued a statement condemning
the government decision as a threat to the future peace process
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel snatched from Syria the Golan Heights during the
June 5 War in 1967 and its Knesset (parliament) adopted law
annexing the 1,200 square kilometer territory.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements have been promoted to establish facts on
the ground. Now there are some 13,000 Jewish settlers in the
territory of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
Late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as matter of fact,
informally agreed to return the Golan Heights to Syria in the
final peaceful arrangements between the two rival neighbors. But
the Likud-led government has insisted on the annexation of the
occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
Anti-occupation activities have reportedly escalated in the
Golan Heights in the past few months. A fire bomb was thrown
at an Israeli army jeep Friday evening in the Druse village
of Majdal Shams. It missed the jeep but ignited nearby and
damaged a parked car.
</P>
<P>
In the previous Friday, a fire bomb was hurled at an
Israeli army command car patrolling on the outskirts of Majdal
Shams. The vehicle was hit and set alight, but the soldiers
on board were unhurt and managed to extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
The other cases included arson attacks on a police post
in Mas'ada village and on a building housing the Income Tax
Authority office in Majdal Shams.
</P>
<P>
There have also been incidents of arson attacks on businesses
owned by, Druse who are considered to be pro-Israeli, and cases of
stone-throwing at police vehicles and of raising Syrian
flags.

<HEADLINE> Most of Diplomatic Hostages Released in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian guerrillas Sunday night
released 225 hostages from the Japanese ambassador's residence in
Lima, keeping another 140 in hand to pressure President Alberto
Fujimori to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of Bolivia, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela and
the European Union were among the latest group of hostages
released by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary (MRTA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Spain's charge d'affaires, a World Health Organization
official, two United Nations anti-drug officials, and four
U.S. diplomats were also among those freed.
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's release, most of the diplomats held in the
residence have been set free.
</P>
<P>
The 225 freed hostages were greeted in person by Fujimori at
the police hospital in Lima Sunday night after their release.
</P>
<P>
The mass release was sudden and unexpected. Earlier, Sandro
Fuentes, a freed hostage and a former labor minister, read a
statement from rebel leader Nestor Cerpa that said the release was
a "Christmas gesture."
</P>
<P>
The rebels said that they were freeing captives who had no ties
with the Peruvian government.
</P>
<P>
They noted that two ministers, vice-ministers, members of the
judiciary, legislators, armed forces and police leaders, and
representatives of Japanese businesses, were among
government-linked hostages still detained.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Peruvian and foreign officials and businessmen were
taken captive Tuesday night by MRTA rebels during a reception at
the residence marking Japanese emperor's birthday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded freedom for some 300 of their jailed
comrades.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 hostages, including all women, were freed early
in the crisis and 38 more were released Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Weed Eradication Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A program to eradicate
hyacinth weed in Lake Victoria through biological method is
scheduled to launch today in Kenya, the Daily Nation has
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources
Henry Kosgey will preside over the launching ceremony at the
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) sub-station in Kibos
on the outskirts of Kisumu, west Kenya, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The minister will also over-fly the lake to assess the impact
of the weed, which has blocked most of the fish landing beaches.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, contrary to earlier announcement, the
beetles, which are used to eat the weed, will not be released into
the lake today.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Mailu, Deputy Director of the KARI which is
implementing the program, said that the institute had reared
about 3,500 beetles and will need at least 10,000 beetles before
releasing them into the lake.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the KARI will train about 100 fishermen on how
to rear the beetles and provide them with facilities.
</P>
<P>
The institute is expected to receive 2.3 million U.S. Dollars
from the World Bank, which has agreed to provide about 70 million
Dollars to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for the Lake Victoria
Environmental Program.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Pan Shanyou faced opposition
from his family and friends when he announced he was leaving their
remote village.
</P>
<P>
But young Pan, from the Yao ethnic minority, has never looked
back. He decided to seek his fortune in a local
government-sponsored township, set up to attract poverty stricken
farmers and rural workers.
</P>
<P>
Pan's migration took him from the remote stone area to the
Farmers' Town, also called Baxian Aid-the-Poor District, in
central Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, south China.
</P>
<P>
Today Pan earns a comfortable living by selling meat, and has
built two brick-tile houses. He has bought a TV set and a radio
cassette recorder, luxuries that would have been impossible before.
</P>
<P>
He also helped his younger sister to open a barber shop in
Farmers' Town.
</P>
<P>
Pan disclosed that both his father and younger brother have
visited him and expressed the willingness to live with him.
</P>
<P>
Founded by the roadside on the outskirts of downtown of Du'an
Autonomous County of the Yao Ethnic Group, the Farmers' Town is
now home to over 5,500 people of the Yao, Mulam, Miao and Zhuang
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Annual income this year averages nearly 1,000 yuan per
head, up from 200 to 300 yuan per capita, and will top 1,000
yuan next year.
</P>
<P>
Wei Henggao, vice-chairman of the regional government, said
Guangxi has helped 187,500 poor people to move from karst areas to
places with better living conditions.
</P>
<P>
China still has 65 million people living under the poverty
line with an annual income of less than 530 yuan per capita. These
people are distributed in southwest China's karst areas and
northwest China's highland, arid and desert regions.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to increase its investment
to aid the poor from 10.8 billion yuan this year to 15 billion
yuan next year.

<HEADLINE> China's Pilot City for Environment Protection Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Bureau of Environment
Protection has ratified Xiamen as China's first pilot city to
implement an international standard for environmental protection,
namely, the ISO 14000 series of standards.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, a coastal city in east China's Fujian province, is also
the first city designated by the bureau as an experimental site
for environment-protection standards, which were drawn up for
enterprises to help them improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
China, a member of the environment management and technology
committee that is an international standard organization, has
attached importance to the formulation and implementation of ISO
14000 standards for local environment protection, arousing
world-wide attention.
</P>
<P>
China has chosen more than 20 pilot enterprises for the
standard. Among them, some foreign-funded enterprises have
received accreditation.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen aims to put its local environment-protection management
system in accordance with international standards by resorting to
the pilot of the ISO 14000 standard, which has been listed among
the major tasks for the local environment protection project
during the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's five special economic zones, Xiamen has
witnessed a speedy economic growth during the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
A majority of foreign-funded enterprises in the city have
high-level management basis, and show greater interest in the
trial of the standard.
</P>
<P>
Now more than 73 percent of the city's industrial output value
is generated by its foreign-funded enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Town of Hope Gives Poor Farmers Richer Future (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Du'an is one of the 559 poor counties listed by the
government. It covers 4,095 square kilometers, of which 89 percent
are stone mountains, and has 620,000 people, with about half
living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' Town boasts rows of brick-tile houses, a market,
shops, a cultural hall, a hospital, and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
A newly-built "Hope School" has enrolled 419 students.
</P>
<P>
"Soon after we moved into the town, every household was
given a piece of land on which to build houses, grow fruits and
rear fish. We were also given discount loans," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Skilled farmers are encouraged to help the poor to
master skills in order to become better-off."
</P>
<P>
Wei Maosong, a leader of the Farmers' Town, noted that many
farmers are still reluctant to leave their old farmland.
</P>
<P>
"With the time they and their sons and daughters will live on
their mastery of a skill, just like urban people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lan Yuefei, a 30-year-old man of Yao ethnic minority is good at
plaiting bamboo mats. But living in the depths of the stone
mountains, which lacked roads and information, he could not sell
his products.
</P>
<P>
Since he moved to the town the family has built two brick-tile
houses, and their two children are in school.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Liang Hanlu, a senior middle school leaver of Zhuang
ethnic group settled down in Farmers' Town last year, he
served as salesman.
</P>
<P>
Later on, he opened a mill to produce plastic bags and a smithy.
</P>
<P>
"I had never dreamt of becoming a rich man and enjoying urban
life," said the young man, dressed like an urban citizen.
</P>
<P>
His family of five is living in a two-story building equipped
with tapped water, electric lamps, a flushing toilet and a
porcelain-decorated kitchen.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Although I miss my mother and the villagers, and
return for occasional visits, I would never back to the poor stone
mountains. I have got use to the urban life."

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge in Philippines Over Ramos' Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Stocks plunged today in the
Philippines, with an unestimated amount of capital withdrawn from
the country, following a carotid operation on President Fidel
Ramos this morning.
</P>
<P>
Saturnino Mejia, vice president for research at the country's
brokerage house Guoco Securities, said the 30-issue Philippine
composite index fell 40.28 points to close at 3139.92.
</P>
<P>
Blue chips, including banking issue PNB (the Philippine
National Bank) and telecoms stock PLDT (the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Company), closed down.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Philippine Stock Exchange Index dived to an
intra-day low of 67.64 points because of Ramos' operation on a
carotid-blocked artery and a drop of PLDT in Wall Street over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The market's adverse reaction is expected whenever something
happens to a head of state. Hopefully, this will just be a
short-term development," said Buenvenuto Incamino of the
Philippines' Economist Intelligence Unit.
</P>
<P>
"There will certainly be an outflow (of capital)," he said. "To
what extent, we don't know yet."
</P>
<P>
But he added that long-term investors, who have survived bloody
coup attempts during the previous administration, are not likely
to react violently.
</P>
<P>
Raul Concepcion, chairman of the Federation of Philippine
Industries, said he expected the success of Ramos' operation to
buoy market sentiments and revive business confidence.
</P>
<P>
"If the president were in a coma or in a similar state, that's
another story," Concepcion said. However, he added, "In this
particular case, he has recovered very well from the operation."
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who underwent a successful operation to remove carotid
block this morning, is now conscious and all his vital signs are
normal, Executive Secretary Ruben Torres confirmed at noon today.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon PM Denies Exchange of Political Price for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has denied that Lebanon will pay a "political price"
in exchange for the grants and low-interest loans promised in
the Friends of Lebanon Conference last week.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was quoted by Beirut's As-Safir daily today as saying
that the achievements made by his government in the past four
years was the card he used in the conference, held in Washington
on December 16.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister described the conference, which was
attended by 29 countries and eight international financial
institutions, as "successful and positive."
</P>
<P>
In the Washington gathering, donor countries expressed
readiness to provide 3.2 billion dollars between 1997 and
2000, with one billion available for the next year. Lebanon
had hoped to raise five billion dollars for the implementation
of a five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Some people "forgot or pretended to forget what the
government had achieved in the past four years, and this was
the card we depended on in Washington conference, where the
participating countries realized our credibility, ability and
determination for the rehabilitation," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a multi-billionaire winning his fortune during the
1970s oil boom in Saudi Arabia, is the mastermind of Lebanon's
ambitious reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that thanks to the security stability established
and consolidated by the Lebanese military forces and the Syria
forces in Lebanon, the government made all the achievements.
</P>
<P>
In the name of the Arab deterrent force, Syria sent some
35,000 troops to Lebanon in 1976, one year after Lebanon's
civil war erupted, in order to keep apart the combating
militias. The civil war ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the impossibility to separate the Lebanese track
from the Syrian track in the peace negotiation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon has benefited from the coordination between the two
tracks. For this reason, Lebanon will never take a step" in
the direction of separation, the prime minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
Hariri left for Damascus Sunday afternoon to brief the Syrian
leaders on the outcomes of the Friends of Lebanon conference,
barely 24 hours after his arrival from the United States via
France.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Market in China Showing Signs Of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate market in
coastal areas and major cities is finally beginning to pick up,
and is expected to climb upwards nationwide with the return of
Hong Kong in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction told Xinhua
today that the price of housing in major Chinese cities has been
stable, with only a slight drop since the beginning of this year,
and that is showing signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
The housing price index in the cities of Beijing, Dalian,
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Qingdao is showing a moderate
rise, with Beijing recording the sharpest rise of six percentage
points this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, there have been slight rises in the price of office
and commercial buildings, with only slight rises, minor drops, or
no change in the price of residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Dalian, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Guangzhou saw slight
rises in the price of housing, while prices in a number of large
and medium-sized cities remained the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the country's real estate market is maturing
and behaving rather soundly. Other favorable trends in the sector
are growth from coastal and well-developed cities to the central
and western parts of the country, and from metropolises to medium
and small-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong approaching, housing sales are
expected to be brisk, and a new upsurge is expected in the sector,
according to a senior official with the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that more Chinese compatriots from Hong
Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and those residing overseas are buying
residences in mainland cities, particularly in Shenzhen,
Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Xiamen, and Fuzhou in the Pearl River Delta
area, as well as in the metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai and
Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will be more convenient for Hong Kong residents to
cross to the interior areas after 1997 and the price of housing on
the mainland, being much lower than in Hong Kong, will of course
stimulate purchases by Hong Kong people, the official said.

<HEADLINE> HK Witnesses Decisive Step in Transition: Zhou Nan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has witnessed
a decisive step in the process of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, said Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch, here today in his New Year message.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that with the active participation of the Hong Kong
compatriots and in an unprecedented democratic way, Tung Chee-hwa
was elected the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Marking genuine democracy in Hong Kong, the election fully
embodied the principle of being fair, just and open, he said.
</P>
<P>
Then, the broadly representative 60-member Provisional
Legislative Council of the HKSAR was elected in a similar manner,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Now the framework of the government of the HKSAR has been laid,
which marks a new stage in the preparations for the establishment
of the HKSAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the two elections, the Hong Kong compatriots
came to see the determination of the Chinese government to
implement the principles of "One country, Two systems", "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that the major progress in the preparations for the
HKSAR has greatly impressed Hong Kong compatriots as well as
Chinese people and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the year 1997 just round the corner, the
international and domestic situation is favorable to Hong Kong's
smooth transition and sustainable prosperity and stability in
future.
</P>
<P>
Significant changes have taken place in Hong Kong's political
situation and atmosphere, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The heavy inflow of foreign capital and the large numbers of
returned emigrated Hong Kong people show that the confidence of
the Hong Kong people and the international community is markedly
enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no insurmountable difficulties and obstacles in the
way for Hong Kong to return to the motherland," Zhou Nan said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Hong Kong people will be more
active in participating in the preparations for the establishment
of the HKSAR and in greeting the historic moment of Hong Kong's
return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Report: Likud's Silence Suggests Israel's Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Neither Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu nor any senior figure of the
rightwing Likud Party has publicly disavowed remarks by the
premier's powerful adviser David Bar-Illan, who indicated support
for a demilitarized Palestinian state, reported The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The only comments from the premier's office over the last
three days have come from Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, who
said, "We are in a new situation where everything is open."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan made his statement in an exclusive interview with
the English-language newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, which was
published in the paper's weekend edition Friday. Bar-Illan was
executive editor of the pro-Likud daily before he was appointed
Netanyahu's director of Policy Planning and Communication.
</P>
<P>
In a strong hint of approval, Naveh said the Likud-led
government would fight against what he called the establishment
of a "militarized Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists, who had prescheduled interviews with the
premier, have not obtained a denial from Netanyahu. Instead, the
premier has sought to skirt the issue.
</P>
<P>
Aryeh Naor, a former cabinet secretary to former Likud prime
minister Menachem Begin, said Sunday night that he views
Bar-Illan's comments as part of a wider trend.
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be an ideological revolution in the right," he
said, "as they are detaching themselves from the Greater Israel
ideology.... If Bar-Illan, who is considered to be a true
believer in Likud ideology, talks this way, this tells you there
is a new spirit of the times."
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian Authority reacted cooly to the
remarks. The PA Cabinet Secretary, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, said that
Bar-Illan's statement was noted, but not taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
"It is a contradiction of what is happening on the ground. If
it is meant to be a signal, the timing is not good. There is no
confidence now. We have to deal with the details before we deal
with the big issues," Abdel-Rahman declared.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singaporeans Urged to Cast Votes Carefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- With the polling day of the
country's eighth general election set on January 2, 1997,
Singapore leaders urged the Singapore people to cast their votes
carefully, although the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) had
been returned to power earlier today when nominations closed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that now the people would be
voting for local government and Singaporeans would see the effects
immediately, as the proposed Community Development Council (CDC)
will work like a local government.
</P>
<P>
The PAP believed that electors must take them seriously and
cast for people they want to be in charge of their lives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Using a metaphor, Goh said the test that Singaporeans must
apply was this: If you want to foster your children out when you
are overseas, who will you be entrusting them to.
</P>
<P>
Explaining what local government meant to the Singaporeans, the
prime minister said the CDC will take care of four categories of
schemes, which included the upgrading of estates, investing in the
young, caring for the elderly, and self-improvement for the
workers.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that voting this time will
have a deeper significance for everyone. This was because the
stakes were higher as the voter had to decide whether the team
voted in would be able to run the Town Council and work with a
Community Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh had announced earlier this year that the
CDCs would be responsible for many of the functions of local
government which will determine the value of one's estate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee warned new voters, especially young voters, to
take their vote seriously. He said that the prime minister has a
full program for each constituency and by voting wrongly, some
might be left out in the PAP's upgrading program.
</P>
<P>
The senior minister said that more importantly, the value of
one's estate could be affected by a wrong vote or a protest vote.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh said Sunday that his party, after being
returned to power, would fight the general election as a "local
government election", pitting its ward improvement programs
against what the opposition had to offer.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the PAP would proceed with its national
programs for the country if it was back in government, local
improvement plans unveiled by the PAP candidates would only be
implemented where these plans got the backing of the voters.
</P>
<P>
"Those who think otherwise, those who do not think through what
is in their interest, and may just cast a vote for the other side
without thinking, my message is: Don't be left behind. Don't be
silly," he warned.

<HEADLINE> India Hikes Cotton Yarn Export Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Textiles Ministry
has hiked the annual export quota for cotton yarn, prescribing a
ceiling of 120 million kilograms for 1997, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new quota is 50 percent higher than the initial ceiling of
80 million kilograms set for the current year.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling of 120 kilograms for 1997 would be released in two
equal installments of 60 million kilograms each for the first and
second half of the year in order to evenly phase quota
utilization.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons for the Textiles Ministry's decision to hike
yarn export quota were the continued depressed condition in the
market for raw cotton, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since export of raw cotton was not picking up, allowing higher
export of yarn would ensure better prices for the cotton growers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Blames Dhahran Explosion on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani blamed the Dhahran bomb blast in Saudi Arabia last June
on Saudi nationals, denying any Iranian involvement in the
incident, English language daily Iran News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in an interview with
Saudi Arabian newspaper Alsharq-al-Awsat and the MBC network.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the Dhahran explosion which killed 19
U.S. soldiers, Rafsanjani said: "What we have heard officially on
this matter has proven that those involved in that explosion were
Saudi nationals... Some of them have escaped their country. The
Saudis guess that these terrorists have fled to Iran."
</P>
<P>
"We have searched for them carefully but have found no trace of
them. We were told later that one of the men who was a famous
terrorist had fled to Syria and died in prison there," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have looked everywhere and have found no trace of such
culprits in Iran because such people are not welcomed in any part
of Iran," the president said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, he said that
"We are naturally willing to cooperate with Saudi Arabia. Saudi
Arabia is our neighbor and a Moslem state and we have many common
interests."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iran's leading hardline clergyman Ayatollah Ahmad
Jannati blamed Saudi Arabian opposition group known as Salafis for
bombing the U.S. military bases in Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
Jannati said that he gave a 99 percent probability that the
explosion was carried out by Salafis.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Salafis is the
opposition group who strongly opposes Saudi Arabia rule on the
bases of ideological differences and the presence of the
U.S. military in that country.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati also denied
any Iranian involvement in the Dhahran explosion.

<P>
PRAGUE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Karel Poborsky and Patrik
Berger were voted joint winners of the Czech footballer of the
year award.
</P>
<P>
The two played key roles in helping their country entering the
European Championship final this summer.
</P>
<P>
Poborsky has struggled to reproduce the form he showed during
the European finals in England in his first season with Manchester
United. His poor English made it quite difficult to communicate
with team mates as well as the club management.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Berger has made a great contribution to
Liverpool's premier league title challenge this season.
</P>
<P>
The prize was awarded on the basis of votes from Czech football
league managers, sports journalists and the Czech-Moravian
Football Association.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Local Government Election Postponed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's local government
election on a party basis has been officially postponed to the
first quarter of next year, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique signed by the National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON) and the country's five political parties on Sunday
said that the election originally set for the last quarter of this
year will be held between February 10 and March 31 next year.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission and the parties reached the agreement
after a five-hour meeting in Abuja, the national capital.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the delay will not affect the final objective
of the transition-to-civil-rule program, which provides that the
military government will hand over power to an elected government on
October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
As December 28, the original date of local government election is
approaching, there has been a confusion over whether the election will
be held.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's five newly-approved political parties demand
that the election is held on time so as not to delay the transition
program.
</P>
<P>
But some others have been calling for a postponement, saying they
are not ready yet, as the delay in the announcement of the
newly-created 183 local governments has made any campaign impossible
in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The communique cited the creation of new states and local
governments, the approaching Christmas, new year and the Ramadan Fast
from January 9 to February 8 as reasons for the postponement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the electoral commission will publish a
timetable for the work ahead, including the division of
constituencies, the production of voters' register, the election and
the inauguration of new local governments.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa, HK Governor Meet for 90 Minutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten had their first
meeting here this afternoon, which lasted for one and a half
hours.
</P>
<P>
Both Tung and Patten described the meeting as useful and
constructive.
</P>
<P>
Tung told reporters after the meeting that the cooperation
between the Hong Kong government and the future Special
Administrative Region government is very important for Hong Kong's
transition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it is the wish of the entire six million Hong Kong
people that we have a smooth transition. The cooperation between
the Hong Kong government and the future SAR government is a very
important aspect of it," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung was last week appointed by the Central Government in
Beijing as HKSAR's first Chief Executive, and he will assume the
post on July 1, 1997 when China resumes exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said during the meeting he tried to explain to the
governor about the Provisional Legislative Council, the need for
the Provisional Legislative Council, and the importance for the
Hong Kong government to cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to discuss hopefully the subject with him as I
move forward. It is important for us to meet regularly and we will
do so in the future," he said, adding that in the meantime he will
talk with Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang and some of the other secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Patten said that the HK government will provide as much support
for the SAR government as it reasonably can and he will discuss
the precise mechanism of that with Tung in the coming weeks or
months.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Macao Witnesses Stable Year of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Macao has witnessed another year of
stable transition in 1996, marked with good cooperation between China
and Portugal, new progress in most transitional affairs, and a mild
growth of economy.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relations of cooperation between China and Portugal
marched forward smoothly. Exchange of visits between state leaders
since early 1996 have contributed to the strengthening of friendship
and the effective cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that maintaining a good cooperation on the
question of Macao is in the interests of Macao and the interests of
both Portugal and China. The two sides have made efforts to
guarantee a stable transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group convened three plenary
sessions in 1996, and made discussions on a wide range of issues
concerning the stable transition of Macao. They reached consensus on
a number of topics.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in the three major issues of transition --
the localization of civil servants, the localization of law and the
use of Chinese as an official language.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, about 80 percent of section chiefs and
heads of group of the civil posts have been localized, following Macao
Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira's decree last May to localize all those
positions by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have finished reviewing the "Law on Legal Procedure",
and reached consensus, marking a major step in the localization of
law. The law is the second among five major laws to be localized.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the first three local judges took
office, an unprecedented event in Macao. Legal cases were for the
first time tried in Cantonese rather than Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
In the use of Chinese as an official language, the government
has ruled that government forms must be printed in both Portuguese
and Chinese, and Chinese is more widely used in government
departments.
</P>
<P>
But, officials of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch noted that
the handling of the three major issues still lags behind the
requirements for a smooth transfer of power in 1999. They urge the
Portuguese side to make ever greater efforts.
</P>
<P>
Other related issues concerning the transition also achieved
progress. The Basic Law of Macao, for example, was further promoted
via various forms among students and neighborhood communities, among
other groups of citizens. The law entered the Internet in Chinese,
English and Portuguese versions last May.
</P>
<P>
Macao's residents' enthusiasm in the election of the new session of
the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA) shows that they are more confident
of the future, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 64 percent of all registered voters went to the poll
on September 22 to elect eight members of the LA, which will pass
through 1999. The high turnout indicates that they wish for a better
future of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic growth in Macao continues to slow down. The
government estimates that the economic growth will rise by 0.6 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the International Airport brings a boom in the tourism
sector, Macao's manufacturing industry remains in slump. The income
from casinos, the government main revenue-maker, dropped by some 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the real estate industry is yet to step out of the
doldrums, with some 30,000 units awaiting for buyers. Another leading
income-maker, the finance sector, grows mildly.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Nan: No Intervention in HK's Affairs After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch will not intervene in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) under the principle of high degree
of autonomy, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a question-and-answer session after he delivered his New
Year message, Zhou Nan, director of the branch, said that after
July 1 1997, Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch will continue to
exist, but its functions will be readjusted to some extent.
</P>
<P>
He said that for quite a long time, Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch has made contributions to the exchanges between Hong
Kong and the mainland, and it will continue to play its role in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
On the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the HKSAR, Zhou
Nan said that most of Hong Kong people held that it is necessary
to set up the PLC as there will be no "through train" for the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PLC is sure to overcome any difficulties it
may encounter.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the British Hong Kong government would
not make any disturbance in the later period of Hong Kong's
transition. "even if they make difficulties, we, together with the
Hong Kong people, can overcome them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland in mid-1997
marks the beginning of the implementation of the principle of "One
country, two systems" advanced by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said he is glad to learn in a recent meeting with delegates
from some international organizations that some people who
previously doubted the success of the implementation of the "One
country, Two systems" principle have changed their attitude.

PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- France has discovered a new case
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Cotes d'Armor,
bringing to 25 the number of mad cow disease cases in all French
territories, said the Ministry of Agriculture.

The newly discovered BSE-infected cow is a Prim'Holstein race
dairy cow aged eight.  All cattles of the herd to which it
belonged were culled in accordance with a sanitary rule imposed by
the French government.
</P>
<P>
France has an overall cattle stock of 21.4 million cows.
</P>
<P>
The BSE is proved to be linked with a slowly developing but fatal
human disease.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Industry During Ninth Five-Year-Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry has
made a good start this year for the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), a nuclear power official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
It has plans for four nuclear power projects with a total
installed capacity of 6.6 million kilowatts by the year 2000,
according to the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
On June 2, concrete was poured for the second-phase project of
the Qinshan nuclear power, which is scheduled for completion in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This year, China signed an agreement with Canada for jointly
building the third-phase project of the Qinshan heavy water
nuclear power. So far, the leveling of ground for the project has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
There are three generating units in two nuclear power plants
now operating in China. By the end of October, the
300,000-kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant had generated more
than eight billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
</P>
<P>
CNNC officials say that the efficiency of the plants'
generators are up to world standards.
</P>
<P>
In the other functioning power plant at Daya Bay, in Guangdong
Province, two generating units have generated a total of 33
billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year. The safety record
of the Daya Bay plant has won the approval of a team sent by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, which means an encouragement
to the development of the country's nuclear industry over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the CNNC says that developing nuclear
power in the next five years will not only ease power shortages in
China, but also help the country master technology for large-scale
development of nuclear power in the next century.

LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Italy are expected
to open talks in Milan today, in an effort to try to save the
troubled 12-billion-U.S.-Dollar liquified natural gas (LNG)
supply contract between them.
</P>
<P>
The "Guardian" reported today that a delegation of the Nigeria
Liquified Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) is to hold talks with
officials of the Italian government and the Enel firm of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Enel informed the NLNG last week that it does not intend
to carry out the contract it entered with NLNG in 1992 for the
purchase of 3.5 billion cubic meters of LNG a year, or 50
percent of the NLNG's total production, for a term of 22.5 years.
</P>
<P>
The NLNG said in an earlier statement that Enel's commitment
is a crucial consideration in the decision to launch the NLNG
project, the construction of which has begun on the Bonny Island
of River State in southern Nigeria and is expected to be
completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Nigeria is now looking for

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ship Auctioned Off In South China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Honduran cargo ship went on
the auction block recently in the coastal city of Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A shipping company from nearby Fujian Province put in the
winning bid of 67,500 US dollars for the ship, the 'AMMONITE'.
</P>
<P>
The ship belonged to a Panamanian shipping company when it
broke down near Japan in August of this year, and its manager, a
Hong Kong shipping company, sought the help of the Guangzhou
Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau.
</P>
<P>
After the ship was pulled from difficulties and hauled to
Zhuhai, the Hong Kong company refused to pay the salvage and
rescue fee, and ignored a summons from the Guangzhou Maritime
Court in September ordering it to submit a 60,000-US-dollar
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
When it failed to do so, the court ruled on October 12 that the
ship be put up for auction, and that the proceeds were to be used
to cover the debts.

<HEADLINE> Economic Restructuring Urged for Better Asset Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts should be made
to readjust China's economic structure to ensure a better
distribution of state-owned assets, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the state-owned economy is a major issue for
China's economic work next year, Zhang Youcai, vice minister of
finance, said at a national meeting on the management of
state-owned property in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"All areas must make a greater effort to liquidate existing
assets and implement the strategy of restructuring the economy,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that both planning and market forces should be applied
in practical work.
</P>
<P>
"When setting up large enterprise groups or stake-controlled
companies, it is especially important to restructure and optimize
the distribution of state-owned assets," said Zhang, who is also
director of the State Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
He also said that active efforts should be made to cultivate a
property rights transfer market and standardize property rights
transfers.
</P>
<P>
"Besides government guidance, we should fully tap the role of
the market in issues concerning the mergers, auction, leasing and
bankruptcy of small state-owned enterprises," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that proceeds from the transfer of state-owned property
rights should be invested in industries that the state sees as in
urgent need of development.
</P>
<P>
"The subject of transfer of state-owned property rights should
be standardized, and the asset evaluation system must be strictly
followed," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that supervision of intermediary agencies for property
rights transfers should be enhanced.

<HEADLINE> EU-China Energy Working Group Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 23 (Xinhua) - The European Union(EU) and
China have agreed recently to establish an Energy Working Group to
discuss how the two sides can cooperate, review common projects
and define future methods of collaboration, it was learned here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Working Group, which is to provide a permanent and
institutionalized base for the EU-Chinese energy cooperation that
began in the 1980s, will meet twice a year to discuss technical,
economic, financial and commercial issues, according to the
European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
The creation of the Working Group is in response to the rapid
developments in China's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
"This market is expanding in pace with the country's economic
growth, and offers many possibilities for outside investors, among
them a number of EU companies," the EC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Commission pointed out that China and Europe were facing
many similar challenges - an increasing dependency on energy
imports, the global character of environmental problems, and the
liberalization of energy markets - in areas where bilateral
cooperation could prove fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Specific joint actions discussed during the visit of EU Energy
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis to Beijing in October included
demonstration projects in China in the fields of renewable energy
sources, energy efficiency and clean coal technology and support
for activities related to collaboration on the exploration and
production of hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
The EU and China also agreed to continue supporting and
coordinating joint training courses, conferences and workshops and
to encourage studies on energy development and efficiency carried
out by Chinese institutions and the exchange of students and
researchers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants to Make Peace With All States in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli new Ambassador to Egypt
Zvi Mazel said here today that Israel aims to make peace and
economic partnership with all states in the region, including
Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mazel made the remarks while meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa. Following the meeting, the ambassador told
reporters that they reviewed Egyptian-Israeli ties and the Middle
East peace developments, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is peace between Egypt and Israel, there is peace
between Jordan and Israel, and there are negotiations going on to
realize peace between Israelis and the Palestinians," Mazel said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the peace negotiations on the
Syrian-Israeli track can be resumed, saying his country does not
threaten to wage war against Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have been shelved since about 60
people were killed in the wave of suicide bombings by anti-Israeli
militants in Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Mazel's appointment came at a time when Egypt and Israel
stepped up a verbal warfare against each other over the impasse in
the long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city
of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Israel and Egypt, the first Arab country to make
peace with the Jewish state in 1979, have strained after
Netanyahu's hardline government took over power last June.
</P>
<P>
Mazel, 57, arrived here on December 15 to start his diplomatic
service amid growing tensions between Egypt and Israel. He can
speak fluent Arabic, French, English besides Hebrew. He was
political advisor to the Israeli Embassy in Cairo from 1980 to
1983.

<HEADLINE> Towards Knowledge Society (1)  (by Wu Dingbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- In line with the nation's
objective of achieving developed nation status by the year 2020,
Malaysia is spurring on to the 21st century as the information and
communications hub of the region by emphasizing on the development
of information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, exhortations of "Only countries rich in
technology will succeed" by its national leaders can be heard
almost every day.
</P>
<P>
The year has been eventful in the field of science and
technology as the government made tremendous efforts to project
the cause in a bid to transform the country into a knowledge
society and position it as the emerging digital economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Information Technology Conference (NITC) held on
December 18-20 gathered input for the drawing up of an action plan
to build Malaysia's own knowledge society premised on its own
history, tradition, culture and development experience.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's IT Agenda being formulated will include a
three-pronged strategy to build the knowledge society, Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said when opening the NITC.
</P>
<P>
The basic strategy is to build and develop appropriate physical
infrastructure and infostructure; the second is to create and
develop demand-driven value-added systems or IT-based
applications; and the third is for human development efforts which
will involve all educational and training systems, whether formal
or informal, from the primary to the tertiary stage and further
education, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the NITC, also officially launched this year was the
most talked-about Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) which Mahathir
is personally creating to move Malaysia up the technological
ladder.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a 15-kilometers-by-50-kilometers belt south of Kuala
Lumpur, is an investment zone for computer and information
industries, covering the Kuala Lumpur City Center, the new
administrative capital Putrajaya, and the new Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, which observers say presents the cutting edge of
Malaysia's commitment to ensure the country is not left behind in
the IT explosion and will become Malaysia's pride, has been
acknowledged by world computer experts as a major effort to
concentrate on IT development with definite objectives.
</P>
<P>
The MSC will cater for eight flagship applications: electronic
or "paperless" government, tele-medicine, research and
development, worldwide manufacturing web, borderless marketing
center, multimedia funds haven, the world's first multipurpose
smart card, and Smart Schools.
</P>
<P>
It has received encouraging response with some 20 foreign
companies including the world's biggest software company Microsoft
and Japan's NTT Corporation, having confirmed their participation
in the development of the MSC which is specially designed with
high-tech, state-of-the-art information and communication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, who promised to put the
company's Asia headquarters in the MSC, has agreed to be a member
of the MSC advisory board. Bill Gates' presence in the MSC would
help encourage more cooperation and investment from other big
foreign companies, observers say.

<P>
In November, Malaysia opened its Technology Park, which was
hailed as a major achievement in the field of research and
development as the park will serve as a nerve center for research,
development and innovation in high technology for the country.
</P>
<P>
The 280-hectare park, strategically located within the MSC, is
fully equipped with the latest technology such as fiber optics,
Internet communications and prototyping facilities for its
tenants.
</P>
<P>
A Science Park was also opened in the Perak State, the native
place of Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
The National Science Center located here also opened its doors
to the public in November this year, which sets the right
atmosphere for young and budding talents in the field of science
and technology (S&AMP;T).
</P>
<P>
In the year, the Science, Technology and Environment Ministry
approved the setting up of seven Biotechnology Cooperative Centers
in the country, a move which is believed to increase Malaysia's
participation in the field of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
These parks and centers definitely would play a significant
role in enhancing public S&AMP;T awareness and interest.
</P>
<P>
Adding to that, Science Fun Festival '96 for the public was
held from November 23 to December 1.
</P>
<P>
The mass media, which is considered an influential force in
moulding the thinking and attitude of the people and in creating a
society with a science and technology culture, is being used as a
strategy to enhance public awareness.
</P>
<P>
To widen the science and technology coverage in the mass
media, several steps have been taken to improve the standard of
S&AMP;T journalism such as the introduction of the S&AMP;T Journalism
Award and the holding of the S&AMP;T Journalism Workshops.
</P>
<P>
With the launching of the Internet Society's Malaysian chapter
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Net community has every reason to
rejoice.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Institute of Microelectronics Systems, which is
experiencing a annual growth rate of 20 percent, has 33,000
Internet subscribers nationwide and over 2,000 dial-up access
lines.
</P>
<P>
As reported in July, the government will ensure every district
has an access node of Jaring, the country's first Internet service
provider, by 1997 to enable the people to enjoy the IT benefits at
minimal cost.
</P>
<P>
Some institutions, corporations and major newspapers in the
country were put on Cyberspace this year.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry put forth the introduction of "Smart
Schools" in the country, a definite plus point in the government's
effort to promote the S&AMP;T culture this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is committed to the Smart Schools concept to be
implemented in 1998. It is aimed at connecting all schools to the
Internet and enhancing the use of computers in the
teaching/learning process.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech drive is clearly in keeping with the seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) which stresses the promotion of several
advanced technologies such as information technology and
communications, microelectronics, biotechnology, and
environment-related technology.
</P>
<P>
Under the Plan, priority is placed on innovation-driven and
technology-led industrial development in the shift from
labor-intensive operations to ensure long-term sustainable
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The science and technology budget increased two fold from 1.5
billion ringgit (about 600 million US dollars) allocated in the
Sixth Malaysia Plan to 3 billion ringgit (about 1.2 billion US
dollars) in the present Plan, showing the government's commitment
to S&AMP;T development.
</P>
<P>
To guide the application of new technologies, a national IT
council headed by Mahathir himself has been set up.
</P>
<P>
And to facilitate the development of multimedia and
information technology, the government is drafting at least three
new Acts and amendment to the existing Acts including the Digital
signature Act, Computer Crime Act and the amendment to the
Copyright Act, Dubbed as the Cyber laws, according to
Telecommunications and Posts Minister Leo Moggie.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing Malaysia's scientific happenings for the year,
its inadequacies in science and technology should be recognized.
</P>
<P>
The national spending on research and development, only one
percent of the gross domestic product, is relatively low. In
particular, the private sector is not spending as much as they
should on research and development due to what has been termed
the lack of professional culture, research orientation and good
technocrats available in the sector.
</P>
<P>
More experts in the technical field especially in IT are
needed to meet the demand for manpower in major projects such as
the MSC.
</P>
<P>
However, the government announced recently to take steps to
overcome the acute shortage of engineers by increasing the intake
of students for the science stream at local universities, which is
expected to result in a 40 percent increase by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said while opening the Technology Park that Malaysia
had to leap-frog into the electronics edge to catch up with the
rest of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
He believed Malaysians can master the skill and technological
edge.
</P>
<P>
With the firm top-level commitment from the government and
visible concrete measures taken, the enhanced S&AMP;T role would help
ensure the success of the country's pursuit of its 2020 Vision,
the observers say.

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A symposium to mark the 15th

(ACFTC) was held today in Beijing, which was attended by some 200
people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Zhang Kehui, president of the
federation, said that over the past 15 years the ACFTC and its
subordinates in the country have closely united Taiwan compatriots
residing in inland areas, and participated in political and

<P>
Meanwhile, the federation has conducted extensive contacts with
the Taiwan compatriots, both on the island and overseas, involving
people in various circles and various political organizations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and Macao, and the concept of "one country, two systems" will
become a reality. This will surely produce a far-reaching impact
on the peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pledged that his federation and its subordinates will
continue to promote unofficial exchanges across the straits, and
provide services wholeheartedly to Taiwan compatriots all over the
world, highlighting the principle of "peaceful reunification, and
one country, two systems," as well as the eight-point propositions
put forward by President Jiang Zemin on the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> World's First Combined GSM/DECT Phone Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 23 (Xinhua)-- Swedish Telecom Telia and
Ericsson company have jointly launched the world's first combined
GSM/DECT telephone service, said Telia.
</P>
<P>
The new unit, called Freeset GSM/DECT is a combined Ericsson
GSM 337 and a Freeset DECT weighing 335 grams with a standard
battery. It automatically switches from the cordless DECT to the
GSM mode when out of range of the DECT base transmitter, according
to a recent news letter from Telia.
</P>
<P>
Network selection is done automatically. As long as the user is
within range of the base transmitter, the telephone works just
like a normal cordless unit and calls are channeled through the
company's exchange.
</P>
<P>
When the user gets close to the outer edge of the cordless
system's area of coverage, an alarm sounds warning that the
connection will soon be broken. In this case, the call must be
reconnected in the GSM mode to which the telephone automatically
switches.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of the system include that the same telephone
number is used for both systems and callers are only charged the
price of the call to the company exchange. The re-routed call to
the cellular phone is paid for by the recipient.
</P>
<P>
For the company, the new telephone means reduced telephony
charges as the unit automatically selects the cheapest
alternative.

MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos has fully recovered from the effects of anesthesia that was
given this morning before a carotid operation, the Presidential
Press Office said.
</P>
<P>
"He is fully awake, conscious and all vital signs are within
normal limits," said the office, quoting a medical bulletin
prepared by Ramos' doctors and issued late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who successfully underwent an operation on his neck to
remove a carotid block, has started "cracking jokes," the bulletin
said.
</P>
<P>
All Ramos' doctors are confident that he will be moved to a
private room tomorrow, the bulletin added.
</P>
<P>
An earlier medical bulletin said the doctors are confident that
Ramos may be discharged from the Makati Medical Center either on
Christmas day or after.
</P>
<P>
One of Ramos' doctors said the carotid blockage was caused by
significant cholesterol deposits and can possibly lead to a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was admitted to the Makati Medical Center on December 12
because of an alleged viral infection. Earlier newspaper reports
said Ramos might suffer a mild stroke instead of the so-called
infection, but the reports were denied by both Ramos and his
doctors.

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China has scored marked
achievements in the management of state-owned assets since it set
up an industry watchdog, the State Administration of State
Property (SASP), in 1988, Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai
said today.
</P>
<P>
The SASP has decreed the value of China's state-owned assets at
more than 5.71 trillion yuan (about 688 billion US dollars) at the
end of last year, said Zhang, who is also director of the SASP.
</P>
<P>
He told a national conference on the management of state assets
that registration of property rights has set out on a right track
in China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300,000 enterprises completed the work of registering
their rights of state-owned assets last year, he said, adding that
registration of state-owned property rights in government
departments and institutions, and in overseas-based Chinese firms
has been started on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the asset evaluation industry has developed
steadily over the past years, saying that assets evaluated between
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) were worth over 2.15
trillion yuan, as compared with the 1.43 trillion yuan before
evaluation, consequently gaining 49 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
Property management agencies have been set up in all of China's
348 prefectures and cities, and in 96.4 percent of its counties,
Zhang said, claiming that an asset management network has been
formed at central, provincial, city and county levels.
</P>
<P>
Over the years China has effectively curbed the drain of state
property. More than 300 cases of loss of state property were
investigated last year, which helped save a potential loss of 2.1
billion yuan in state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that progress has also been made in building up a
legal framework for the management of state property, adding that
the State Council has issued three laws and regulations. The SASP
has, sometimes in cooperation with other government departments,
drawn over 140 pieces of property management rules and
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Persistent Efforts Urged for Professional Ethics Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A four-day national conference
on professional ethics stressed that persistent efforts must be
made on the building of socialism in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions Chairman, Wei Jianxing, sent letters of congratulations to
the national conference. The event opened in Wuxi in east China's
Jiangsu Province on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Wu said in his letter that the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics requires workers with lofty ideals, a good
education and a strong sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is of great significance for workers to
cultivate good professional ethics, while establishing a correct
view of the world, life and values.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that trade unions and cadres of unions
will set out to tackle current problems, plunge themselves into
reform, make efforts for reforms and the development of
state-owned enterprises, and give full scope to the role of the
working class as the pillar in the socialist modernization drive
and in promoting socialist ethics and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing pointed out in his letter that trade unions at all
levels should start with matters that concern workers and society
most, to advance the overall improvement of socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
The conference noted that priority should be given to issues
that concern the majority of the people, including the ethics of
officials, law enforcement and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Heads of trade unions from all over the country attended the
conference.

<HEADLINE> New Way For Chinese Parents To Deal With Adolescents' Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The American humorist Mark
Twain once remarked, "When I was 16, my father was stupid. When I
reached 21, I was surprised at how much the old boy had learned in
only five years."
</P>
<P>
American adolescents in Twain's time may have thought that way,
but it is interesting to note that it is also true in China
today. And Chinese educators are asking, if this necessarily so,
how can society help those who are nearing puberty?
</P>
<P>
Social workers in Wenzhou City, in coastal Zhejiang Province,
have come to find parent teaching an effective way to deal with
the problem. So, a special school was established in 1987, jointly
organized by the neighborhood and Wenzhou's No.12 Middle
School. It has provided training for more than 3,800 parents.
</P>
<P>
The school prepared a questionnaire for parents in the
city's Danan Neighborhood, which contained questions such as:
</P>
<P>
"What do you know about the causes of juvenile delinquency?"
</P>
<P>
"Have your children entered puberty?"
</P>
<P>
"How do you talk with your children about physical,
psychological, and ethical issues?"
</P>
<P>
The headmaster of the parents school, Mao Dehao, explains, "The
school deals with moral, ethical, and behavioral problems that
usually confront children in primary and secondary school."
</P>
<P>
After China adopted the one-child policy to restrict population
growth in the late 1970s, more families began to have only one
child, and these parents seldom refuse requests from their only
child. This abundance of love is often abused by these "Little
Emperors", a byword in the modern Chinese lexicon. But, the
morality and social behavior of the young should never be ignored,
educators think.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the shift from the traditional extended family to
the nuclear family has given children fewer opportunities to spend
time with the adult family members. Shen Xingpei, the headmaster
of the No.12 Middle School, who worries about the parents' own
personalities, which influence their children greatly, points out,
"Parents are spending less time with their children, and go out of
the home on entertainment sprees."
</P>
<P>
Children are the target of pulp magazines and video pornography
as well, Shen notes.
</P>
<P>
To combat these unpleasant distractions, he suggests, the young
need help from their parents, to avoid a modern version of
"Catcher in the Rye", a reference to the American story about
adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
So, classes are offered on two weekends before the start of the
semester for these Danan Neighborhood parents. The part-time
lecturers in the school are experts in psychology and pedagogy
from Wenzhou Teacher's College.
</P>
<P>
Fang Shihe, the father of a 15-year-old boy, has given up using
the time-honored carrot-and-stick method on his son thanks to the
parents school, and now uses every means possible to narrow the
generation gap between him and the boy, including frequent chats
and family outings.
</P>
<P>
More schools for parents are appearing around the city, which
is renowned for its shrewd merchants, comments Chen Jiufu,
director of the Wenzhou Civil Affairs Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Invasion in Somalia Condemned by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- As Somalia's reinforcement
Islamist troops are leaving for Dolow's fighting from Mogadishu
and other towns, North Mogadishu religious leader Sheikh Ali
Dhere today condemned the Ethiopian invasion into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali Dhere characterized the Ethiopian war against
Somali as a revenge for the Ethiopians over the 1977 war between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He explained the fighting as a war between the Muslims
and Christians. "The Christians have always maintained deep
animosity against the Muslims wherever they are," said Sheikh Ali
Dhere, who spoke to reporters in his office in North Mogadishu
today.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the southern boundary town of Dolow indicated
that the Ethiopian forces were engaged in bitter fighting with
the Al-Itihad Islamic forces on the border areas two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Bile Hassan, a spokesman for the Al-Itihad Al-Islam in
Mogadishu said that 19 of his men were killed and 23 others
wounded in the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Ethiopia has deployed more troops at
Melkaray village near Bulo Hawo town on the Somali-Ethiopian
border.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources from the area put the casualty figures
much higher than that of the Al-Itihad spokesman. The sources
confirmed the death of 47 Al-Itihad militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the Al-Itihad Al-Islam and Ethiopia took
place at a time when some Somali factions are claiming progress
in their political talks for settling the Somali crisis in
Ethiopia. None of the Somali political factions has so far spoken
about the what's going on in Dolow.

<HEADLINE> Problem in Zaire Internal Affair: Eritrean FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The problem existing in
Zaire is an internal affair as most of the refugees in that
country have now returned home, said Eritrean Foreign Minister
Petros Solomon.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the weekly "Eritrea Profile"
published last Saturday, the remarks were made by the Eritrean
foreign minister after he returned Asmara from the recent summit
in Nairobi of east and central African leaders.
</P>
<P>
Petros stressed the need to work for a peaceful settlement of
the problem in Zaire in line with the resolution adopted at the
recent Nairobi summit.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a committee comprising four African
leaders was mandated by the summit participants to help achieve
an African solution to the crisis through negotiations between
those involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean minister further explained that participants of
the summit commended the government of Rwanda for the good
treatment it extended to the returnee refugees.
</P>
<P>
In view of the few remaining refugees in Zaire, the decision
made by the United Nations Security Council to deploy a
multinational force has become obsolete and unnecessary, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Official: Turkey Not to Sign Defense Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official denied here
today that Turkey would sign any defense cooperation agreement
with neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akber told reporters at a
weekly press conference that the subject of the defense
cooperation agreement between Turkey and Iran had not been
discussed during a four-day state visit to Turkey by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on December 19-22.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have neither project nor contract" on the defense
cooperation agreement with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Sabah today quoted Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Aladdin Burujerdin as saying that the defense
cooperation agreement would absolutely be signed.
</P>
<P>
Burujerdin said: "The talks (on the defense cooperation
agreement) began during the visit to Iran by Turkish Prime
Minister Necmeetin Erbakan in August and are continuing with high
speed," adding that it is possible that the agreement would be
reached in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has said that the cooperation in defense between Turkey
and Iran "was on the program."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister made the remarks before his
meeting with Burujerdin on August 10, who paid a visit to
Ankara to make preparations for Rafsanjani's visit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns has said that
the Clinton Administration does not approve "of military
cooperation by any of our allies with Iran. Iran ought to be
isolated. There should be no military or economic cooperation as
far as we are concerned. So we oppose."
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources told Xinhua that with the strong opposition
from the United States, Turkey, a member state of the NATO, would
not sign any defense cooperation agreement with Iran for the time
being.

<HEADLINE> 50 Foreign Nationals Arrested in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Immigration officials in
Sierra Leone have arrested up to 50 foreign nationals for
contravening the country's immigation laws.
</P>
<P>
An immigration source disclosed on Monday that a special
outside investigations team (SOIT) made a sweeping tour of the
provincial capitals of Bo, Kenema, Koidu and Makenizn, checking
about 386 foreign nationals. Some 165 were Lebanese, 13 British,
one American and the rest Africans including Nigerians, Gambians
and Guineans.
</P>
<P>
The SOIT was set up last year to carry out random checks on
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Fifty Lebanese have not renewed their residential permits or
failed to declare their actual immigration status, the source said.
</P>
<P>
''They have succeeded in defrauding the government of about
10,000 dollars by dodging the required payment fees,'' Principal
Immigration Officer Solomon Musa said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
According to Musa, ''the latest check is a precedent that will
go a long way to prevent such dishonest practices.''
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Attorney-General 's Office said some of
those arrested registered as dependants when they were actually
self employed.
</P>
<P>
A non national who is self employed is required to pay 300
dollars annually and 500 dollars for a dependant.
</P>
<P>
''Those who fail to regularise their stay and pay the necessary
penalties will be prosecuted and deported,'' the spokesman warned.
</P>
<P>
Checks in the capital are due soon, he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> State Property Administration to Make Major Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's administrative work on
state property is expected to realize several major changes in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
During the five years the sector will set up an administrative,
supervisory and operational system, with a clear definition on the
rights and responsibilities. Its structure, quality and
performance will be improved during the five year span.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Zhang Youcai, Vice-Minister of Finance
and Director of State Administration on State Property (SASP), who
was speaking at a national conference held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the SASP plans to turn its management system to
the market economy away from the current planned-economy
structure. Its emphasis will be shifted from individual
enterprises at present, to the restructuring of the entire
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration will, instead of emphasizing
micro-administration on state enterprises in the past, attach
greater importance to maintaining and increasing state property by
reinforcing infrastructure control and improving relevant
subordinative measures, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The SASP will explore new areas on administrative and
resource-like state assets simultaneously, rather than merely
focus on the administration of operational state property.
</P>
<P>
The SASP, which used to pay attention mainly to administration
on state-owned assets, will attach significance to the
administration on public-owned property, in a bid to develop the
assets of all kinds of enterprises in the country, and to make a
full display of the advantages of public ownership, Zhang said.

CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast peace coordinator
Dennis Ross arrived here today amid speculations that a deal
effecting Israeli troops pullout from Hebron might be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who will return to Israel tonight, will brief Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on developments concerning Israel's troop
withdrawal from the West Bank city with has been delayed since
last March.
</P>
<P>
Ross had separate meetings with both Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Saturday and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today reported progress made at an overnight talks
held between Israeli and Palestinian representatives at a
Jerusalem hotel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh said Ross has brought
new proposals, some of which "are acceptable to Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Media reports said a deal on Hebron could be reached as early
as later today.
</P>
<P>
With all the diplomatic efforts to smooth out differences,
tension has been mounting in the city of 500 Jews and 130,000
Arabs. Three fire bombs landed near Jewish settler homes in the
city Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two months of Israelis-Palestinians talks balked over Israel's
demands for better security guarantees for the settlers.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two sides have failed to resolved the three
sticking points, the Israeli demand for right to pursue extremist
suspects in the Arab territories, reopening of the Martyrs Street
and the Palestinian armament and joint patrols.

<HEADLINE> China's State Property Increases Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's state property had
topped 5.71 trillion yuan by the end of 1995, including over 4.5
trillion yuan in operational assets and over 1.2 trillion yuan in
non-operational property.
</P>
<P>
The figures were given by Vice-Minister of Finance and Director
of State Administration of State Property Zhang Youcai, who spoke
at a national conference in Beijing today on the administration of
state property.
</P>
<P>
The general volume of state-owned assets has continued to
increase steadily, and the growth is speeding up, Zhang said,
noting that the yearly increase since 1949 has stood at 12.4
percent. But it jumped to 14.5 percent since 1980 and 17.9 percent
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Currently, state property in enterprises accounts for over 65
percent of total property of all enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, employees in state firms make up 67 percent of the
total in urban areas, with 60 percent of state revenue coming from
the state economy.
</P>
<P>
The state economy now takes a lion's share in power, coal, oil,
metallurgical and chemical industries, and accounts for over 45
percent of the share in industries of electronics,
machine-building, light industry and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 302,000 state companies in the country, large
and medium firms make up only 15.5 percent in quantity, but their
assets are 82.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that after counting and checking on state property,
the state economy has its major force in these large and medium
firms which are playing a leading role in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong are the
five largest among the country's provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities in terms of the amount of state property.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial administrations in charge of railways, power
industry, posts and telecommunications, petroleum and gas
industry, and chemical industry are the five largest holders of
state property among all industrial departments, according to
Zhang.

<HEADLINE> China's Nonferrous Metals Industry Strides Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to be the
world's second largest nonferrous metals producer, with its output
of copper, lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum, magnesium, titanium,
antimony, tin and mercury expected to surpass 4.45 million tons
this year, 6.5 percent more over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among them, output of copper, aluminium, lead and zinc will
reach 900,000 tons, 1.74 million tons, 530,000 tons and nearly
1.08 million tons this year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
And enterprises which are directly under the China National
Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation are expected to turn out
2.55 million tons of the ten nonferrous metals this year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a rise in cost, as well as price cuts for the main
nonferrous metal products, the industry suffered a drop in
economic returns during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
And in the last two months of the year greater effort is
expected to help the corporation's enterprises pay more than 3.15
billion yuan of taxes this year, making them achieve a tax-profit
balance, instead of loss-making during the first ten months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The whole corporation is estimated to invest three billion yuan
in infrastructure construction, and nearly 1.4 billion yuan in key
technology-upgrade projects this year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is estimated to handle 1.78 billion US dollars
in foreign trade, with imports reaching 550 million US dollars,
and exports surpassing 1.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, the industry will attach more
importance to promoting implementation of pilot reforms for
companies, with the state holding a majority stake, enterprise
restructuring, technological applications and marketing
development, in a bid to enchance the strength of enterprises and
increase economic returns.
</P>
<P>
China plans to turn out 4.55 million tons of the ten nonferrous
metals in 1997, with output of copper and aluminum reaching
900,000 tons and more than 1.8 million tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises aim to earn more than one billion yuan in
profits, and 50 billion yuan in sales in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Instigators Doomed to Lose Popularity: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading official newspaper, carried a commentary today, refuting
some U.S. media's prejudice against the recent warming up of
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, by Wen Min, said the Sino-U.S. relations are
now gaining momentum towards improvement and many Americans of
insight, including some members of the U.S. think tank who once
had prejudice against and misunderstanding about China, are making
efforts to give impetus to this momentum.
</P>
<P>
But, however, some U.S. media, with their intrinsic arrogance
and prejudice, have time and again lodged groundless charges
against China and even made scathing criticism of those Americans
who stand for the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, said the
commentary entitled "Instigators Doomed to Lose Popularity."
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the New York Times has published several
articles spreading a so-called China threat and preaching a policy
of overall containment of China.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the newspaper even criticized U.S. government's
modification of its China policy, comparing it to the appeasement
policy adopted by former British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain in 1938-39.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times went so far as calling for a boycott of
commodities made in China to press the government to pursue a
tough China policy.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that even now some Americans still stubbornly cling
to the Cold War mentality," said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Chinese and U.S. economies are
complementary. The United States is China's second largest trade
partner, while China ranks the fifth among the trade partners of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is of mutual benefit to develop their economic and trade
relations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Sino-U.S. trade is increasing at a rate of
about 15 percent a year. In 1995, the trade volume of the two
countries totalled 40.83 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Should the U.S. government cancel China's most-favored-nation
status, U.S. consumers would have to pay an additional 15 billion
dollars per year, and some 200,000 American workers would lose
their jobs, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the large shares now enjoyed by U.S. products,
such as wheat, chemical fertilizers and aircraft, in the huge
Chinese market would probably be taken away by other countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Anti-Corruption Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's legal organs will make
more efforts to deal with major embezzlement and bribery cases
involving officials next year.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guoqing, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, made the remark at a national procurators'
conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that procuratorial organs nationwide will focus on
major corruption cases in party and government departments, law
enforcement and judicial organs and economic administrative
organs, especially those involving officials above county level.
</P>
<P>
The procurators are required to investigate major fields such
as finance, security, real estate, land leasing, building project
contracting and medical services.
</P>
<P>
He added that more efforts will be made in dealing with major
cases in those fields in an effort to guarantee the smooth
implementation of overall reforms.
</P>
<P>
Liang also called for efforts on strengthening the building of
anti-embezzlement and bribery bureaus, China's legal arm
specializing in eradicating corruption.
</P>
<P>
He asked the procuratorate organs to summerize the
characteristics of major corruption cases, and help departments
concerned to draft new regulations to prevent further corruption
cases.

<P>
The commentary called U.S. President Bill Clinton's judgement
that a secure, stable and prosperous China is in the interests of
the United States a correct one.
</P>
<P>
As for the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which is a major
argument mentioned by the New York Times, the commentary quoted
other major American newspapers as saying that the figure has been
greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
An article in the U.S.A. Today said the figure was inflated by
at least 50 percent. The claim that China has replaced Japan as
the top one to cause U.S. trade deficit is misleading, it added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said another article in the New York Times,
which tried to find fault with the encouragement of patriotism in
China, attempted to mislead the Americans by creating a false
impression that xenophobia is prevailing in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are serious when it concerns matters of
state sovereignty and national dignity. They eagerly hope that
their motherland will develop, become powerful and achieve an
early reunification. This patriotic enthusiasm is blameless, said
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It noted that in China, the patriotism cherished by most
Chinese people is rational. The attempt to depict the Chinese
people's rational patriotism as xenophobic nationalism was aimed
for nothing but creating another obstacle in improving
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The history of Sino-U.S. relations in the past 50 years,
starting from the U.S. blockade against China in 1949 to Richard
Nixon's China visit in 1972, the normalization of the
Sino-U.S. ties and the current China policy of "engagement"
pursued by the United States, reflected a historical trend to
improved relations.
</P>
<P>
"The press ought to adapt themselves to this historical trend,
respect the facts and give an active push to the development of
relations between the two countries," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
If the New York Times goes on as some of its writers were doing
and sticks to their prejudice, it will lose its credibility among
the readers sooner or later, the commentary warned.

<HEADLINE> Public Security Organs Urged to Keep On "Strike Hard" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading official today
urged public security organs in China to continue to implement the
successful "strike hard" principle in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"'Strike hard' should be integrated into effective prevention
and control in a bid to ensure a nationwide sustained stability in
social order," said Public Security Minister Tao Siju.
</P>
<P>
Tao delivered a report to a national conference of directors of
public security bureaus at all levels, which was held in
Guangzhou, the booming city of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Public security organs across the country have made marked
achievements this year in maintaining the country's social and
political stability, and public security, Tao said.
</P>
<P>
During the period of "strike hard", which began in last April,
public security organs have dealt with more than 390,000 major
cases, and some 70,000 criminals voluntarily surrendered, or were
seized and handed over to police by local residents, according to
Tao.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of "strike hard", the minister said, the
country's growth rate of criminal cases has slowed down, social
and security order in some places has improved, and the sense of
safety of residents has been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, public security organs in some 156
cities above prefectural level had set up alarm services, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, efforts have been made to control the
police according to law, and a supervision system has been built
to improve the professional ethics of police.

participate in international co-operation, facilitate
international exchanges, and try its best to introduce more
overseas investments in hi-tech industries, service industries,
modern agriculture, and construction of residential buildings.

<HEADLINE> Malfunction Causes Hercules Crash in HK Kai Tak Airport: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The fatal crash that led to
the death of half of the 12-member crew of a Lockheed Hercules
aircraft two years ago was most likely caused by a mechanical
malfunction, an accident investigation report said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The malfunction affected one of the aircraft's four propellers
which in turn caused the crash shortly after the aircraft's
take-off on September 23, 1994 at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport.
</P>
<P>
The propeller blades entered a fine-pitch configuration which
caused a loss in lift and extremely high drag resulting in a loss
of aircraft control, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation revealed that the most likely cause of the
propeller entering this mode, which is only used for taxiing, was
a failure of the throttle cable system.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was not carrying any passenger at the time of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
And the report contains nine safety recommendations. Six of
them are for improvements to operational and maintenance
procedures by the aircraft operator, Pelita Air Services. Two of
them concern the aircraft manufacturer's advice to aircraft
operators on emergency procedures and the type of throttle cables
to be used; the other recommendation is for Hong Kong Air Traffic
Management to ensure its emergency alerting list is up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
When the aircraft crashed, it was returning to its base in
Indonesia after having two flights from Hong Kong to Hanoi
carrying a total of 66 Vietnamese who were being returned to
Vietnam under the Orderly Repatriation Program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Unravel Niya Silk Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of scholars have
managed to translate the enigmatic language woven into a piece of
brocade found at ruins in the Buddhist city of Niya, in China's
northwestern region, which date back more than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The ruins are in the south of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region's Taklimakan Desert, where archaelogists last year dug up
several ancient graves. They say they believe that the piece of
cloth, with the words "five stars from the east favorable to the
central kingdom" woven into it, came from the Central Plains area,
now known as north China.
</P>
<P>
The rarity of this kind of brocade contributes to its great
archaeological value, said Yu Zhiyong, deputy director of the
Xinjiang Relics and Archaeology Institute.
</P>
<P>
The writing describes a rare astronomical occurrence of the
simultaneous appearance of the five planets Venus, Jupiter,
Mercury, Mars, and Saturn. The earliest account is believed to
have occurred as described in works by Shi Shen, a famous
astrologer of about 2,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ancient astrologers held the unique phenomenon to be auspicious
for rulers and the people in the central area. Military and
political affairs were decided in accordance with astronomical and
astrological signs, scholars point out.
</P>
<P>
Yu got clues on the meaning of the brocade text from an
imperial edict of 61 B.C. Other help in interpreting it was
discovered in the "Records of the Grand Historian," where it was
stated that five planets appeared together in the east when the
Han Dynasty was thriving.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan professor, Huang Yinong, says he was able to calculate
the year and determined that the astronomical phenomenon actually
occurred in 205 B.C., one year after Liu Bang, a warlord and later
first emperor of the Han Dynasty, defeated the Qin State.
</P>
<P>
Yu also said the finds are signs of the close ties between the
western region and the Central Plain, about 2,000 years ago, and
that the brocade is important for determining the date of the
graves.

<HEADLINE> Thai Plastic Product Exports Slide Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of plastic
products are expected to total 24 billion baht (960 million U.S.
dollars) in value this year, declining by 40 percent this year
compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Plastic Industry Association, the drastic
drop was due to fierce competition on the international markets,
especially from Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Fluctuating prices and higher costs to Thai manufacturers
generated by rising interest rates and freight charges also led to
the decrease.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that Thailand's plastic product
exports will rise only 10 percent in 1997 as this year's trend
might continue, while the country might face European Union's
charges of dumping plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bag is a major item of Thai plastic exports which
is estimated to post around 3 billion baht (120 million dollars)
this year.
</P>
<P>
Pradit Hiranpradit, chairman of the association, said that the
ten-percent growth target was based on expectations that the worst
had already occurred as some EU companies would delay their
imports of Thai plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
Pradit urged the government to help local manufacturers to
lower costs by reducing transport duties and seeking new markets.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that local petrochemical producers
could expand their production to bring down raw material costs
while local plastic product manufacturers could improve product
quality to prop up the exports.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt, Muslim Rebels to Open Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) negotiators have agreed
to open peace talks in January in Sultan Kudarat province, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said government peace broker Fortunato Abat has
agreed to the MILF proposal to begin the talks on January 3 at the
Da'wah Center in Sultan Kudarat town.
</P>
<P>
Abat was quoted as saying that the technical committees of both
sides would meet to establish the working parameters of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ghazali Gaafar, MILF spokesman, said the MILF had recommended
the holding of the talks "any day between January 2 and January
9," in anticipation of the Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting,
which will begin on January 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
Abat said his panel had long been ready for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos earlier turned down a proposal of the
MILF for him to chair the government panel, saying he has already
named Abat as head of the government panel that will hold peace
talks with the MILF and other southern Philippines groups.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the MILF have not
taken off because of their disagreement over several issues, such
as frame of reference on the talks, the terms and conditions of a
proposed ceasefire and even venue of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) which has signed a peace accord with the government,
has sought its own peace negotiations with the government as it
refused to honor the peace agreement forged between the government
and the MNLF.

COLOMBO, December 23 (Xinhua)-- The German government has
expressed its commitment to assistance in the rehabilitation of
Sri Lanka's northern Jaffna Peninsula, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
A technical appraisal mission of three German engineers has
been in Sri Lanka on behalf of the German Aid Agency.
</P>

The mission carried out an assessment of damages to water
supply systems, school buildings and civil housing in the area to
recommend the implementation of rehabilitation measures to the
agency, the sources said.

The team visited all accessible water supply schemes and a
large number of the 490 schools in the Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused by the prolonged unrest was assessed and the
means and measures to repair the damage have been outlined, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Immediate measures to supply safe drinking water to the
peninsula have been formulated and will be implemented at the
beginning of next year, the sources said, adding that the measures
regarding water supply and school building repair require further
technical planning and will be implemented as soon as possible.
</P>

Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels
who have waged a 13-year war for a separate state in the
north-east of the country. The peninsula was recaptured by the
government troops last May.

<HEADLINE> India's UF Leaders Anxious over Developments in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Rattled by the recent
developments in the Congress Party, senior United Front (UF)
ministers have got in touch with Congress Party President Sitaram
Kesri to know his future plan, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Kesri said he had no immediate plans to ask
the Congress Working Committee to withdraw support for the UF
minority government and the UF's fears at this stage were
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
There have been widespread fears among the 14-party UF that the
Congress Party, which lends support to the UF government in the
parliament, may end its favor at any time following former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's resignation from the leadership of
the Congress Parliamentary Party last week.
</P>
<P>
A senior minister representing an important UF constituent had
called on Kesri two days ago to find out whether the Congress
Party was working on a plan to withdraw support to the government
by March.
</P>
<P>
Kesri apparently told the minister that the Congress Party had
no such plan and the government should not become victim of its
fears, according to the Hindustan Times.
</P>
<P>
Kesri's aides said, however, that the UF leaders belonging to
different parties apprehend that once the new leadership of the
Congress Parliamentary Party was settled, the Congress Party
leadership was bound to turn its attention to the ties with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Kesri was of the view that the Congress Party's support to the
UF should continue for some more time and he has no time table for
toppling the government.

<HEADLINE> Defense Spending Rising in South Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The defense expenditure of the
South Asian countries have been increasing at a steady rate from
10.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1985 to 12 billion dollars in 1995 at
the 1990 constant prices.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Sunday here at an international seminar on
governance and development: South Asia in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote paper at the seminar, Executive Director of the
Regional Center for Strategic Studies Iftekharuz Zaman said that
of the countries, Sri Lanka recorded the steepest rise with its
defense expenditure from 311 million dollars to 701 million
dollars during the ten year period.
</P>
<P>
The share of defense expenditure has also been substantially
higher in public expenditure in India and Pakistan, the two
largest countries in the region, whose defense expenditure over
the period rose from 6.528 billion dollars and 2.165 billion
dollars to 8.853 billion dollars and 2.967 billion dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, the defense expenditure also rose from 265
million dollars in 1985 to 432 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the increase of defense expenditure.
But observers here noted that border military conflicts, civil war
and violent political conflicts might be the main cause for the
increase.
