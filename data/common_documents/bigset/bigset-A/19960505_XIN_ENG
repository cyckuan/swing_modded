<HEADLINE> Pak to Earn Half Million Dlrs from Italian Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will earn over half
million US dollars from new Italian tourist market this year, said
Awais Jawaid Bangash, Pakistani government's Consultant for
Tourism here today.
</P>
<P>
Bangash told a group of Pakistani travel operators that with
the new agreement signed recently between a major Italian tour
operator and Pakistan Tours Limited, the number of Italian
tourists will increase by more than one third in 1996 over last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, he said that the signed agreement
will enable Pakistan to receive over 1,200 tourists booked by this
firm alone from Italy this year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Consultant said that only this year Pakistan will
earn over half million US dollars from the signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that his company will send twice as many
tourists to Pakistan in the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said till 1995 Pakistan received an average of around 3,000
tourists from Italy each year, which was nothing compared to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangash disclosed that at present Pakistan is concluding more
agreements with the five other major tour operators from Italy.
</P>
<P>
These firms have already been provided with various itineraries
by Pakistan Tours Ltd. and booking of tour groups for Pakistan
will start shortly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) at
present is working on a plan to add another flight from Rome to
Islamabad which will become operational within a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
It will allow tourists from Italy to stay in Pakistan as long
as ten days instead of seven days at present.
</P>
<P>
With the addition of another flight and the duration of stay
extended, the foreign exchange earning will automatically increase
manifold, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangash said that by the year 1997, it is expected that the
country will earn over five million dollars from Italian tourist
alone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistani tourism industry is looking for
markets in America, Europe, the Pacific, Far East and the Gulf
region, where some countries have been ignored in the past.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tourism Generates  200 Million US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tourist industry generated
close to 200 million US Dollars in 1995, more than trebling the
amount five years back.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals have doubled since 1989 and trebled since 1985,
providing jobs for about 85,000 people, reports the First Marchant
Bank of Zimbabwse (FMB) in its latest quarterly guide to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The FMB said although Zimbabswe was still behind in world terms,
its tourist industry directly contributed only about 4.6 percent of
GDP compared with worldwide average estimated at more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the country was poised ''on the brink'' of considerable
growth in investment in new tourism-related facilities.
</P>
<P>
''With some of the best wildlife herds still remaining on the
African continent, the improving political climate in the region...
new proposals for expansion are being considered by Zimbabwean hotel
groups as well as the department on national parks and wildlife
management, which is soon to be commercialised to ensure a more
dependable income base,'' says the FMB. enditem

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto said here today that Pakistan supports the suggestion of
embargo on arms to Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of foreign correspondents at the Prime
Minister's House this evening, Bhutto said that so much forces had
been used but no solution came out for the long-term Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of the arms embargo was raised at the debate of
the Afghan issue in the UN Security Council at the end of this
March.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Bhutto stressed that Pakistan has no
intention of sending arms to Afghanistan and does not do so.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the international monitor to ensure the embargo on
arms to the war-torn Afghanistan," she added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan also supports the efforts made by the UN and the
Organization of Islamic Conference for restoring peace in
Afghanistan, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has no favorites in Afghanistan," she stressed,
adding that Pakistan could have good relations with all Afghan
groups.
</P>
<P>
Answering another question, Bhutto said that the suggestion of
setting up a "broad-based" government in Afghanistan was raised by
Afghan parties, not by Pakistan.
</P>

She expressed the hope that international efforts will help
bring peace to the war-ravaged country.

ULAN BATOR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring six on
the Richter scale struck southern Mongolia today, with a smaller
temblor half an hour later, but so far there are no reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The quake happened at 13:34 local time (05:34 GMT), Dugarmaa,
director of the Earthquake Research Center of the Mongolian
Academy of Science told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was the remote area of Magnituud,

<HEADLINE> Chechen Deputy PM Arrested for Stealing Budget Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian police on Friday arrested
Beslan Gantamirov, deputy prime minister of the pro-Moscow Chechen
government, on charges of stealing state budget funds, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a probe into thefts of billions of roubles of federal
funds allocated for reconstruction in the war-torn republic, the
Federal Prosecutor-General's Office found Gantamirov was "one of
the organizers of these operations," Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Gantamirov, formerly mayor of the Chechen
capital Grozny before becoming deputy prime minister last
December, was accused of "organizing the theft of several billion
roubles" from state budget funds, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ruslan Martagov, spokesman for Chechen head of state Doku
Zavgayev, was quoted by Itar-Tass as saying the arrest of
Gantamirov, second to Zavgayev, was "a serious blow to the
authority of the Chechen government."
</P>
<P>
Gantamirov was responsible for the taxation, customs and
auditing services and the licensing commission. He was elected
mayor of Grozny in 1991, but in 1993 he became a leader of the
armed opposition to Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev
after the city council was dissolved by the rebel.
</P>
<P>
After Russian troops captured Grozny in February 1995,
Gantamirov was reinstated as mayor.

<HEADLINE> Settlers to Occupy More Buildings in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Jewish settlers in Hebron
said today that they will occupy more buildings in the disputed
West Bank town, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the settlers are intending to occupy 10
additional buildings in the town's old Jewish neighborhood, and
bring 100 more settlers into the town.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the Peace Now movement, an Israeli
left-wing organization, called on the Israeli government to block
such attempt by the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the peace group said that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be resolved and true peace
achieved with the evacuation of the Jewish settlers in Hebron,
not just with the redeployment of Israeli army in the town.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank town to be handed over to the
Palestinian National Authority, in accordance with the Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army had already completed its redeployments in
other major Palestinian towns of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah,
Bethlehem, Kalikilya and Tulkarm in the West Bank by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel postponed the withdrawal of its troops from
Hebron, which was scheduled to be concluded on May 28, due to
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, after meeting
with top army and security officials, apparently decided to
further delay the redeployment in Hebron until after Israel's May
29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Al-Natsheh today sharply criticized
Peres' decision during a meeting with the leaders of the Peace
Now movement, who paid a visit to the town this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians are insisting the Israeli troops
leave, adding that the arrival of the Palestinian police will put
an end of violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the West Bank
town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
During the redeployment in Hebron, Israeli army is expected to
leave 85 percent of the town's municipal area, and then to
redeploy in the remaining 15 percent of the city.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company To Increase Uranium Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian uranium giant Cameco
Corp. plans to increase its annual production by 50 percent by the
year of 2005, the Financial Post daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The production increases is needed to meet the projected rising
demand from nuclear reactors, Cameco Chief Executive Bernard
Michel told the company's annual meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the world's leading uranium producer with an 18 percent
market share, the Saskatchewan-based Cameco last year produced a
record 6.81 million kilograms of uranium from mines in Canada's
Saskatchewan Province and the U.S. state of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
It also produces about 10,500 tonnes of reactor-ready material
from its Ontario conversion facilities.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 17 percent of the world's electricity is
generated by nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Michel predicted that the annual world consumption of uranium
will grow to 78 million kilograms in 2005 from today's 71.2
million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The former eastern bloc countries will continue to meet their
needs from domestic sources, and won't be an available market to
western producers, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, given that China has earmarked on an ambitious nuclear
program and that Cameco has made some inroads into the Czech
Republic, such assumptions could be conservative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cameco plans to expand its production by bringing on two new
Saskatchewan mines at McArthur River and Cigar Lake, which will
replace its soon-to-be depleted Key Lake and Rabbit Lake
operations, he said.

Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The opening session of the 16th Chinese Cultural Week was

"I have felt -- as all who have visited China have done -- how
great that people are and how glorious their renaissance is," he

<HEADLINE> Africa Ready For Business: Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND, South Africa, May 4 (Xinhua) -- "Africa will connect!
Indeed, Africa is ready for business," announced an international
business conference called "Africa Connect" in a communique here
today.
</P>
<P>
In the communique called "Johannesburg Declaration", African and
international participants from over 500 firms and business
organizations "implore the international community to consider the
Africa connect program of technical assistance follow-up activities".
</P>
<P>
They urged the UN to "set up a separate trust fund for such a
purpose" or consider the program as "an integral part of the recently
announced 25-billion-US-dollar UN system-wide special initiative on
Africa".
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium which ended today "represents a defining
moment for the future of business development on the continent and the
process of connecting the various national markets with themselves and
with Transnational Corporations (TNCS) in the rest of the world," said
the declaration.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, participants "exchanged experiences on doing
business in Africa in various sectors and industries,...initiated
very numerous deals among themselves, and committed themselves to
various further pro-active measures in order to make Africa 'the
dragon of the 21st century'," the statement declared.
</P>
<P>
It said the experiences of enterprises have been encouraging
despite the negative images and the stereotyping of the region.
</P>
<P>
While business in petroleum and mining remains rewarding as
ever, and the agricultural and fishing outlook has become more
favorable, "the more modern sectors offer equally inviting, but
largely unexplored, prospets," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It noted, "the conference found the African market attractive
for agro-industry and clothing manufacture, production of consumer
durables, infrastructure strengthening of telecommunications, power,
transportation and construction and the development of tourism."
</P>
<P>
It urges African states to continue on the path of economic reform,
saying, "the improvement in recent years in the legislative and
regualtory framework for doing business is beginning to bear bountiful
fruit as many African countries make a determined effort to prepare
themselves for entry into the competitive world of globalization."
</P>
<P>
It said, "the fostering of government-private sector harmony and
partnership, and the transfer to the private sector of the burden for
producing goods and services, should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
"For the purpose of nurturing entrepreneurship and enterprise
development, the state should provide incentives and support services,
where appropriate."
</P>
<P>
It also urged governments of developed countries "to contribute
to this business development process by allowing free (non tariff)
entry of goods manufactured in africa."
</P>
<P>
"Synergies and economies of scale can be derived from the
collective efforts of the African countries," said the declaration,
which also urged African states to engage in north-south joint
ventures and south-south joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"To facilitate this process of connecting african markets, the
conference recommends the regionalization of business associations,"
it said, noting that a regional chamber of commerce, a regional
manufacturers asssociation, and a regional investment promotion agency
should be set up.
</P>
<P>
In order to assist the process of connecting with the world
outside of Africa, the declaration "urges the government-private
sector partners to set up african investment and trade offices
(AITO) abroad, especially in Europe, Asia and North America."
</P>
<P>
During the hot debate in the three-day symposium, a participant
said, "Africa today is not a dark Africa, not a violent Africa, but a
promising Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Africa Connect should enjoy funding from the United Nations," a
delegate from the UN Economic Commission for Africa said this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the meeting today considered the conference
"successful" as it has achieved its aims to promote awareness of
business opportunities in Africa, exchange information and experience
about investing and trading in Africa and put businessmen interested
in prospects on Africa in touch with each other. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Starts Slaughtering Cows to Eradicate BSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain has started the selective
slaughtering program in an effort to restore the consumers'
confidence and achieve an early lifting of the European Union's
(EU) world-wide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Abbatoir workers in Scotland slaughtered 100 cows on Friday and
sprayed the carcasses with orange dye to indicate the meat was
unfit for human consumption, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of 250,000 cows, over 30 months old, due to
be slaughtered over the coming few months and the selective
culling is expected to cost at least one billion pounds (1.5
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has announced that
they would officially lodge a legal challenge to the EU beef ban
next week.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef products exports
last month when the British government admitted that there was
some possible link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent CJD disease.
</P>
<P>
The British farmers would argue that the ban, which has halted
exports worth 600 million pounds (about 900 million dollars) a
year, was illegally imposed in an attempt to allay consumer panic
and not because of a scientifically proven risk to human health.
</P>
<P>
They would also argue that the EU Commission had no legal
powers to impose a global ban and it was disproportionate and
unnecessary as the British government has taken adequate measures
to tackly the problem.

<HEADLINE> Israel Shells Iglim Al-Toffah in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli occupation forces in
southern Lebanon today shelled Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge used by
Lebanese Moslem guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks at
Israel.
</P>
<P>
So far, there were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said the Israeli forces fired artillery
around 6:30 p.m. (15:30 GMT) from a position at Aishiyeh, Jezzine,
in the northern sector of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces bombarded Jebal Al-Rafih and the
vicinities of Sejoud and Rihan villages, the security sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind tonight's bombardment was still unknown.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians were killed and some 400
wounded in 16 days of Israeli bombardment in southern Lebanon
last month, before a cease-fire understanding was reached on April
26.
</P>
<P>
Although civilians are allegedly freed from military attacks, it
is not expected that the cease-fire understanding would finally
end the exchange of gunfire at the last battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Bankers Agree on Refinancing Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The leading creditor banks of
Eurotunnel have agreed on a refinancing program for the
Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources confirmed today that Eurotunnel's four leading
creditor banks had approved at a meeting in Paris on Friday a
negotiating position which would form the basis of talks with the
company this week.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for National Westminster Bank, one of the two
British banks on the steering committee, said Friday night that
the banks would meet Eurotunnel in the next few days to put
forward their proposal.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Paris meeting is the first sign of a
breakthrough in the long and tense debate over Eurotunnel's
future, since it halted interest payments on its debt last
September after deciding that it could not meet its interest
payments from revenues for many years.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel, which last month announced losses in 1995 of 925
million pounds (1.4 billion US dollars), one of the biggest in
British corporate history, welcomed the news, saying "It is nice
that they have been able to get their act together and agree on
something."
</P>
<P>
Banking sources say that the outline proposal contain a range
of options, and one of them is a debt-for-equity swap which would
result in the lenders holding a 49 percent of the company's stake.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the proposal could include converting part of
the debt into convertible bonds, reducing the interest rate on the
outstanding part of the debt for a number of years and extending
the payment period.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo's Separatists Claim Responsibility for Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A separatist organization, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, has claimed responsibility for terrorist
attacks last week in Serbia's province Kosovo, Belgrade daily
Vecernje Novosti reported today.
</P>
<P>
The organization made a statement on the Albanian-language
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) program that it had carried
out the reprisal actions on April 22 in Kosovo and Metohija
(Kosmet) in which five Serbs were killed and five injured,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The organization, which also belongs to the outlawed National
Front for the Liberation of Kosovo, announced on the program that
they would carry out "other similar actions" which they described
as the "continuation of armed war in Kosovo" and the spreading of
conflicts to the entire Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Five Serbs, including two police, were killed and five other
wounded within 70 minutes in four separate terrorist attacks
carried out in several towns in Kosmet on April 22. The incident
followed the killing of an Albanian student by a Serb man on the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million population
in Kosovo in southern Yugoslavia. Many in the province seek
independence from Serbia so as to merge with neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
The organization also claimed that they were responsible for
the series of bomb attacks on five refugee camps in Kosmet,
Vecernje Novosti said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government stripped the province of its autonomy
in 1989 and around 150 people have died in clashes between the two
ethnic communities since then.

JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today paid tribute to late Joe Slovo for his part in
negotiating a democratic settlement in the country.
</P>
<P>
While unveiling a tombstone on Slovo's grave in Soweto near
Johannesburg, Mandela said the country's final constitution,
scheduled to be adopted on May 8, would be a living monument to
Slovo and his tireless efforts.
</P>
<P>
Slovo, former leader of the South African Communist Party
(SACP) and Housing Minister, died last year after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Slovo had been at the forefront of the drive to
build a partnership of government.
</P>
<P>
"That partnership and the new patriotism which imbues it, is
a living monument to his dedication to mobilizing the nation so
that poverty should be eliminated from our land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the former communist leader had understood tactics and
strategies and had known when to fight and when to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
When the opportunity for negotiation arose he threw his weight
behind the process and fought vigorously to fashion the kinds of
compromise needed to move the process forward, added the
president.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today aired his party's strategy for
the forthcoming local elections, giving first priority to fight
against crime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an election rally in Hibberdene of Kwazulu/natal
Province, Buthelezi said escalating crime in the province was
leading to the degeneration of society.
</P>
<P>
The local government election is scheduled to be held on May
29 in the province.
</P>
<P>
However, President Nelson Mandela has yet to give his final
word on whether the local poll would go ahead in the
violence-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Mandela appointed a multi-party election task team
to assess the feasibility of holding the elections on May
29.
</P>
<P>
The president called for an extraordinary cabinet meeting on
Monday to discuss the proposals made by the presidential task
team on the time table of the poll.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said his party was opposed to Mandela's African
National Congress plan to put all the crime-fighting powers in
the hands of the government. He held that local authorities must
assume real powers to ensure effective policing of the community.
</P>
<P>
The IFP leader announced a 12-point crime crackdown plan,
including support for a referendum on the reintroduction of the
death penalty, which was repealed last year.

<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A case of BSE, known as mad cow
disease, has been confirmed in the Irish Republic for the first
time since the wave of the current British-based scare over the
disease was stirred up in March, reported BBC TV today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, in a cow in County Cork last month, led to the
slaughter of 183 animals on the farm involved.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy of the Irish government, the BSE-infected
cattle will be automatically slaughtered so as to prevent the

LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's major faction leader
Charles Taylor said today he was hopeful of a ceasefire in his
war-torn country in view of the fact that his opponent Roosevelt
Johnson, leader of the ethnic Krahn militias, has agreed to the
proposed peace talks in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this development," said Taylor, Vice-Chairman of
the Liberian interim government.
</P>
<P>
Johnson has agreed to take part in the multi-party peace talks
in Accra, capital of Ghana, mediated by the United States and
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Under the increased public pressure the U.S. government
toughened its stance, announcing that Taylor and other warlords
would be barred from the U.S. if they refused to engage in peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Taylor softened his earlier stance that there would be no
peace until Johnson is arrested.

<HEADLINE> UK Tories Rally around Embattled John Major: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Most of British Tory members of
parliament want Prime Minister John Major as their party leader to
lead them into the general election scheduled for next May,
despite the Tories' humiliating defeat in the local elections held
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An exclusive survey of backbench Conservative opinion conducted
by the Daily Express tabloid said that overwhelming majority of
the Tories supported Major to stay at the helm.
</P>
<P>
Of 97 Tory MPs who responded directly, 92 indicated that the
embattled prime minister should lead them into the next general
election and only five argued that he should quit.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the verdict of these Tories will be a big
boost to the prime minister, who feared that the defeat in the
local elections would plunge his party into renewed turmoil and
provoke another leadership crisis.

The delegation, representing various Afghan groups and
ministries, will have fruitful discussions with the Pakistani
side, the sources added.

denied by the later, for supporting the Taliban religious student
militia, who besieged Kabul since last October and vowed to topple

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Grand Military Maneuver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched a grand military
maneuver in its northeastern region bordering Turkey as a tough
gesture toward the "potential threat" stemming from the military
cooperation between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the first stage
of the grand "Ashura" maneuver will be carried in four cities of
Orumiyeh, Maku, Salmas and Khoy.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the four cities in Iran's West
Azarbaijan province are very close to the border line with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, they noted, the Iranian authorities assumed a tough
stance toward its neighbor of Turkey because it allows Israel to
train its air forces pilots in the Turkish sky under a military
accord signed by the two countries in February.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities maintain that the military cooperation
between Israel and Turkey pose a grave threat to the national
security of this country.
</P>
<P>
Some well-informed sources said that a number of citizens
living in northwestern Iran are now worrying about military
strikes by Israeli air forces, some even are leaving from the
region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 "Ashura" battalions and three "al-Zahra"
battalions are taking part in the maneuver with an aim of raising
the combat readiness of Basij (volunteers) forces, according to
the IRNA report.
</P>
<P>
A field commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
(IRGC) said that the main objective behind the war games was to
control the border crossings of the province and protect
sensitive spots in Orumiyeh, Maku, Salmas and Khoy.

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Runs Fastest 5000 Meters of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- World 10,000-meter record holder
Wang Junxia ran the year's fastest women's 5000-meter time Sunday
at the Chinese track and field trials for the Atlanda Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won the 10,000m gold medal at the world championships
in 1993 and set world record of 29 mintues and 31.78 seconds one
month later in the same event, led all the way in the day's 5,000m
race with a 14:51.87 winning time.
</P>
<P>
The time also ranked sixth in the world last year. Wang placed
sixth in the world in 1995 with a personal best time of 14:53.08.
</P>
<P>
"I ran the race according to our plan," Wang said. "I'm
satisfied with the result. I knew I could break the 15 minute line
before the race. With two months to go, I believe I can do better
than this at the Olympics," added the Chinese, who broke away from
coach Ma Junren's Ma's Army three years ago.
</P>
<P>
But her coach Mao Dezhen refused to make any comments, only
saying "We made up a plan and Wang carried it out well."
</P>
<P>
Wang led the pace throughout, and wound up each lap within 71
seconds. She finished the final lap with a 67-seconds kick.
</P>
<P>
Wei Li finished second in 15:11.78, ahead of Yin Lili, 15:18.14.
</P>
<P>
Wang's team leader Cao Dalin told Xinhua that their plan was to
break the 15-minute line. "We asked Wang to lead the pace from the
start and wrap up each lap within 71 seconds. The plan was as
simple as that," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, who was coached by Ma Junren and set the world junior
record of 14:45.90 last October in Nanjing, stepped out of the
race after seven laps.
</P>
<P>
The ace runner of the famous Ma's Army broke into tears when
she left the track.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ma Junren's runners, like Qu Yunxia, Wang Yuan and
Jiang, seemed to have no hopes to qualify for the Olympic team
unless they can do well in the 1,500 and 10,000 meters later.
</P>
<P>
In the women's javelin final, Beijing's Li Lei lofted the spear
to 66.58 meters, also a year's best which could list her fifth in
the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Sun Caiyun, former world record setter of 4.23 meters, bettered
the women's Asian record with a 4.25 leap. Another Chinese girl
Cai Weiyan also broke the record with a 4.25 jump, but listed
second. The women's pole vault is not an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
After world star runners Qu Yunxia and Wang Yuan failed to
qualify for the women's 800 meters final Sunday, the race was won
by Zhang Jian in 1:59.45, a mark could be only listed the 26th in
the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Zou Sixin leaped 16.94 meters in the men's triple jump final
and Li Tong stormed into the men's 110-meter hurdles final with a
13.65 heat result.
</P>
<P>
The trials, also serves as the national championships, will
close on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Striking Guards to Close Archaeological Sites in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Tourists planning to visit museums
and archaeological sites across Greece will find many of them
closed this week because of a strike by Culture Ministry employees
demanding higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The strike will peak Thursday and Friday with one of the
world's most visited sites, the acropolis, being shut down along
with the Temple of Zeus at Sounion, 50 kilometers west of Athens,
and the site of the ancient oracle of Delphi, central Greece.
</P>
<P>
Monday and Tuesday, the archaeological museum at Salonika,
northern Greece, plus the ancient sites in Corinth and the
Mycenaean acropolis, both in the Peloponnese, will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Apart from demands for a bigger share of the state budget to be
spent on culture, the guards also want their 25,000 drachma (about
108 U.S. dollar) monthly salary bonus to be doubled. The bonus
itself was established after a series of strikes last year.
</P>
<P>
The tourist operators are worried about the situation and warned
that if strikes continue, the wave of tourists will decrease.

<HEADLINE> New York, New Jersey Plan to Deepen New York Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The governors of New York and New
Jersey have endorsed a plan earmarking up to 130 million U.S.
dollars to deepen New York Harbor, The New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
For years, New York Harbor, which generates each year 166,500
jobs in the two states along with 20 billion dollars in annual
sales of goods, has been plagued with rising shoals of silt.
Experts say that the problem is so serious that it has already
cost the area trade and jobs and may soon end the harbor's
150-year-old status as as the dominant Eat Coast seaport.
</P>
<P>
Outlined in a one-page resolution released by Governor Christine
Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Governor George Pataki of New York,
the plan will allocate four times as much money for dredging as
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey normally spends each
year to maintain its channels and berths. Port Authority
commissioners are scheduled to vote on the resolution next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls the deepening of channels to 50 feet a
"top priority" of the states. It says it is vital for New York
Harbor to be able to accommodate a new generation of deep-draft
ships that is expected to begin carrying cargo from Asia to the
East Coast.

PARIS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister Eduard
Balladur said today that he is optimistic about the prospect of
French-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
Both France and China, two permanent members of the United
States Security Council, bear regional and global
responsibilities, Balladur told Chinese reporters before his
week-long China visit which will start Monday.

countries to establish friendly and stable relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Enterprises to Benefit from Interest Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Shenzhen special economic
zone is expected to cut interest rates on loans by an average of
1.12 percentage points and those on deposits by an average of 0.83
percentage points, starting this month.
</P>
<P>
The cuts were made after the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, decided to lower interest rates on loans by an
average of 0.75 percentage points and those on deposits by 0.98
percentage points on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province, is the only
city in China empowered by the central government to decide
interest rates for itself," said Wang Xiyi, head of the local
branch of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Lowering the interest rates will further benefit local
enterprises by reducing the burden of interests on their
shoulders, promoting sustained economic growth, spurring the
development in capital market and revitalizing the real estate
sector," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Our cuts in loans interest rates are higher than the national
average level, our cuts in deposit interest rates are lower than
the national average level, and enterprises will not be required
to pay compound interests on overdue loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The adjusting of interest rates in Shenzhen will add about 800
million yuan in returns to local enterprises, 145 million yuan to
local financial institutions, and individuals are expected to lose
about 600 million yuan in deposit interests in 1996, reveal
statistics released by the local branch of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the re-distribution of interests are favorable to
enterprises," another official noted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded firms in Shenzhen have large deposits in
renminbi yuan, accounting for about 20 percent of the total in
Shenzhen, and they will benefit from the interest cuts, too.
</P>
<P>
An interest rates mechanism linked to the market economy has
taken shape in Shenzhen since it was authorised by the central
bank to keep the initiative in its own hands in adjusting interest
rates within certain range in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate mechanism has sustained healthy growth in
Shenzhen's economy," said Wang, adding that "Shenzhen, however,
has been cautious in using the rather independent mechanism as we
have to consider the macro economic policies across the country
and try not to produce too negative effects on other regions which
are different from Shenzhen."

WUHAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The main hall of a famous Taoist
temple in central China's Hubei Province reopened to followers
today after a five year renovation program.
</P>
<P>
The Zixiao Main Hall of the Zixiao Daoist Temple, constructed
about 900 years ago in the Song dynasty (960-1279), is one of the
best preserved ancient buildings in the Wudang Mountains, and is
listed as one of the world's cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Since December, 1990, China has set up a special working group
and raised four million yuan to pay for the repair of the main
hall.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitated main hall is a brick-and-wooden structure,
with vivid colored glazed birds and beasts decorated on its
ridges, and hundreds of ancient statues of gods and sacrificial
vessels in the shrines for idols.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Taoist Association in the Wudang Mountains
said that they have raised more than 10 million yuan to maintain
ancient buildings in the mountain area.

<HEADLINE> Aidid Declares EU Envoy Persona Non-Grata </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of General Mohamed
Farah Aidid today declared the European Union's special envoy to
Somalia, Mr Sigurd Illing, as persona non-grata with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, General Mohamed Farah Aidid accused Mr
Illing of widely masterminding the international audience by
spreading the bad sides of his government.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid, who controls South Mogadishu, has also
criticized the EU for using all its resources to finance the
conflicts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Aidid said Mr Illing had met with the European Union embassies
in Kenya only two days prior to the arrival of United Nations
Secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Illing promised the EU ambassadors a UN supervised alternative
to the government of General Aidid in Somalia, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy told EU embassies in Nairobi that the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) will take control of Baidoa
and Bakol regions of southwestern Somalia within a week, the
statement alleged.
</P>
<P>
Aidid expressed the firm stand in the statement that no
foreign designed solutions for Somalia, whether menu of options
or otherwise, would ever have the slightest chance of success.
</P>
<P>
"Boutros Ghali and Illing are not only Naive but deceive
themselves and the international community can not just ignore
General Aidid," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated General Aidid's strong objection to the
UN liaison office in Nairobi and called for its total closure.
</P>
<P>
It warned of possible catastrophe upon the opening of any
branch of UN office anywhere in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Armenian Presidents Hold Talks  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the Sino-Armenian summit talks demonstrated that
bilateral ties had entered a new period of development.
</P>
<P>
He made this statement during talks with visiting Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrocyan at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian president and his party arrived in Beijing last
Friday on a four-day state visit to China. It is the first visit
to China by a head of state from Armenia since the country gained
independence.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, Jiang said that although the two
countries are far from each other, the long history of friendly
contacts between peoples of the two countries is the important
driving power of the growth of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, he said, the
two countries had maintained high-level exchanges, and their
cooperation in various fields was making progress.
</P>
<P>
Levon Ter-Petrocyan said that since Armenia is seeking to join
the international community, it is of special significance for the
country to develop relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"China's achievement in reform and opening up makes Armenia
confident of finding its suitable way to prosperity," he continued.
</P>
<P>
China, as a factor in keeping stability in Asia and in the
world at large, plays an important role in global politics, he
said, adding that Armenia fully supports China's principal stand
on the Taiwan issue, and hopes to further expand its friendly ties
with China. There is no obstacle in this regard, he said.

<P>
Jiang said that China would like to pursue long-term stable
relations with Armenia by respecting the choice of the Armenian
people, and supporting the Armenian government's efforts for
safeguarding independence and sovereignty, as well as for
developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
China would also like to see Armenia maintaining good relations
with its neighboring countries by solving conflicts through
peaceful negotiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and Armenia should further their
mutually-beneficial cooperation in the fields of trade, science
and technology, as well as culture, while strengthening
coordination on international issues.
</P>
<P>
China appreciated Armenia's stand of seeking no official ties
with Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade, as an important part of the bilateral ties,
is complementary, he said, adding that China would like to explore
flexible cooperation ways in this regard on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Touching on China's diplomatic policy, Jiang said that China
will neither form an alliance with any big power, nor take
ideology into account in international relations, and firmly
opposed hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
China will forever play a positive role in maintaining peace
and spurring development in the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrocyan spoke highly of China's independent peaceful
diplomatic policy.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two leaders also briefed each other their
countries' domestic situations, and exchanged views on issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Levon Ter-Petrocyan signed a joint
communique which laid the foundation for the development of
bilateral ties. They also attended the signing ceremony of the
agreements of Sino-Armenian cooperation in the fields of taxation,
civil air transportation and culture.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Media Lash out at Washington's Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian media have in the past few
days severely criticized the U.S. for its failure to act as a fair
Middle East peace process mediator.
</P>
<P>
This criticism comes after the recent U.S. strategic accord
with Israel was concluded, and after the U.S. State Department
issued a statement in which Syria was listed as a
terrorism-sponsoring country.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian media have accused Washington of feeding the
aggressiveness of Israel's policy by signing with Tel Aviv a
security and military accord "intended to protect Israeli
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Syrian official sources have condemned the U.S. State
Department for intentionally publishing -- while Israeli Prime
Minister Peres was in the U.S. -- a report in which it accused
Syria and Lebanon of supporting terrorism, ignoring the recent
Israeli atrocities in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Political observers think that the U.S. statements, which were
made a few days ago and which implied doubt about Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad's wish to achieve a fair and overall peace in the
Middle East, have aroused the indignation of Syria and made it
feel disappointed in the U.S. Administration.
</P>
<P>
Syria has repeatedly affirmed that President Assad's belief
in a fair and comprehensive peace has not been and will never be
shaken despite Peres' practices which arouse suspicion in his
seriousness about establishing a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria has also expressed doubt about the compatibility of the
U.S. administration's recent attitudes with the fact that the
U.S. is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Syria calls on the U.S. to be sincere in both words and deeds,
as the people of the region feel a big difference between what the
U.S. administration says about a fair and comprehensive peace and
what it does in showing partiality to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrians think that this big difference between what is declared
by Washington and what is actually carried out by it creates a
great deal of doubt about the credibility of the U.S. policy
toward the region, and that the U.S. partiality to Israel at the
expense of the Arabs would be greatly detrimental to the U.S. role
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian media have reaffirmed that Syria wants peace, but it
must be a fair peace, because establishing peace in the Middle
East is in the interest of the whole world.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls For Taming Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has called on
local governments in the Huaihe River region to step up measures
to control this, third longest river in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ending a five-day inspection trip to east China's Anhui
Province on Saturday, Li said that the taming of the river is
still an arduous job, although years of efforts are gradually
paying off.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River region, which meanders across Henan, Shandong,
Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, is the home of 150 million people.
Because of frequent flooding and poor water control facilities,
the region used to suffer many natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Li said during the trip that water control is one of the
fundamental conditions for agricultural development. During the
past five years, both the central and local governments have
increased investment in projects for controlling the Huaihe river,
which has led to an improvement in anti-disaster abilities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, the four provinces in the region should
continue to join hands in taming the river and making it possible
to deal with the worst flooding, Li said, adding that water
pollution in the region should also be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
As Anhui is one of China's major grain producers, the premier
also urged the province to play a greater role in the nation's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other provinces, Anhui boasts excellent
infrastructure in the farming sector and has a bright future in
agricultural production, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He asked local governments to rely on modern science and
technology to upgrade medium- and low-yield farmland and strive to
increase the province's annual grain output by five million tons
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Also during the trip, the premier urged governments at various
levels nationwide to improve urban planning and strengthen
protection of farmland. He said that the scale of large cities
should be strictly controlled and an adequate development of
medium- and small cities should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
On reform and development of state-owned enterprises, Li said
that the firms' potential should be fully tapped to increase the
efficiency of input, and technological renovation should be given
top priority.
</P>
<P>
The premier also asked local governments to step up cultural
and ideological building to create a better environment for
economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> Well-Known Chinese Poet Ai Qing Is Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Famous Chinese poet Ai Qing died
today in Peking Union Medical College Hospital at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
The poet, who had devoted his life to writing poems praising
Chinese revolution, was once described by the American Newsweek
Magazine as the "Prince of Chinese poets'.
</P>
<P>
He was hospitalized in Beijing on March 18 after he was found
to have a lung infection and heart problems. His heart stopped
beating for about three hours on March 26, but he was revived.
</P>
<P>
Ai died 04:15 (Beijing Time) today of what doctors said was
exhaustion of several organs.
</P>
<P>
On hearing the news, Ding Guangen, member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and head
of the party's Publicity Department, made a phone call to Ai's
family, expressing his condolences over the death of the poet.
</P>
<P>
Ding said Ai Qing made outstanding contributions to Chinese
literature and remarkable achievements in prose, poetry, and
poetry theory.
</P>
<P>
His widow Gao Ying, who married Ai in 1956, cited her husband
as one of the most outstanding contemporary poets and writers,
adding that that he was a "sincere and honest man".
</P>
<P>
Before his death, Ai Qing had asked his family not to arrange a
traditional commemorative ceremony as a last respect to his
remains, nor did he request they be thrown into the sea or
mountains, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Ai Qing, vice-chairman of Chinese Writers Association, wrote
at least at least 20 long lyrics and narrative poems, 1,000 poems
of less than 100 lines and nearly 200 essays on art and
literature, novels and prose.
</P>
<P>
One of his best known poems was "Dayanhe -- My Nurse", a long
lyric of more than 100 lines that has been translated into a dozen
languages, including French, Japanese, English, German,
Portuguese, and Russian.
</P>
<P>
The poem, which was written in 1933 when the patriotic young
painter was imprisoned by the Kuomintang government, expressed his
curses and hatred over the "immoral" old world.
</P>
<P>
In late 1980s, French President Jacques Chirac, then prime
minister, wrote a letter to the translator of the French version
of Ai Qing's poem "rock", expressing his appreciations on the
quality of the poem.
</P>
<P>
Ai Qing, who studied oil painting in Paris during 1929 and
1932, was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by
then French president Francois Mitterrand in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Born in March 1910 in a picturesque village in Jinhua city of
coastal Zhejiang province, the poet, originally named Jiang
Haicheng, went to France to study painting in 1929 following a
one-year study of painting in the Hangzhou West Lake Arts School.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Left-wing Artists League after his return to
China in 1932. He was arrested by secret agents with the French
concession, or settlement, in Shanghai the next year and
extradited to the Kuomintang government and was sentenced to six
years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The poet joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The painter-turned poet, who was twice married, is survived by
five sons and three daughters, and his wife Gao Ying.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Quicker Reform of State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's top leader Jiang Zemin has
called for the reform of state-owned enterprises to be speeded
up. The country's President also wants to see the development of
the state sector enhanced.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection trip to Shanghai, one of the nation's
economic powerhouses, Jiang, General Secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party's Central Committee, said that the reform of
state-owned firms has reached a period of crucial importance.
</P>
<P>
"The reform and growth of state-owned enterprises is not only a
key economic issue concerning the growth of national economy, but
also a key political issue concerning the future of the socialist
system," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He visited a number of state-owned firms and held discussions
with local entrepreneurs and officials during his visit to the
country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong provinces were
also summoned to Shanghai to report on the situation of
state-owned firms in their areas.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a key-note speech at the end of the trip, Jiang said
that the reform of state enterprises have been developing well as
a result of efforts in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The pilot reforms of establishing a modern enterprise system
have been conducted comprehensively, with initial progress already
registered. A number of resolutions have had to be found to crack
some hard nuts in the reform process, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
While it was doubtless that state-owned enterprises have played
a positive role in the national economy, it is also obvious that
some problems exist in their development, he said, adding that
those problems will only be tackled by quickening the pace of
reform.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he added, it is necessary that state-owned
enterprises accelerate the application of new scientific and
technological achievements, and develop adequately to increase
their market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To enliven state-owned enterprises, it is essential that the
state sector should be taken into account as a whole, Jiang said,
underlining the need to restructure the state sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while promoting the reform of state-owned
enterprises, it is necessary to "stay free from old ideas, and
experiment boldly".
</P>
<P>
At present, some state-owned enterprises are facing difficulty
in their management and hence the living standards of their
workers are affected, Jiang said. He urged local officials to care
for those workers and take effective measures to help them
overcome the problems.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Orphan And Her American Foster Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- She's an American girl and speaks
only English, but she has a Chinese face and a typical Chinese
name for girls.
</P>
<P>
Only six-year-old, Maggie, or Gao Huamei in her Chinese name,
is already able to explain to people confused at her
nationality: "I am an American Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Maggie now lives in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, where her American foster mother, Professor
Nancy E. Riley is carrying out research into the social status of
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I adopted her at a Beijing orphanage when she was
only four months old. And we did not get any information
about her own parents except her family name," Nancy recalled.
</P>
<P>
Besides the English name "Maggie", the American couple decided
to give their Chinese daughter a Chinese first name as well.
</P>
<P>
"We called her Huamei, the Chinese name for a kind of thrush,
because the bird could be seen in both China and the States,"
Nancy explained.
</P>
<P>
On her arrival in America, Maggie quickly became the darling of
the whole family, adding much happiness to the lives of both her
parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
"Because of my research work, she had many opportunities
to revisit and live in her birth place," Nancy said, calling
Maggie her "best companion" and "source of pleasure" in China.
</P>
<P>
"Maggie fell in love with China when she was taken to Shenyang,
capital of Liaoning, at the age of 4," she added. "She was both
surprised and excited to see so many Chinese faces around her."
</P>
<P>
Despite her tight schedule in China, Nancy continues to be the
tutor of her daughter, who has not reached school age yet. Every
day she spends two or three hours teaching Maggie spelling,
maths, and drawing pictures.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she goes to the markets to buy some fresh vegetables,
and she cooks Chinese dishes for Maggie and herself.
</P>
<P>
Relating her current life to her studies, she said that she had
not found many differences between Chinese and American women in
their roles in the household.
</P>
<P>
"We all have to cook, wash clothes, and take care of children."
</P>
<P>
For most of the time during the interview, Maggie sat on the
carpet at her mother's feet, turning the pages of comic books or
playing with pretty Chinese dolls. Sometimes she felt bored and
crawled away, and Nancy had to stop talking and remind her to take
care.
</P>
<P>
The girl said she enjoys her stay in China, but misses her
father in Washington, who calls her every week.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't of critical importance to be the girl's own parents,
but to help her grow up in a loving family," the American mother
said.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, capital of the People's
Republic of China, is exactly 5,582.81 kilometers away from the
North Pole, according to a survey made by Professor E Dongchen of
central China's Wuhan University of Geodesic, Photogrammetry and

To successfully fulfill the survey, Professor E Dongchen
overcame unimaginable difficulties, such as the extreme difficulty
in finding rocks in snow-covered Greenland on which to affix
measuring instruments.
</P>
<P>
The professor, who is one of the founders of polar surveys in
China, has been to the South Pole and nearby regions several
times, conducting several successful polar surveys.

NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides
left here today for a five-day official visit to Greece where he
will have meetings with his Greek counterpart Costis
Stephanopoulos and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure, President Clerides said that
the issue of security is central in the U.S. initiative to be
launched on the Cyprus problem and that "without feeling secure
for the future there is no possibility to reach an agreement by
discussing only constitutional or other matters."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "accession to the European Union (EU) is a way of
achieving security but is not as strong as we would like it
because Europe does not guarantee the borders of its member
states."
</P>
<P>
"This is why we insist on the creation of an international
force under the orders of the U.N. Security Council to be
stationed in Cyprus which will have the right to intervene in a
demilitarized Cyprus if its sovereignty and territorial integrity
are endangered or if one of the two communities is threatened by
the other," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We consider it an essential prerequisite for the security of
the future," he stressed, noting that this proposal is gaining
ground and is supported by many members of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the Greek capital, the topics of the Cyprus
problem, Cyprus' bid to become a full member of the EU and the
Cyprus-Greece joint defense pact are expected to be high on the
agenda.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Writes Peres on Revocation Of Covenant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat has written to Prime Minister Shimon Peres
confirming the annulment of the clauses in the Palestinian
National Charter calling for elimination of the Jewish state,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet session here this morning, Peres showed
ministers the letter as well as copies of recent decision taken at
the recent Palestinian National Council on amending its charter.
</P>
<P>
Peres noted that the documents show that the PNC has amended
those clauses which contradict mutual recognition between Israel
and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
The PNC decision reads that the charter is amended to cancel
all contradictory clauses and a legal committee has been directed
to draw up a new one.
</P>
<P>
In its 21st session on April 24, the PNC voted 504-54, with 14
abstentions, to amend the covenant, a historic move welcomed by
the Israeli government and the international community. But major
Israeli opposition parties dismissed it as a fraud.
</P>
<P>
Peres told his ministers today that he will reconvene the
security cabinet this week to further discuss the issue of
redeployment from Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Iran Helps Nigeria Maintain Shore Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran is taking an increasing share
in maintenance of Nigeria's shore refineries as the West African
nation has lost confidence in western companies.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Punch" newspaper, the two countries have
intensified their discussions for an agreement which the Iranian
government is lobbying to sign with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's industry sources were quoted as saying that the
proposed policy for a change can be attributed to the loss of
confidence in the former contractors' handling of the refineries.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions, diplomatic muscle-flexing and general
isolation of Nigeria by the western world are also said to have
motivated the current move.
</P>
<P>
To cultivate business partnership with the more friendly
Middle East is better than with the West that has been doing
major maintenence work for Nigeria's refineries, indicated the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Iran have seen bilateral relations improved
since Nigerian Petroleum Resources Minister Kabir Chafe visited
Iran towards the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Areas Benefit from Market Economy  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chen Shankui, a farmer in
mountainous Tujia Autonomous County of Shizhu in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, has get rid of poverty by raising 150
long-haired rabbits.
</P>
<P>
His annual income reaches more than 6,000 yuan, and last year
he managed to build a new two-story house with his savings over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Tianyun, secretary of the Communist Party
Committee of Shizhu, farmers in the county are raising more than
2.2 million rabbits, which produce 820 tons of fine-quality rabbit
hair each year.
</P>
<P>
Shizhu raises the biggest number of long-haired rabbits among
all China's counties. The hair is sold to textile mills and a
large amount is exported to Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"The county government takes charge of expanding markets with
the outside to protect the interests of rabbit raisers, and
implements protective purchasing prices to reduce their risks in the
market economy," Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Like Shizhu County, many areas inhabited by ethnic-minority
peoples are engaged in sending resources to the market, such as
tobacco, silkworm cocoons, tea, fruit, medicinal herbs, livestock
products and minerals.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the prosperity of local economies and of
farmers can be achieved at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Up until the turn of the century the state will carry on its
fundamental policy of implementing the market economy all over the
country, including in ethnic areas, said Wang Fulin, head of the
Economics Department under the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"While accepting state support for further development,
officials at ethnic areas must free themselves from merely asking
for relief from the state, which used to be common under the
planned economy," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, they must adapt to the objective principles
of the market economy as soon as possible," he added. "The state
may offer favorable policies and funds, but the market will give
no preferential treatment either to ethnic areas or to any other
areas."
</P>
<P>
He noted that market competition is inherent in the competition
for economic returns as well as for scientific management. While
the economic foundation is weak and money is in short supply in
ethnic areas, investments must be carefully channeled into
projects which can yield quick and high returns.

Adjacent to Shizhu County, a paper mill is being built in the
Miao and Tujia Autonomous County of Pengshui, which is situated in
the Wuling Mountains. In addition to state relief funds, the mill
has received seven million US dollars in loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion by the end of this year, the mill will be
able to employ nearly 800 people and produce 10,200 tons of high
quality paper each year.
</P>
<P>
Every year the mill will consume 30,000 tons of bluish dogbane,
which grows locally and will bring about considerable benefits to
20,000 rural households, according to Xu Xibo, chief engineer of
the mill.
</P>
<P>
"The project will not only be able to help meet the strained
demand in the paper market, but raise farmers' incomes and help
them get rid of poverty as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shizhu and Pengshui are two out of the five counties under
Qianjiang Prefecture in Sichuan Province. With a population of
2.74 million, the prefecture achieved an agricultural and
industrial output value of 7.2 billion yuan in 1995, up from 2.5
billion in 1990. The annual increase rate ran as high as 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Miao-Tujia Autonomous County of Qianjiang
has succeeded in integrating specialized companies and rural
households in the course of market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Through group operations, we are able to streamline the supply
of funds, resources and manpower, raise efficiency, cultivate
famous brands and further expand the domestic market," said Yang
Tingshou, secretary of the county's Communist Party committee.
</P>
<P>
So far, the county has organized company groups involving
tobacco, silk, tea, fruit, tapestry, foodstuffs and building
materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
While developing their advantageous resources, local
governments have begun putting priority on enterprise efficiency
as they face the market economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many places have tried out reforms which have
proved to be successful in China's coastal areas to reinvigorate
their old enterprises, such as share-holding, raising funds by
issuing bonds, property rights transfer, leasing, and annexation.
</P>
<P>
"For ethnic areas, the way to prosperity along with the market
economy is a historic change, and is the only way leading to a
modern society," Wang Fulin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that local governments must take effective measures to
reform the old economic mechanism and readjust inappropriate
industrial pattern, so as to reduce losses, increase fiscal
revenues and strengthen local economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the coastal areas achieved economic miracles just
because they took the lead in marching into the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Officials in ethnic areas must sense the severe challenge of
the market," he said. "Those who can realize this early will obtain
benefits first; otherwise, the possibility of failure will surely
increase."

CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The man responsible for the Port
Arthur massacre was moved from the Royal Hobart Hospital to a
local prison in Tasmania today after the hospital received
numerous threatening calls.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said Martin Bryant was moved to the Risdon
Prison early this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Bryant has been charged with one count of murdering for the
worse shooting massacre in Australia's modern history. The
28-year-old man slaughtered 35 people around the most popular
tourist site in Port Arthur in Tasmania, the island state of
Australia, last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police identified another of the 35 victims today. The victim
was Russell James Pollard, 72, from Australia.
</P>
<P>
There are still three victims remaining unidentified.
</P>
<P>
Bryant was treated for burns to his back and buttocks in the
hospital, where many of his shooting victims are also being
treated for injury. The hospital had received so many phone calls
threatening to kill the gunman that police had to deploy
technology to trail down the callers.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that hospital staff can now begin the task of
concentrating on their normal duties and caring for the injured
without the distractions of threatening calls that had been made
to the hospital," the police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The historical site where the massacre took place reopened to
tourists yesterday. The number of tourists to the place reached
700 today, more than the normal average of 500 per day. Management
at the Port Arthur Historic Site expected the figure to become
even bigger tomorrow.
</P>

State Councilor and Director of the Environmental Protection
Committee of the State Council Song Jian and the former Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita attended the ceremony, as well as
more than 400 Sino-Japanese guests.
</P>
<P>
"It is foresighted for the Sino-Japanese leaders to decide to
build the environmental protection center to mark the tenth
anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship
between the People's Republic of China and the Japan in the
mid-1980s, which shows both sides' deep sense of responsibility
for solving the environmental problem in China and in Asia as
well," said Song Jian in a speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As a large country, China will play an important role both in
the global and the regional environmental protection. Protecting
the Chinese environment better will not only benefit the Chinese
people but also make contributions to the world, and the
establishment of the center will surely give a strong impetus to
the environmental protection drive," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Noboru Takeshita expressed his appreciations for the efforts
made by the Chinese government in environmental protection, saying
that Japan will further strengthen co-operation with China in this
field, hoping the center will become an important base for such
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The center, established with donations from Japan and Chinese
supporting funds, is another example of successful co-operation
between Chinese and Japanese governments, following the
establishment of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital and the
Sino-Japanese Youth Exchange Center.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the center began in October 1992.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Lower Base Money Ceilings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has finally
agreed to lower its 1996 base money ceiling as demanded by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank would be allowed a higher Base Money
(BM) ceiling for this year as opposed to the level proposed by the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, central bank sources said the IMF had wanted the BM
growth to be lowered to 18 percent from the original allowed
growth rate of 25 percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
Philippine monetary authorities, on the other hand, are arguing
for a 22 percent BM growth rate, but would be willing to settle
for 20 percent depending on its ability to show that it has been
able to tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
The final figure on BM will be firmed up within the month with
the arrival of an IMF team in the latter half of May.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate slowed down to 11.3 percent in
April from 11.8 percent in February and March.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in four months that the country's
inflation rate has dropped.

<HEADLINE> Aznar Approved as Spain's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Parliament Saturday
endorsed conservative leader Jose Maria Aznar as Spain's new prime
minister, as appointed by King Juan Carlos, ending 13 years of
Socialist rule.
</P>
<P>
The parliament approved the appointment of 43-year-old Aznar,
leader of the Popular Party (PP), with an absolute majority of 181
votes in the 350-seat lower house of parliament. And 166 deputies,
including the Socialists and the Communists, voted against Aznar,
while one abstained and two boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
Apart from PP deputies, supporters of Aznar included deputies
from the regional Catalan and Basque nationalist parties and the
Canaries coalition.
</P>
<P>
The PP finally obtained these parties' support, which was
critical for Aznar's success in the parliament, following two
months of negotiation since the PP won the elections in March but
fell short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
Aznar is scheduled to take office on Sunday and announce a new
cabinet. He is Spain's fourth prime minister since the end of the
rule of General Francisco Franco in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his victory, Aznar promised that he
would rely on all kinds of cooperation and joint effort for
governing the country in his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the parliament on Friday, Aznar said he would
govern on the principles of honesty, austerity and close ties with
the public.
</P>
<P>
He also said his government's tasks included fighting
unemployment, streamlining administrative structures, reducing
public spending, exercising austerity and encouraging investment
and privatization.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Aznar said Spain would focus on Europe. He
added that Spain would live up to its promises of maintaining
peace and unity among people across the world.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Justice Minister Concludes Visit to Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Qatari Justice Minister Najeeb
Mohammed al-Naeemi has concluded his four-day visit to Palestine
today, during which he declared that there could be no real final
settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis without
Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naeemi made the statement Saturday evening at a press
conference held in Bir Zeit University in Ramallah, JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari justice minister, who arrived here Thursday,
concluded today his four-day visit to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the minister signed a 1.6 million
U.S. dollars deal for financing an international law center and a
new library for the West Bank University.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, al-Naeemi visited Orient House, PLO's office in
East Jerusalem, after praying at Al-Aksa Mosque, the third
largest in the Moslem world.
</P>
<P>
"My visit is both official and personal," Naeemi said upon
entering Orient House, "I have come to support the Palestinian
Authority's position of establishing a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital."
</P>
<P>
Al-Naeemi, also met Friday with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
However, the Qatari minister's visit to Orient House caused a
row between the Israeli opposition party Likud and the government.
</P>
<P>
Likud Mayor of Jerusalem Yossi Olmert charged that the visit
showed Jerusalem is in the stage of being divided. But Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres dismissed the charge saying it
demonstrated that Jerusalem as Israel's capital is being
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naeemi confirmed that he had met with some Israelis during
his visit, but said he had no official connections with the
Israeli government while here.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has official ties with Israel. Peres visited the Gulf
state last month.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government has been harsher toward senior
EU officials restricting their visits to Orient House.

undertaken in the Gulf enters its second day today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees on Manila's New Foreign Borrowing Ceilings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has accepted in full the Philippine government's proposal on new
foreign borrowing approval ceilings for 1996, according to the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's external borrowing level is one of the
performance criteria monitored by the IMF under the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) program it has with the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
and officials from IMF management in Washington last month, it was
agreed that total foreign borrowing approvals would be limited to
7.5 billion US dollars with a 600 million dollars sub-ceiling for
borrowing with maturities of five years or less.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing ceiling was primarily revised to achieve a more
comprehensive coverage including borrowings with maturities in
excess of 12 years which were previously not covered.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the new ceilings take into account borrowings
already in the pipeline as well as projected borrowings of the
government and the private sector necessary to achieve desired
investment levels.

infrastructural development and appropriate resources.

Frequent blockages to municipal sewer systems, refuse strewn
in the central business streets and unsightly heaps of refuse
dumped in all residential areas bore testimony to the
unacceptable strain being put on municipal services, the report
said.

"To improve the quality of the environment and living conditions
of Harare's residents, an aggressive policy must be formulated to
sustain sound environmental health," the report pointed out.

MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Gross International Reserves
(GIR) of the Philippines rose to a new record high of 9.25 Billion
US dollars as May 3, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, the 9.25 billion US dollars GIR
level already exceeded the end-1995 level of 7.7 billion US
dollars. The amount is equivalent to more than two months worth of
imports.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the higher GIR level was due to
strong equity inflows and the central bank's continued dollar
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year up to May 3, the central
bank's net dollar purchases reached 2.24 billion US dollars,
surpassing the 1.93 billion US dollars net purchases for the whole

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Seen to Increase By About 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A research report released by the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences shows that China's growth rate
of gross domestic product (GDP) this year might reach about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy seemed to start slowing down at the
beginning of this year. But economists said that the real result
at the end of this year might go beyond people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Last year's good harvest has turned into a propellant for the
country's economy, which might grow by two percent more than the
planned eight percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A possible factor in China's higher growth rate is that most of
China's neighboring countries have maintained relatively high
growth rates in their national economies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China also needs to develop its economy at a higher rate to
solve the worsening unemployment in rural areas, and to further
the reforms in the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's goal of keeping an eight-percent annual
increase in national economy in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000) has become the lowest limit for local governments when
setting their own economic development plan accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that there is a great potential to be
tapped in developing the national economy, after years of
high-rate development.
</P>
<P>
The country saw an annual GDP increase rate of 12 percent
during the 1991-1995 period, and invested 6,000 billion yuan in
fixed assets. The investment has had a long-term effect on the
country's economy, easing the country's bottleneck problems.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for a possible relaxing of the tight control
over bank loans is that deposits in banks and rural co-operatives
last year surpassed the total loans released a second time after
1994.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises also need more funds for further
reform.
</P>
<P>
The country's budgeted debt income this year is 195.2 billion
yuan, up 27 percent from last year. With factors of price-hiking
deducted, the rate is still much higher than the development rate
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that there are still some factors that
might hinder the country's high-rate economic development.

"We do not need to enter the talks from the back door," the
foreign minister stressed in an interview with English daily
Tehran Times with strong background of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts considered Iran's recent mediation in Lebanon as
a kind of back-door entry to the Middle East peace talks. However,
Iran was kept away from the group which monitor the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Iran's latest diplomatic achievements in
Lebanon, he said, the cease-fire which it helped to conclude
between the warring sides stopped the continued killing of
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
He credited bilateral, regional and international efforts taken
by countries such as Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and the EU,
especially France, as being instrumental in bringing about the
cease-fire, adding that though the Americans obviously appeared to
be active in the search for a solution, they were not really
interested in bringing peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian participation in the supervisory committee
to monitor the cease-fire was opposed by the Americans and the
United States initially tried to block France's entry but later
agreed.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement leading to a cease-fire created a new
atmosphere for closer cooperation between Iran, Syria, Lebanon,
Russia, and the EU," he said, expressing hopes that the
cooperation would continue in future problem areas.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Boost Aluminium Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries are planning to produce more aluminium in a bid to
diversify their oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Doha-based Gulf Organization for Industrial
Consultation (GOIC), all the six member states of the GCC, which

<HEADLINE> Opportunities, Challenges Co-exist for Sino-African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China and African countries, which
enjoy a traditional friendship and solid foundations for two-way
economic and trade co-operation, have witnessed a rapid
development in such co-operations in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
At present, the economic and trade co-operation between China
and African countries is facing both opportunities and challenges,
a Chinese trade official said.
</P>
<P>
The impact on Africa imposed by the drastic changes in the
international situation following the Cold War has gradually been
eased, and there are no great turbulences now.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries are enjoying more and more stable
political situations and many African nations have made their
economic development as top priority.
</P>
<P>
Last year the African economy witnessed the fastest development
for many years, and the average economic growth rate reached three
percent.
</P>
<P>
With economies growing, African countries have gradually adjusted
their financial policies, adopted free trade and improved their
investment environments.
</P>
<P>
So, the current political and economic situations in Africa
have created unprecedented opportunities for China and African
countries to further expand their economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strong economic complementarity between China
and African countries also displays vast potential for further
expansion of co-operation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that Africa, long known as the "world's
storehouse of raw materials", is rich in underground resources,
such as gold, diamonds, iron ore, copper, manganese, chromium and
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Africa is also famous for its timber, cocoa, coffee, cotton and
fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile China is comparatively short of iron, copper, chromium
and petroleum, and lacks forest and fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
China's light industrial and textile products as well as
commodities for daily use can meet the demands of the African
people. China-made agricultural machinery and tools, and chemical
products are also suitable for industrial and agricultural
production in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China-made household electrical appliances and medium
and small-sized machinery and equipment have entered the African
market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the Sino-African trade volume only accounts
for two percent of Africa's trade worldwide, and the great
potential for bilateral economic and trade co-operation needs to
be further explored.
</P>
<P>
However, African economic growth in recent years has been
overshadowed by pauperization, and the ratio of its actual
economic strength in the world economy as a whole has kept
dropping.
</P>
<P>
The economic difficulties in African countries are bound to
hinder development of economic and trade co-operation between
China and African countries.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation pointed out that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to developing economic and trade relations with African
countries, and holds a positive attitude toward the development
of such relations, wishing to further two-way comprehensive
co-operation in various forms.

<HEADLINE> New Scoring Planned for Olympic Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The scoring system of Olympic
boxing will be modified for the 1996 Olympic Games, the president
of the International Amateur Boxing Association said in Atlanta on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although the boxing federation has decided to continue using
the widely-criticised electronic scoring system, the tabulation
will not be revealed until the end of each bout, Anwar Chowdhry,
the federation president said.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been trying to do is eliminate the political
decisions," Chowdhry said. "Some of the judges used to be afraid
to score a bout against boxers from the larger countries."
</P>
<P>
His comments came during the Atlanta Boxing Classic, a test
event at the newly-renovated Alexander Memorial Coliseum, site of
this summer's Olympic boxing.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhry was displeased with the scoring of the Atlanta test
event, where the electronic tabulations were revealed at the end
of each round.
</P>
<P>
"This is wrong," Chowdhry said. "The judges see that the bout
is going for one boy, and they just keep scoring for that boxer.
Look at this score, 13-0. That's ridiculous. Are you going to tell
me the other boy just stood there and got hit without ever doing
anything? Impossible."
</P>
<P>
Chowdhry said none of the judges at this weekend's event will
score Olympic fights and that all the judges for the Olympic
tournament have already received at least three training sessions.
</P>
<P>
"The scoring system has been under criticism and the
federation is alive to this criticism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the electronic scoring system, a boxer is awarded a
point if three of the five ringside judges press a button
indicating the boxer landed a punch with the scoring portion of
his glove on the opponent's head or torso. Part of the criticism
of the current system is that it makes no allowance for superior
boxing style or tactics.
</P>
<P>
"We have considered a system in which the judges would award
two or three points for defence and style at the end of a bout,
but that will not occur during these Olympics," Chowdhry said.
</P>
<P>
Questions of scoring aside, Chowdhry said federation officials
are pleased with the boxing facility. "Everything, the arena, the
training facilities, are very good," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am particularly happy that Atlanta kept their promise to
us. This was the venue we were promised and this is what we
have," said Chowdhry, who also is vice president of the National
Olympic Committee of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't always been the case. Barcelona promised to build
a new venue, but they didn't and we ended up in a place that was
too shabby for an Olympic Games."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Women Earn Much Less Than Men: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi women's earnings from
non-domestic production are much lower than men's with a gap of
about 58 percent in both rural and urban areas, a labor force
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Center on Integrated Rural
Development for Asia and the Pacific, said Bangladeshi women earn
only 42 percent of what men earn in both rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Although women are reported to spend 21 hours per week working
compared to 53 hours by men, women still spend substantially more
hours working per day than men at all ages, if household
maintenance work like cooking, cleaning and child care is added,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the low earnings of women to their
concentration in low skilled activities with low productivity.
</P>
<P>
The increasing incidence of female-headed households as a newly
emerged distressed category and low demand for unskilled female
labor both within and outside agriculture call for measures to
lessen distress among these households, the survey said, adding
that stress needs to be put on skill-training in order to enhance
income-earning opportunities for women.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Bolivar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar continued to advance
against the bolivar, the Venezuelan currency, two weeks after the
lift of exchange controls, and closed the week at 469 bolivars in
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking exchange market officials said the rise was caused
by a drop in the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank of Venezuela attributed that to the
recent increase of 136 million dollars in the country's
international reserves to 9.838 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This news was considered a boon because it shows a recovery of
the country's reserves despite the lift of exchange controls,
which meant a possible outflow of foreign currencies that would
reduce its reserves.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the industry disclosed that the central bank has
abstained from intervening during the two weeks of ending the
exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
They added that rising pressures, plus the drop in the interest
rates and the possible outflow of capital, could force financial
authorities to intervene in the exchange market next week.

<HEADLINE> New Reservoir Comes Into Use in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The newly-built Shwenattaung
reservoir in Myanmar's Mon state, which can irrigate 162 hectares
of farm land, has been put into use.
</P>
<P>
The new reservoir brings to 65 the number of new dams and
reservoirs built since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony for the new reservoir in
Mawlamyine on Saturday, Second Secretary of the State Law and
Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Lieutenant Gen Tin Oo said the
irrigable area expanded to account for 21 percent of the total
land under cultivation in 1995-96 from 12.7 percent in 1992-93,
according to today's official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the irrigable area will enable farmers to
extend cultivation from traditional single crop to double and
triple crops per year and their standards of living will become
higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, the annual growth
rate of agriculture in the last four fiscal years (from 1992-93 to
1995-96), which ended on March 31, stood at 8.8 percent and it is
targeted for 5.4 percent in the next five fiscal years from
1996-97 to 2000-2001 which began on April 1.

<HEADLINE> Tidal Wave Hits Indonesia's Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of houses in the districts of
Banda Sakti and Lhokseumawe, 1,800 kilometers east of Jakarta,
were hit Friday by a tidal wave, according to reports reaching
here today from Banda Aceh, capital of the eastmost province of
Aceh.
</P>
<P>
At least six villages were still besieged by floods caused by
the tidal wave but no casualties were reported, Banda Sakti
District Chief Rahmatsyah said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave occurred at 11:15 am (0415 GMT) on Friday and
floods submerged houses in the villages in pools as deep as 35
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
"This year's disaster is not as bad as that in 1989 when
numerous houses were destroyed and residents had to be moved to
safer places," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial social affairs office, many coastal
areas in west Aceh are also prone to the floods, but no life or
property loss was reported.

<HEADLINE> China to Remain Active on World Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Exchange Control
said some domestic financial institutions are applying for the
overseas bond issue.
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, only the Ministry of Finance
issued 400 million US dollars in Yankee bonds in the United States
in January and the State Development Bank issued bonds in the Tokyo
market.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that this year's bond issue will not be
as big as that in 1993 and 1994 when China issue bonds 11 times
each year. More than 20 billion US dollars in bonds were issued in
the international market in 1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
Domestic institutions only issued overseas bonds five times
last year. The official said the decline was a natural response to
the country's economic control measures which eased the speed and
scope of investment and led to shrinking foreign exchange demand.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the supply of foreign exchange in China has been
rich enough to meet part of the hard currency demands.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Bank of China, State foreign exchange
reserves amounted to 80.83 billion US dollars by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the international rate is rising
compared with two years ago, which was another reason for the
declining issue of overseas bonds.
</P>
<P>
But he said Chinese financial institutions will continue to
issue bonds in the international market, which will help them
maintain their international reputation -- if Chinese institutions
are absent from the market too long, they will have to do a lot of
work when they return, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Chinas has issued bonds in major international
markets including Frankfurt, London, Tokyo, New York, Singapore
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed the moderate foreign bond issue will also
lighten the foreign debt burden of the country. China's
outstanding foreign debts hit 106.5 billion US dollars by the end
of last year, which forced the State to beef up efforts to control
the rise of foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> United States Wins Bronze at World Ice Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States needed overtime to
beat Russia, winnig a bronze medal at the world ice hockey
championships on Saturday, their first medal at the event for 34
years.
</P>
<P>
Tied at 3-3 after regulation time, the U.S. looked to be in
trouble when Chris Tancill received a slashing penalty at 4:36 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
But Brian Rolston scored his second goal of the game just 12
seconds into the penalty, taking a pass from Joe Sacco and
finding the net with a hard wrist shot from the top of the slot.
</P>
<P>
Russia sped into a two-goal lead with five minutes into the
game, with Alexei Yashin and Dmitri Kvartalnov giving their side
the advantage with almost identical tip-in plays from close range.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., who won their last medal, also a bronze, at the 1962
world championships, were slow to regroup and looked disorganised
as Russia continued their offensive barrage, outshooting the
Americans 10-1 in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Americans who took control of the play in the
second period, even though Russia managed to increase their lead
to 3-0 in the 10th minute when Sergei Berezin flew past
defenceman Chris Luongo and slipped the puck under Parris Duffus
while the U.S. was short-handed.
</P>
<P>
Just as they had done 24 hours earlier in the semifinal loss
to Canada after leading 2-0, the Russians were guilty of allowing
the opposition a chance to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes from the end of the period, Rolston banged home
a rebound to get the U.S. on the scoreboard and less than 30
seconds later Tancill closed the gap to 3-2, sneaking the puck
between San Jose Shark netminder Mikhail Shtalenkov's pads during
a goalmouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
Derek Plante then pulled the U.S. level in the fourth minute
of the final period, sneaking another shot between Shtalenkov's
legs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. were not expected to be in medal contention after
several of their best players, such as Mike Modano, Pat
Lafontaine and Phil Housley, declined offers to play for the team.
</P>
<P>
Russia lost 3-2 against Canada on Friday after a penalty
shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
Canada face the Czech Republic in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
After having gone 33 years without winning the title, Canada
will be looking for their second gold medal in four years.
</P>
<P>
It will be the Czech Republic's first appearance in the final
since the division of the former Czechoslovakia, who won the last
of their six world titles in 1985 when they beat Canada.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Build More Sugar Mills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans to
build 15 sugar mills in the near future as part of its efforts to
reduce the country's dependence on imported sugar, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted National Logistics Agency (BULOG) Chief
Beddu Amang as saying on Saturday that national sugar production,
which stands at about 2.5 million tons a year, was not sufficient
to meet domestic demand so that the country has to import some
three million tons every year.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan to build more sugar mills was part of its
efforts to regain its position as a major sugar producer, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Amang also called on the business community to help raise its
sugar production by investing in the sugar refinery industry.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Countries Spend Less on Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries have
considerably cut their budget spending in military after decades
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
Chilean newspapers reported today that Chile, which ranked the
49th in the world's arms-purchasing countries, spent only 3.5
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on military in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean media report came in response to the latest report
of the London International Institute of Strategic Studies, which
said Chile had spent larger proportion of the GDP in the military
sector than any other Latin American countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has the smallest military budget among Latin American
countries, which occupied only 0.7 percent of its GDP, said local
press.
</P>
<P>
Brazil ranked the 124th in the world in terms of military
expenditure, which accounted for 1.6 percent of its GDP, but the
country has the most powerful armed forces in the region, with
330,000 men in active service in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's military spending made up 1.7 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, with the fifth largest defense spending in Latin
America, saw its military spending declining from 15 percent of
its GDP to 10 percent over the last decade, while the size of the
its armed forces fell from 33,500 men in 1985 to 25,600 today.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay has cut its military budget to 7 percent from 24
percent of the GDP ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Central American countries have also drastically cut back their
military expenditures over the last decade because of the end of
armed conflicts during the Cold War, among other reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan defense spending has dropped from 50 percent of
its government budget in 1989 to 7.1 percent, representing only 2
percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador, another country battered by bloody civil wars,
reduced its military spending from 21.5 percent in 1989 to 6
percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cut Means Breathing Room For Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises, the
country's largest loan recipients, are the biggest beneficiaries
of the central bank's cut interest rates last Wednesday, "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China announced on Tuesday an average cut
of 0.75 percentage points on loans from May 1. The interest rate
on one-year working capital loans, the most important loan
category for Stated firms, fell from 12.06 percent to 10.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate on fixed-assets investment loans will range from 11.52
percent for one-year loans to 15.12 percent for loans longer than
five years.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also reduced the adjustment margin for
financial institutions in their working capital loans.
</P>
<P>
In the past, commercial banks and other non-banking financial
institutions could increase their rates on such loans to a maximum
of 20 percent while urban credit co-operatives could raise them to
a maximum of 30 percent and rural co-operatives to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustment of the rate, the ceiling growth margin
dropped to ten percent. The interest rate for enterprises' overdue
loans also dropped.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the measures mean both remarkable relief for
State firms, many of which are operating in the red, and a better
environment for their operation, which are striving to build up
modern corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
Reviving State-owned firms is one of the major targets of the
country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut was the first since 1993. Although
enterprises have been crying for the interest rate cut for a long
time, the central bank did not take action as inflation kept
rising.
</P>
<P>
The most important factor in the central bank's decision this
time was the country's improved economic situation.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996, retail price inflation fell to an
annual 7.7 percent from 14.8 percent in all of 1995. Analysts said
the recent cut indicates that the State has a high degree of
confidence that inflation is under control.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have said they are fairly confident of
achieving their target of ten percent inflation for 1996.
</P>
<P>
But observers should be careful not to mistake the rate cut for
a relaxation in the central government's tight credit policy.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the central bank, the People's Bank of China,
threw cold water on that idea.
</P>
<P>
The latest cut reflects the central bank's use of interest
rates to adjust the structure of M1 and M2, directing more money
into demand deposits and away from fixed-term deposits. The cut in
the interest rate for fixed deposits is much higher than that for
current deposits.
</P>
<P>
M1 refers to cash owned by residents and enterprises and the
current deposits of enterprises. M2 refers to M1 plus individual
savings and enterprises' fixed-term savings.
</P>
<P>
At present, the increase of M1 is much lower than of M2,
because of the decline of enterprises' current savings and the
increase in the fixed deposits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the interest rate cut will pave the way for the
issue of treasury bonds which carry a higher interest
rate.

<HEADLINE> Powell Upset in Rio de Janeiro Athletic Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Ferreira of Brazil
gave the local people a big reason to cheer as he upset the world
record holder Mike Powell for the men's long jump title Saturday
at the Rio de Janeiro Athletic Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The local hero leaped a personal best 8.32 meters to beat the
American favorite by 18 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Powell said that the hot weather here and the excessive warm-up
caused his failure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in other events the Americans dominated.
</P>
<P>
Gwen Torrence won the women's 100 and Michael Johnson the men's
200 as Americans won seven events, finished second in seven and
third in five.
</P>
<P>
Torrence, last year's IAAF athlete of the year, won in 11.13,
0.06 off her meet record set two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Johnson blew past countryman Jeff Williams to win the 200 in
20.27 seconds and said he never felt challenged.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Donovan Bailey, the world 100 champion, ran away from
the pack in the final 50 meters and won in 10.07 seconds. But he
wasn't satisfied about his time.
</P>
<P>
Danny Harris of the United States won the 400 hurdles in 48.08,
bettering his own meet record of 48.13 set in 1990. Zambia's
Samuel Matete was second, and world champion Derrick Adkins of the
United States third.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Javier Sotomayor of Cuba suffered a big
scare in the high jump as he tied with Steinar Hoen of Norway tied
in the high jump. Both cleared 2.28 meters, but the Cuban won on
the basis of fewer misses.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, well below his record of 2.45 meters, said he was
bothered by his left knee and with the unusual circular jump area,
which limited his approach to five steps instead of his usual
seven.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Sergei Bubka won the pole vault with a jump
of 5.75 meters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of the IAAF Grand Prix season, drew 179
athletes from 31 countries.

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sixth-seeded Moroccan Karim Alami
upset top-seed and defending champion Michael Chang 6-4, 6-4 on
Saturday to reach the final of the ATP's Atlanta claycourt
tournament in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Alami, 22, needed one and a half hours to record his best
victory since a win over Pete Sampras in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday he will meet either second-seeded American Richey
Reneberg or Sweden's Niklas Kulti.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who struggled all week, was clearly in trouble on his
serve and he later admitted that a strained right shoulder had
hampered him.
</P>
<P>
But he took nothing away from Alami.
</P>
<P>
Alami broke Chang in the opening game of the match, then held
for 2-0. Chang fought back with a break in the fourth to level
the set at 2-2. They traded breaks again in the seventh and
eighth games before Alami earned the decisive break of the set to
go up 5-4 then served out for the set.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Alami continued to attack at the net, and he had
more success with his serve as well for the win.

<HEADLINE> Hendry to Meet Ebdon in World Snooker Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Title-holder Stephen Hendry swept
through the semifinals of the World Snooker Championships in
Sheffield on Saturday and will face Peter Ebdon in the final,
aiming to equal the record of six snooker world championship
titles.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Scot scored a comfortable 16-7 win over 12th
seed Nigel Bond to reach the two-day best-of-35-frames final
which begins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hendry was never extended, unlike Ebdon who secured his 16-14
semifinal win over 20-year-old Ronnie O'Sullivan after a marathon
of nearly 8-1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
Ebdon, who defeated former champion Steve Davis in the
quarter-finals, denied O'Sullivan the chance to become snooker's
youngest ever world champion.
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan left the tournament with the threat of a two-year
ban hanging over him for an assault on snooker official Mike
Ganley last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There was little such drama for Hendry, the world number one,
as he compiled his 24th consecutive world championship match win
at Sheffield where he was last beaten in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Thai, Myanmar leaders to meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa and Myanmar leader Senior Gen. Than Shwe are expected
to meet soon in a renewed bid to end the deadlock over
construction of the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Charas Puachuay was quoted by
today's Bangkok Post as saying that the Thai Foreign Ministry
would arrange such a meeting between the two leaders within a
month.
</P>
<P>
Charas inspected the bridge across the border river Moei in Mae
Sot District, Tak Province Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said if Banharn and Than Shwe were able to reach an
understanding, working officials from both sides would be able to
resolve the disputes. This, in turn, would lead to resumption of
construction on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 72-million baht (2.9 million US dollars)
bridge was suspended by Yangon in June last year. The bridge will
link Thailand's Mae Sot and Myanmar's Myawaddy and is expected to
boost trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had hoped the deadlock would end during Banharn's
visit to Yangon last month. The two leaders agreed to send teams
to inspect the area, but no progress has been made since.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Ambassador to Thailand Tin Winn has said construction
would not resume unless the root causes of the problem were
removed -- the water channel in the Moei River which demarcates
Thailand and Myanmar is restored to its original state before
dredging by the Thai side, and the man-made reclaimed area on the
Thai side is removed.

force.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Provincial departments in China
responsible for compiling local annals are establishing service
centers to provide comprehensive information to enterprises at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
So far, except for Taiwan Province and the Tibet Autonomous
Region, all provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
set up province-level departments to preside over the work of
chronicle compilation.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that China started its modern compilation
work in the early 1980s, and a total of 6,000 volumes of local
chronicles, containing five billion Chinese characters, are
expected to be published by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
To date, about one third of the work has been completed,
with the support of the central government, and the compilation
has involved 110,000 scholars nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years local governments have carried out
various surveys to collect data concerning history, economy,
culture, agriculture and the environment, containing over 10
billion characters, and also saved a batch of rare and valuable
historical books.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's Local Annals Working Group said that
the provincial departments now have the ability to "provide
overseas enterprises with reliable information and help them to
get to know more about China's history and reality."
