	   DENVER (AP) _ This was the old John Elway, not old John Elway,
at quarterback for Denver.
	   Playing more like a 28-year-old than a 38-year-old, Elway threw
for 257 yards and a touchdown as the Broncos beat New England 27-21
Monday night to begin defense of their NFL title and what is more
than likely to be Elway's final season.
	   Terrell Davis added two rushing touchdowns as Denver beat New
England for the 11th straight time dating to 1980.
	   ``John played a heck of a game,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan
said. ``About the only mistake he made, he underthrew a ball and it
still went for a 50-yard completion.''
	   But the Patriots, who had lost their previous three games to
Denver by a combined 105-24, gave the Broncos plenty of help.
	   They committed three critical penalties on special teams, two of
which cost them 48 yards and were offside on another punt that let
the Broncos continue a touchdown drive. Adam Vinatieri missed a
39-yard field-goal attempt and had another blocked by Trevor Pryce.
	   New England also was disorganized on the sidelines, using all
two of their first half timeouts early and all three in the second
half with 6:16 gone in the third quarter. That cost them dearly
when they had to catch up at the end.
	   Still, even with all those mistakes, this wasn't easy for
Denver, which had a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter on a
12-yard pass from Elway to Shannon Sharpe, a 9-yard run by Davis,
and Jason Elam's 53-yard field goal.
	   New England cut it to 17-7 at halftime when Drew Bledsoe's
55-yard pass to Shawn Jefferson set up Robert Edwards' 1-yard TD
run. Then, on the first series of the second half, the Patriots
drove 73 yards in seven plays for a score _ Bledsoe's 24-yard pass
to Troy Brown that made it 20-14
	   But Elam countered with a 42-yard field goal and the Broncos
clinched it on Davis' 1-yard score, which came one after a vintage
Elway play _ a scrambling third-down pass to Ed McCaffrey at the 1
as he was pursued by three Patriots. That drive was aided by
another New England mistake, a late hit on Elway by Willie
McGinest.
	   New England added a TD with 1:59 left on Bledsoe's 10-yard pass
to Vincent Brisby, but McCaffrey recovered the onside kick and with
no timeouts left, they had no option.
	   Elway was 13-of-18 for 158 yards in the first half as the
Patriots brought up eight men to the line of scrimmage to shut down
Davis, who finished with 75 yards on 22 carries.
	   ``We anticipated that. That's why we threw the ball a little
more,'' Shanahan said.
	   Elway, who was 22-of-34 for the game, hit McCaffrey for 44 yards
on the first play of the game to set up Elam's first field goal, a
play of which Shanahan was just a little bit critical.
	   ``It should have been a touchdown,'' the coach said.
	   Later in the period, Elway found Justin Armour for 23 yards,
then scrambled 13 yards to set up his 12-yard TD pass to Sharpe,
which he threaded among three defenders.
	   The TD that made it 17-0 came three lays after McGinest was
offside on a punt by the Broncos to give Denver a first down at the
New England 38. Three completions by Elway and then Davis went
around left end and squeezed into the end zone.

Griffey hits 49th, 50th homers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. hit two home runs Monday night,
becoming the record third player to reach 50 homers this season.
	   The Seattle star, the AL leader, reached 50 with a grand slam
off Jimmy Key in the sixth inning of the Mariners' game against
Baltimore. He hit his 49th in the fifth, a 449-foot shot off Pete
Smith.
	   Griffey's grand slam, a line drive to left, gave the Mariners an
11-1 lead. He ran toward first base and pumped his right fist
overhead when the ball cleared the wall.
	   Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris' 1961 record of 61 homers earlier
Monday in St. Louis' victory over Chicago. The Cubs' Sammy Sosa has
58 homers.
	   Griffey is the third player in major league history to hit 50
home runs or more in consecutive seasons. Babe Ruth did it in
1920-21 and 1927-28, and McGwire has hit 50 or more the last three
years.
	   Griffey's 50-homer season is the sixth in the American League
this decade. Before Cecil Fielder hit 51 in 1990 for Detroit, no AL
player had topped 50 since Maris and Mickey Mantle (54) in 1961.
	   Griffey led the AL last year with 56 homers, and had 49 in 1996.
He has 344 home runs in his 10-year career.
	   He has 10 career grand slams.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. homered twice against Baltimore
on Monday night, giving baseball three 50-homer players in a season
for the first time.
	   The Seattle outfielder hit a 449-foot shot off Pete Smith in the
fifth inning for his 49th homer, then hit his 10th career grand
slam in the sixth off Jimmy Key, a line drive to left. He ran
toward first base and pumped his right fist overhead when the ball
cleared the wall.
	   Griffey, who had 56 homers last year after hitting 49 in 1996,
joined Mark McGwire and Babe Ruth as the only players to hit 50 or
more in consecutive seasons. Ruth did it in 1920-21 and 1927-28,
and McGwire has hit 50 or more the last three years.
	   Hours earlier, McGwire hit his 61st homer to tie the major
league record Roger Maris set in 1961. Griffey leads the AL and is
third in the majors, trailing McGwire and the Chicago Cubs' Sammy
Sosa, who has 58.
	   Griffey's 50-homer season is the sixth in the American League
this decade. Before Cecil Fielder hit 51 in 1990 for Detroit, no AL
player had topped 50 since Maris and Mickey Mantle (54) in 1961.
	   Griffey has 344 home runs in his 10-year career. It was his 35th
multihomer game, his sixth this season.
	   Before 1996, there had been just two seasons in which a pair of
players hit 50: Maris and Mantle in 1961, and Hank Greenberg (58)
and Jimmie Foxx (50) in 1938.
	   McGwire (52) and Brady Anderson (50) achieved the feat in 1996,
and McGwire and Griffey did it last year.

IRA dissidents declare `complete' cease-fire

Monday; UPPICKS graf 10 pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by journalists and
unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire, committed the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th victim died of
his wounds and was buried Monday.
	   On Aug. 19, the group declared a ``suspension'' of what it
called its ``military operations,'' in a step short of Tuesday's
formal cease-fire.
	   In Tuesday's statement issued to state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves by the IRA's traditional Gaelic
sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann, or ``Soldiers of Ireland,''
said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks ... the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern gave a qualified welcome to
the statement.
	   ``On the basis that this statement is now put fully into effect
and is final, it would represent both an important and a positive
development,'' Ahern said. ``It will not, unfortunately, bring the
dead of Omagh back to life, heal the injured or comfort their
families.''
	   Ireland's President Mary McAleese said Tuesday she was heartened
by the announcement.
	   ``I simply hope that those who were slain in Omagh will be the
last to be added to the grim roll call of victims of violence,''
McAleese told an ecumenical service at the National Irish Memorial
in Sydney, Australia. She is on an 11-day diplomatic visit to
Australia which ends Wednesday.
	   The British government's Northern Ireland Office issued its own
statement emphasizing that ``the Real IRA needs not just to talk
but to convince the Irish people that their violence is at an end
for good.''
	   The Real IRA's announcement came hours after Northern Ireland's
major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist party, ended
its ban on direct communication with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, another symbolic step down the road to reconciliation.
	   At a two-hour meeting Monday at Stormont Parlimentary Building
in Belfast, the venue for a new cross-community government outlined
in April's peace accord, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
discussed the establishment of a multi-party administration with
seven other party leaders, including Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams.
	   Trimble had sat through eight months of negotiations opposite
Adams without saying a direct word to him, citing the IRA's refusal
to start disarming as proof it had really renounced violence. The
April agreement commits Sinn Fein to secure the IRA's disarmament
by mid-2000.
	   A majority of Protestant and Catholic politicians in Belfast's
new legislative Assembly in July elected Trimble to lead the new
administration.
	   The Real IRA's statement brought the group into line with the
mainstream IRA and several other paramilitary groups: the IRA's
main anti-British rival, the Irish National Liberation Army, which
called its own truce Aug. 22, and Northern Ireland's two major
outlawed pro-British gangs _ the Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force _ which called a joint cease-fire in 1994.

Seven sentenced to death for kidnapping women, children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in southeastern Fujian province have
sentenced seven people to death for their involvement in a
kidnapping ring that abducted 110 women and two children, the
state-run newspaper Legal Daily reported Tuesday.
	   The Fujian provincial High Court ordered the seven to be
executed shortly after the sentencing Monday, the report said.
	   The seven were convicted of having tricked the women and
children into joining them with promises of jobs. Their victims
were taken to other parts of Fujian and then sold as wives. Those
who resisted were beaten and, in some cases, raped, the report
said.
	   Another 43 people were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18
months to life in connection with the kidnappings, it said. Most of
those involved in the case were former convicts, farmers and
unemployed workers, the report added.

 &UR; Sam Rainsy goes free; anti-Hun Sen motorcades throng Phnom Penh
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout and UPDATES with Sam Rainsy walking free
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Shielded by U.N. officials and
cheered by a mob of thousands of motorcycle riders, opposition
leader Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from a hotel where he had
sought refuge overnight from arrest by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Motorcycle taxis, a core of opposition support, roared through
the streets, snarling traffic and beeping horns to the rhythm of
their leader's name: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen rescinded an order earlier Tuesday to have Sam Rainsy
arrested for what the Cambodian leader called ``terrorism,''
blaming his most vocal rival for a grenade attack Monday against
his house. No one was hurt.
	   Sam Rainsy looked weary and nervous from a night spent on the
couch of the U.N. offices in the basement of the luxury Cambodiana
hotel. Soldiers trying to disperse a supportive crowd outside
Monday night had fired thousands of rounds into the air. One man
was killed and several people hurt.
	   Security was eased Tuesday. Thousands of motorcycle drivers and
Buddhist monks waited outside the hotel as word of Sam Rainsy's
release spread.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have been challenging Hun Sen over his
declared victory in parliamentary elections July 26, alleging
massive fraud. Hun Sen-controlled panels have rejected their
complaints.
	   The government's decision to rescind the arrest order eased
tensions raging since Monday's grenade attack, which the opposition
called a pretext by Hun Sen to end the protest against his rule.
	   Besides Sam Rainsy's arrest, Hun Sen ordered thousands of
demonstrators camped in a park outside the National Assembly to
clear out by midnight Monday or face expulsion. The deadline was
withdrawn at the last minute following the shooting outside the
hotel.
	   The demonstrators have supported Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy in
contesting the elections, held by Hun Sen to regain international
legitimacy lost when he deposed the prince as co-prime minister in
a bloody coup last year.
	   Tuesday, the demonstrators and the motorcycle taxi drivers
celebrated one of the rare cases in 13 years at the top of
Cambodian politics where Hun Sen has backed down from a
confrontation.
	   ``There will be no more arrest warrants, is the order I got from
him,'' said Prum Sokha, a senior Interior Ministry official.
	   Earlier Tuesday before the order was withdrawn, Sam Rainsy had
tried to leave the Cambodiana hotel and was nearly arrested by a
waiting horde of policeman, said his spokesman, Rich Garrella.
Mehrotra, the U.N. envoy, quickly pulled him back inside.
	   The protesters outside the National Assembly, camped on the site
of a grenade attack in 1997 against a rally Sam Rainsy was leading,
killing 16 people, celebrated their victory as the protest entered
its 16th day.
	   Buddhist monks chanted and motorcycle taxi drivers circled the
tent city in the park, which the protesters dubbed Democracy
Square.
	   ``They set a deadline for midnight and nothing happened,'' said
demonstrator Dara Choeun, 28, a student. ``We're going to stay
until these problems are solved. We're sick of this brutal
government.''
	   The shooting marked the worst violence in the capital since Hun
Sen deposed Ranariddh last year. If the violence grows worse, he
could lose the legitimacy he has worked to regain.
	   Hun Sen won a slight majority of the 122 National Assembly
seats. But Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have threatened to withhold the
vital two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new
government.
	   The first meeting looms Sept. 24. If an agreement cannot be
reached by then, Cambodia could be left without a legal government.
	   Hun Sen eased tactics Tuesday. Security was remarkably light as
protests resumed at Democracy Square, the hotel and the ministries
of information and religion.
	   Hundreds of monks, upset by the beating Monday of one of their
brethren, took part.

Teachers fear Spice Babies could be next teenage craze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After giving Girl Power to a generation of
schoolgirls, the Spice Girls could inspire a new wave of teenage
pregnancies as fans try to emulate their idols, teachers' leaders
fear.
	   Wooed by the recent publicity surrounding the pregnancies of
Posh Spice Victoria Adams and Scary Spice Mel Brown, girls who feel
they are academic failures could see a copycat pregnancy as
glamorous or as a way of raising their self-esteem, Judith Mullen,
new president of the Secondary Heads Association, said Monday
night.
	   The expectant pop stars could trigger ``a generation of Spice
babies born to teenage mothers,'' she told several newspapers.
	   But Mrs. Mullen blamed politicians for the problem, saying the
emphasis of judging schools in government performance tables by the
percentage of students who achieve high grades in at least five
subjects at examination leaves some pupils with a sense of failure.
	   ``There are a lot of young women whose self-esteem has been
knocked because they don't feel they have achieved the magic five
A-C grades,'' she said. ``For some, pregnancy might be a way of
feeling success.''
	   Mrs. Mullen told The Express newspaper that there was evidence
in schools of young girls turning to motherhood to feel successful,
important and less of a failure.
	   She stressed she was not criticizing the Spice Girls, noting
that they are in their 20s and ``in loving, caring relationships.''

Swissair plane's flight recorder found but missing crucial data

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers have retrieved Swissair
Flight 111's flight-data recorder despite an emergency which
endangered their lives, but experts say the ``black box'' contains
no information from the final minutes of the doomed flight.
	   Crash investigators had high hopes after the data recorder was
recovered from the ocean floor Sunday. But laboratory examinations
on Monday revealed that there was no data from at least the last
six minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off
Nova Scotia last week, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the data recorder
stopped once the plane dipped below 10,000 feet (3048 meters). A
strong possibility, he said, was that the plane lost electrical
power at that stage.
	   However, Gerden said the data recorder was in good condition and
should provide useful evidence about more than 100 types of
information ranging from altitude and airspeed to whether the
plane's smoke warning lights were on.
	   The data recorder, found at a depth of 190 feet (57 meters),
nearly didn't make it to the surface. Navy Capt. Phil Webster said
one of the two divers developed a leak in his suit, and the pair
had to make an ascent _ clutching the black box _ much more rapidly
than is considered safe.
	   One of the divers became ill from the rapid change in pressure.
Both were put in a decompression chamber, then taken to a hospital.
Both were recovering at home, Webster said.
	   At the crash site, five miles (eight kilometers) offshore,
divers equipped with hand-held sonar searched Monday for the
plane's other black box _ the cockpit-voice recorder. The signals
from the device have been detected, but bad weather forced
suspension of the diving until Wednesday at the earliest.
	   If retrieved intact, the voice recorder would reveal other
noises in the cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with
controllers, portions of which were released Saturday. That
conversation was cut off 10 minutes after the pilots reported smoke
in the cockpit and six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to confirm if three large pieces of
wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections of the
plane's fuselage.
	   Several hundred family members have come to the area to visit
Peggy's Cove, attend memorial services and assist medical teams in
trying to identify badly fragmented human remains retrieved by
searchers.
	   More than 1,400 military personnel are involved in the search,
and more than 200 stress counselors have been assigned to support
them during their often grisly work.
	   ``Some of the stuff they're being exposed to is truly
horrible,'' said Mary Anne Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
	   At the Shearwater military air base near Halifax, relatives have
been invited to look at personal effects found by the search team.
	   Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California, said she went
there hoping to find her stepmother's ring, and instead found the
wallet of her father, former New York Times executive John
Mortimer.
	   ``It was a very wrenching experience,'' she said.
	   In a scare Monday night reminiscent of last week's crash, a
Swiss Balair airbus charter plane headed for Vancouver returned to
Halifax shortly after takeoff after reporting smoke in its galley.

Japanese schoolgirl admits poisoning 15-year-old boy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo police said Tuesday a junior high school girl
has admitted poisoning a 15-year-old boy in one of a string of
anonymous poisonings that have spooked Japan over the past few
months.
	   The girl, whose name and age were not disclosed because she is a
minor, admitted filling vials marked ``diet medicine'' with a
poisonous disinfectant and sending them to students and a teacher
in her school, a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department said.
	   The 15-year-old boy has been hospitalized since Aug. 26 after
drinking the liquid, news reports said.
	   Under Japanese juvenile law, the girl will be allowed to stay
home until police file formal charges, which they will do soon,
said the spokesman.
	   Handwritten letters accompanying the vials described them as
samples of a new weight-loss drug.
	   The girl told investigators that she sent the vials ``as a
prank'' after she saw other poisonings on the news, Japan's
national broadcaster NHK said.
	   The case was the latest in a series of recent, high-profile
poisonings. In the first and most deadly incident, four people died
and another 60 fell ill in July at a festival in rural Wakayama
prefecture after eating curry laced with arsenic.
	   Since then, news reports have been filled with apparent copycat
poisonings.
	   On Aug. 31, the 58-year-old man collapsed and later died at a
hospital in central Japan after drinking canned tea from a nearly
supermarket. Police found a hole had been punched in the can, which
had traces of cyanide inside.

Security forces protect Indonesia's Parliament after student clash

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces blocked roads and
erected razor wire barricades around the Parliament Tuesday after
they used batons, shields and tear gas to push hundreds of student
protesters from its grounds.
	   A senior Cabinet minister called on students to remain calm,
saying violent anti-government demonstrations and calls for the
president to quit would not fix Indonesia's crippling economic
crisis.
	   The protest, which began Monday, was the biggest of its kind
since a marathon student sit-in at the Parliament helped force
President Habibie's autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto,
to step down after 1,200 people were killed in a wave of riots four
months ago.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that two students were
hospitalized with bayonet wounds to their abdomens and others were
treated for tear gas inhalation after the pre-dawn clash.
	   Maria Helena, a spokeswoman for nearby Atma Jaya Hospital, said
two students underwent emergency surgery. However, she refused to
give details of their injuries. Three others were treated at the
hospital and later released, she said.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured by rocks and
bottles thrown by demonstrators who had earlier pushed down the
gates of the legislature.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, the students gathered outside
the green-domed building Monday to demand that Habibie quit because
of his handling of Indonesia's economic crisis and failure to lower
soaring food prices.
	   They also urged that Suharto be put on trial for alleged
misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during his 32 years
at the helm of the nation of 202 million people.
	   Officers corralled the protesters into a parking lot on the
grounds. Many protesters later left peacefully.
	   However, about 300 refused repeated requests to disperse. A
standoff dragged on until about 1.30 a.m. Tuesday when security
personnel forcibly evicted the protesters.
	   Police said they made no arrests and later re-erected the gates.
	   The Parliament precinct was quiet by late morning Tuesday as
legislators arrived to discuss the effects of Indonesia's financial
woes, including food shortages and price hikes.
	   Hundreds of security personnel were stationed inside the grounds
of the Parliament, and they placed piles of riot gear outside its
perimeter as precaution.
	   They also unraveled coils of razor wire inside its main
entrance. However, there was no sign of trouble.
	   Lines of police and troops cut off several major roads leading
to the legislature amid reports that hundreds of students were
planning to march there from nearby campuses.
	   Rush hour traffic was choked by the heavy security presence.
	   Meanwhile at Jakarta's state palace, Habibie opened a regional
human rights conference Tuesday by restating a pledge to improve
Indonesia's bad human rights record.
	   However, he warned that the country's severe economic problems
must be fixed if human rights were to be protected. Growing poverty
could lead to further social unrest, he said.
	   The president made no comment about the student protest.
	   Justice Minister Muladi urged the students ``to use their wisdom
and prevent the situation from getting worse.''
	   He defended the reform record of the Habibie government and said
it had done its best to improve Indonesia's situation during its
first 100 days in office.
	   ``We have to be realistic,'' Muladi said. ``I doubt there is
anyone who would want to replace Habibie and could do what he has
done in this very short time.''
	   He said that the government was seriously addressing the
student's main gripe about food shortages and high prices. He said
anyone found guilty of interfering with food distribution could be
sentenced to death under a 1959 law.

Asian markets open higher, but worries loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ For the second day in a row, Asia's three top
stock markets opened sharply higher Tuesday, but traders in
Singapore and Hong Kong said the rebound may be short-lived.
	   Investors were encouraged by the strengthening Japanese yen,
market controls in Malaysia and Hong Kong and a host of other
positive local news, market players said. But they expected
profit-taking to set in later, trimming the early gains.
	   Jerome Fung, research analyst at Lippo Securities in Hong Kong,
said investors in the region have not yet digested the long-term,
negative impact of recently-announced market control measures
imposed in Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong in recent weeks.
	   And worries over the financial health of Russia and the United
States continued to loom large, Fung said.
	   Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   ``Most foreign funds are sidelined,'' Fung said. ``The outlook
is still negative.''
	   In Tokyo, the U.S. dollar continued to slip against the yen in
late morning trading, as overseas investors sought to make up for
losses on their Russian investments, dealers said.
	   The dollar bought 131.68 yen, down 0.31 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also below its late London level of 131.79 yen overnight.
The New York markets were closed Monday for Labor Day.
	   The stronger yen and buying from hedge funds also buoyed
Japanese shares.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 2.32
percent to close the morning session at 15,132.72.
	   It had surged 5.32 percent on Monday, bolstered by prospects
that Japanese lawmakers were close to an agreement on a banking
system bailout.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds and other overseas players sold dollars for
profit-taking and to procure the yen to invest in Japanese
stocks,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at
the Tokyo office of ABN AMRO Bank.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices continued to surge on the strong yen,
rallies in regional bourses, lower domestic interest rates and
announcement of additional market control measures by the
government announced Monday.
	   The new measures are aimed at curbing speculative activities,
which have been blamed for driving interest rates up and share
prices down and putting pressure on the currency link to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Measures announced at the weekend to strengthen the currency
board system has sent interest rates dramatically lower.
	   The key Hang Seng Index closed 2.2 percent higher at 8,254.77
points at midday, after Monday's 7.9 percent gain.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Time Index was up 1.2 percent at
872.47 points, after Monday's 7.1 percent rally.
	   But dealers said it was only a technical rebound following its
recent battering and expect profit-taking later to cut the
morning's gains.
	   Taiwan's main index closed 2.1 percent higher on rallies in the
region.
	   But the Malaysian bourse bucked the regional upward trend as
profit-taking in early trading trimmed Monday's strong gains.
	   The Composite index was down 7 percent by midmorning, after
rising 22.5 percent Monday on government-related buying.

Sam Rainsy goes free; anti-Hun Sen motorcades throng Phnom Penh

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Shielded by U.N. officials and
cheered by a mob of thousands of motorcycle riders, opposition
leader Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from a hotel where he had
sought refuge overnight from arrest by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Motorcycle taxis, a core of opposition support, roared through
the streets, snarling traffic and beeping horns to the rhythm of
their leader's name: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen rescinded an order earlier Tuesday to have Sam Rainsy
arrested for what the Cambodian leader called ``terrorism,''
blaming his most vocal rival for a grenade attack Monday against
his house. Hun Sen was not there and no one was hurt.
	   Sam Rainsy looked weary and nervous from a night spent on the
couch of the U.N. offices in the basement of the luxury Cambodiana
hotel. Soldiers trying to disperse a supportive crowd outside
Monday night had fired thousands of rounds into the air. One man
was killed and several people injured.
	   A local human-rights group, LICADHO, said a Buddhist monk had
also died. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   Security was eased Tuesday. Thousands of motorcycle drivers and
monks waited outside the hotel as word of Sam Rainsy's release
spread.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a meeting.
	   Afterwards, they returned to the U.N. offices, where Sam Rainsy
met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada,
Australia, Japan and Singapore. The contents of the talks were not
immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically close-mouthed with the
media, responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had
been frightened and was now relieved.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have been challenging Hun Sen over his
declared victory in parliamentary elections July 26, alleging
massive fraud. Hun Sen-controlled panels have rejected their
complaints.
	   The government's decision to rescind the arrest order eased
tensions raging since Monday's grenade attack, which the opposition
called a pretext by Hun Sen to end the protest against his rule.
	   Besides Sam Rainsy's arrest, Hun Sen ordered thousands of
demonstrators camped in a park outside the National Assembly to
clear out by midnight Monday or face expulsion. The deadline was
withdrawn at the last minute following the shooting outside the
hotel.
	   The demonstrators have supported Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy in
contesting the elections, held by Hun Sen to regain international
legitimacy lost when he deposed the prince as co-prime minister in
a bloody coup last year.
	   Tuesday, the demonstrators and the motorcycle taxi drivers
celebrated one of the rare cases in 13 years at the top of
Cambodian politics where Hun Sen has backed down from a
confrontation.
	   ``There will be no more arrest warrants, is the order I got from
him,'' said Prum Sokha, a senior Interior Ministry official.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Sam Rainsy had tried to leave the Cambodiana
hotel and was nearly arrested by waiting policeman, said his
spokesman, Rich Garrella. Mehrotra, the U.N. envoy, quickly pulled
him back inside.
	   The protesters outside the National Assembly, camped on the site
of a grenade attack in 1997 against a rally Sam Rainsy was leading,
killing 16 people, celebrated their victory as the protest entered
its 16th day.
	   ``They set a deadline for midnight and nothing happened,'' said
demonstrator Dara Choeun, 28, a student. ``We're going to stay
until these problems are solved. We're sick of this brutal
government.''
	   The shooting marked the worst violence in the capital since Hun
Sen ousted Ranariddh. If the violence grows worse, he could lose
legitimacy he has worked to regain.
	   Hun Sen won a slight majority of the 122 National Assembly
seats. But Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have threatened to withhold the
vital two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new
government.
	   The first meeting looms Sept. 24. If an agreement cannot be
reached by then, Cambodia could be left without a legal government.

Fired deputy PM calls off political road show

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX WRITETHRU DESIGNATOR &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister, who is spearheading an unprecedented reform movement,
canceled on Tuesday a nationwide tour to launch his campaign.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, ousted from his posts of deputy and finance
minister last week, told the AP that he postponed the driving tour
for security reasons.
	   ``My supporters, they called from other states,'' Anwar said.
``They said, `Why don't you hold on for a few days?' and they are
also concerned about my personal safety.''
	   His wife, Azizah Ismail, said they were worried Anwar would be
arrested along the way, ``saying he was trying to sabotage the
Commonwealth Games.''
	   The political showdown between Anwar and his one-time mentor,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, comes just as Malaysia begins
hosting Friday the first Commonwealth Games held in Asia.
	   Anwar said he still intended to go on a national tour to drum up
support for political reforms in the Malaysian government. But he
doubts he'll be given a police permit.
	   Any public gathering in Malaysia requires a permit.
	   Police spokesman Ghazali Amin said Tuesday he didn't know
whether Anwar had applied for one.
	   ``But if he holds a public gathering without a permit, we'll
take action according to the law,'' Ghazali said. ``The law says we
have the power to stop the gathering.''
	   The huge rallies at Anwar's home have been allowed, he said,
because they've been held at a private residence.
	   Anwar, 51, was stripped of his official positions of deputy and
finance minister last Wednesday on allegations ranging from sexual
misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   He has denied the charges, saying they've been floated by the
government to undermine his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Increasing numbers of people have been attending his nightly
gatherings. On Monday night, some 2,000 people packed the yard
outside his home in the posh Damansara neighborhood.
	   Some were reluctant to label themselves Anwar supporters. They
said they were coming to get at the truth.
	   ``It's very simple, we want to know the truth. We don't know why
he was sacked. The newspapers don't print it. The leaders don't
tell us,'' said Ahmad Rozi Hussein, 40, a businessman. ``Day by
day, people are losing faith in the current leadership.''
	   Mahathir has never publicly stated why he fired Anwar, only to
say that he was ``unsuitable'' for the job. The tightly controlled
local media have given little of Anwar's side of the story.
	   Mahathir was slated later Tuesday to explain to division chiefs
of the ruling United Malays National Organization why he dumped
Anwar from his posts and expelled him from UMNO.
	   The sex allegations first surfaced in a book, ``50 Reasons Why
Anwar Cannot Be PM.'' The police say they are taking the book
seriously and investigating its lurid allegations.
	   Police have filed affidavits in court regarding the
investigation. They say they intend to complete their
investigations into charges of sexual misconduct, abuse of power
and leaking state secrets, before possibly arresting Anwar.
	   Vendors outside Anwar's house have erected stands where they
sell bootlegged cassettes and videotapes of Anwar's nightly
speeches, in which he asserts his innocence.
	   They sell for 5 ringgit (dlrs 1.30). One vendor estimates he has
sold 3,000 cassettes in the last three days.

Indonesian leader warns of more social unrest if no economic

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president on Tuesday
linked human rights and financial reform and warned that civil
unrest would continue to flare if the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation can't fix its crisis-ridden economy.
	   President B.J. Habibie made his comments hours after police used
batons, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds of student
protesters from the grounds of the national Parliament in Jakarta.
	   The students had called for Habibie's resignation and demanded
that food prices be lowered.
	   There have also been outbreaks of rioting and looting in several
provincial towns recently as Indonesia's 202 million people endure
skyrocketing inflation and mass unemployment while the worst
economic crisis in 30 years grinds on.
	   In a speech to open an Asia-Pacific regional human rights
conference, Habibie said his government had done much to improve
Indonesia's poor human rights record since he replaced former
autocratic leader President Suharto in May.
	   ``Our hard struggle to overcome the economic crisis should be
viewed as a part of our commitment to human rights,'' he said.
``Economic poverty is one of the most important factors giving rise
to abuses of human rights.
	   ``If economic problems can not be solved in a short time their
influence will be felt in other areas.
	   ``Social unrest will prevail. Instances of crime will rise. The
feeling of being safe and tranquil will, as a consequence, be
further away from society.
	   ``In such a situation the chance of human rights abuses taking
place will surely be bigger,'' he said.
	   During his brief tenure so far, Habibie said he had freed many
political prisoners who had been jailed by Suharto's regime.
	   He had opened the door to freedom of expression and had lifted a
ban on the formation of new political parties.
	   Habibie has also set out a timetable for political reform,
including the holding of parliamentary elections next May, followed
by the selection of a president by a legislative assembly before
the end of 1999.
	   Habibie, who had been Suharto's vice president, has indicated
that he will stand for the presidency.

Cholera kills at least 10 in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Doctors have rushed to a popular
eastern Sri Lankan tourist spot where at least 10 people have died
of cholera and another 125 developed the illness at the beginning
of the travel season, an official said Tuesday.
	   Polonnaruwa, an ancient city and the seat of a former ruler, is
a major attraction for foreign tourists. Ten deaths were reported
last week in the town 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of
Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
	   ``We have sent a team, and we are confident the disease will be
contained. Such outbreaks happen almost every year in many
countries in Asia, with the onset of (monsoon) rains,'' said Dr.
Prasanna Kulatilleke, a health ministry official.
	   The disease spreads through contaminated food and water.
Symptoms include high fever and diarrhea and death often occurs due
to dehydration. The spread of cholera can be checked by providing
proper sanitation, clean drinking water and well-cooked food.

President Kim's coalition government wins parliamentary majority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four opposition legislators joined
President Kim Dae-jung's party Tuesday, giving his coalition
government a long sought majority in South Korea's parliament.
	   Kim said he needed the majority to pass economic and other
reform bills deemed crucial to wooing back foreign investors whose
flight last year fueled the nation's economic crisis.
	   With the new members, the president's National Congress for New
Politics controls 101 seats in the single-chamber, 299-seat
National Assembly. His coalition partner, Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil's United Liberal Democrats, has 52 seats.
	   That gives the two parties a majority of three seats. The
opposition Grand National Party has 140 seats. There also are six
independent members.
	   President Kim has accused the opposition of delaying economic
reforms that South Korea promised to the International Monetary
Fund in return for its record dlrs 58 billion economic bailout
package.
	   Opposition leaders accused the government of using favors and
intimidation to lure away their members.
	   Prosecutors arrested two opposition legislators last week on
corruption charges. Armed with court-issued arrest warrants, they
were seeking two more opposition lawmakers on similar charges.
	   The prosecutors denied the arrests were politically motivated.

Airplane makers busy announcing jet sales at big air show

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airplane makers are busy announcing
new jet orders at the biggest air show of the year, while hoping a
forecast slump in sales won't mean a repeat of the industry's early
1990s disaster.
	   Sales are booming, but analysts say air carriers are buying more
airplanes than they need so a setback is inevitable, probably in
2000.
	   The market is ``peaking and flattening,'' Boeing Co. president
Harry Stonecipher told a news conference at Monday's opening of the
Farnborough International 98 show.
	   But the Boeing boss said airlines have not overextended
themselves as much this time around as they did in the late 1980s,
only to hit serious troubles when the Gulf War and the last
recession cut demand for air travel and virtually halved new
airplane sales.
	   ``People haven't splurged like they have in the past,''
Stonecipher said.
	   But he cautioned that the Asian economic crisis could last two
to five years, and that poses troubling questions about how hard
developed economies _ where the planemakers sell most of their jets
_ will be hit.
	   Stonecipher said Boeing's leadership was to blame for the
company's recent troubles, including Ron Woodard, recently fired as
president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
	   Stonecipher said new management, with Woodard replaced by
executive Alan Mulally, will fix assembly line troubles and other
things that caused numerous delays in airplane deliveries.
	   ``Where we have been too arrogant, too distracted or too
self-satisfied, we are going to be much more intense and much more
focused on things that really matter,'' Stonecipher said.
	   Seattle-based Boeing quickly tried to put a better spin on
things, announcing the first big batch of orders at the Farnborough
show. Rival Airbus Industrie promised to announce its own new
orders later.
	   Boeing said the International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 17
new jets with a list price of around dlrs 900 million, including
nine 737-800s, six 757-200s, one 767-300ER and one 777-200ER. ILFC,
based in Los Angeles, purchases jets that it then leases to air
carriers.
	   Boeing also said KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ordered four new
737-900s for dlrs 200 million.
	   The Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard said his company plans
to launch a small jet, the A318 with about 100 seats.

Namibian star withdraws from Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Namibian sports officials Tuesday
expressed shock at the withdrawal of their star and key athlete,
Frankie Fredericks, from the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``He was our main hope,'' said Daan Nel, Chef de Mission of the
Namibian contingent. He said he would be sending a letter to the
Games' organizing committee to inform them of Fredericks'
withdrawal.
	   ``We are shocked by his decision. The athletes feel the same
way. He is a role model for them and suddenly that has been washed
away,'' Nel was quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Fredericks reportedly was upset about Namibia's prime minister
describing the country's new world boxing champion, Harry Simon, as
Namibia's greatest athlete because Fredericks had never won an
Olympic title.
	   Namibian officials thought Fredericks was affected by the tight
scheduling of events in the lead up to the Commonwealth Games,
which include the World Cup and Nelson Mandela competitions in
South Africa, but had been confident that Fredericks would compete
in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``This is really a personal thing. Fredericks was put in a tight
situation and, in spite of that, we hoped he would have come
here,'' Nel said.
	   ``I think, though, we must be human about this. He is entitled
to his own choices.''
	   Fredericks was to have run the 100-meter sprint and 4x100-meter
relay event here, a rare double for him in international
competition. He normally competes in the 100- and 200-meter dashes,
but with these events scheduled close together at the Games, he had
decided to skip the 200-meter, the event in which he was crowned
world champion in 1993.
	   The Namibian 4x100-meter team will still compete, but with a
considerably weaker combination.
	   ``I don't think they will achieve anything this time,'' said
Nel.
	   With Frederick's withdrawal, spectators will miss seeing one of
the best sprinters. He is ranked third on the all time list for the
100-meter with a personal best of 9.86 seconds.
	   Fredericks is also the second fastest 200-meter runner in
history, behind the world record holder Michael Johnson of the
United States.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts on southern Lebanon Tuesday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the 0830 (0530GMT)
air attack.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said two Israel jets fired an air-to-surface rocket each on targets
in the hills between Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah
province.
	   In Israel, the army said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   The area, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Beirut, is
a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia that attacks
Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protects its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

Two South Korean banks announce merger

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two mid-sized banks announced plans
Tuesday to merge and create one of the largest commercial banks in
South Korea.
	   Hana Bank and Boram Bank, the nation's 11th- and 13th-largest
banks, signed a letter of intent to merge effective Jan. 4. It will
create the nation's 7th largest bank with combined assets of 41.1
billion won (dlrs 29.4 billion).
	   It will be the second commercial bank merger this year. In July,
Hanil Bank and the Commercial Bank of Korea announced plans to
merge, also effective Jan. 4.
	   Experts said the Hana-Boram merger would have a positive effect
on the banking system because both are relatively healthy banks.
That contrasts with the first merger in July, which analysts
described as between weaker banks.
	   ``It is a good sign that two relatively healthy banks are
merging. It will stimulate reforms in other banks,'' said Woo
Jong-taek, an analyst at Daishin Securities Co.
	   Hana Bank president Kim Seung-yu said he is confidant that the
new, bigger bank will be competitive at home and abroad.
	   He said that Hana and Boram will cut their work force and
increase their capital with a 400 billion won (dlrs 285.7 million)
in equity participation by the government.
	   Hana and Boram posted a combined net profit of 96.1 billion won
(dlrs 68.6 million) for the first six months this year. Hanil and
Commercial Bank of Korea recorded a combined net loss of 1.5
trillion won (dlrs 1.1 billion) during the same period.
	   The latest merger is expected to further encourage the
government's ongoing efforts to restructure the nation's
bad-debt-ridden banking industry.
	   Under past military rulers, banks were accused of paying little
attention either to the true financial condition of borrowers or
the long-term profitability of the projects being funded.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, banks were left with a growing mass of bad loans, triggering
a sudden loss of international confidence that led to the financial
crisis.
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout fund
from the International Monetary Fund in December. In return, the
nation is required to reform its bloated industrial and financial
sectors.
	   The government had previously shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks and five small commercial banks. But critics said that was
not enough.
	   To boost voluntary mergers to create more efficient, stronger
banks, the government promised to help by writing off bad loans and
giving tax benefits.

St. Louis goes crazy as McGwire hits 61st
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM SALTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Horns blared, shoppers stopped and cheered, and
St. Louis generally went berserk when Mark McGwire hit his 61st
home run.
	   And it was even more nuts inside Busch Stadium, where McGwire
lined a 1-1 pitch from the Chicago Cubs' Mike Morgan deep into the
left-field seats in the first inning, tying Roger Maris'
37-year-old record for most homers in a season. Even Chicago's
Sammy Sosa, who with 58 homers is chasing both Maris and McGwire,
applauded into his glove in right field.
	   The roar from the 50,530 fans, including Maris' sons, lasted for
several minutes, well into the at-bat of teammate Ray Lankford. But
it masked emotions that ran even deeper in this baseball-crazy
town.
	   Many were moved to tears after watching McGwire circle the
bases, slap hands with Cubs first baseman Mark Grace and third
baseman Gary Gaetti, a former Cardinals teammate, before greeting
his 10-year-old son Matthew at home plate with a bear hug.
	   ``To be here, I will remember and cherish my entire life,'' said
Rick Faccin, 44, of Alton, Illinois. ``The reception he received
and what he did as he rounded the bases gave me chills all over.''
	   ``When I saw the ball hit off the glass and I knew he tied the
record, I had a few tears in my eyes,'' said Don Fisher, 51, of
Marion, Illinois. ``It made me feel like I was part of history
since I saw it live.''
	   During a curtain call, McGwire thumped his chest and pointed
skyward as he looked to the Maris family, sitting behind
photographers along the first-base line, and other family and
friends.
	   ``He acknowledged us. He tapped his heart, like dad was in his
heart,'' Kevin Maris said.
	   McGwire said he also looked for his parents and mouthed the
words, ``Happy Birthday'' to his father, ironically celebrating his
61st birthday.
	   Downtown, horns blared in the minutes after McGwire's homer. TV
stations interrupted programming to announce the news. Street
corner vendors were hawking a special 61st homer edition of the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch before the end of the game.
	   The celebrations didn't end even though McGwire failed to hit
No. 62. In the eighth inning, the Blue Angels' precision flying
team roared over Busch Stadium, sending the crowd into another
round of cheering.
	   It was a day St. Louis won't soon forget.
	   The Cardinals have won 15 pennants and nine World Series, but
the city hadn't seen hysteria like this since the ticker-tape
parade after Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis across
the Atlantic in the 1920s.
	   Red 60s were plastered everywhere _ billboards, store signs,
even a few bare chests. By early afternoon, 61s were already going
up.
	   In health clubs, grocery stores, restaurants, even taxi cabs and
hospitals, all conversation centered around McGwire and Sosa.
	   ``We'll be doing a heart transplant, and it (McGwire) will come
up,'' said JoAnne Donnelly, a surgical nurse at St. Louis
Children's Hospital.
	   At the Schnucks grocery store in suburban Clayton, customers
stopped and cheered when an employee announced over the loud
speaker that McGwire hit No. 61.
	   Patrons at Mike Duffy's Pub and Grill stopped munching on
burgers and sipping 62-cent beers, a special in honor of McGwire's
pursuit, when McGwire came up to bat. They cheered wildly as they
watched the homer on bar TVs.
	   ``This is a summer that I will remember forever,'' customer Dave
Schwartz said.
	   Typically, thousands of Cubs fans make the trek for games in St.
Louis, and Tuesday was no exception. There were nearly as many blue
``Sosa 21'' jerseys as red ``McGwire 25s.''
	   ``I'm here to see Sammy surpass Mr. McGwire as the home run king
of major league baseball,'' said Dan Sherman, 30, of Quincy,
Illinois., wearing a Sosa jersey and Cubs cap. ``This is the best
thing that I've ever been to.''
	   Most fans at the stadium were just happy to be there.
	   ``To be a part of history is something I will never forget,''
said Bill Wethigton, 49, of Morris, Illinois. ``For Mark to do it
with Sammy and the Cubs in town makes it even more emotional. For
me to be here and witness it is mind-boggling.''

Getting through comeback game a relief for Rice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS GEORGATOS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CLARA, California (AP) _ Coming back from two serious knee
injuries wasn't enough for Jerry Rice. He wanted to finish a game,
and it was a relief when he was able to do just that and make an
impact, too.
	   ``It took a lot of weight off my shoulders, I'm going to be
honest,'' Rice said Monday. ``All week long, I was nervous about
the situation and wondering what the result would be. That's behind
me, and now I can get ready for the next game.''
	   Sidelined for all but parts of two games last season, Rice
returned Sunday to make six catches for 86 yards and a touchdown in
the San Francisco 49ers' 36-30 overtime win over the New York Jets.
	   It was his first complete game since the end of the 1996 season.
	   He tore ligaments in his left knee in last year's season opener
at Tampa Bay and then cracked his left kneecap Dec. 15 against
Denver in his comeback game. They were the first major injuries in
his 14-year career.
	   ``I was concerned about Jerry's knee. We all were,'' 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci said. ``But he had a big smile on his face after the
game. He was good, was productive. He looked like Jerry Rice.
That's so encouraging.''
	   Held out of the preseason to make sure his surgically repaired
knee was fully healed, Rice was concerned going into the game about
how his body would respond to his first heavy contact of the year.
	   But he withstood linebacker Mo Lewis' jolting hit at the end of
his first catch, a 16-yard reception that was part of San
Francisco's initial touchdown drive. Rice gained confidence from
there, and he soon flashed the form that has made him the NFL's
premier receiver.
	   On his 14-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter, Rice made a
running sideline catch, cut back suddenly to lose one Jets defender
and accelerated past two others to go in for the touchdown.
	   ``That looked like the Jerry Rice I'm used to seeing, getting
into the end zone,'' said J.J. Stokes, who had a team-high seven
catches for 111 yards and a TD. ``That's what separates the good
from the great, and he's the greatest.''
	   Steve Young, who has teamed with Rice on 76 touchdown passes,
second-most for a tandem in NFL history, said Rice's memorable
return was the payoff for what amounted to a constant year-long
rehabilitation. And it portends a dynamic and diversified passing
attack for the 49ers, who have young wideouts Terrell Owens and
Stokes to go with the incomparable Rice.
	   ``He looked great,'' Young said. ``He needed this game. He's
been waiting for it so long. He's a monstrous asset.''
	   ``I think he had it in his head, `I want to get through this
game,' '' Young added. ``Getting through the game was the key. The
rest of it was gravy, catching a touchdown, making some plays. He
just wanted to get back on track.''
	   Rice said he's off to a good start in his comeback and he says
he'll soon get better.
	   ``I know the explosion is there. I know the cutting is there,''
Rice said. ``I'm not in game shape yet. I think in a couple of my
assignments, I didn't use the smarts I normally do. But that's just
getting back into the flow of the game. Once you get back into the
flow, it's all reaction. It's automatic.''

	   In less than 15 minutes, the combined force of more than a
hundred riot police and soldiers completely cleared the park of the
demonstrators, who fled down side streets.
	   No arrests were witnessed.
	   Soldiers and riot police stood guard around the park, which was
littered with the remnants of the protest against alleged cheating
in July's national election.
	   The grass was strewn with bamboo mats, clothing, still burning
cooking fires, leftover food and other belongings.
	   Sixty riot police also surrounded a second protest by about 300
supporters of Cambodia's opposition in front of the Interior
Ministry. Fire trucks had also arrived at that site to hose down
the demonstrators.
	   The protesters, who had been demonstrating against alleged
campaign fraud, had been encamped in front of the National Assembly
for more than two weeks and had at times numbered more than 5,000.
	   The police action came as political tensions in Cambodia had
apparently eased slightly, with the government led by Hun Sen
backing off a vow to arrest opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who
organized the demonstrations.

McGwire makes history all for himself
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ As Mark McGwire circled the bases, following a
path taken by only one player before him, Gary Gaetti was
transfixed at third base.
	   Earlier in the season, the two were teammates with the St. Louis
Cardinals, so Gaetti was hardly surprised when the power lurking
within Big Mac's gargantuan biceps showed itself for the 61st time
this season.
	   Still, the enormity of watching McGwire pull even with Roger
Maris' home run record managed to overwhelm even those who've
witnessed this astonishing spectacle from the inner circle of
history.
	   ``It's like the last out in the seventh game of the World
Series. It's almost like it's unreal, even though it's happening
right before your eyes,'' said Gaetti, who was playing third base
for the Chicago Cubs on Monday. ``It's a really strange feeling.''
	   McGwire needed only 144 games to surpass Babe Ruth's 60 homers
in 1927 and equal Maris' mark from 1961. Both of McGwire's
predecessors waited until their final games _ Ruth played when the
schedule was 154 games, Maris under the current 162-game era _ to
hit their landmark homers.
	   With 19 games to go, no one is questioning whether McGwire will
break the record. The only concern is when it's going to happen _
the Cardinals play the Cubs again Tuesday night at Busch Stadium _
and how many he might hit before he's done.
	   Will it be 65? Perhaps 68? Or a nice, round number like 70, as
McGwire himself has joked about?
	   ``Nobody can put an asterisk on it,'' McGwire said, alluding to
the fate that befell Maris when he broke Ruth's revered record in
North American baseball while playing eight additional games.
	   On the same field where Maris played his final game in 1968,
McGwire's sense of timing was impeccable, as usual. He had his son
in the dugout, his father in the stands on his 61st birthday, his
biggest rival applauding the moment from right field.
	   ``I've hit 61, Mark. I don't know why you shouldn't be able to
do it,'' John McGwire told his son when the two had dinner the
night before.
	   It didn't take long. In the first inning, McGwire launched Mike
Morgan's fastball inside the left-field foul pole, the ball
slamming off the third-deck facade some 430 feet away, setting off
a wild scene below when it deflected back into the crowd.
	   ``The look on his face is what I'll remember,'' said Chicago
catcher Scott Servais, who had the closest view of history. ``The
intensity of that first at-bat, then the relief when he hit it
out.''
	   McGwire got a high five from Cubs first baseman Mark Grace as he
rounded the bag, another from Gaetti as he approached third. Out in
right field, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, whose 58 home runs have pushed
McGwire down the stretch like Mickey Mantle did for Maris 37 years
ago, joined the tribute by slapping his right hand against his
glove.
	   Waiting at home plate was McGwire's 10-year-old batboy son,
Matt, who had arrived from California only minutes before Dad made
history. The slugger hoisted the youngster in his massive arms and
gave him a bear hug.
	   ``When he grabbed his son, that was a great moment,'' said
Servais, who has three children himself. ``Anyone who has kids
knows what it's like to go play ball with your kids.''
	   The Cardinals spilled out of the dugout to mob McGwire, and it
took him a few moments to make it to the bench. But he didn't stay
there long, springing back out to salute his father, Sosa and the
Maris family, watching from seats on the first-base side.
	   ``He tapped his heart, like Dad was in his heart,'' said Kevin
Maris, a son of the former New York Yankees slugger.
	   Maris played the final game of his major league career for the
Cardinals in the 1968 World Series, a pitiable figure who never
again approached 61 homers and failed to receive the hero treatment
enjoyed by both Ruth and McGwire during their slugging summers.
	   Maris' accomplishment was forever called into question by
commissioner Ford Frick, who declared in 1961 that any record would
have to carry a ``distinctive mark'' if it did not beat Ruth's mark
of 60 in 154 games.
	   ``I admire everything that Roger went through because I know
what he went through now,'' McGwire said. ``I am very, very happy
to be linked with him.''
	   McGwire added a single and went 2-for-4 as the Cardinals won
3-2, dealing a blow to Chicago's playoff hopes. The Cubs are now
tied with the New York Mets in the wild-card race.
	   Sosa went 1-for-5 with a single and struck out with a runner on
the third to end the game.
	   ``It was just a tough day,'' Sosa said. ``You can't go up there
every day and be the hero.''
	   Don't tell that to Mike Davidson, a 28-year-old fan from St.
Louis who wound up with an historic souvenir ball. He gave it back
to McGwire in exchange for a jersey, an autographed bat and a
handshake.
	   ``It means more to him and baseball than to me and having dlrs 1
million,'' Davidson said.
	   Tuesday night will likely be McGwire's last realistic chance to
break the record at home. The Cardinals leave on a five-game road
trip, and McGwire's longest stretch without a homer is 29 at-bats.
	   ``Like I have said probably 100,000 times, I can only take care
of myself, try to get a ball to hit, and get a good swing on it,''
McGwire said. ``But I'm going to give it my best shot.''

	   Hun Sen issued the threat after grenades were tossed into his
Phnom Penh home on Monday. The Cambodian leader was in the northern
city of Siem Reap at the time, and no one was injured in the blast.
	   He blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack. The opposition leader spent
the night under the protection of the United Nations representative
in Cambodia, as troops surrounded the U.N. offices in a luxury
Phnom Penh hotel.
	   On Tuesday, however, Hun Sen rescinded the arrest order.
Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel.
	   Motorcycle taxis, a core of opposition support, roared through
the streets, snarling traffic and beeping horns to the rhythm of
their leader's name: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Sam Rainsy looked weary and nervous. Soldiers trying to disperse
a supportive crowd outside Monday night had fired thousands of
rounds into the air. One man was killed and several people injured.
	   A local human-rights group, LICADHO, said a Buddhist monk had
also died. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a meeting.
	   Afterwards, they returned to the U.N. offices, where Sam Rainsy
met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada,
Australia, Japan and Singapore. The contents of the talks were not
immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically close-mouthed with the
media, responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had
been frightened and was now relieved.

Yeltsin hesitates in choosing candidate; Russian crisis unabated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW throughout with Yeltsin making no decision on his
candidate for prime minister, comments from lawmakers. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister has
been rejected twice by a hostile parliament, and the president must
now decide whether he wants to renominate Viktor Chernomyrdin for
the all-important third and final vote.
	   Yeltsin has said that Chernomyrdin is his only choice to lead a
new government that will face an economic crisis that is worsening
by the day.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, overwhelmingly
turned down Chernomyrdin for a second time Monday, and Yeltsin has
hesitated before selecting a candidate for the third round.
	   As of Tuesday morning, Yeltsin had still not named his
candidate, which fueled speculation that he might be considering a
different, compromise figure.
	   Yeltsin was spending the day at his country residence, Gorky 9,
outside Moscow. He was meeting with aides and had no public
appearances scheduled.
	   ``Today the countdown has begun for the position of compromise
... with another candidate,'' Konstantin Titov, a member of
parliament's upper house, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The first two votes in parliament demonstrated parliament's
strong opposition to Yeltsin and delayed the formation of a new
government during a time of economic turmoil. But the third vote,
which is likely in about a week's time, will be decisive.
	   If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's candidate, then the constitution
calls on the president to dismiss parliament and call new elections
within three months. Yeltsin would then rule by decree, along with
an interim government, until the new parliament is seated.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin warned the Duma before the lower house of
parliament torpedoed his nomination 273-138. ``We are all standing
on the edge and no time is left for settling scores. We must begin
acting.''
	   Duma members might back down in the third round of voting rather
in order to preserve their own jobs. The dissolution of the
legislature would only add to the country's political and economic
turbulence, and it's not clear how angry Russians would vote in new
elections. Many incumbents would likely lose their seats.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government for two
weeks, since Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back after firing him in
March.
	   Chernomyrdin's efforts to win confirmation by parliament have
left him little time to devote to the worst economic crisis since
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party, the largest in
the Duma, would never accept Chernomyrdin. He complained that
Yeltsin had not listened to opposition calls for an alternate
candidate.
	   ``This is not a victory,'' Zyuganov said after the opposition
defeated Chernomyrdin on Monday. ``The country is in trouble.''
	   The Communists and their allies say they have nine alternate
candidates, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The liberal
Yabloko party on Monday has suggested Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's economy remained in a downward spiral.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about six to the U.S. dollar
last month, was around 20 to the dollar on Tuesday.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation on even higher inflation. Long lines
at gas stations began forming Monday as motorists filled up before
prices go up.
	   Also, Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin, who has been widely
criticized for mishandling the crisis, offered Monday to resign.
However, there was no immediate response from the Kremlin and it
was not clear if Yeltsin would accept his resignation.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras
had Mark McGwire on their minds at the U.S. Open.
	   During Monday's rain delay, all three found themselves watching
baseball.
	   Davenport said she just missed seeing McGwire's 61st homer in
his first at-bat.
	   ``I saw it on the replay. Then I watched his next three at-bats.
Nothing happened,'' Davenport said.
	   ``That was exciting. I was in the referee's office when Sampras
and Agassi were there. They were both like staring at the TVs. It's
a big day.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JUNIORS UNDER WAY: &LR;  The junior tournament, where many tennis
watchers get their first glimpse of future champions, has begun.
	   Julien Jeanpierre of France is top-seeded in the singles for
boys 18 and under. He has already won the Australian Open junior
title.
	   Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, the French Open junior champion, is
seeded second, with Roger Federer of Switzerland seeded fourth
behind Andreas Vinciquerra of Sweden.
	   Katerina Srebotnik of Slovenia is the No. 1 seeded player in the
girls singles. She won the Wimbledon junior crown.
	   Nadejda Petrova of Russia, the French Open girls champion is
seeded sixth but Jelena Kostanic of Croatia, the junior Australian
Open winner, is not entered.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TRIO OF SWEDES: &LR;  With Magnus Larsson, Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas
Johansson in the fourth round, it marked the first time since 1987
that three Swedes made it to the round of 16 at the U.S. Open.
	   There were four in 1987, headed by two future champions, Mats
Wilander and Stefan Edberg, along with Anders Jarryd and Jonas
Svenson.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOUBLES LOSERS: &LR;  For the second year in a row at the U.S. Open,
the top doubles team of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge made an
early exit.
	   The Woodies lost in the third round to Cyril Suk and Sandon
Stolle, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Last year, the Australians went out in the first round, ending a
streak of five consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals. In all,
they have won nine Grand Slam doubles titles together, including
five straight Wimbledons.
	   It will be the first time since 1991 they have not won at least
one Grand Slam doubles titles, losing in the Australian Open and
Wimbledon finals and the round of 16 at the French this year.
	   ``We have high expectations, high standards,'' Woodforde said.
``We have to keep them up, otherwise you start sort of shuffling
down in the pack.''

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts on southern Lebanon Tuesday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the 0830 (0530GMT)
air attack.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said two Israel jets fired an air-to-surface rocket each on targets
in the hills between Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah
province.
	   In Israel, the army said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   Israeli frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel's panhandle, but it wasn't
clear exactly why Tuesday's raid was carried out.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protects its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

Low-key Lindsay in Open quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For someone ranked third in the world and seeded
second in the U.S. Open, Lindsay Davenport is keeping a low
profile.
	   No beads bouncing all over the place. No headbands holding her
hair. Just low-key Lindsay, winning her way into the quarterfinals,
where she'll meet Amanda Coetzer..
	   ``I like being the quiet underdog, knowing I can go about my
business,'' Davenport said after defeating Nathalie Tauziat 6-1,
6-4 on Monday. ``I'm always still in the second week these days.''
	   The underdog image fits because despite her fancy ranking and
seeding, Davenport has never won a Grand Slam event. Her best
performance on tennis' main stage were three straight semifinals _
at last year's Open and the Australian and French this season.
	   She seemed to take a step back when she lost in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon, beaten by Tauziat. That made Monday
night's victory over the French player that much sweeter.
	   ``I guess so,'' Davenport said. ``I wasn't happy when I lost to
her at Wimbledon.''
	   She also wasn't surprised. It was her second loss in 10 matches
against Tauziat, both times on the grass of the All England Club.
Hardcourts like the ones at Flushing Meadows are more suited to
Davenport's game.
	   ``She is definitely more comfortable on the grass than I am,''
Davenport said. `I love playing on the hardcourts. I'm definitely
more comfortable on them. You get a higher bounce when helps me. I
don't have to bend as much as on the grass. I can get her serve
back a little easier on the hardcourt. ''
	   Still, Davenport played cautiously.
	   ``I felt like I'm playing well,'' she said. ``I didn't want to
be in any danger out there.''
	   And there were moments when she might have been. Tauziat, who
went on to the finals after beating Davenport at Wimbledon, was
down 3-1 in the second set and drew even.
	   ``When she starts serving well, you have to really concentrate
to hold your serve,'' Davenport said. ``A couple of times I think I
was down a lot of break points and only got broken once, which is
great.''
	   Davenport arrived at the Open as the hottest player on the tour.
She swept three consecutive hardcourt tournaments in California and
had a 14-match winning streak before losing to Steffi Graf in the
semifinals of the Open warmup at New Haven.
	   ``I'm playing well, concentrating very well,'' Davenport said.
``I'm taking advantage of the opportiniuties that were given to
me.''
	   She is in the best shape of her life and equipped with a new
mindset.
	   ``I'm a much better competitor now than I've ever been,'' she
said. ``Mentally, I'm getting stronger and physically, I'm getting
stronger. You know, I think I want it just as bad as everybody else
does now.''
	   The surface suits her and her game is flourishing. It's a good
combination for low-key Lindsay, playing in the second week again..

 &UR; Riot police breaking up demonstration by Cambodian opposition
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; RECASTS

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Heavily-armed riot police began
breaking up a demonstration Tuesday against election fraud by
hundreds of people camped in front of the National Assembly in
Phnom Penh.
	   A combined force of more than 100 riot police and soldiers
carrying assault weapons surrounded the protesters in a park across
from the assembly that they had renamed Democracy Square.
	   Police charged the demonstrators, whose protest had been
nonviolent, and ran after several people beating them with batons
and bamboo rods.
	   Fire trucks then began hosing down the rest of the demonstrators
to force them to flee.
	   The protesters, who had been demonstrating against alleged fraud
in Cambodia's July 26 national election, had been encamped in front
of the National Assembly for more than two weeks and had at times
numbered more than 5,000.
	   They were demanding that Cambodian leader Hun Sen, whose party
won the polls, resign. Hun Sen had issued an ultimatum to the
protesters Monday evening that if they did not leave, he would use
force to evict them.
	   In less than 15 minutes, the police and soldiers, completely
cleared the park of the demonstrators, who fled down side streets.
	   No arrests were witnessed.
	   Soldiers and riot police stood guard around the park.
	   The police spread out over a four-block area, pushing more
protesters away from the site. Mobs responded by hurling rocks and
other debris at the police.
	   In the park, the grass was strewn with bamboo mats, clothing,
still burning cooking fires, leftover food and other belongings.
	   Sixty riot police also surrounded a second protest by about 300
supporters of Cambodia's opposition in front of the Interior
Ministry. Fire trucks had also arrived at that site to hose down
the demonstrators.
	   The police action came as political tensions in Cambodia had
apparently eased slightly, with the government led by Hun Sen
backing off a vow to arrest opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who
organized the demonstrations.
	   Hun Sen issued the threat after grenades were tossed into his
Phnom Penh home on Monday. The Cambodian leader was in the northern
city of Siem Reap at the time, and no one was injured in the blast.
	   He blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack. The opposition leader spent
the night under the protection of the United Nations representative
in Cambodia, as troops surrounded the U.N. offices in a luxury
Phnom Penh hotel.
	   On Tuesday, however, Hun Sen rescinded the arrest order.
Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel.
	   Motorcycle taxis, a core of opposition support, roared through
the streets, snarling traffic and beeping horns to the rhythm of
their leader's name: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Sam Rainsy looked weary and nervous. Soldiers trying to disperse
a supportive crowd outside Monday night had fired thousands of
rounds into the air. One man was killed and several people injured.
	   A local human-rights group, LICADHO, said a Buddhist monk had
also died. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a meeting.
	   Afterwards, they returned to the U.N. offices, where Sam Rainsy
met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada,
Australia, Japan and Singapore. The contents of the talks were not
immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically close-mouthed with the
media, responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had
been frightened and was now relieved.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, midafternoon dollar, bond,
analyst comment

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rallied against the yen Tuesday on
bargain hunting by Japanese investors following a wave of
dollar-selling earlier in the day. Japanese stock prices rose
moderately.
	   The dollar bought 132.32 yen in midafternoon trading, up 0.33
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late London level
of 131.79 yen overnight. The New York markets were closed Monday
for Labor Day.
	   Early Tuesday, overseas funds tried to make up for losses on
their Russian investments by taking profits on their dollar
positions. But Japanese investors saw bargains in the dollar's
slide and pushed the value of the U.S. currency back up.
	   ``Japanese investors were buying at the 131-132 yen level
because after seeing the dollar at 147.00 just last month, it's
quite a bargain for them,'' said Tatsuya Ishii of the Banque
Nationale de Paris.
	   Trading was thin as investors continued to monitor the political
turmoil in Moscow. Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President
Boris Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving
the country in political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   The Kremlin said late Monday that there was no word on how soon
Yeltsin would offer a new nomination.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose as hedge funds
closed positions in Japan to make up for losses in other markets
such as Russia and the United States. Investors were also covering
short positions ahead of Friday's settlement of September futures,
traders said.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished the
session 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent, higher at 14,913.49. On
Monday, the average closed up 747.15 points, or 5.32 percent,
bolstered by prospects that Japanese lawmakers were close to an
agreement on a banking system bailout.
	   The Nikkei rose about 500 points at one point in morning
trading, but the market largely erased those gains in the afternoon
session as investors snapped up short-term profits.
	   Traders say concerns about Japan's sputtering economy and
uncertainty in world financial markets were likely to make the
Tokyo stock market's rally short-lived.
	   ``Economic fundamentals aren't strong enough to support share
prices, and trading over the past two sessions has been dominated
by technical futures-led activities,'' said Kunihiro Hatae of Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,131.01. The
TOPIX closed up 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.025 percent from 1.040 percent Monday,
driving its price up to 112.89 from 112.83 yen.

Israel, Turkey to hold joint exercises; Egypt, Jordan invited
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Turkey plan to hold joint search and
rescue naval exercises in the eastern Mediterranean in November and
have asked Egypt and Jordan to join them, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli-Turkish military alliance has caused great concern
among several Middle Eastern nations, especially Syria, Iran and
Iraq which believe it is directed at them.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who is on his first visit
to the Middle East since his Motherland Party came to power earlier
this year, on Monday lashed out at Syria.
	   ``Frankly, I don't care how Syria comments (on) my visit.
Everyone is aware of the hostile intentions of Syria on Turkey,''
Yilmaz told a news conference in Jerusalem.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, quoting security sources, said
Tuesday that Israel and Turkey planned to hold their second joint
naval maneuver in November, but that no date has been set yet.
	   The Israeli army spokesman said he was checking the report.
	   The two nations held their first joint exercise in January. It
involved more than 1,000 sailors and five warships. Jordan sent an
observer, but did not participate.
	   Jordan's information minister, Nasser Judeh, said earlier this
week that Jordan had no plans to join a regional military alliance.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   However, Netanyahu softened his comments Monday, saying he meant
only to say that Israeli-Turkish cooperation could contribute to
regional security.
	   Turkey has signed several military cooperation agreements with
Israel since 1996. It allows Israeli jets to use its airspace for
training, and Israel upgrades Turkey's F-4 fighter fleet under a
contract worth dlrs 630 million signed two years ago.

Amnesty reports executions in China fall, but still world high
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 0100 GMT Wednesday Sept. 9, time set by source.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China sentenced at least 3,152 people to death
and executed at least 1,876 last year, a decline from an unusually
high total in 1996, Amnesty International said in a report
Wednesday.
	   Despite the drop, China still executed more people than the rest
of the world combined. The report added that the decline was not
dramatic, but rather represented a resumption of normal levels
after the peak of China's ``Strike-Hard'' anti-crime campaign in
1996.
	   That year there were 4,367 executions in China, according the
London-based human rights group's figures.
	   The Communist leadership urged courts to apply the death penalty
more often as part of the anti-crime campaign. Amnesty's tally for
1996 was twice the 2,190 executions it reported for 1995 in China.
	   The group said its statistics were only partial because they
were based on reports in the Chinese press and authorities do not
allow all executions to be reported.
	   The total number of executions in China is a state secret.
	   Trials in China often fail to meet international standards of
fairness because confessions are extracted through torture,
defendants are denied early access to lawyers and trials are
carried out with ``indecent haste,'' Amnesty International's report
said.
	   Cases in which these problems appeared ``reveal a lack of
genuine safeguards against police abuse, deeply flawed evidence
criteria, truncated review procedures and an almost unstoppable
momentum towards execution once the verdict has been announced,''
it added.
	   A new criminal code that went into effect last Oct. 1 may help
reduce the number of executions if it is properly implemented.
	   The report said the revisions clarified the definition of
``particularly serious circumstances'' that would call for the
death penalty, but the number of capital offenses remained the same
at 69.
	   John Kamm, a U.S. businessman who has lobbied the Chinese
government on behalf of political prisoners for eight years, said
last week that a senior judge told him the new criminal code and
sentencing guidelines were the prime reasons for the decline.
	   The code narrowed the uses of the death penalty for theft to
bank robbery and theft of cultural relics, Kamm quoted the judge as
saying.
	   Iran had the second highest number of executions last year with
143, according to Amnesty's report.

Hart offers his `please explain' to board

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand rugby union coach
John Hart presented his report Tuesday on what went wrong with the
usually invincible All Blacks, along with his plans for 1999.
	   How well the 1998 report is accepted by the New Zealand Rugby
Union Football Union (NZRFU) may determine whether Hart, who
watched New Zealand stumble to five consecutive losses to close out
the season, gets a chance to put his plan for next year into
action.
	   Hart remains upbeat about his prospects of staying in the top
job and denied suggestions the current team was unhappy for reasons
other then its poor record.
	   Hart said his hard line on discipline had not affected his
relationship with several players, a view supported in comments
taken by Banks after the most recent loss to Australia.
	   ``I think my relationship with the players generally is good,''
Hart said Tuesday. ``But that is something you have to work on all
the time.''
	   ``I haven't talked to any players because I felt it was better
for Mike to do that because he has to produce the report, but I'm
comfortable.''
	   Hart said he supported the NZRFU's review process despite it
being a possible vehicle for his demise.
	   ``I think it is very important to have that,'' Hart said. ``I
have been in management long enough to understand these sort of
things should be reviewed and what the union have done is a proper
thing.
	   `They've asked for a formal review, which is part of my contract
_ it happens every year.''
	   Hart conceded he might have erred in retaining senior players
and hurrying key players back from injury but he said he was wiser
for the experience.
	   ``I've learned this year, you learn from mistakes. I admit we
have made mistakes, like loyalty, maybe being very loyal to players
at times, maybe that was an issue and I think we did bring a few
players back into the team quicker than we should have.''
	   NZRFU chief executive David Moffett reiterated his support for
Hart but hinted some aspects of the current setup needed to be
reviewed.
	   ``I've come out publicly and given my support for John and my
support for him has not changed but there is no doubt some things
have to be done differently,'' Moffett said. (djp)

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Turkey plan to hold joint search and
rescue naval exercises in the eastern Mediterranean in November and
have asked Egypt and Jordan to join them, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli-Turkish military alliance has caused great concern
among several Middle Eastern nations, especially Syria, Iran and
Iraq which believe it is directed at them.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who is on his first visit
to the Middle East since his Motherland Party came to power earlier
this year, on Monday lashed out at Syria.
	   ``Frankly, I don't care how Syria comments (on) my visit.
Everyone is aware of the hostile intentions of Syria on Turkey,''
Yilmaz told a news conference in Jerusalem.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, quoting security sources, said
Tuesday that Israel and Turkey planned to hold their second joint
naval maneuver in November, but that no date has been set yet.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said it was not aware of
naval maneuvers scheduled for November.

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior
police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said.
	   The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the
first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to
punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
	   Witnesses said a car exploded first. When police and journalists
gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb apparently hidden in a
motorcycle parked nearby exploded and injured the crowd at around 2
a.m. (1800GMT).
	   TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for
help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another
explosion. Police said the second bomb was believed to have been
set off by remote control.
	   The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained
hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday.
	   Police said the injured officers were members of the judiciary
and security units.
	   Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions. But
police said the two incidents were probably not related.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the
explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said
Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the
population and the territory's stability.''
	   Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but
the motive was not yet known. They said they were searching for two
men, both aged 30.
	   Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed
shock and anger. The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong
statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to
injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Last month, two gunmen on a motorcycle shot and wounded a
government prosecutor and his pregnant wife, one day after the
grandson of one of Macau's original gambling kingpins was wounded
in a shootout with attackers.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. The
enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to
Chinese rule in December 1999.

Shiite leader murdered in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A prominent member of a Shiite Muslim
group was murdered in Tuesday in what police suspect was a feud
between rival Islamic groups.
	   Murid Hussein, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan, or the
Movement for the Implementation of Shiite Rights, was shot by two
men with automatic rifles in the town of Sahiwal, about 400
kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Islamabad.
	   Police said the men approached Hussein's house on motorcycles in
the early morning, broke in and opened fire on the Shiite leader
and his wife. Police said Hussein died on the spot, and his wife
was hospitalized in critical condition.
	   The gunmen escaped, but police said they suspect members of a
rival Sunni Muslim sect, called the Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of
the Friends of the Prophet. The group is linked to dozens of
religiously motivated attacks.
	   Fighting between religious rivals has left hundreds of people
dead in Pakistan. Attackers have lobbed grenades at mosques, and
gunned down people on the streets and in their houses.
	   On Monday, public prosecutor Sardar Khan, 50, was shot and
killed outside his children's school in the southern city of
Karachi after bringing seven Sunni militants before a special
anti-terror court on charges of murdering two Iranian engineers in
February.

Japan remains biggest foreign aid donor for seventh straight year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan was the world's largest provider of aid to
developing countries in 1997 for the seventh straight year, the
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday, but the amount declined in dollar
terms.
	   Japan's overseas development assistance fell 1.8 percent to
about dlrs 9.4 billion in 1997, mainly because of the Japanese
yen's steep depreciation against the dollar, the Foreign Ministry
said in a report.
	   It was the second straight year of decline in dollar terms in
Japan's ODA committment, the report said.
	   However, Japan's ODA in yen rose 9.2 percent to about 1.14
trillion yen. That amount represented 0.22 percent of Japan's 1997
Gross National Product, ranking Japan 19th out of the 21 donor
countries in terms of the ratio of ODA committment to GNP.
	   Japan's aid to specific countries fell 20.9 percent to dlrs 6.61
billion, while its ODA to international institutions such as the
World Bank rose 125 percent to dlrs 2.82 billion.

Rain-swollen river threatens to submerge Bangladeshi capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photo expected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of government workers and
local residents battled to shore up a dam protecting the
Bangladeshi capital on Tuesday, after officials said the city of 9
million people was in danger of being swamped by the Sitalakhoia
River.
	   Already, more than half of Dhaka was already under knee-to
waist-deep water following heavy monsoon rains in the past month.
	   Workers used cement and sand bags to shore up the dam 10
kilometers (six miles) east of Dhaka. A minor breach occurred on
Monday but was it was quickly filled, said Rustom Ali, an engineer
of the water development board, at the site.
	   Elsewhere, at least 22 people were reported missing after a
rescue trawler sank in a flooded river near Faridpur, 64 kilometers
(40 miles) south of Dhaka, an official at the flood relief center
in Dhaka said.
	   In two months more than 800 people have been drowned or killed
by collapsing houses in one of the worst monsoon floods in this
impoverished nation.

Warne wants to play in first Ashes test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Injured leg spin bowler Shane Warne
said Tuesday he was hopeful of rejoining his Australian cricket
teammates for the first Ashes test against England in late
November.
	   He said the progression of his reconstructed shoulder was ahead
of schedule and he would test it in domestic Sheffield Shield
matches starting next month.
	   Warne said at a sports function two weeks ago that there was a
danger he may never play again. But on Tuesday he said it was a
matter of when, rather than if, he would resume.
	   ``At the physio over the last couple of weeks I've shown some
good progress and at this stage I'm aiming for the first Shield
game,'' he said at the launch of the Victorian state season.
	   ``Probably I won't bowl an unlimited amount of overs, maybe 10
to 15 an innings.''
	   Warne, Australia's second-greatest wicket taker with 313 victims
in 67 tests, was reappointed Victorian captain with wicketkeeper
Darren Berry his deputy.
	   He has made himself unavailable for the tour of Pakistan
starting on Sept. 23 but now is hopeful of making his return in the
first test against England in Brisbane on Nov. 24.
	   He said he needed to play the Shield games in the lead up to
gauge how his shoulder was recovering.
	   ``You have to get confidence, you have to be able to have a few
games, see how you pull up the next day, whether you can go
back-to-back,'' he said.
	   Warne said with the surgery his bowling action should be better
than ever.
	   He said the shoulder had been causing him great discomfort over
the past 18 months, making it hard for him to sleep.
	   ``I haven't been able to do a lot of things with the shoulder
but to have a brand new shoulder and do whatever I like with it is
pretty exciting,'' he said. (djp)

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts on southern Lebanon Tuesday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the 0830 (0530GMT)
air attack.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said two Israel jets fired an air-to-surface rocket each on targets
in the hills between Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah
province.
	   In Israel, the army said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   Israeli frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel's panhandle, but it wasn't
clear exactly why Tuesday's raid was carried out.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protects its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

Number of Japanese centenarians tops 10,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan, home to the world's longest-living
population and one of the world's lowest fertility rates, now has
more than 10,000 centenarians, the government said Tuesday.
	   There will be 10,158 Japanese 100 years or older at the end of
September _ 1,667 more than a year ago, the Health and Welfare
Ministry said. Of those who have lived a century, 82.2 percent are
women.
	   It is the 28th year-to-year increase in the number of the
centenarians, according to a list of the centenarians released by
the ministry ahead of Respect for the Aged Day, Sept. 15.
	   Japan's oldest citizen, 114-year-old Tase Matsunaga, is in a
nursing home in Tokyo.
	   No international comparisons of the number of centenarians were
available, a ministry official said.
	   Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy _ 83.82 years
for women and 77.19 years for men.
	   The birthrate, however, is declining fast. the ministry reported
earlier this year that the average Japanese woman has an average of
only 1.39 babies in her lifetime.

Indonesia to import 3.4 million metric tons says minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia will import 3.4 million
metric tons of rice in the fiscal year 1999-2000, Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan said Tuesday.
	   Rahardi, head of the government's food distribution
organization, the National Logistics Agency, or Bulog, told
Parliament the forecast was based on ``the most conservative
assumption'' that 1 million tons of rice will be produced
domestically during the same period.
	   The fiscal year starts from the end of March.
	   Rahardi said the government hopes half of its rice imports for
1999-2000 can be financed via a mixture of soft loans and aid
grants or deferred payments.
	   Indonesia is facing its worst economic crisis in 30 years. Food
shortages and price increases have been compounded by a drought
last year as well as claims of rice smuggling and hoarding.
	   Police and troops used batons, shields and tear gas to break up
a demonstration by students at the Parliament before dawn Tuesday
after the protesters called for lower food prices.
	   Indonesia recently raised its import forecast for this year to
4.1 million tons from 3.1 million tons. Despite the fact that this
year's rice crop looked promising compared with last year's,
traders say output remains extremely low.
	   Of the overall 4.1 million amount, Rahardi said the country had
imported 2.44 million tons of rice as of the end of August.
	   Rahardi said Bulog will use 3.5 million tons of rice in the
1998-99 fiscal year to try to keep prices down by putting
subsidized rice on the market.
	   Waiting in long lines to buy Bulog's cheap rice has become a
daily way of life for many poor Indonesians.
	   Even so, the price of rice has risen sharply in recent weeks
despite Bulog's efforts. The International Monetary Fund has said
it will look into the reasons why prices have been rising.

Yeltsin hesitates in choosing candidate; Russian crisis unabated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting aides, more comments from
lawmakers. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin huddled with top aides at
his country residence Tuesday, discussing whether to stick with his
first choice for prime minister or force a confrontation with a
hostile parliament.
	   Yeltsin has said that Viktor Chernomyrdin is his only choice to
lead a new government that must deal with the country's worst
economic crisis since Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, overwhelmingly
turned down Chernomyrdin for a second time Monday. Yeltsin is now
considering whether to name him again for the all-important third
and final round of voting.
	   As of midday Tuesday, Yeltsin had still not named anyone, which
fueled speculation that he might be considering a compromise
candidate.
	   Yeltsin was spending the day meeting with senior aides at his
country residence, Gorky 9, outside Moscow. Chernomyrdin was among
those who planned to meet with the president, lawmakers in
parliament said.
	   ``Today the countdown has begun for the position of compromise
... with another candidate,'' Konstantin Titov, a member of
parliament's upper house, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Yeltsin
planned to stick with Chernomyrdin, who held the premier's post for
five years before he was sacked by the president in March.
	   ``It will be Chernomyrdin and no one else,'' Zhirinovsky said.
	   The first two votes in parliament demonstrated lawmakers' strong
opposition to Yeltsin and delayed the formation of a new government
during a time of turmoil.
	   If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's candidate again, then the
constitution calls on the president to dismiss parliament and call
new elections within three months. Yeltsin would then rule by
decree, along with an interim government, until the new legislature
is seated.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin warned the Duma before the lower house of
parliament torpedoed his nomination. ``We are all standing on the
edge and no time is left for settling scores. We must begin
acting.''
	   Duma members might be willing to change their votes in the third
round in order to preserve their own jobs. The dissolution of the
legislature would only add to the country's political and economic
turbulence, and it's not clear how angry Russians would vote in new
elections. Many incumbents would likely lose their seats.
	   Chernomyrdin's efforts to win confirmation by parliament have
left him little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party, the largest in
the Duma, would never accept Chernomyrdin. He complained that
Yeltsin had not listened to opposition calls for an alternate
candidate.
	   The Communists and their allies say they have nine alternate
candidates, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The liberal
Yabloko party on Monday has suggested Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's economy remained in a downward spiral.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about six to the U.S. dollar
last month, was around 20 to the dollar on Tuesday.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation on even higher inflation. Long lines
at gas stations began forming Monday as motorists filled up before
prices go up.
	   Also, Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin, who has been widely
criticized for mishandling the crisis, offered Monday to resign.
However, there was no immediate response from the Kremlin and it
was not clear if Yeltsin would accept his resignation.

Despite slight recovery, global worries likely to keep dollar down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ International crises usually buoy the U.S. dollar.
This time, worries about crumbling economies in Russia and Asia are
heightening fears about the fate of American global investments and
sending the dollar plunging.
	   ``There's a widespread sense that the U.S. dollar is in danger
so people are selling,'' said Masashi Ehara, a manager in the
foreign exchange section of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The dollar, often sought as a haven during times of turmoil, has
fallen about 15 yen over the last month from a closing in Tokyo as
high as 147.41 yen on Aug. 10.
	   The greenback recovered slightly Tuesday afternoon to 132.32
yen, up 0.33 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. New York markets were
closed Monday for Labor Day. In London, the dollar dipped to 131.79
yen overnight.
	   Traders said the downward dollar was likely to continue for the
next couple of weeks.
	   Interest in yen-buying also remains low. The dismal prospects
for the Japanese economy, dragged down in the worst recession in
five decades, continue to weigh down on the yen, dealers say.
	   But the deep-rooted anxiety that the Asian financial troubles
may spread to the United States was working in the other direction,
to push the dollar down.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average on the New York
Stock Exchange fell 41.97 to 7,640.25, down 411.43 for the week.
The decline left the Dow with a loss of 268 points, or 3.4 percent,
for the year. At the July peak, the Dow was up 18.1 percent for
1998.
	   Problems in Russia also herald trouble for the dollar.
	   The Russian parliament rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo and sending the ruble crashing. Dealers said such
economic woes are forcing U.S. players to sell the dollar for
profits to cover losses in Russia and other global trouble spots.
	   ``As long as the confusion continues in emerging markets, this
trend will not let up,'' said Tokai Bank dealer Shunji Tsuda,
adding that such uncertainties spanned from Malaysia to Latin
America. ``Sentiments are negative on the dollar, so people are
going along with that flow.''
	   The comment last Friday from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan suggesting that the American central bank is prepared to
lower interest rates to ward off a recession has also dampened
dollar-buying.
	   Lower interest rates boosts economic growth by making it easier
for businesses and consumers to borrow, but also tend to lower the
value of that nation's currency.
	   A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said he was not
worried about the dollar's nosedive.
	   ``The correction of the strong dollar-weak yen has just
started,'' Haruhiko Kuroda told the Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.
	   Most players, however, do not foresee a further comeback for the
yen unless share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange shoot up. That
appears unlikely given the economic slowdown. Parliament has been
deadlocked over banking reform bills to deal with the nation's
massive bad debt problem.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished Tuesday at 14,913.49
points, up 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent from Monday's close.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ As a Canadian navy commander, Rick
Town is trained for combat. But the chief officer of the HMCS
Preserver never prepared for a mission devoted mostly to pulling
body parts from a plane crash out of the sea.
	   Town said the focus of the giant operation that he has overseen
since Wednesday night's crash of the Swissair aircraft is to bring
home the remains of the 229 people who perished on the New
York-Geneva flight.
	   ``It's beyond anything anybody here has seen,'' Town said of the
grisly search.
	   Crew members initially hoped they would be rescuing survivors;
now much of their efforts involve collecting bodies torn to pieces
by the impact of the crash five miles (eight kilometers) off the
coastal resort of Peggy's Cove.
	   ``You had to try so very hard to have respect for the remains of
the person that did not survive,'' Town said. ``You had to
constantly continue to remind yourself that what you're dealing
with is human.''
	   From his command post aboard the 560-foot (168-meter) supply
ship, Town oversees an extensive recovery mission that has involved
seven Canadian navy ships, several coast guard vessels, one
submarine and, soon, a U.S. Navy ship.
	   As Town spoke by telephone from his ship, he described divers,
one after the other, going to depths of 190 feet (57 meters) to
search for the cockpit voice recorder. Three other ships used a
sophisticated ``side-scan'' sonar that has given them detailed
images of the ocean floor, including sightings of three large
pieces of wreckage where more bodies are believed to be.
	   ``We've got a good sense from the visual description from the
divers who were down in the debris field _ they were down there and
they saw the wreckage and they believe they have bodies,'' Town
said.
	   In another direction, near a pair of islands, two teams of
divers were searching for more bodies in an area where Town got
reports, which he admits were not very reliable, that victims might
be found.
	   On the Preserver, the work of gathering the debris and human
remains has occupied much of the 270-member crew. A hangar about 50
meters (yards) long _ normally home to three Sea Hawk helicopters _
is filled with wreckage. Human remains are taken by helicopter to
the morgue at an air force base on shore.
	   ``This is unprecedented, the horror that we've had to
confront,'' Town said.
	   But his encounters with the the victims' families, who have
often thanked Town and his crew for their efforts, have given them
some reassurance that, though they cannot save any lives, their
work is still meaningful, he said.

Malaysia all set to host biggest Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After months of nerve-wracking
worries, Malaysia is coming out ahead with flying colors for its
upcoming festival of sports.
	   Three days before the official opening of the 16th Commonwealth
Games, Kuala Lumpur is looking all spruced up, the sports venues
appear ready, the predicted haze is not here and the city's water
rationing appears over.
	   If only there wasn't a political scandal under way, which some
people worry could end up overshadowing the games. And then there's
the recession, the worst in 13 years.
	   ``Despite losing several hundred billions of U.S. dollars due to
the speculations by currency traders and stock market players, we
have completed all the facilities and preparations,'' Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
	   Malaysia has literally spared no effort.
	   Almost to military regimen, thousands have worked
around-the-clock to paint fading facades, lay fresh asphalt and
trim hedges to beautify Kuala Lumpur.
	   Braving tropical downpours, schoolchildren have practiced in the
100,000-capacity, dlrs 300-million Bukit Jalil stadium for the
spectacular opening Friday night.
	   Officials have worked nights ensuring that arenas matched and
even surpassed world standards.
	   ``It is a measure of our commitment to the Games and our
seriousness about keeping our promises,'' Mahathir said at the
opening the Commonwealth Games Federation general assembly, which
is held ahead of each four-year event.
	   Malaysia is looking at regaining some of its prestige, eroded in
recent weeks by Mahathir's handling of a political challenge from
his deputy, attempts to smother the local press and his turnaround
on free-market policies to introduce sweeping capital control
measures.
	   ``We hope that the presence of so many people who would
otherwise not visit Malaysia will help to correct the image of
Malaysia that have been painted by the less friendly of the
international media,'' Mahathir said.
	   The Kuala Lumpur event, the first in Asia, is the largest of all
Commonwealth Games so far. About 5,000 athletes are competing and
Kiribati will become the 70th nation to join the games when it is
admitted by the CGF on Tuesday.
	   The number of participants four years ago in Vancouver, British
Columbia, was 3,200.
	   Kuala Lumpur has admitted six new events to spice up interest in
the sporting event, which is facing increasing competition from
grands prix and World Cups.
	   Cricket, sevens rugby, men's and women's field hockey, netball,
squash and tenpin bowling have been added. Preliminary events start
Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremonies.
	   Despite a 10 percent slash in the budget, organizers had managed
within 360 million (dlrs 95 million) ringgit, said Chandra
Shekaran, spokesman for the organizers.
	   Apart from the operating costs, Malaysia had spent 1.4 billion
(dlrs 370 million) ringgit on building new venues and importing
equipment and another 300 million ringgit (dlrs 90 million) on
upgrading existing facilities, he said.
	   Concerns about the success of the games have dogged Malaysia
since a haze enveloped large swathes of Southeast Asia last year.
Officials from some Commonwealth countries who visited Kuala Lumpur
last September were shocked by the gray blanket and people wearing
surgical masks.
	   A water shortage triggered new doubts in March and later CGF
officials said they were worried about the slow pace of work at the
various venues and the traffic congestions.

Think tank downgrades projection on Japanese corporate profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Major Japanese companies will post an average 15
percent fall in parent pretax profit this fiscal year due to
stagnant domestic demand and the Asian economic crisis, a private
think tank said Tuesday.
	   The Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd.'s assessment was
considerably bleaker than its previous prediction of an average 8
percent decline for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   Profits are being battered as both households and companies cut
back on spending because of Japan's severe credit crunch and the
negative effects of asset deflation, Daiwa said.
	   The think tank, which is a research arm of Daiwa Securities Co.,
also said the government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 112 billion)
stimulus plan was unlikely to lead to an immediate recovery in
domestic demand.
	   Corporate profits will be further eroded by the economic woes of
Southeast Asian countries, which will limit exports to the region,
Daiwa said.
	   Daiwa had a brighter projection for the fiscal year ending March
31, 2000, saying corporate pretax profits are expected to rise 11
percent, the first increase in three years.
	   Daiwa's report covers 381 major companies listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, but doesn't include financial
institutions.

Shiite leader murdered in Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A prominent member of a Shiite Muslim
group was murdered on Tuesday in what police suspect was a feud
between rival Islamic groups.
	   Murid Hussein, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan, or the
Movement for the Implementation of Shiite Rights, was shot by two
men with automatic rifles in the town of Sahiwal, about 400
kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Islamabad.
	   Police said the men approached Hussein's house on motorcycles in
the early morning, broke in and opened fire on the Shiite leader
and his wife. Police said Hussein died on the spot, and his wife
was hospitalized in critical condition.
	   The gunmen escaped, but police said they suspect members of a
rival Sunni Muslim sect, called the Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of
the Friends of the Prophet. The group is linked to dozens of
religiously motivated attacks.
	   Fighting between religious rivals has left hundreds of people
dead in Pakistan. Attackers have lobbed grenades at mosques, and
gunned down people on the streets and in their houses.
	   On Monday, public prosecutor Sardar Khan, 50, was shot and
killed outside his children's school in the southern city of
Karachi after bringing seven Sunni militants before a special
anti-terror court on charges of murdering two Iranian engineers in
February.

Chechen kidnappers release six Russian hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kidnappers from Chechnya have released six
Russians they took hostage earlier this summer, a news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The six captives, taken June 7 near the village of Tsalyk in the
Caucasus republic of North Ossetia, were let go after a local
businessman helped pay the ransom for their release, the ITAR-TASS
news agency reported.
	   The report did not say how much was paid. The Chechen kidnappers
moved the men often, holding them for the last few days in a dark
cellar, ITAR-Tass said.
	   North Ossetia has seen frequent spillover violence from
breakaway Chechnya, which lies in the same mountainous region of
the Caucasus.
	   Chechnya fought a 1994-6 war with Russia and considers itself
independent, though no other nation recognizes its claim.

Syria criticizes Turkey after Turkish leader's visit to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria unleashed a fresh barrage of
criticism Tuesday at the Israeli-Turkish military alliance, saying
it will add to tensions and violence in the Middle East.
	   The complaints in the state-run Syrian press came a day after a
visit to Israel by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz who accused
Syria of hostile intentions toward his own country.
	   The government daily Tishrin said the Israeli-Turkish alliance
``does not intend to spread peace and stability in the region but
rather aims at creating tension and plunging the region into a
cycle of endless violence.''
	   The paper, in an editorial, urged Turkey to improve its
relations with the Arabs and with fellow Muslim states instead of
``throwing itself into Israel's arms (which) would bring it nothing
but troubles.''
	   The government daily Al-Baath added that ``the suspicious
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance threatens ... Arab security in
general and Syria's in particular.''
	   After his meeting Monday with Yilmaz, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said that the ties between Israel and Turkey are
intended ``to contribute to the stability of the region.''
	   Yilmaz lashed out at Syria during a news conference in
Jerusalem. ``Frankly, I don't care how Syria comments (on) my
visit. Everyone is aware of the hostile intentions of Syria on
Turkey,'' the Turkish leader said.
	   On Tuesday, the Israeli daily Haaretz quoted security sources as
saying Turkey and Israel plan to hold their second joint naval
exercises in November.
	   Syria has frequently criticized the Israeli-Turkish military
alliance since it was begun in 1996, saying it is aimed at adding
to Israel's military capabilities and at forcing concessions from
Syria in stalled Mideast peace talks.

Travelers Group still shopping for acquisitions in Japanese market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of financial giant Travelers Group Inc.
said Tuesday that his company hopes to expand its presence in Japan
just three months after buying a quarter of the third-largest
Japanese brokerage house.
	   Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of New
York-based Travelers Group, said he sees great potential from
business generated by tapping into the huge pool of funds
accumulated by thrifty Japanese savers.
	   Speaking at a symposium in Tokyo, Weill said his firm is
``looking to invest in other financial companies in the Japanese
market.''
	   He also said Travelers remains bullish on the long-term
prospects for Japan's economy, noting that many other countries
have also been hurt recently by economic troubles.
	   ``With all these economies imploding, it is giving Japan another
chance to be a leader in the world economy,'' Weill said.
	   In June, Travelers Group Inc. placed a dlrs 1.6 billion bet on
Japan's financial future by becoming the biggest shareholder of
Nikko Securities Co. That came on the heels of Travelers Group's
announcement of a planned merger with Citicorp to create the
world's largest financial services company.
	   In the past, foreign financial companies have had difficultly
setting up operations in Japan and buying out domestic rivals. But
Weill said there are no longer any barriers to acquisitions by
foreign companies.
	   The Japanese government has begun to remove regulations which
have sheltered domestic banks, brokers and insurers from
competition by implementing a series of economic reforms dubbed the
``Big Bang.''
	   Travelers, like many other big American financial powerhouses
such as Merrill Lynch and Co., hopes to win a share of the
estimated dlrs 9 trillion in personal financial assets owned by
Japanese savers and investors.
	   Also Tuesday, Weill said a cut in U.S. interest rates _
something which Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at
on Friday _ would provide a boost for struggling developing nations
with currencies pegged to the dollar.

North Korea boasts of scientific prowess in rocket launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea boasted Tuesday about the
``might of science and technology'' that allowed it to launch a
multistage rocket that has perplexed the world.
	   The ruling communist party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, described
the launch vehicle as a three-stage rocket that lofted a scientific
satellite into earth orbit.
	   Japanese officials, quoting unidentified U.S. sources, initially
said the rocket was a two-stage ballistic missile that overflew
their nation and dropped into the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 31.
	   But they have since tempered that claim, suggesting that North
Korea might indeed have succeeded in orbiting a satellite in its
first known launch of a three-stage rocket.
	   There has been no official word from the United States, which
closely monitors North Korea with satellites, electronic
eavesdropping and intelligence overflights.
	   Whatever it was, the launch angered officials in Japan and South
Korea, who saw it as a new threat to the security of northeast
Asia.
	   Japan immediately withdrew support for a multinational effort to
build two nuclear reactors in North Korea, replacing one suspected
of producing plutonium for atomic weapons. In South Korea, there
were calls for the government to reconsider its policy of
engagement toward the North.
	   The Rodong Sinmun report said North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
sent special thanks to scientists who contributed to the successful
launch of the satellite, dubbed Kwangmyongsong, or bright star.
	   The report said the rocket's first and second stages were liquid
fueled, while the third stage used solid fuel. Both the rocket and
satellite, it said, were ``developed with local strength, wisdom
and technology 100 percent.''
	   The launch ``demonstrates the might of science and technology of
Juche and proves the high level of the technology of development
and manufacture of the carrier rocket,'' Rodong Sinmun said.
	   Juche, or self-reliance, is North Korea's guiding philosophy.
	   Quoting unidentified government sources, the South Korean
newspaper Hankyoreh said Seoul and Washington have tentatively
concluded that North Korea might have put ``something'' in orbit
with a multistage rocket.
	   It quoted the sources as saying that the United States will
announce its findings before this weekend.
	   A re-analysis of data found that the rocket fired by North Korea
over Japan was of three stages, a strong indication that it was
intended to put an object into orbit, the paper said.

Airplane makers selling jets, but worry about downturn

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with source saying Airbus will announce sale to
Emirates; EDITING below to tighten, delete dated material

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airplane makers are busy announcing
new jet orders at the biggest air show of the year, while hoping a
forecast slump in sales won't mean a repeat of the industry's early
1990s disaster.
	   Sales are booming, but analysts say air carriers are buying more
airplanes than they need so a setback is inevitable, probably in
2000.
	   The European airplane maker Airbus Industrie was to announce
Tuesday that the Middle East carrier Emirates Airlines had placed
six firm orders for Airbus model A340 jets, with a list price of
about dlrs 810 million, an aviation source said.
	   Emirates would also take options to purchase more Airbus jets,
raising the potential value of the deal into the billions, the
source told The Associated Press, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Despite the new orders _ the Boeing Co. announced dlrs 1.1
billion worth of new business when the Farnborough International 98
show opened on Monday _ Boeing president Harry Stonecipher warned
that the business is ``peaking and flattening.''
	   But the Boeing boss said airlines had not overextended
themselves as much this time around as they did in the late 1980s,
only to hit serious troubles when the Gulf War and the last
recession cut demand for air travel and virtually halved new
airplane sales.
	   ``People haven't splurged like they have in the past,''
Stonecipher told reporters on Monday.
	   But he cautioned that the Asian economic crisis could last two
to five years, and that poses troubling questions about how hard
developed economies _ where the planemakers sell most of their jets
_ will be hit.
	   Stonecipher said Boeing's leadership was to blame for the
company's recent troubles, including Ron Woodard, recently fired as
president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
	   Stonecipher said new management, with Woodard replaced by
executive Alan Mulally, will fix assembly line troubles and other
things that caused numerous delays in airplane deliveries.
	   ``Where we have been too arrogant, too distracted or too
self-satisfied, we are going to be much more intense and much more
focused on things that really matter,'' Stonecipher said.

Yeltsin hesitates in choosing candidate; Russian crisis unabated

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin huddled with top aides at
his country residence Tuesday, discussing whether to stick with his
first choice for prime minister or offer a compromise candidate to
the hostile parliament.
	   Yeltsin has said that Viktor Chernomyrdin is his only choice to
lead a new government that must deal with the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, overwhelmingly
turned down Chernomyrdin for a second time Monday. Yeltsin was
considering whether to name him again for the all-important third
and final round of voting.
	   As of midday Tuesday, Yeltsin had still not named anyone, which
fueled speculation that he might be considering a compromise
candidate.
	   Yeltsin was spending the day meeting with senior aides at his
country residence, Gorky 9, outside Moscow. Chernomyrdin was among
those meeting with the president.
	   ``Today the countdown has begun for the position of compromise
... with another candidate,'' Konstantin Titov, a member of
parliament's upper house, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Yeltsin
planned to stick with Chernomyrdin, who held the premier's post for
five years before he was sacked by the president in March.
	   ``It will be Chernomyrdin and no one else,'' Zhirinovsky said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said that the renomination of
Chernomyrdin would lead to the ``complete paralysis of the entire
political process.''

Russia's trade with Korea down in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trade between Russia and South Korea dropped
steeply since the start of the year because of financial problems
in both countries, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Korean imports to Russia fell 5.7 percent to dlrs 1.5 billion
since the start of the year. In the same period, Russian exports to
Korea were down by a third, now at dlrs 583 million, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Russia's decision to stop paying foreign debts and aftershocks
of last year's Asian crisis, were primarily to blame, said Li Kwang
He, head of the South Korean Consulate's commercial department in
the eastern port city of Vladivostok.
	   He said, however, that Russia should be able to sell more raw
materials abroad because prices will fall as the ruble weakens,
Interfax reported.

Swissair plane's flight recorder found but missing crucial data
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of Swissair charter plane landing after smoke in
cabin. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers have retrieved Swissair
Flight 111's flight-data recorder despite an emergency which
endangered their lives, but experts say the ``black box'' contains
no information from the final minutes of the doomed flight.
	   Crash investigators had high hopes after the data recorder was
recovered from the ocean floor Sunday. But laboratory examinations
on Monday revealed that there was no data from at least the last
six minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off
Nova Scotia last week, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the data recorder
stopped once the plane dipped below 10,000 feet (3048 meters). A
strong possibility, he said, was that the plane lost electrical
power at that stage.
	   However, Gerden said the data recorder was in good condition and
should provide useful evidence about more than 100 types of
information ranging from altitude and airspeed to whether the
plane's smoke warning lights were on.
	   The data recorder, found at a depth of 190 feet (57 meters),
nearly didn't make it to the surface. Navy Capt. Phil Webster said
one of the two divers developed a leak in his suit, and the pair
had to make an ascent _ clutching the black box _ much more rapidly
than is considered safe.
	   One of the divers became ill from the rapid change in pressure.
Both were put in a decompression chamber, then taken to hospital.
Both were recovering at home, Webster said.
	   At the crash site, five miles (eight kilometers) offshore,
divers equipped with hand-held sonar searched Monday for the
plane's other black box _ the cockpit-voice recorder. The signals
from the device have been detected, but bad weather forced
suspension of the diving until at least Wednesday.
	   If retrieved intact, the voice recorder would reveal other
noises in the cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with
controllers, portions of which were released Saturday. That
conversation was cut off 10 minutes after the pilots reported smoke
in the cockpit and six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to confirm if three large pieces of
wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections of the
plane's fuselage.
	   Several hundred family members have come to the area to visit
Peggy's Cove, attend memorial services and assist medical teams in
trying to identify badly fragmented human remains retrieved by
searchers.
	   More than 1,400 military personnel are involved in the search,
and more than 200 stress counselors have been assigned to support
them during their often grisly work.
	   ``Some of the stuff they're being exposed to is truly
horrible,'' said Mary Anne Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
	   At the Shearwater military air base near Halifax, relatives have
been invited to look at personal effects found by the search team.
	   Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California, said she went
there hoping to find her stepmother's ring, and instead found the
wallet of her father, former New York Times executive John
Mortimer.
	   ``It was a very wrenching experience,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, in a scare Monday night reminiscent of last week's
crash, an Airbus A-310 charter plane belonging to a charter
subsidiary of Swissair's parent company returned to Halifax shortly
after reporting smoke in its galley.
	   The Balair/CTA Airbus A-310 was on a flight from Zurich to
Vancouver via a scheduled stop in Halifax with 144 passengers on
board, SAirGroup spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz said in Zurich.
	   A short-circuit in the plane's galley started the incident soon
after takeoff, Tschanz said.
	   She said the pilot, Hans Breitenmoser, decided to return to
Halifax as there was some smoke in the passenger cabin. ``It was
not an emergency landing'' and went without any problems, Tschanz
said.
	   The plane, flight BB118, was able to continue to Vancouver early
Tuesday, although two of its passengers declined to continue the
journey, she said.

Drug-tainted Australian cyclist sparks controversy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cyclist's comments on arrival

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Allowing drug scandal-tainted
Australian cyclist Neil Stephens to ride at the Commonwealth Games
has created problems for the sport, Australian Olympic official
Phil Coles said Tuesday.
	   Coles, also an Australian Olympic Committee board member and the
AOC's director of international relations, questioned the
Australian Commonwealth Games Association's decision to allow
Stephens to compete at the Kuala Lumpur Games.
	   Malaysian Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Monday that
Stephens should not compete at the Games, which officially kick off
Friday.
	   Stephens was part of the Festina team expelled from the recent
Tour de France for using a performance-enhancing substance.
	   The drug scandal has placed Malaysia and Australia at
loggerheads once again. Relations have been poor since 1993, when
former Prime Minister Paul Keating criticized his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad for boycotting the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Things heated up again last month when Australian games chief
Perry Crosswhite warned his athletes that things would go wrong in
Kuala Lumpur because the games were being run by retired military
officers.
	   Festina team boss Bruno Roussel has confirmed the Australian
cycling team had an organized system of doping and five of the nine
team riders have admitted using drugs.
	   Stephens told French police he inadvertently took erythropoietin
(EPO), saying team officials did not tell him what the substance
was.
	   Coles told the Australian Associated Press that he found it odd
the ACGA and the Australian Cycling Federation allowed Stephens to
ride at the September 11-21 games.
	   The association and federation, both headed by Ray Godkin,
allowed Stephens to ride here as French authorities continue an
investigation into the drug scandal that rocked the Tour de France.
	   ``I just don't know under what authority they were able to do
that. I don't know the real reason why they could do that but it's
up to them I guess,'' said Coles, who is also a member of the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Asked if Australia would be embarrassed should Stephens win a
medal at the Games, Coles said if he was a fellow competitor he
would ``have some questions.''
	   On arrival in Kuala Lumpur, Stephens said he happy to ride.
	   ``I've been asked to come over and I feel quite proud that I've
been chosen in the Australian team, to come over and do my best and
help one of my mates take home a medal,'' he said.
	   He said he had considered retirement amid the drug accusations.

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Congolese government and
rebels who control a quarter of the huge central African country
have reached a breakthrough in peace talks here and details were
supposed to be released on Tuesday.
	   Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, chairman of a regional
summit aimed at ending the civil war, refused to discuss details of
Monday's breakthrough and would not comment on whether a cease-fire
had been reached, but said there was some sort of an agreement.
	   ``Details of the agreement will be released tomorrow,'' he said.
	   Chiluba said the group of regional presidents will reconvene
Tuesday for further deliberations before issuing a statement.
	   ``We have had a very good meeting,'' he told reporters. ``Things
have gone extremely well.''
	   The Congolese rebels, excluded from two previous summits over
the past month, arrived Monday for the talks with Congo's President
Laurent Kabila and the presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face with the rebels.
Instead, Chiluba shuttled between the two camps during the talks,
said George Charamba, spokesman for Zimbabwe President Robert
Mugabe.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of sending troops to back the
rebels _ a claim they deny _ while Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
have sent military help to back Kabila's government.
	   ``We are ready to talk,'' Arthur Zahidi Ngoma of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition said at the airport before the
meetings began. He said rebels want foreign troops to leave before
they agree to any cease-fire.
	   Kabila has said he will not agree to a cease-fire until all
Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from Congo.
	   Meanwhile, in the rebels' eastern Congo stronghold of Goma, a
rebel commander said Tuesday that 25 people were killed and 40
wounded on Monday when planes supporting Kabila's government bombed
the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie for the second straight day. It
was not possible to independently verify the rebel claim.
	   The rebels did not say which of Kabila's allies deployed the
fighter jets. Only Zimbabwe and Angola are known to have military
aircraft.
	   At the summit, the head of the rebel delegation, Bizima Karaha _
a former foreign minister in Kabila's government _ met with summit
chairman Chiluba and Organization of African Unity Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Salim said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire that
would ensure the continuation of Kabila's government but also bring
about democratic reforms.
	   The rebel insurrection began in early August.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Tuesday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the 0830 (0530GMT)
air attack.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said two Israel jets fired an air-to-surface rocket each on targets
in the hills between Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah
province.
	   In Israel, the army said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   Israeli frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel's panhandle, but it wasn't
clear exactly why Tuesday's raid was carried out.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protects its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

Sydney water has been contaminated before, but warnings were never
</HEADLINE>
issued &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The water supply to Australia's largest
city has been contaminated by parasites at least twice before the
current scare, but the public was never warned, according to a
study released Tuesday.
	   New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr released an independent
report into Sydney's water supply which reveal at least two serious
outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium parasites between 1992 and
1993.
	   Testing in 1992 showed the bugs were present in every reservoir
serving Sydney, the report said. Tests in 1993 showed
cryptosporidium at levels five times those of the highest readings
in the current outbreak.
	   ``The public wasn't told. There was no boil water alert,'' Carr
said, accusing the previous government of a cover-up.
	   In a series of on again-off again warnings over the past five
weeks, more than 3 million people in Sydney have been warned to
boil tap water for at least one minute before ingesting it or risk
illness.
	   The health scare, which anonymous officials have been reported
as saying could last as long as six months, has been a major
embarrassment for the city, which will host the 2000 Olympic Games.
	   The government has been unable to isolate the source of the
infestation, officials on Tuesday called an emergency meeting of
international tourism operators to consider strategies to minimize
the damage to Sydney's image.
	   According to the documents released by Carr, there were no
public health warnings in the earlier cases despite the tests
coming just eight months after a cryptosporidium outbreak in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. That outbreak was blamed for the
deaths of about 100 people and for making about 400,000 people ill.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.
	   There has been no statistical increase in illness during the
Sydney outbreaks, and some scientists have argued that the bugs are
harmless algae.
	   Also Tuesday, authorities in the South Australian state capital
Adelaide said they too had detected an outbreak, but that they did
not consider it a health risk.
	   Sydney residents have been told the alert will remain in place
until at least Sept. 19.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes twice attacked
suspected guerrilla hideouts Tuesday in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the air attacks at
8:30 a.m. (0530GMT) and 11:00 a.m. (0800GMT).
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said in the first air raid two Israel jets each fired an
air-to-surface rocket on targets in the hills between the villages
of Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
	   Two jets returned to fire a rocket on Louweizeh 2 1/2 hours
later, the officials said.
	   In Israel, the army had said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud in the first air attack, scoring
``precise hits'' and returning safely to base.
	   Israel frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16

	   A Lebanese security official said the Israeli may have detected
guerrilla movements and decided to strike to prevent infiltration
into the Israeli-held territories.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust

Dollar slightly lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS UP with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen Tuesday
as investors fretted about the political turmoil in Russia, but the
greenback's fall was softened by bargain hunting. Tokyo stock
prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 131.92 yen in late afternoon trading, down
0.07 yen from late Monday in Tokyo, but above its late London level
of 131.79 yen overnight. The New York markets were closed Monday
for Labor Day.
	   The U.S. currency slumped in early trading as overseas funds
tried to make up for losses on their Russian investments by taking
profits on their dollar positions. Worries that Latin America might
next fall victim to the global financial crisis and hurt U.S.
stocks also dampened interest in the dollar.
	   But Japanese investors saw bargains in the greenback's slide and
helped the U.S. currency recover losses.
	   ``Japanese investors were buying at the 131-132 yen level
because after seeing the dollar at 147.00 just last month, it's
quite a bargain for them,'' said Tatsuya Ishii of the Banque
Nationale de Paris.
	   The dollar ranged between 131.10 and 132.50 yen in Tuesday's
trading.
	   Trading was thin as investors continued to monitor the political
turmoil in Moscow. Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President
Boris Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving
the country in political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   The Kremlin said late Monday that there was no word on how soon
Yeltsin would offer a new nomination.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose as hedge funds
closed positions in Japan to make up for losses in other markets
such as Russia and the United States. Investors were also covering
short positions ahead of Friday's settlement of September futures,
traders said.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished the
session 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent, higher at 14,913.49. On
Monday, the average closed up 747.15 points, or 5.32 percent,
bolstered by prospects that Japanese lawmakers were close to an
agreement on a banking system bailout.
	   The Nikkei rose about 500 points at one point in morning
trading, but the market largely erased those gains in the afternoon
session as investors snapped up short-term profits.
	   Traders say concerns about Japan's sputtering economy and
uncertainty in world financial markets were likely to make the
Tokyo stock market's rally short-lived.
	   ``Economic fundamentals aren't strong enough to support share
prices, and trading over the past two sessions has been dominated
by technical futures-led activities,'' said Kunihiro Hatae of Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,131.01. The
TOPIX closed up 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 490 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 503.53 million
shares Monday. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 612 to 523, while
165 issues were unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.020 percent from 1.040 percent Monday,
driving its price up to 112.93 from 112.83 yen.

Israeli children back to school after weeklong teachers' strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's 1.5 million school children returned
to their classrooms Tuesday after teachers ended a weeklong strike
called to press for higher wages.
	   Under an agreement with the Treasury signed Tuesday morning,
just an hour before the start of school, teachers will receive a
1.9 percent wage increase and will get paid extra for chaperoning
school trips.
	   The strike, which began Sept. 1, disrupted family routines
across the country, with working parents scrambling to find child
care.
	   The agreement with the teachers' union came after another strike
involving 300,000 public sector workers was settled Monday.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters returned to
Indonesia's Parliament Tuesday after security forces used batons,
shields and tear gas to evict hundreds in pre-dawn clash.
	   Violence also flared for a second day in a riot-torn town in the
center of the main island, Java, police said.
	   About 100 students staged peaceful sit-in protest on a road
about 100 meters (yards) from the main gate of the Parliament on
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Several hundred riot police stood guard over the peaceful
gathering as the students sang patriotic songs, chanted
anti-government slogans and called on President B.J. Habibie to
resign.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of other students were stopped at
military roadblocks on major roads leading to the legislative
complex.
	   However, some protesters got past the security cordon on foot.
More jumped out of vehicles that stopped on a nearby toll road not
sealed by troops.
	   Earlier, a senior Cabinet minister called on students to remain
calm, saying violent anti-government demonstrations and calls for
the president to quit would not fix Indonesia's crippling economic
crisis.
	   On Monday about 2,000 protesters marched to the Parliament. They
pushed down the legislature's main gate, but were forced out of its
grounds by troops and soldiers early Tuesday morning.
	   It was the biggest demonstration of its kind since a marathon
student sit-in at the Parliament helped force Habibie's autocratic
predecessor, Suharto, to step down after 1,200 people were killed
in a wave of riots four months ago.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that two students were
hospitalized with bayonet wounds to their abdomens and others were
treated for tear gas inhalation after Tuesday morning's
confrontation.
	   Maria Helena, a spokeswoman for nearby Atma Jaya Hospital, said
two students underwent emergency surgery, but she refused to give
details of their injuries. Three others were treated at the
hospital and later released, she said.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured by rocks and
bottles thrown by demonstrators.
	   Meanwhile, mobs returned to the streets for the second
consecutive day of rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority in a
small town in Central Java province.
	   Violence broke out in Kebumen, about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of Jakarta, Monday. Trouble flared again Tuesday with
arson attacks and looting of dozens of Chinese-owned shops.
	   Local police chief Col. Dedi S.K. said 112 people were arrested.
He said 49 shops, 23 cars and five motorcycles were damaged or set
afire.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only a small fraction of Indonesia's
population. However, they are active in commerce and industry and
have become scapegoats for Indonesia's economic problems, the worst
in 30 years.
	   Also on Tuesday thousands of students staged a peaceful rally
against rising prices in Indonesia's second biggest city, Surabaya,
about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Some students said they would protest again on Wednesday when
Habibie is scheduled to visit the city.
	   In Jakarta, Justice Minister Muladi urged the students ``to use
their wisdom and prevent the situation from getting worse.''
	   He defended the reform record of the Habibie government and said
it had done its best to improve Indonesia's situation during its
first 100 days in office.

Germany's unemployment rate dips slightly in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ The number of Germans without work
sank slightly from July to August, the Federal Labor Office said
Tuesday, signalling a fresh improvement in the job market ahead of
Sept. 27 elections.
	   The unemployment rate sank to 10.6 percent, or 4.10 million, in
August, from 10.7 percent a month earlier. The August rate compares
with 11.4 percent last year, a record high for that month.
	   Labor Office President Bernhard Jagoda said job-creation efforts
had resulted in a ``further light improvement.'' The unemployment
rate had risen slightly in July, but labor officials attributed
that increase solely to seasonal factors.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is trailing his Social Democratic
challenger Gerhard Schroeder in the polls, has taken credit for
what he calls a turnaround in the labor market.
	   Kohl has even predicted that the number of jobless will fall
below the psychologically significant barrier of 4 million this
fall. But some economists have cast doubt on his forecast.
	   The opposition Social Democrats say much of the improvement is
temporary, partly because of the government's make-work programs in
former communist East Germany.

Aviation official: chaos during airport opening not mere teething
</HEADLINE>
problems &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top aviation official told independent
investigators Tuesday the problems during the opening of Hong
Kong's new airport were caused by a complete failure of the
computer system, a news report said.
	   Richard Siegel, director of civil aviation, detailed computer
problems that partially shut down the flight information display
system, cargo handling and ramp handling operations, government
radio reported.
	   He rejected official versions of the troubles, which depicted
the breakdown as ``teething problems'' related to the opening of a
new airport, the report said.
	   The much-anticipated opening of the U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport
in early July became a costly fiasco as widespread computer
problems paralyzed both passenger and cargo services.
	   While passenger services were back to normal in days, the
troubles in cargo handling lasted to more than one month, and were
estimated to have cost the territory 0.35 percent of this year's
gross domestic product.
	   The two-member investigation team was appointed by the chief
executive in late July to find out what went wrong and who's
responsible for the problems.
	   Critics suspect government officials may have pressured the
airport authority for an early July opening to coincide with a
visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated the airport.
	   The investigation started Monday and is expected to last for 10
weeks.
	   The new Chek Lap Kok airport was built on reclaimed land off a
remote outlying island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Government workers and local residents
fought to strengthen the Bangladeshi capital's dam today, and
officials said all of Dhaka was in danger of being swamped by the
Sitalakhoia River.
	   More than half of the city of 9 million people was already under
knee- to waist-deep water after heavy monsoon rains.
	   Much of Bangladesh, a country the size of Wisconsin, has been
flooded since monsoon rains began July 10. The floods have killed
800 people and high water has displaced or marooned at least 30
million people.
	   Thousands of workers used cement and sandbags today to shore up
the dam six miles east of the capital. A minor breach occurred
Monday but was quickly filled up, said Rustom Ali, an engineer of
the water development board.
	   Elsewhere, at least 22 people were reported missing after a
rescue boat evacuating residents from a flooded village sank in a
river near Faridpur, 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Dhaka, an
official at the flood relief center in the capital said.
	   The situation worsened today in 31 of 47 flood-hit districts in
central and northern Bangladesh, with eight major rivers flowing
above danger levels, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said.
	   The Brahmaputra River breached its embankments in at least seven
places, inundating huge areas in the western Sirajganj district.
	   A Disaster and Relief Ministry official said the two months of
flooding had damaged more than 8,000 miles (12,900 kilometers) of
road and 5,000 bridges and culverts.

Memoir of Hong Kong's last colonial governor an instant hit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A book by Hong Kong's last colonial governor
about the territory's final years under British rule has become an
instant hit and is poised to become this year's bestseller, the
book's distributor said Tuesday.
	   With nearly 7,000 copies sold in one day, Chris Patten's should
surpass last year's blockbuster, a biography of the late Princess
Diana, which sold 10,000 copies, said Vivienne Wong of Publishers
Association.
	   ``East and West,'' Patten's much-anticipated account of his five
years as Hong Kong's governor, was out Monday.
	   ``Our initial order was for only 500 copies, but we've already
sold more than 100 since yesterday,'' said Owen Ngau of Page One
Books. ``At the moment it's the most popular book we have.''
	   Patten, who had a strained relationship with Chinese communist
leaders for much of his term here, wielded an acrid pen. A local
bookstore last month decided to cancel a book signing session,
saying it didn't agree with his strong criticism of Beijing.
	   Patten was also shunned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch's
publishing house Harper Collins, which dropped the book, allegedly
out of fear of upsetting Beijing.
	   In a recent interview with the Telegragh, Patten, 54, described
his memoir as ``just a critique of what happened,'' during his five
years in Hong Kong.
	   ``It wasn't going to be a kiss and tell, or a manifesto for my
return,'' he said.
	   ``I don't want my book to sound like a sermon, but I do feel
passionate about pushing democracy,'' Patten said.
	   Patten will be in Hong Kong to promote his book in October.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second air raid in first seven grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes twice attacked
suspected guerrilla hideouts Tuesday in southern Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the air attacks at
8:30 a.m. (0530GMT) and 11:00 a.m. (0800GMT).
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said in the first air raid two Israel jets each fired an
air-to-surface rocket on targets in the hills between the villages
of Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
	   Two jets returned to fire a rocket on Louweizeh 2 1/2 hours
later, the officials said.
	   In Israel, the army had said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud in the first air attack, scoring
``precise hits'' and returning safely to base.
	   Israel frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel's panhandle, but it wasn't
clear exactly why Tuesday's raids were carried out.
	   A Lebanese security official said the Israeli may have detected
guerrilla movements and decided to strike to prevent infiltration
into the Israeli-held territories.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.

Global worries keep dollar down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late dollar now down slightly in 4th graf;
changes overline to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ International crises usually buoy the U.S. dollar.
This time, worries about crumbling economies in Russia and Asia are
heightening fears about the fate of American global investments and
sending the dollar plunging.
	   ``There's a widespread sense that the U.S. dollar is in danger
so people are selling,'' said Masashi Ehara, a manager in the
foreign exchange section of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The dollar, often sought as a haven during times of turmoil, has
fallen about 15 yen over the last month from a closing in Tokyo as
high as 147.41 yen on Aug. 10.
	   The greenback cost 131.92 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo, down just
0.07 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. New York markets were closed
Monday for Labor Day. In London, the dollar dipped to 131.79 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said the downward dollar was likely to continue for the
next couple of weeks.
	   Interest in yen-buying also remains low. The dismal prospects
for the Japanese economy, dragged down in the worst recession in
five decades, continue to weigh down on the yen, dealers say.
	   But the deep-rooted anxiety that the Asian financial troubles
may spread to the United States was working in the other direction,
to push the dollar down.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average on the New York
Stock Exchange fell 41.97 to 7,640.25, down 411.43 for the week.
The decline left the Dow with a loss of 268 points, or 3.4 percent,
for the year. At the July peak, the Dow was up 18.1 percent for
1998.
	   Problems in Russia also herald trouble for the dollar.
	   The Russian parliament rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo and sending the ruble crashing. Dealers said such
economic woes are forcing U.S. players to sell the dollar for
profits to cover losses in Russia and other global trouble spots.
	   ``As long as the confusion continues in emerging markets, this
trend will not let up,'' said Tokai Bank dealer Shunji Tsuda,
adding that such uncertainties spanned from Malaysia to Latin
America. ``Sentiments are negative on the dollar, so people are
going along with that flow.''
	   The comment last Friday from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan suggesting that the American central bank is prepared to
lower interest rates to ward off a recession has also dampened
dollar-buying.
	   Lower interest rates boosts economic growth by making it easier
for businesses and consumers to borrow, but also tend to lower the
value of that nation's currency.
	   A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said he was not
worried about the dollar's nosedive.
	   ``The correction of the strong dollar-weak yen has just
started,'' Haruhiko Kuroda told the Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.
	   Most players, however, do not foresee a further comeback for the
yen unless share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange shoot up. That
appears unlikely given the economic slowdown. Parliament has been
deadlocked over banking reform bills to deal with the nation's
massive bad debt problem.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished Tuesday at 14,913.49
points, up 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent from Monday's close.

Russian ruble remains unstable, no rate set Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's interbank currency exchange failed to
provide a formal ruble rate against the U.S. dollar for the second
straight day on Tuesday, leaving the market without an agreed upon
level for the Russian currency.
	   However, street trading at currency exchange booths carried on
without interruption, with one U.S. dollar buying about 20 rubles.
	   The interbank currency exchange, known by its acronym as MICEX,
normally sets a rate in the morning which serves as a benchmark for
the day. But in the present turmoil, MICEX has failed to set a rate
on some days, adding to the uncertainty about the ruble's real
value.
	   Trading in rubles was canceled on the exchange Monday because
there were no offers to sell dollars, and no transactions were
expected to be completed Tuesday.
	   The ruble was trading at about 6.2 to the dollar when the crisis
hit last month. Since then people have scrambled to get their money
out of the banks and prices have soared.
	   This week has provided only more bad news. On Monday, the
Central Bank chief offered to resign and the Communist-led
parliament once again rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin, President Boris
Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister.
	   Many Russians who receive their salaries in fast-devaluing
rubles are stocking up on household items, clothing and basic
foodstuffs which are sometimes sold at pre-crisis prices.
	   Automatic banking machines have stopped operating in Moscow and
elsewhere, and many businesses have stopped honoring credit cards,
making it difficult for some people to obtain cash or make
payments.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government downgraded its assessment
of the economy Tuesday and the head of the country's chief economic
agency warned Japan stands at the brink of entering a dangerous
deflationary spiral.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, the director-general of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, said that while the economy has not yet fallen
into a deflationary spiral in which prices sink lower and lower,
``we are at the entrance of one.''
	   ``We must take actions to prevent the economy from being sucked
in,'' he said at a regularly scheduled press conference.
	   Sakaiya's remarks followed the release of the Economic Planning
Agency's latest monthly report on the economy, which used the term
``very severe'' to describe the current situation _ stronger
language than the agency has used in the past.
	   The report cited a deterioration in key areas of the economy,
noting sluggish housing starts and rising unemployment.
	   EPA chief Sakaiya said the Japanese economy could enter an
``extremely dangerous'' phase should the economic situation outside
of Japan continue to worsen. But he added that Japan's hefty trade
surplus and government stimulus spending will likely offset the
negative impact of the global economy's woes.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Major Japanese companies will post an average 15
percent fall in parent pretax profit this fiscal year due to
stagnant domestic demand and the Asian economic crisis, a private
think tank said Tuesday.
	   The Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd.'s assessment was
considerably bleaker than its previous prediction of an average 8
percent decline for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   Profits are being battered as both households and companies cut
back on spending because of Japan's severe credit crunch and the
negative effects of asset deflation, Daiwa said.
	   The think tank, which is a research arm of Daiwa Securities Co.,
also said the government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 112 billion)
stimulus plan was unlikely to lead to an immediate recovery in
domestic demand.
	   Corporate profits will be further eroded by the economic woes of
Southeast Asian countries, which will limit exports to the region,
Daiwa said.
	   Daiwa had a brighter projection for the fiscal year ending March
31, 2000, saying corporate pretax profits are expected to rise 11
percent, the first increase in three years.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of financial giant Travelers Group Inc.
said Tuesday that his company hopes to expand its presence in Japan
just three months after buying a quarter of the third-largest
Japanese brokerage house.
	   Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive officer of New
York-based Travelers Group, said he sees great potential from
business generated by tapping into the huge pool of funds
accumulated by thrifty Japanese savers.
	   Speaking at a symposium in Tokyo, Weill said his firm is
``looking to invest in other financial companies in the Japanese
market.''
	   He also said Travelers remains bullish on the long-term
prospects for Japan's economy, noting that many other countries
have also been hurt recently by economic troubles.
	   ``With all these economies imploding, it is giving Japan another
chance to be a leader in the world economy,'' Weill said.
	   In June, Travelers Group Inc. placed a dlrs 1.6 billion bet on
Japan's financial future by becoming the biggest shareholder of
Nikko Securities Co. That came on the heels of Travelers Group's
announcement of a planned merger with Citicorp to create the
world's largest financial services company.
	   Travelers, like many other big American financial powerhouses
such as Merrill Lynch and Co., hopes to win a share of the
estimated dlrs 9 trillion in personal financial assets owned by
Japanese savers and investors.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two mid-ranking banks announced plans
Tuesday to merge to create one of the largest commercial banks in
South Korea.
	   Hana Bank and Boram Bank, the nation's 11th and 13th largest
banks, signed a letter of intent to merge effective Jan. 4. It will
create the nation's 7th largest bank with combined assets of 41.1
billion won (dlrs 29.4 billion).
	   It will be the second merger of Korean commercial banks this
year. In July, Hanil Bank and the Commercial Bank of Korea
announced plans to merge, also effective Jan. 4.
	   Experts said the Hana-Boram merger would have a positive effect
on the banking system, because both are relatively healthy banks.
They said the first merger in July was between relatively weak
banks.
	   ``It is a good sign that two relatively healthy banks are
merging. It will stimulate reforms in other banks,'' said Woo
Jong-taek, an analyst at Daishin Securities Co.
	   The latest merger is expected to further encourage the
government's ongoing efforts to restructure the nation's
debt-ridden banking industry.
	   ___
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Asian contagion and commodity
price falloffs will push the New Zealand economy into deficit over
the next two years, after earlier forecasts predicted continuing
growth and solid surpluses, the government said Tuesday.
	   The latest forecasts point to a bleak short-term outlook for a
weakened economy, as the deficit and unemployment rate rise. But
they also foreshadow a return to growth within a year.
	   Releasing the new projections, Finance Minister Bill Birch
confirmed the economy is in recession and will shrink by half a
percent in the current financial year, down from the projected
growth rate of 2.9 percent.
	   While the economy is projected to contract this year, ending
June 30, 1990, it would bounce back to 2.9 percent growth in
1999/00 and 4 percent in 2000/01.
	   Birch said this would occur because the lower value of the
currency would increase New Zealand's competitiveness.
	   Unemployment, currently at 7.7 percent, is expected to continue
rising and peak at 8.5 percent by early next year.
	   After five years of budget surplus, Birch is now projecting a
deficit of New Zealand dollars 700 million (U.S. dlrs 351 million)
instead of a New Zealand 2 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion) surplus
next year.
	   The New Zealand dollars 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.5 billion)
surplus projected for 2000/01 has become a New Zealand dollars 300
(U.S. dlrs 150 million) deficit.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices climbed Tuesday on the
back of government measures to clamp down on market speculators.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 112.49 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 8,189.25. On
Monday, the index had surged 7.9 percent after the government
announced steps to restore stability to Hong Kong's financial
markets.
	   The measures were aimed at protecting Hong Kong's currency peg
to the U.S. dollar by quashing illegal short selling activities and
boosting liquidity in the banking sector.
	   Investors who sell short in both the stock and currency markets
in attempts to drive up interest rates and depress stock prices at
the same time have been blamed for creating chaos in the financial
system.
	   The government's anti-speculation measures have provided good
sentiment for the market, at least for the short term, said Tony
Yung, research director with Tai Fook Securities Ltd.
	   Turnover amounted to 8.43 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.0 billion), down from Monday's 9.76 billion Hong Kong dollars

Low-key Lindsay in Open quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For someone ranked third in the world and seeded
second in the U.S. Open, Lindsay Davenport is keeping a low
profile.
	   No beads bouncing all over the place. No headbands holding her
hair. Just low-key Lindsay, winning her way into the quarterfinals,
where she'll meet Amanda Coetzer..
	   ``I like being the quiet underdog, knowing I can go about my
business,'' Davenport said after defeating Nathalie Tauziat 6-1,
6-4 on Monday. ``I'm always still in the second week these days.''
	   The underdog image fits because despite her fancy ranking and
seeding, Davenport has never won a Grand Slam event. Her best
performance on tennis' main stage were three straight semifinals _
at last year's Open and the Australian and French this season.
	   She seemed to take a step back when she lost in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon, beaten by Tauziat. That made Monday
night's victory over the French player that much sweeter.
	   ``I guess so,'' Davenport said. ``I wasn't happy when I lost to
her at Wimbledon.''
	   She also wasn't surprised. It was her second loss in 10 matches
against Tauziat, both times on the grass of the All England Club.
Hardcourts like the ones at Flushing Meadows are more suited to
Davenport's game.
	   ``She is definitely more comfortable on the grass than I am,''
Davenport said. `I love playing on the hardcourts. I'm definitely
more comfortable on them. You get a higher bounce when helps me. I
don't have to bend as much as on the grass. I can get her serve
back a little easier on the hardcourt. ''
	   Still, Davenport played cautiously.
	   ``I felt like I'm playing well,'' she said. ``I didn't want to
be in any danger out there.''
	   And there were moments when she might have been. Tauziat, who
went on to the finals after beating Davenport at Wimbledon, was
down 3-1 in the second set and drew even.
	   ``When she starts serving well, you have to really concentrate
to hold your serve,'' Davenport said. ``A couple of times I think I
was down a lot of break points and only got broken once, which is
great.''
	   Davenport arrived at the Open as the hottest player on the tour.
She swept three consecutive hardcourt tournaments in California and
had a 14-match winning streak before losing to Steffi Graf in the
semifinals of the Open warmup at New Haven.
	   ``I'm playing well, concentrating very well,'' Davenport said.
``I'm taking advantage of the opportiniuties that were given to
me.''
	   She is in the best shape of her life and equipped with a new
mindset.
	   ``I'm a much better competitor now than I've ever been,'' she
said. ``Mentally, I'm getting stronger and physically, I'm getting
stronger. You know, I think I want it just as bad as everybody else
does now.''
	   The surface suits her and her game is flourishing. It's a good
combination for low-key Lindsay, playing in the second week again..

Taiwan appoints roving ambassadors against Chinese blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking ways around China's diplomatic
embargo, Taiwan appointed a trio of ambassadors-at-large Tuesday to
press ``special needs'' on behalf of its hamstrung Foreign
Ministry.
	   Banker Jeffrey Koo, scholar Chiu Hung-tah, and former ambassador
to South Africa Lu I-cheng have been appointed to represent Taiwan
as special envoys, particularly to countries that do not have
official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   Koo is also Taiwan's representative to several regional trade
organizations.
	   ``Under special situations we have special needs that require
measures to buttress and strengthen our official diplomacy,''
ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference.
	   Taiwan frequently relies on alternative or unofficial diplomatic
channels because just 27 countries recognize the island, and most
nations severely limit their contacts with senior Taiwanese
officials.
	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province with no right to
diplomatic recognition. It refuses to recognize countries that
maintain formal relations with Taiwan, and severely chastises
allies who accept visits from Taiwanese officials.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 54 million to help refugees in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ United Nations agencies appealed Tuesday for dlrs
54 million to help refugees fleeing fighting in Kosovo.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other U.N. relief
agencies say more than 400,000 people are expected to need help
through the winter and into next spring.
	   Sub-zero temperatures are expected to take hold in the region in
October and continue until March or April, the agencies say.
	   They have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in the province
unless the international community does more to aid refugees and to
help bring about an immediate end to hostilities followed by a
political settlement.
	   ``Unless appropriate humanitarian assistance is quickly
provided, the sufferings of war will quickly be compounded by cold,
hunger, disease and continued social deprivation,'' said a report
about the appeal.
	   UNHCR, the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Relief and
other agencies appealed in June for some dlrs 18 million to meet
the immediate needs of an estimated 265,000 Kosovo civilians,
mostly Albanians, who are fleeing fighting in the province.
	   The money, of which UNHCR's share is around dlrs 13 million, is
needed to buy materials to provide shelter and other aid.
	   But they say governments had only contributed dlrs 9.6 million,
just over half the target, by late August.
	   The latest bid for cash supersedes the June appeal and should
sustain humanitarian operations until next spring, the agencies
say.

Ukraine's president voices support for Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
criticized Russia's parliament Tuesday for refusing to confirm
President Boris Yeltsin's nominee for prime minister.
	   He said parliament's lower house, the State Duma, was ``aiming
against'' Yeltsin by refusing to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kuchma spoke in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, where he arrived
Monday to participate in an international conference organized by
the country's president, Geidar Aliev.
	   Russian lawmakers overwhelmingly turned down Chernomyrdin for a
second time Monday.
	   Kuchma said that any other candidate for the prime minister post
would be viewed by the Duma as a means of obstructing Yeltsin's
policies.
	   ``The course projected by the president is of primary
importance, and the Cabinet is to implement this course,'' Kuchma
said, according to Interfax.

Record overseas entries posted for Australia's top race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian horse of the year Might
And Power is top weight for the Caulfield and Melbourne Cup races
after connections of European horse Swain failed to pay up when
first acceptances were taken for the country's premiere events
Tuesday.
	   Might and Power has been given 60.5 kilograms (133 pounds) to
defend the races he won in 1997 and has been entered mainly as a
precaution with the Cox Plate-Japan Cup double his aim.
	   A total of 143 horses are left in the Caulfield Cup, including
four overseas entries, while 164 declarations were received for the
Melbourne Cup on Nov. 3 with a record 21 northern hemisphere horses
still in Australia's top staying event.
	   Lee Benton, Racing Victoria's general manager of racing, said
the number of foreign entries underscored the impact Australian
racing was having on the rest of the world.
	   ``It's very pleasing to think that the leading stables are
standing up and taking notice of the racing over here and further
internationalizing the event,'' Benton said.
	   ``We probably thought we would have between 15 and 20 horses
still in the Melbourne Cup.''
	   The previous record first declarations from overseas at the
first stage was 14.
	   ``There are already three horses in quarantine for the Caulfield
Cup _ Faithful Son, Persian Punch and Taufan's Melody.''
	   Benton said he thought Malcolm Thwaites would send two horses
from Malaysia for the Melbourne Cup and two others would probably
arrive from Europe. (djp)

Police break up demonstration by Cambodian opposition

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police swinging batons, bamboo
rods and rifle butts drove opposition supporters from a protest
camp in front of the National Assembly on Tuesday. Scattered
demonstrators battled with security forces in the streets, throwing
stones and setting fires.
	   The surge of riot police through makeshift shelters broke up a
two-week protest against alleged fraud in Cambodia's July 26
national election. The crowd, which at times numbered 5,000, had
called for the resignation of Cambodian strongman Hun Sen.
	   The protestors were trapped for several minutes between lines of
police pushing up from the south and a water cannon directed at
them from the north. Police plowed through the camp, smashing
shelters and pounding women and children with their weapons.
	   An APTV cameraman saw a soldier swing the butt of his rifle at a
woman in her mid 60s, shattering her elbow. Another woman was
smashed in the mouth with a baton.
	   A third elderly woman was hit so hard with a rifle butt that
what appeared to be a piece of the gun went flying loose. She
crumpled to the ground, then picked herself up and ran.
	   No arrests were witnessed.
	   The breakup of the protest followed an ultimatum by Hun Sen
ordering them to leave the site by midnight Monday or he would use
force to evict them. The order came after grenades were tossed into
his Phnom Penh home. He was not at home, and no one was injured in
the blast.
	   About 10 minutes after the police swarmed into the camp, the
crowd managed to flee on streets running north, slowly pursued by
police and troops firing hundreds of shots from automatic rifles
into the air.
	   As they were being pushed back, the demonstrators staged hit and
run battles with the security forces, regrouping to throwing stones
and loose objects at them. They set several piles of rubbish on
fire.
	   Almost all shops and public places in he capital were closed.
	   Other groups of demonstrators on hundreds of motorcycles cruised
streets near the railway station, staging rock throwing brawls when
stopped at a police checkout.
	   The motorcycle taxis, whose drivers are a core of opposition
support, roared through the streets, snarling traffic and beeping
horns to the rhythm of the name of the politician who has lead the
protests: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack, ordering his arrest.
The opposition leader spent the night at the offices of the United
Nations representative in Cambodia in a luxury Phnom Penh hotel
surrounded by police.
	   Political tensions in Cambodia had apparently eased slightly
late Monday, with the government backing off its plan to arrest Sam
Rainsy and rescinding the deadline for the protests to end.
	   The move came after soldiers trying to disperse protestors had
fired thousands of rounds into the air, killing one man and
injuring several others.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official who negotiated the
stand-down had said efforts would be made to peacefully end the
confrontations Tuesday.
	   Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel.
He looked weary and nervous.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a meeting.
	   Afterwards, they returned to the U.N. offices. The ambassadors
of the United States, France, Canada, Australia, Japan and
Singapore consulted with the U.N. representative. The contents of
the talks were not immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically closemouthed with the media,
responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had been
frightened and was now relieved.

Former Boston-area resident in first Lithuanian war crimes trial

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Day after day for three years, Jews
were hauled out of Vilnius' ghetto, marched down a cobblestone road
to a forest, stripped naked and shot dead by Nazis. Aleksandras
Lileikis was head of the city's security police then.
	   Those facts are not in doubt. Whether they are connected has
been disputed for years. On Wednesday, a Lithuanian court is to
begin hearing the arguments when it opens the first Nazi war crimes
trial in the former Soviet Union.
	   Lileikis lived in the United States for 40 years after the war
and worked for a Boston-area Lithuanian publishing house. He
returned to Lithuania in 1995 as the United States was moving to
revoke his citizenship.
	   He is charged with genocide _ with a potential life sentence _
for allegedly taking part in one of World War II's most grisly and
concerted execution campaigns: an estimated 70,000 victims.
	   The killings, during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation, wiped out one
of Europe's liveliest Jewish communities, renowned for its culture
and scholarship and earning Vilnius the nickname ``Jerusalem of the
North.''
	   Today, only a few traces remain: some faded Hebrew letters on a
back-alley wall, a single remaining synagogue. About 90 percent of
Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of 240,000 was killed during
the war.
	   Basing their case on documents that came to light only after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, prosecutors say Lileikis
personally ordered scores of Vilnius Jews arrested and handed over
to a Nazi squad that slaughtered them amid the tall pines of the
Paneriai forest.
	   The United States, when it began the move to strip Lileikis of
his citizenship for lying about his past when he emigrated, said
the documents form a ``shockingly complete paper trail.''
	   Lileikis' attorneys are expected to argue that the documents
could have been forged, that he never pulled a trigger himself,
never commanded an execution squad and, even if he did turn over
Jews to the Nazis, didn't necessarily know that meant sending them
to near-certain death.
	   That's impossible, according to Svetlana Shatalova, a researcher
at Vilnius' Jewish Museum. Within months of the Nazi occupation,
virtually everyone in Vilnius knew of the executions, she said.
	   ``If he was handing over Jews and they were being taken away,
what did he think?,'' Shatalova said in a recent interview. ``He
knew very well they weren't being taken away for a picnic.''
	   Edvard Jankovski, who grew up at the edge of the blood-drenched
forest, knew what went on there. A half-century later, the memory
distresses him so much that he pulls at his shirt and stares at his
hands when he tells it.
	   ``We could hear them shooting people at the front of the line
while hordes of people at the back were still filing in,'' said
Jankovski, 63. ``It was horrible.''
	   Jankovski cannot forget, but many Lithuanians say there's no
point to remembering.
	   ``I think its absolutely wrong what they are doing to
Lileikis,'' said 62-year-old Stanislava Jevseyeva, selling flowers
on a Vilnius street corner ``If they put him on trial, what about
all the Soviets who killed and deported people?''
	   ``Theyre afraid that if Lileikis is found guilty, then Lithuania
itself will be seen as guilty by the world,'' said Shatalova, the
Jewish Museum researcher. ``So the reasoning is, well, then we have
no choice but to defend Lileikis.''
	   Some Jewish groups overseas denounce Lithuania as a country
unwilling to face its past. Although returned to Lithuania in 1995,
it was only this year that he was formally charged and his trial
has been postponed several times.
	   The delays, Jewish groups say, show that authorities hope the
91-year-old Lileikis will die before testimony can begin.
	   Even if the trial opens on schedule, it's doubtful whether
Lileikis will appear: his attorneys claim he is bedridden by a
stroke. Guards at Lileikis' downtown apartment building refused to
allow a reporter access to him.
	   President Valdas Adamkus says holding the trial is critically
important to Lithuania.
	   ``We have to show the world that we are not justifying these
crimes and that we will have nothing to do with people who
committed them,'' he said in an interview. ``However painful these
issues are, we have to deal with them.''
	   That position was echoed by Violeta Palcinskaite, a guide at the
Jewish Museum.
	   ``You can't have a future with vengeance in your heart,'' she
said. ``But you also can't have a future if you don't come to terms
with your past.''

Romanian mother, upset at daughter's marriage, kidnaps her
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Talk about parents who can't let their
children go.
	   Outraged at her daughter's decision to marry a man almost twice
her age, a Romanian woman hired five armed men to bring the
teen-age bride back home, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Three weeks ago, 19-year-old Nicoleta Chirimbu wed Nicusor
Nicolae, 37, against her parents' will. Nicolae is a small-time
politician and leader of revolutionaries who fought to bring down
communism in 1989.
	   But his revolutionary activity was no match for his
mother-in-law's wrath.
	   After repeatedly threatening that she would kill herself and her
daughter, Elena Chirimbu paid dlrs 3,000 to five men to bring her
daughter home by hook or by crook, the daily Liberatea reported.
	   At the crack of dawn Sunday, the men burst into Nicolae's small
house in the south of Bucharest and dragged the young bride from
her bed. The men threatened Nicolae with swords and at least one
gun, he told the paper.
	   Her mother was waiting downstairs in a car. They immediately
made off for their hometown of Navodari, some 225 kilometers (140
miles) east of Bucharest. Nicolae alerted police, who located his
wife at her parents' home.
	   ``I tried to convince my mother that I love my husband but she
did not understand. She has terrorized me ever since I was a kid,''
Nicoleta was quoted as saying.
	   She filed an official complaint against her mother and the five
kidnappers Monday. But Chirimbu defended her actions, claiming
Nicolae ``treated his wife badly.''
	   The battle isn't over. Chirimbu is now trying to get medical
proof that her daughter is not responsible for her actions, which
would be grounds to annul the marriage.

U.S. criticizes Japan as laggard in trade liberalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A United States trade official on
Tuesday accused Japan of holding up a new trade liberalization plan
for the Asia-Pacific region.
	   The sharp criticism of Japan came from the head of a U.S.
delegation to a meeting in Malaysia of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation members about trade issues related to small and
medium-sized businesses.
	   ``They are really standing in the way of a substantial package
of liberalization measures and this would be very unfortunate for
APEC,'' David L. Aaron, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for
international trade, said of Japan.
	   ``They are sending the wrong signal at this time of crisis,''
Aaron told the AP. ``We are hopeful that the new Japanese
government will take a more positive approach. Up until now,
everyone was very united, except Japan.''
	   During an APEC trade meeting in June, Japanese trade officials
balked at a plan to immediately liberalize trade in nine key
industries.
	   The free-trade process would gradually lift tariffs and other
trade barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an agreement reached at last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and
expected to be ready for final signatures by the APEC gathering of
world leaders in Kuala Lumpur in November.
	   Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz said most of the 18 APEC
members were on board.
	   ``All of us believe the current turmoil isn't an excuse for not
going forward with trade liberalization,'' she said.
	   The early liberalization plan would eliminate tariffs in all
nine sectors by 2005, with tariffs on toys lifted as early as 2000.
Developing APEC nations would have more time to ease tariffs so as
not to adversely affect their smaller economies.
	   Western countries are at the forefront in pushing for market
liberalization, saying that it's an important means to rescue
Pacific-Rim economies from their current economic slump.
	   They want specific dates for liberalization measures and tariff
reductions in the targeted nine industries, which account for about
$1.5 trillion in global trade.
	   During the meeting in June, senior delegates said Japan was
trying to opt out of specific tariff reductions in the fisheries
and forestry sectors.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru are scheduled for admission
in November.
	   Aaron, the U.S. trade official, is also leading an American
trade mission to identify business opportunities in Malaysia's
hi-tech sector.
	   One-fifth of Malaysia's trade is with the United States, while
new U.S. investments in the Southeast Asian country totals dlrs 600
million.
	   Aaron said U.S. businesses have expressed concern over the
sweeping currency controls announced last week in Malaysia which
effectively fix the local currency, the ringgit, at 3.80 to the
U.S. dollar.
	   ``If you fix the exchange rate at a certain rate, that makes it
unprofitable for companies to do business,'' he said.

Japan downgrades economy as top official warns of deflationary
</HEADLINE>
spiral
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with remarks from economic agency head; ADDS
trade surplus figures in 7th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government downgraded its assessment of the
economy Tuesday and the head of the country's chief economic agency
warned Japan stands at the brink of a dangerous deflationary
spiral.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, the director-general of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, said that while the economy has not yet fallen
into a deflationary spiral in which prices sink lower and lower,
``we are at the entrance of one.''
	   ``We must take actions to prevent the economy from being sucked
in,'' he told reporters.
	   Sakaiya's remarks followed the release of the Economic Planning
Agency's latest monthly report on the economy, which used the term
``very severe'' to describe the current situation _ stronger
language than the agency has used in the past.
	   The report cited a deterioration in key areas of the economy,
noting sluggish housing starts and rising unemployment.
	   EPA chief Sakaiya said the Japanese economy could enter an
``extremely dangerous'' phase should the economic situation outside
of Japan continue to worsen. But he added that Japan's hefty trade
surplus and government stimulus spending will likely offset the
negative impact of the global economy's woes.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Finance Ministry said Japan's merchandise
trade surplus rose 63 percent on the year to 367 billion yen (dlrs
2.78 billion) in the first 20 days of August. Exports increased 3.7
percent while imports fell 2.6 percent.
	   Japan entered a full-fledged recession in the first quarter of
this year, but the government has been reluctant to acknowledge
that the economy has veered off the path of recovery until very
recently.

More than 100 arrested after two days of rioting in Central Java
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs returned to the streets of a town
in Central Java province for second consecutive day of looting and
arson Tuesday, police and residents said.
	   Violence broke out Monday in Kebumen, about 350 kilometers (218
miles) southeast of Jakarta. Trouble flared again Tuesday with
attacks against dozens of Chinese-owned shops.
	   Local police chief Col. Dedi S.K. said 112 people were arrested
He said 49 shops, 23 cars and five motorcycles were damaged or set
afire.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only a small fraction of Indonesia's
population. However, they are active in commerce and industry and
have become scapegoats for Indonesia's economic problems, the worst
in 30 years.
	   Dedi said three people were reported injured: a police officer
and two fire fighters who were pelted with stones by rioters.
	   Dedi said the situation in the town was under control late
Tuesday.
	   However, some residents contacted by The Associated Press
reported sporadic looting. Mobs were breaking into shops that had
been shut by frightened owners.
	   ``Some people including children looted shops near my house.
Another tried to set fire to a shop,'' said one woman, who
identified herself by the single name, Rianti.
	   The trouble broke out Monday after a fight between a local man
and an ethnic Chinese shopkeeper.
	   The rioting in Kebumen is the latest in a series to hit
crisis-ridden Indonesia recently.
	   Last week two people were killed and 12 were injured when riots
erupted in Lhokseumawe on the northern tip of Sumatra island, an
area that endured years of repression by Indonesia's military
following a separatist uprising in the late 1980s.
	   Those riots came after a major pullout by the army, but the mobs
soon turned on members of the ethnic Chinese minority.
	   In Jakarta on Tuesday security personnel clashed with students
outside the Parliament after several thousand protests demanded
that President B.J. Habibie resign.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian actor who fell into the orchestra pit
during a performance has given new meaning to the phrase, ``the
show must go on.''
	   The unidentified actor in in the southeastern town of Khabarovsk
broke both arms during the fall, which occurred as he performed a
stunt, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But neither the fall, nor the broken arms, deterred him. He
continued to act out his role until the end of the play, and the
audience was unaware of his injuries, the report said.
	   Many spectators simply thought the fall was merely
improvisation, Interfax said.

Paul Merson leaves 'Boro for Villa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England midfielder Paul Merson joined
Aston Villa on Tuesday in a 6.75-million-pound (dlrs 10.8 million)
transfer from Middlesbrough.
	   The 30-year-old former Arsenal star became Villa's second
biggest transfer signing after Stan Collymore, who cost 7 million
pounds (dlrs 11.2 million) from Liverpool.
	   Merson is expected to make his debut for Villa in Wednesday
night's home match against Newcastle. He will wear the No. 10 shirt
that was vacated by Dwight Yorke after his move to Manchester
United.
	   Merson helped guide Middlebrough from the first division back to
the Premier League. But he became disenchanted with Bryan Robson's
club and reportedly had a falling out with teammate Paul Gascoigne.
	   In 1994, Merson spent six weeks in a rehabilitation clinic after
admitting being addicted to alcohol, gambling and drugs.
	   He was a member of England's World Cup squad in France, coming
on as a substitute in the second-round penalty shootout defeat to
Argentina.

China demands Vietnam remove troops from area near disputed reefs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China accused Vietnam on Tuesday of occupying a
pair of submerged reefs near the disputed Spratly islands and
demanded that Hanoi immediately withdraw troops in the area.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao reiterated what China
calls an indisputable and ancient claim to sovereignty over the
South China Sea islands and nearby reefs. By its ``recent''
occupation of the two submerged reefs, Vietnam was ``seriously
endangering China's territorial sovereignty,'' Zhu said.
	   ``The Chinese side has made solemn representations to the
Vietnamese side, strongly demanding the Vietnamese side immediately
withdraw from the Chinese reefs it has illegally seized, dismantle
all the installations illegally built and guarantee no similar acts
of seizure occur in the future,'' Zhu said at a regularly scheduled
media briefing.
	   The dispute _ unconfirmed so far by the Vietnamese government _
is the latest in a series of frequent territorial clashes between
the communist neighbors who fought a bloody border war in 1979.
Their navies skirmished over territorial rights to the Spratlys in
1988.
	   The islands are believed to lie atop potentially valuable oil,
gas and mineral deposits. But claims of whole or partial
sovereignty by six governments _ including Brunei, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Taiwan _ have prevented thorough exploration.
	   Despite improving relations and a commitment three years ago to
map out their disputed land and sea borders, China and Vietnam have
repeatedly tested each other's resolve. China has continually sent
oil-prospecting and scientific vessels into disputed sections of
the South China Sea, with the latest such incidence occurring in
May.
	   Although border traffic has recovered from a decade of tensions
following the 1979 war, the two governments traded accusations this
year over a dike and jetty built along a border river.

Taiwan war games to be largest in recent years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Ground troops, ships, helicopters and
armor will be mobilized for war games next month in Taiwan's
largest display of military might in years, the Defense Ministry
said Tuesday.
	   The live firing exercises, first announced last week, will
demonstrate the military's progress in upgrading armaments and
tactics, the ministry said.
	   The Oct. 12 exercises will be the first combined forces trials
to feature new French Mirage 2000-5 and U.S. F-16 fighters in major
roles. Recently obtained French Lafayette and other U.S. and
homemade missile frigates, U.S. M60A3 tanks, and an upgraded
missile arsenal will also participate.
	   Altogether, 3,000 ground soldiers, 128 armored vehicles, 29
naval vessels, and 89 helicopters of various types will take part
in the exercises, said Tu Lung-sheng, chief of the ministry's
Department of Joint Operations.
	   ``This is a good time to display to the people of our country
the coming together of training with new armaments,'' Tu told a
news conference.
	   Tu acknowledged the closeness of the war games' timing to a
watershed visit by Taiwan's top negotiator to China, but denied
Taiwan intended to convey a message of defiance to Beijing.
	   Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation will
visit China Oct. 12-18 for contacts that Taiwan hopes will steer
long-stalled talks between the sides back on track.
	   Exercises by the armed forces of Taiwan and China have been
closely watched since China staged war games in 1995-1996 aimed at
intimidating Taiwan independence supporters.
	   China has considered Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunited
with by force if necessary since the two sides divided politically
in 1949.

Kidnapped American's ordeal: Daylong marches, sleepless nights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS throughout with new details.
 &UR; AP Photo BOG101 of Sept. 7 &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ After trudging through Colombia's rugged
mountains for months as a captive of leftist guerrillas, Donald Lee
Cary took great pleasure in sinking into his living room couch and
counting his blessings.
	   But the retired Exxon executive can hardly rest easy.
	   Freed Sunday by his rebel captors, the Lubbock, Texas, native
must now decide whether to remain in his wife's homeland and sell
their dairy farm outside Bogota where he was kidnapped March 21.
	   ``I've got all kinds of bills to pay,'' he replied when asked
his immediate plans. ``An awful lot of loose ends.''
	   Cary refused to discuss the ransom paid for his release. But he
did allow that he had no kidnapping insurance _ a security blanket
possessed by most foreign executives working here.
	   Cary, 64, looked fit and relaxed during an interview Monday at
his Bogota apartment. He still wore the gray beard he grew in
captivity and was 2 inches (5 centimeters) trimmer at the waist.
	   All the walking and a steady diet of ``guerrilla soup'' _ pasta
and rice in broth _ saw to that.
	   The only injuries Cary suffered during his 170-day ordeal were a
possibly fractured rib, shoulder and vertebra from when he fell in
a mountain gorge in May.
	   There was plenty of tension, however.
	   Some nights, Cary's fitful sleep was interrupted by the
frightening whoosh of mortar shells soaring overhead and by
warplanes strafing suspected guerrilla positions.
	   After a three-hour walk from his last rebel encampment, Cary was
handed to the Red Cross near Medina, 40 miles (64 kilometers)
southeast of Bogota.
	   For a time, he was held with four American birdwatchers
kidnapped two days after his capture. Three of them were freed less
than a month later; one escaped earlier.
	   Life on the trail was grueling, uncomfortable and tedious: Cary
said he was constantly on the move during one 28-day stretch,
spending the night in 26 different places.
	   He had to wash his own clothes and eating utensils, set up his
own tent.
	   But his captors from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, always treated him with respect.
	   ``I was never mistreated in any way, neither physically nor
psychologically nor verbally,'' Cary said. Kidnapping is a prime
revenue source for the FARC, Colombia's oldest and largest rebel
group.
	   Cary discussed with his captors the big push by Colombia's new
president, Andres Pastrana, to try to make peace with the
guerrillas, who have been fighting the state for nearly four
decades.
	   Rebel commanders were ``extraordinarily cautious,'' though,
about accepting Pastrana's overtures, Cary said. They told him they
want to take power through elections but are afraid of being
assassinated, as has happened with some 3,000 former rebels from
other movements who demobilized over the past decade and entered
politics.
	   Cary said he also gained insight into the guerrilla struggle and
how it is largely represented by poor peasants.
	   ``A lot of these people come from families where they've been
mistreated as children,'' he said, so they run away and never get
much of an education. A few rebels were so ignorant, Cary said,
that they asked him if the United States and Colombia share a
border.
	   Cary's abduction was common in a country with the world's
highest kidnapping rate. He was snatched by three gunmen as he left
his farm at dusk on a Saturday, and driven in his own car through
Bogota.
	   As they were leaving the capital, the gunmen identified
themselves as from the FARC's 53rd Front and Cary knew he would be
away for some time from his wife Lucia, who has been bedridden for
more than two years with multiple sclerosis.
	   With Cary's release, at least eight foreigners remain captive in
Colombia: American Donald W. Riedel, who was seized Feb. 24, 1997,
two Germans, a Frenchman, a Chilean, an Italian, a Canadian and an
Ecuadoran, according to the government.

Missile or satellite? China says no word from North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite claims of close, longstanding friendship,
China still does not know whether communist neighbor North Korea
launched a missile or a satellite last month.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday that China
received no prior notice about the rocket-launching on Aug. 31. He
added that China has no independent confirmation to back up a
report from North Korea's state-run news agency last Friday
claiming the country launched a satellite.
	   ``We didn't get any prior notice,'' Zhu said at a twice weekly
media briefing. ``We only have the report from KCNA.''
	   The launching made North Korea's wary neighbors, South Korea and
Japan, more uneasy. Although Japanese officials, citing U.S.
sources, initially said the rocket was a two-stage ballistic
missile, they have since suggested North Korea may have succeeded
in placing a satellite in orbit.
	   North Korea's state-run media reported the satellite-launching
as a display of technical might and revolutionary zeal to glorify
late leader Kim Il Sung and his successor son, Kim Jong Il.
	   Meeting for the first time since the elder Kim's death four
years ago, North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly on Saturday left
vacant the state presidency he held, but named his son ultimate
state leader as head of the National Defense Commission.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu hinted Tuesday that Kim
Jong Il might visit China on his first foreign trip since his
father's death.
	   ``There is a tradition, like calling on relatives, between the
leaders of China and Korea. We hope that that tradition will
continue,'' Zhu said in response to a reporter's question about the
long-rumored visit.
	   Although relations between the two allies in the Korean War have
strained in recent years, China has made efforts to court Kim.
	   Chinese President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin sent
Kim a congratulatory telegram right after his election. Jiang's
heir apparent, Vice President Hu Jintao, attended a banquet Monday
night in Beijing to commemorate the 50th anniversary of North
Korea's establishment.
	   ``We believe China and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea's friendship and cooperation will see further consolidation
and development,'' Zhu said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters returned to
Indonesia's Parliament on Tuesday after security forces used
batons, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds in a pre-dawn clash.
	   Violence also flared for a second day in a riot-torn town in the
center of the main island, Java, police said.
	   About 200 students staged peaceful sit-in protest on a road
about 100 meters (yards) from the main gate of the Parliament on
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Several hundred riot police stood guard over the gathering as
the students sang patriotic songs, chanted anti-government slogans
and called on President B.J. Habibie to resign.
	   The group later marched back to a nearby college campus after
police made repeated requests to disperse.
	   Witnesses said hundreds of other students were stopped at
military roadblocks on major roads leading to the legislative
complex.
	   However, some protesters got past the security cordon on foot.
More jumped out of vehicles that stopped on a nearby toll road not
sealed by troops.
	   Earlier, a senior Cabinet minister called on students to remain
calm, saying violent anti-government demonstrations and calls for
the president to quit would not fix Indonesia's crippling economic
crisis.
	   On Monday about 2,000 protesters marched to the Parliament. They
pushed down the legislature's main gate, but were forced out of its
grounds by troops and soldiers early Tuesday morning.
	   It was the biggest demonstration of its kind since a marathon
student sit-in at the Parliament helped force Habibie's autocratic
predecessor, Suharto, to step down after 1,200 people were killed
in a wave of riots four months ago.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that two students were
hospitalized with bayonet wounds to their abdomens and others were
treated for tear gas inhalation after Tuesday morning's
confrontation.
	   Maria Helena, a spokeswoman for nearby Atma Jaya Hospital, said
two students underwent emergency surgery, but she refused to give
details of their injuries. Three others were treated at the
hospital and later released, she said.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured by rocks and
bottles thrown by demonstrators.
	   Meanwhile, mobs returned to the streets for the second
consecutive day of rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority in a
small town in Central Java province.
	   Violence broke out in Kebumen, about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of Jakarta, Monday. Trouble flared again Tuesday with
arson attacks and looting of dozens of Chinese-owned shops.
	   Local police chief Col. Dedi S.K. said 112 people were arrested.
He said 49 shops, 23 cars and five motorcycles were damaged or set
afire.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only a small fraction of Indonesia's
population. However, they are successful in commerce and industry
and have become scapegoats for Indonesia's economic problems, the
worst in 30 years.
	   Also on Tuesday thousands of students staged a peaceful rally
against rising prices in Indonesia's second biggest city, Surabaya,
about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Some students said they would protest again on Wednesday when
Habibie is scheduled to visit the city.
	   In Jakarta, Justice Minister Muladi urged the students ``to use
their wisdom and prevent the situation from getting worse.''
	   He defended the reform record of the Habibie government and said
it had done its best to improve Indonesia's situation during its
first 100 days in office.

New Zealand premier wins first confidence vote for minority

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, formally secured her grip on power after the
collapse of the former ruling coalition as the new minority
government on Tuesday won a key Parliamentary vote of confidence.
	   The confidence motion proposed by Shipley _ the first time this
century a New Zealand government has sought a vote of confidence in
itself _ passed 62 votes to 58.
	   The result puts a formal end to weeks of political turmoil which
resulted in the collapse of the former ruling coalition between
Shipley's National Party and junior partner New Zealand First.
	   ``This government intends to keep the momentum up and deliver
progress for New Zealanders,'' Shipley said in a speech to
Parliament.
	   ``Minority government is new and I accept that many people
aren't sure about it. All I ask is that they judge us by our
results.''
	   But she gave the country's 120 legislators little indication of
the future direction of her government in terms of specific policy
issues.
	   The minority government depends on the backing of the
center-right ACT Party's eight votes and 10 independents.
	   During the confidence debate, ACT leader Richard Prebble said
his party's support depends on Shipley returning to the
center-right policies which he said voters approved at the last
election.
	   The vote came after a sharp downward revision of the country's
economic outlook Tuesday, which showed the economy shrinking and
budgets moving into the red over the next two years. This comes
after five years of consistent budget surpluses.
	   Shipley said in a recent television interview that her
government would not hold future generations hostage by running up
debt during the current economic downturn.

Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 17 people died and 29 others
fell ill after eating worm-infested fish and drinking contaminated
water from shallow mud holes in the southern Philippines, health
officials said Tuesday.
	   Twelve of the deaths and 19 of the non-fatal illnesses this
month were attributed to gastroenteritis acquired after eating fish
infested with worms in a mountain village in Monkayo in Davao del
Norte province, assistant regional health officer Salvador Estrera
said.
	   At about the same time, five members of the B'laan tribe in
nearby Alabel in Sarangani province died from cholera, he said. Ten
other tribesmen were being treated for the disease, he added.
	   Sarangani province is about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of
Monkayo and 880 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Manila.
	   Estrera said most of the tribesmen fell ill after drinking water
from mud holes that are also used to bathe farm animals and wash
clothes. Sarangani was also hit by a cholera outbreak earlier this
year which killed seven children and sickened 35 others.
	   Several doctors and volunteers have been sent to the two areas
to take medicine, oral rehydration fluids and fresh water, Estrera
said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rebuffing the latest Western demands
to halt the fighting in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic insists he has no intention of calling off his troops
battling ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But in a sign he is willing to make a political compromise over
the status of the embattled Serbian province, Milosevic reportedly
wants to hold elections for a Kosovo parliament that would be
dominated by rival ethnic Albanians.
	   The reliable independent daily Glas Javnosti said Tuesday that
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans.
	   The daily quoted Kosovo Albanian sources as saying parliamentary
elections should be held within three months and that the formation
of a new Kosovo parliament should represent the basis of an
agreement between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The rebel fighters who are fighting Serb troops have indicated
they do not support an agreement in principle reached last week
between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova under which Kosovo would eventually be granted self-rule.
Western diplomats say that deal could take months to finalize.
	   The rebels have indicated they do not support an agreement in
principle reached last week between Milosevic and Rugova under
which Kosovo would eventually be granted self-rule. Western
diplomats say that deal could take months to finalize.
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.
	   After talks Monday with U.S. officials in Belgrade, Milosevic
issued a statement declaring he had stressed that ``terrorism in
Kosovo will be suppressed and eliminated.''
	   He called anew for international condemnation of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which Yugoslav and Serb forces have tried to crush
during a six-month assault in the secessionist province.
	   The visiting officials, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State John
Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, were the latest in a parade
of Western dignitaries to Belgrade to urge Milosevic to stop the
bloodshed.
	   Shattuck and Dole reiterated calls for an end to the Serb
offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and an
estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes. The two
demanded a pullback of government forces so refugees could return
to their homes.
	   Shattuck, a human rights specialist, said the Yugoslav leader
``showed interest'' in letting independent investigators look into
evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but did not
comply with their appeal to allow experts immediate access to
alleged massacre sites.
	   In an apparent effort to avoid some of the international
criticism, Milosevic's security forces have released most of the
approximately 500 men taken captive in the latest offensive against
the KLA.
	   Some of those released told reporters they had been beaten with
sticks and complained they were kept in forests without food and
water for 24 hours. Other local residents said 50 people were still
missing and 17 were killed in the offensive.
	   ``They came and took us in the mountains,'' said Xhavit Rudi, a
30-year-old farmer who was detained near the village of Ponorac.
``They said they would cut us if we ate or drank or went to the
bathroom.''
	   Hundreds of refugees who fled police detention or were released
returned to villages surrounding Ponorac to find many of their
houses and belongings burnt.
	   Western officials estimate that 50,000 people are now living in
hills and forests and at risk of starvation or freezing in winter.
	   United Nations agencies appealed Tuesday for dlrs 54 million to
help the refugees.
	   ``Adequate funding is critical to avert further tragedy in the
freezing hills where tens of thousands of displaced people are
huddling,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said
in Geneva. ``We have to act very quickly since time is running
out.''

Gallery under investigation for serving Lenin as a cake

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An art gallery owner was questioned by prosecutors
after a life-sized cake depicting Vladimir Lenin was devoured by
guests and art critics at a recent exhibition, The Moscow Times
reported Tuesday.
	   Sergei Taraborov has been questioned by prosecutors after some
20 Communist members of parliament complained the cake violated
laws against insulting national figures, the report said.
	   Taraborov said the cake was made by artist Yury Shabelnikov to
symbolize the end of the 20th century and the pivotal role played
by Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union. It was served up at the
gallery in March.
	   The artist has refused to take part in the investigation.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy resuming mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians believes some progress is
possible, but does not count on a deal being concluded during his
visit to the Middle East this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater
Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials were to meet Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation the three sides
had worked out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue Ross will have to address is the scope of an
Israeli pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent,
Israel accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of
the land set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full
security control and Palestinian land use being restricted.
	   Netanyahu has claimed that the Palestinians agreed to the
proposal in principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said
no agreement was reached and that the gaps remained wide.
	   Netanyahu reportedly suspects that Arafat was prodded by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to withdraw concessions he had
already made to Israel.
	   Netanyahu was to send two senior aides, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad, to Cairo on Wednesday to try
and soften Mubarak's position, the prime minister's office said.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police swinging batons, bamboo
rods and rifle butts drove opposition supporters from a protest
camp in front of the National Assembly on Tuesday. Scattered
demonstrators battled with security forces in the streets, throwing
stones and setting fires.
	   The surge of riot police through makeshift shelters broke up a
two-week protest against alleged fraud in Cambodia's July 26
national election. The crowd, which at times numbered 5,000, had
called for the resignation of Cambodian strongman Hun Sen.
	   The protestors were trapped for several minutes between lines of
police pushing up from the south and a water cannon directed at
them from the north. Police plowed through the camp, smashing
shelters and pounding women and children with their weapons.
	   An APTV cameraman saw a soldier swing the butt of his rifle at a
woman in her mid 60s, shattering her elbow. Another woman was
smashed in the mouth with a baton.
	   A third elderly woman was hit so hard with a rifle butt that
what appeared to be a piece of the gun went flying loose. She
crumpled to the ground, then picked herself up and ran.
	   No arrests were witnessed.
	   The breakup of the protest followed an ultimatum by Hun Sen
ordering them to leave the site by midnight Monday or he would use
force to evict them. The order came after grenades were tossed into
his Phnom Penh home. He was not at home, and no one was injured in
the blast.
	   About 10 minutes after the police swarmed into the camp, the
crowd managed to flee on streets running north, slowly pursued by
police and troops firing hundreds of shots from automatic rifles
into the air.
	   As they were being pushed back, the demonstrators staged hit and
run battles with the security forces, regrouping to throwing stones
and loose objects at them. They set several piles of rubbish on
fire.
	   Almost all shops and public places in he capital were closed.
	   Other groups of demonstrators on hundreds of motorcycles cruised
streets near the railway station, staging rock throwing brawls when
stopped at a police checkout.
	   The motorcycle taxis, whose drivers are a core of opposition
support, roared through the streets, snarling traffic and beeping
horns to the rhythm of the name of the politician who has lead the
protests: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack, ordering his arrest.
The opposition leader spent the night at the offices of the United
Nations representative in Cambodia in a luxury Phnom Penh hotel
surrounded by police.
	   Political tensions in Cambodia had apparently eased slightly
late Monday, with the government backing off its plan to arrest Sam
Rainsy and rescinding the deadline for the protests to end.
	   The move to defuse the situation came after soldiers trying to
disperse protestors Monday had fired thousands of rounds into the
air, killing one man and injuring several others.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official who negotiated the
stand-down had said efforts would be made to peacefully end the
confrontations Tuesday.
	   Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel.
He looked weary and nervous.
	   The politician was escorted by the U.N.'s special
representative, Lakhan Mehrotra, in a convoy of U.N. vehicles to
the home of his ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh for a meeting.
	   Afterwards, they returned to the U.N. offices. The ambassadors
of the United States, France, Canada, Australia, Japan and
Singapore consulted with the U.N. representative. The contents of
the talks were not immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically closemouthed with the media,
responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had been
frightened and was now relieved.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A Sri Lankan politician's bodyguard
was arrested for shooting a wild boar and a monitor lizard in a
wildlife sanctuary, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Sergeant Gamini Wijerathne, chief bodyguard of a lawmaker in
President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance party, was
caught hunting in the Pallekelle Strict Nature Reserve on Sunday,
the Divaina newspaper reported. His rifle was confiscated.
	   Park rangers told court officials they believed the game was
intended for the lawmaker's table. Police declined to name the
lawmaker, who was vacationing near the nature reserve 100
kilometers (60 miles) east of the capital, Colombo. Police said
there wasn't enough evidence to charge him with any crime.
	   Wild boar and monitor lizards are not endangered species and are
considered delicacies in this Indian Ocean island nation. But
hunting of all types is banned in reserves unless permission is
obtained from wildlife rangers.
	   Wijerathne was jailed for two weeks by a local magistrate to
allow forest rangers to gather evidence against him. He could be
charged with hunting inside a nature reserve, illegal use of
weapons, hunting without a license, and killing animals for meat on
a full moon day. If convicted, he could get up to four years in
jail.
	   The full moon day every month is a Buddhist holiday in Sri
Lanka, where about 74 percent of the 18.6 million population are
Buddhists. Buddha is believed to have attained Nirvana or
enlightenment on a full moon day. Sri Lankan law prohibits the
killing of animals for food on these days.

principle reached last week between Milosevic and Rugova under
which Kosovo would eventually be granted self-rule. Western
diplomats say that deal could take months to finalize.
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.
	   After talks Monday with U.S. officials in Belgrade, Milosevic
issued a statement declaring he had stressed that ``terrorism in
Kosovo will be suppressed and eliminated.''
	   He called anew for international condemnation of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which Yugoslav and Serb forces have tried to crush
during a six-month assault in the secessionist province.
	   The visiting officials, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State John
Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, urged an end to the Serb
offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and an
estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes. The two
demanded a pullback of government forces so refugees could return
to their homes.
	   In an apparent effort to avoid some of the international
criticism, Milosevic's security forces have released most of the
approximately 500 men taken captive in the latest offensive against
the KLA.
	   Some of those released told reporters they had been beaten with
sticks and complained they were kept in forests without food and
water for 24 hours. Other local residents said 50 people were still
missing and 17 were killed in the offensive.
	   ``They came and took us in the mountains,'' said Xhavit Rudi, a
30-year-old farmer who was detained near the village of Ponorac.
``They said they would cut us if we ate or drank or went to the
bathroom.''
	   Hundreds of refugees who fled police detention or were released
returned to villages surrounding Ponorac to find many of their
houses and belongings burnt.
	   Western officials estimate that 50,000 people are now living in
hills and forests and at risk of starvation or freezing in winter.
	   United Nations agencies appealed Tuesday for dlrs 54 million to
help the refugees.
	   ``Adequate funding is critical to avert further tragedy in the
freezing hills where tens of thousands of displaced people are
huddling,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said
in Geneva. ``We have to act very quickly since time is running
out.''

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airbus Industrie has scored deals to
sell widebody aircraft worth more than dlrs 2 billion to the Middle
East carrier Emirates Airlines and a big U.S. lending company,
aviation sources said Tuesday.
	   Airbus was poised to announce the sale of up to 10 A340 jets to
International Lease Finance Corp., or ILFC, a Los Angeles-based
company that buys aircraft then rents them out to air carriers, one
source said, speaking to The Associated Press only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Earlier, another source told the AP that Emirates had placed six
firm orders for A340s, with a list price of around dlrs 810
million. Emirates has options to purchase more of the Airbus planes
which could push the deal into the billions, the source said.
	   It was not immediately clear how many of the airplanes that ILFC
wants are firm orders or how many are options, but the models it
would buy are listed at between dlrs 148 million and dlrs 162
million per jet. If ILFC buys 10 of the jets, as one source
suggested, it would put the deal in the range of dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Airbus would not comment, but chief executive Noel Forgeard
called a late morning press conference on the second day of the
Farnborough International 98 air show, the industry's biggest event
of the year.
	   Many of the world's aerospace companies now seem to be setting
their sights on smaller aircraft.
	   Airbus outlined its plans early Tuesday for a new 100-seat jet,
the A318, to compete with Boeing's recent 717 models, and the
Canadian company Bombardier unveiled a proposal Tuesday to build a
new 90-seat regional jet, code-named the BRJ-X series.
	   The airplane makers are busily announcing orders at Farnborough,
but they are also worrying about a pending slump in sales that they
hope won't mean a repeat of the industry's early 1990s disaster.
	   Sales are booming, but analysts say air carriers are buying more
airplanes than they need so a setback is inevitable, probably in
2000.

Israel, U.S. hold talks about possible release of Pollard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Senior U.S. and Israeli officials have
discussed the possible release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard in
recent meetings, the spokesman for a Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   The Jerusalem Post daily said U.S. Vice President Al Gore and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger participated in the talks.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli Immigrant Absorption Minister Yuli
Edelstein will fly to Washington to lobby members of Congress on
Pollard's behalf, said Edelstein's spokesman, Yehuda Glick.
	   Glick said high-level Israeli-U.S. meetings concerning Pollard's
fate have taken place in recent weeks, but would not provide
details.
	   The Post said there have been several meetings, including one
between Gore and Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky in July.
The newspaper said U.S. officials asked that the meetings be kept
secret.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was convicted
in 1987 of passing U.S. military secrets to Israel and is serving a
life prison term.
	   For years, successive Israeli governments said Pollard was part
of a rogue operation and did not have official blessing. However,
in May, Israel recognized Pollard as a spy.

 &UR; Kohl claims credit as German unemployment dips &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with reaction. Changes dateline. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's troubled
re-election campaign got a push Tuesday from lower jobless figures
released less than three weeks before national elections.
	   Kohl said the improvement confirmed a ``turnaround'' in
Germany's job market, and he credited his government's reforms to
make the economy more competitive. He predicted the jobless total
would fall below the 4 million mark next month.
	   The opposition Social Democrats, who polls say will win the
Sept. 27 election, said the latest numbers only prove that voters
should dump Kohl after 16 years in power.
	   ``Never before have there been so many jobless before a federal
election as this time,'' party chairman Oskar Lafontaine said.
``The Social Democrats will turn this election into a referendum on
combating unemployment.''
	   A total of 4.095 people were out of work in August, down 39,000
from the month before, squeezing the jobless rate to 10.6 percent
from 10.7 percent in July, the Federal Labor Office said.
	   With unemployment a key election issue, some analysts believe
the latest improvement may sway undecided voters as unemployment
recedes from postwar records last year and early this year.
	   The August jobless rate compares with 11.4 percent last year, a
record high for that month. The rate had risen slightly in July,
but labor officials attributed that increase solely to seasonal
factors.
	   Kohl said the year-on-year jobless total dropped for the third
month in a row in former communist East Germany and for the eighth
consecutive month in western Germany, the nation's economic
powerhouse.
	   The labor office said the August figures show a ``continuing
slight improvement,'' with the number of unemployed falling a
seasonally adjusted 24,000 in August from July. The drop was
slightly greater than analysts had forecast.
	   Western Germany's jobless rate fell to 9.0 percent in August
from 9.1 percent the month before. Economically depressed Eastern
Germany recorded a drop to 17.1 percent from 17.4 percent.
	   The Social Democrats say much of the improvement is due to an
election-year boost in government make-work programs in eastern
Germany.
	   And labor office head Bernhard Jagoda said that while he expects
the number of jobless to drop below 4 million in September and
October, unemployment may rise again in November.
	   Kohl said the Social Democrats ``threaten the upswing'' with
their campaign promise to repeal welfare-state reforms passed by
his center-right government. The measures included cuts in sick
pay, health care and retirement benefits as well as more lenient
rules on firing employees.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy mediating between Israel
and the Palestinians believes progress is possible, but doubts a
deal will be concluded during his visit to the Middle East this
week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater Palestinian
effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials were to meet Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation the three sides
had worked out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue for Ross will be the scope of an Israeli
pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent, Israel
accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of the land
set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full security
control and Palestinian land use restricted.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians agreed to the proposal in
principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said no agreement
was reached and that gaps remained wide.
	   Netanyahu reportedly suspects that Arafat was prodded by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to withdraw concessions he had
already made to Israel.
	   Netanyahu was to send two senior aides, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad, to Cairo on Wednesday to try
and soften Mubarak's position, Israel radio said Tuesday.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
conflicting Israeli and Palestinian assessments on whether progress
had been made were part of an attempt to stake out positions ahead
of Ross' arrival.
	   Ross, a veteran of several exhausting and unsuccessful Mideast
shuttles, would not have agreed to return to the region if he did
not believe progress was possible, the official said.
	   However, this does not mean an agreement on the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation can be reached at the end of
this trip, the official said.

U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue for Ross will be the scope of an Israeli
pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent, Israel
accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of the land
set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full security
control and Palestinian land use restricted.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians agreed to the proposal in
principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said no agreement
was reached and that gaps remained wide.
	   Netanyahu reportedly suspects that Arafat was prodded by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to withdraw concessions he had
already made to Israel.
	   Netanyahu was to send two senior aides, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad, to Cairo on Wednesday to try
and soften Mubarak's position, the prime minister's office said.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
conflicting Israeli and Palestinian assessments on whether progress
had been made were p
	   However, this does not mean an agreement on the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation can be reached at the end of
this trip, the official said.

Asian markets close mixed, yen's rise buoys major bourses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stock and currency prices.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the three leading bourses posting moderate gains on a stronger
Japanese currency and positive local news.
	   The benchmark Composite Index in Malaysia, which imposed strict
currency and stock trading controls last week, fell 21 percent on
profit-taking, largely erasing Monday's 22.5 percent gain.
	   Profit-taking also dragged down shares in Thailand, where the
key stock index sank 3.5 percent. Stock markets in South Korea and
Australia also declined, falling 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent lower,
respectively.
	   In Japan, the U.S. dollar lost ground against the yen, reaching
131.99 yen in late afternoon trading, down 0.07 yen from the
previous day. Tokyo's benchmark 255-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed 0.83 percent higher at 14,913.49, adding to Monday's five
percent gain.
	   Hong Kong's main Hang Seng Index advanced 1.4 percent following
Monday's 7.9 percent increase, and Singapore's Straits Times Index
rose 0.67 percent after a 7.1 percent gain the day before.
	   Other markets closing higher included those in Taiwan, up 2.1
percent; New Zealand, up 1.6 percent; and the Philippines, up 0.4
percent.
	   ``The yen has gotten stronger ... There's no reason regional
stock markets shouldn't recover,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice
president of Diversified Securities Inc. in Manila.
	   The yen strengthened Tuesday as overseas funds tried to make up
for losses on their Russian investments by taking profits on dollar
positions, dealers said.
	   Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   Worries that Latin America might become the next victim of a
spreading global financial crisis and the recent drop in U.S. stock
prices also dampened interest in the dollar, traders said.
	   In Hong Kong, investors reacted positively to measures announced
Monday to limit short-selling, which has been blamed for the recent
chaos in the financial market.
	   The government announced a 30-point plan, including increased
fines and jail terms for investors caught illegally carrying out
short sales and expulsion from the stock exchange for brokers who
break trading rules.
	   Shorting refers to the practice of borrowing stocks or a
currency, selling these borrowed securities, and then buying them
back from the market to return them by a promised date. Investors
profit if the sale price of the borrowed securities is higher than
the price paid to buy them back.
	   By betting that stock prices will fall, short-sellers can help
dampen market sentiment.
	   In Malaysia, dealers said the drop was expected after the sharp
gains recorded since last week when the government imposed strict
currency and stock trading controls and set an exchange rate of
three ringgit to the U.S. dollar.
	   They said panic selling by retail investors, many of whom jumped
into the market Monday, also added to the drop.
	   Jerome Fung, research analyst at Lippo Securities in Hong Kong,
said investors in the region have not yet digested the long-term,
negative impact of recently-announced market controls imposed in
Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   They have also ignored that fact that there have been no real
improvements in the financial fundamentals, he said.
	   ``Most foreign funds are sidelined,'' Fung said. ``The outlook
is still negative.''

Supporters seek release of Ugandan facing U.S. fraud trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Supporters of a Ugandan mayor charged
with bank fraud petitioned the U.S. government for his release from
house arrest pending a trial, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Nasser Ntege Sebaggala, 52, is under electronic monitoring 24
hours a day, and required to stay within 150 feet (50 meters) of a
telephone in his temporary residence in Boston's Roxbury
neighborhood
	   Sebaggala is allowed to have visitors, use the telephone and
Internet, but can leave the residence only for court appearances
and to meet with his lawyer.
	   He faces multiple counts of trying to defraud BankBoston of
nearly dlrs 200,000, and of falsifying Customs forms at Boston's
Logan Airport earlier this year. Court papers said he claimed to
have less than dlrs 10,000 when in fact he was carrying dlrs
108,000.
	   Sebaggala faces up to 30 years in prison and a dlrs 1 million
fine for each of four bank fraud charges, and 10 years imprisonment
and dlrs 250,000 fine for each of two forged check charges,
prosecutors said.
	   John Sebaana Kizito, who managed Sebaggala's mayoral campaign
last year, read a petition seeking his release from house arrest at
a news conference Monday. It was addressed to the U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   The petition complained that a U.S. court's refusal to grant
bail to Sebaggala interferred with his ability to ``answer the
charges while executing his duties as mayor of Kampala.''
	   ``The trust the electorate has in the mayor is frustrated by his
continued detention,'' the petition said.
	   Sebaggala was arrested in New York in June en route from Chicago
to London. Customs officials at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport took him off the plane.
	   A federal court in Boston on July 9 put Sebaggala under house
arrest and released him to the custody of Edmund Narine, a Roxbury
resident sympathetic to his plight.

Philippine government's total deficit triples in first half of
</HEADLINE>
year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A severe revenue shortfall has caused
the Philippines' public sector deficit to triple to 33.59 billion
pesos (dlrs 781 million) in the first half of 1998 from 11.1
billion pesos (dlrs 258 million) a year earlier, the government
said Tuesday.
	   The consolidated public sector account covers government
revenues and expenditures as well as 13 government-owned and
controlled corporations, local government units, the central bank
and a former oil-price buffer fund.
	   The central government posted a budget deficit of 24.01 billion
pesos (dlrs 558 million) for the six-month period, while the 13
public corporations registered a deficit of 19.26 billion pesos
(dlrs 448 million).
	   The government predicts the consolidated public sector deficit
will balloon to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.6 billion) at the end of
the year as the government, public corporations and local
governments miss their revenue targets for the year.
	   An overall economic slowdown triggered by Asia's currency crisis
and a drought have caused corporate earnings to decline, reducing
tax collection and other government revenues.
	   The central government budget deficit, meanwhile, is expected to
widen to 40 billion pesos (dlrs 930 million) by the end of the
year, mainly because of the revenue shortfalls.

Scottish Parliament backfires on Britain's governing party
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With PM-Scot Free-Glance &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair's bold
experiment in giving Scots their first Parliament in three
centuries has backfired.
	   Support for independence-seeking nationalists is surging, and
Blair's Labor Party is in deep trouble in Scotland, its traditional
stronghold.
	   In opinion polls, nationalist popularity is at record levels,
boosted by rapid disenchantment with Britain's first Labor Party
government in a generation and by a sense of increasing confidence
_ critics call it foolhardiness _ about Scotland going it alone.
	   The harder Blair's government tries, the better it gets for the
Scottish National Party, now running neck-and-neck with Labor in
opinion polls.
	   ``We are Scottish, they are English,'' road worker Bruce
Mitchell said as Blair's motorcade zoomed away from this handsome
east coast seaport during a recent visit. ``They think they are up
here and we are down there, but the SNP is totally behind the
Scottish people.''
	   Blair glad-handed, promised better deals for old people and job
programs for young people, and sought to undercut the nationalists
with appeals to Britishness and warnings that the 5 million Scots
would pay dearly for independence.
	   ``Taxes up to pay for the costs of separatism,'' he declared at
a rally in Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. ``Businesses scared of
investing because they can't get answers on the currency, on
interest rates, on taxes...''
	   That's what the nationalists like to hear _ language reminiscent
of Britain's former Conservative Party government, which tried to
block any constitutional change to the 1707 union of England and
Scotland.
	   Scots' sense of national identity appears to have grown since
they voted 3-to-1 in a referendum last September to have their own
Parliament to deal with local issues and taxation.
	   The Scottish flag, the blue-and-white cross of St. Andrew, flies
everywhere, while the Union Jack, Britain's national flag, is
seldom seen.
	   Along with traditional prickliness about a big neighbor, some
Scots now have an air of seeing themselves as rather nicer than the
English _ politically more compassionate, less materialistic.
	   Elections to the Scottish Parliament, which will have
tax-raising powers and control health, education, legal affairs,
sports and the arts, are to be held in May.
	   New assemblies in Northern Ireland and Wales also are part of a
process that, in the Labor Party plan, was designed to give greater
autonomy within the United Kingdom _ not break it up.
	   In Wales, whose assembly will be less powerful than Scotland's,
there is no real sign of the majority wanting independence. Still,
one opinion poll put support for the nationalist Plaid Cymru party
at 23 percent, more than double the percentage of the Welsh vote it
got in the May 1997 national elections.
	   In the Scottish Parliament, however, it's possiblethe
nationalists could become the largest party. They would not have
control, but such a showing would boost their campaign to hold an
independence referendum within four years.
	   If the Scottish Parliament voted to have a referendum, and if a
majority of Scots voted for independence, they would get it.
	   After attracting 22 percent of the Scottish vote in the 1997
national elections, the Scottish National Party has been running
level with or ahead of Labor in post-referendum polls, each with
around 40 percent support.
	   ``Labor has not understood that last year Scotland crossed a
psychological Rubicon,'' said Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
National Party. ``They have bestowed on us government credibility
... a reasonable choice for reasonable people to make.''
	   A poll published this week in The Sunday Times Scotland
suggested half of Scots voters supported independence, with 5
percent undecided and 45 percent against. A July poll by ICM
indicated 56 percent support for independence.
	   However, not even the Scottish National Party thinks Scots will
vote for independence soon. Salmond's own estimate is ``within 15
years.''
	   That, however, would be a blink compared with three centuries of
political union. And the Scottish Parliament is likely to
exacerbate tensions by blaming London for too little money or too
much interference.

Russian governor urges emergency measures to stave off crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economic crisis deepening, the
governor of the western Kaliningrad enclave has declared an
``emergency situation'' to ensure the region does not run out of
food, fuel and other vital supplies, officials said Tuesday.
	   Governor Leonid Gorbenko ordered his staff on Monday night to
find funds to support pensioners and other people with low incomes,
and to develop a plan to ensure that the region does not run out of
basic medicines, said administration spokeswoman Antonina Maidak.
	   He also demanded that measures be taken to get the harvest in.
Many crops in the region have already been ruined by an unusually
wet summer.
	   Maidak emphasized that the ``emergency situation'' does not call
for any restrictions on residents' rights.
	   ``These are purely economic measures,'' she said. ``We have
appealed to our people, so that we could join forces and not get
lost in the time of crisis.''
	   As the ruble's value has plunged, Kaliningrad officials worry
that the funds that had been budgeted to heat apartments during the
winter will not be nearly enough.
	   Gorbenko appealed to Kaliningrad utility authorities to avoid
middlemen and buy fuel directly from producers, Maidak said.
	   He also asked Kaliningrad food producers to take food to cities
and sell directly to customers, bypassing retail companies, in
order to keep prices lower, she said.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some facts and figures on Scottish politics:
	   ___
	   PARLIAMENT: In May, voters will elect a 129-member assembly in
Edinburgh, Scotland's first separate Parliament since union with
England in 1707. If the Scottish National Party wins the most
seats, it will seek within four years a referendum on full
independence.
	   ___
	   POWERS: Parliament will have tax-raising powers and legislate on
health, education, local government, housing, police, courts,
transport, agriculture, sports and arts. Parliament was an election
pledge by the Labor Party, and Scots voted 3-to-1 in favor in a
referendum last September.
	   ___
	   WHAT WON'T CHANGE: Scots will still elect members of the
659-member House of Commons in London, be entitled to vote on
domestic matters in England and Wales and get their traditionally
higher per capita share of state expenditures _ dlrs 7,523 per
person vs. dlrs 6,035 in England.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Since the union, Scotland has retained separate legal
and educational system. England and Scotland have had the same
monarch since 1603, when England's Queen Elizabeth I was succeeded
by James VI of Scotland (James I of England). The Scottish National
Party says it would retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state of
an indepdendent Scotland.

Hungary's new premier promises to cut taxes, boost economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Prime Minister Viktor Orban promised
Tuesday to cut taxes and boost the Hungarian economy, making his
first speech to a regular session of Parliament since he took
office in July.
	   The country's bright economic outlook provides an opportunity
for the new government to ease the austerity policies imposed by
the previous leadership, he said.
	   Orban expressed hope that lowering the income tax by 1 percent
and employers' social security payments by 6 percent will help
employment and make Hungarian products more competitive abroad.
	   He called his new government the ``government of hope, and the
government of the future,'' saying it will reintroduce child
welfare benefits, extend family allowances and abolish higher
education tuition fees.
	   Orban's Young Democrats formed a new center-right government in
coalition with the agrarian-based Independent Smallholders Party
after winning elections in May. They ousted the Socialist-led
government of Gyula Horn, which presided over economic growth but
was criticized for not improving Hungarians' living conditions.
	   Hungary's stock market has taken a hit recently as a result of
the economic crisis in Russia. Orban said it should be only
temporary, blaming the false impression others have that Hungary
remains part of the Eastern bloc.
	   ``But we can't do anything if the investors do not want to
realize that we are no longer part of that bloc,'' he said.
	   There are no signs that investors will turn away from Hungary,
the premier maintained, noting as an example that General Electric
still plans to build a new plant in the country.
	   Orban said the crawling peg devaluation of the forint, currently
at 8 percent, will be cut by 1 percent in October and another 1
percent in January.
	   The most urgent priority facing his government is the 1999
budget, which he said must be completely overhauled from last year.

Caritas accuses European leaders of indifference to Kosovo

suffering &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An official of the Roman Catholic charity
Caritas accused European leaders Tuesday of ignoring the suffering
in Kosovo and treating civilians there like ``pawns'' in a
political chess game with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``In Kosovo, chaos and hunger are rampant,'' the official,
Marion Feik, said. ``Hundreds of thousands have fled. Women and
children must make do in open fields. Many are becoming ill.''
	   Feik, who recently returned from the Serb-ruled province, said
``children are dying every day,'' yet the Europeans are failing to
take effective action to bring an end to the crisis.
	   Feik denounced the ``seeming indifference with which politicians
in East and West are dealing with the suffering and despair of the
civilian population.''
	   ``It is pure cyunicism,'' he added. ``Women and children are
moved like pawns here and there in a power play.''
	   Hundreds have been killed and thousands made homeless during the
fighting, which escalated Feb. 28 when Milosevic moved to destroy
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   An estimated 50,000 refugees, nearly all ethnic Albanians, are
believed living without shelter in the fields, hills and forests of
the majority Albanian province.
	   Fears for their survival are increasing with the approach of
winter less than two months from now.
	   Feik said that in his 25 years with Caritas, ``I have never seen
such a dreadful situation'' as in Kosovo.

Indonesian president to visit Malaysia on first official trip
</HEADLINE>
abroad
 &UR; Eds: Single name Muladi is correct in final graf

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie will
visit neighboring Malaysia next month for bilateral talks with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, an Indonesian official said
Tuesday.
	   The visit, scheduled for the second week of October, would be
Habibie's first official overseas trip since he replaced former
autocratic President Suharto in May after a wave of protests and
riots.
	   Since assuming office, Habibie had refrained from traveling
abroad because of pressing problems at home stemming from
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.

JAT continues flying, but prepares for EU ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national carrier JAT
kept flying its flights to European Union countries Tuesday, but
prepared to be shut out of the airports under a new EU ban due to
take effect imminently.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT's officials said flights would continue to EU countries
until they receive an official notification about the ban.
	   European officials indicated the ban was expected to go into
effect Tuesday, when it was published in the EU gazette.
	   JAT, which was banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo
against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo. Independent
Belgrade media claimed Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the new EU ban
against the Yugoslav national carrier but suggested no reciprocal
measures be adopted against foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   The government called the ban ``another sad example of
discriminatory and capricious'' acts against Yugoslavia and
``indirect support for terrorism in Kosovo,'' the state news agency
Tanjug reported.

Prime Minister Shipley wins first confidence vote as minority

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES from 4th graf with threats from liberal and
conservative backers of minority government. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's prime minister,
Jenny Shipley, formally secured her grip on power after the
collapse of the former ruling coalition as the new minority
government on Tuesday won a key Parliamentary vote of confidence.
	   The confidence motion proposed by Shipley _ the first time this
century a New Zealand government has sought a vote of confidence in
itself _ passed 62 votes to 58.
	   The result puts a formal end to weeks of political turmoil which
resulted in the collapse of the former ruling coalition between
Shipley's National Party and junior partner New Zealand First.
	   However, it is unclear how long the new informal coalition will
last, as both liberal and conservative Shipley supporters
immediately clashed about changes in government policy.
	   ``This government intends to keep the momentum up and deliver
progress for New Zealanders,'' Shipley said in a speech to
Parliament.
	   ``Minority government is new and I accept that many people
aren't sure about it. All I ask is that they judge us by our
results.''
	   But she gave the country's 120 legislators little indication of
the future direction of her government in terms of specific policy
issues.
	   The minority government depends on the backing of the
center-right ACT Party's eight votes and 10 independents.
	   During the confidence debate, ACT leader Richard Prebble said
his party's support depends on Shipley returning to the
center-right policies which he said voters approved at the last
election.
	   Unless the government adopts policies friendly to his party,
Prebble said ACT would consider voting against it and force an
election when the government next faces a confidence vote in
February.
	   The ACT leader called for lower spending, lower taxes and more
asset sales.
	   But other Shipley supporters have rejected a shift to the right.
	   Former NZ First legislator Anne Batten ruled out asset sales
``in a depressed market,'' and legislator Peter Dunne said the
government could not return to ``scorched earth'' rightist
policies.
	   The vote came after a sharp downward revision of the country's
economic outlook Tuesday, which showed the economy shrinking and
budgets moving into the red over the next two years. This comes
after five years of consistent budget surpluses.
	   Shipley said in a recent television interview that her
government would not hold future generations hostage by running up
debt during the current economic downturn.

Yeltsin hesitates in choosing candidate; economy still in crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES in graf 5 with Yeltsin's office saying president has
not yet met with Chernomyrdin, NEW grafs 10 and 18 with additional
comment from Communist leader, government saying federal budget
will have to be revised this year and next. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin huddled with top aides at
his country residence Tuesday, discussing whether to stick with his
first choice for prime minister or present a compromise candidate
to the hostile parliament.
	   Yeltsin has said that Viktor Chernomyrdin is his only choice to
lead a new government that must deal with the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, overwhelmingly
rejected Chernomyrdin for a second time Monday. Yeltsin was
weighing whether to choose him again for the all-important third
and final round of voting, which is expected in about a week.
	   As of Tuesday afternoon, Yeltsin had still not named anyone,
fueling speculation that he might pick a compromise candidate.
Yeltsin conferred with senior aides at his country residence, Gorky
9, outside Moscow.
	   Several legislators said that Chernomyrdin had met with Yeltsin,
but Yeltsin's office later issued a statement saying the two men
had not yet met.
	   ``Today the countdown has begun for the position of compromise
... with another candidate,'' Konstantin Titov, a member of
parliament's upper house, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Yeltsin
planned to stick with Chernomyrdin, who held the premier's post for
five years before he was sacked by Yeltsin in March.
	   ``It will be Chernomyrdin and no one else,'' Zhirinovsky said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said that the renomination of
Chernomyrdin would lead to the ``complete paralysis of the entire
political process.''
	   ``The whole nation today is in opposition to Mr. Yeltsin,''
Zyuganov added.
	   The first two votes in parliament demonstrated lawmakers' strong
opposition to Yeltsin and have delayed the formation of a new
government during a time of turmoil.
	   If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's candidate again, then the
constitution calls on the president to dismiss parliament and call
new elections within three months. Yeltsin would rule by decree,
along with an interim government, until the new legislature is
seated.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin warned lawmakers Monday before they torpedoed
his nomination. ``We are all standing on the edge and no time is
left for settling scores.''
	   Legislators might be willing to change their votes in the third
round in order to preserve their own jobs. The dissolution of the
legislature would only add to the country's political and economic
turbulence, and it's not clear how angry Russians would vote in new
elections. Many incumbents could lose their seats.
	   Chernomyrdin's efforts to win parliamentary confirmation have
left him little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   The Communists and their allies say they have nine alternate
candidates, including Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The liberal
Yabloko party has suggested acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's economy remained in a downward spiral.
	   The government will hold talks Thursday on an emergency federal
budget for the remainder of the year, and plans for the 1999 budget
will have to be revised, government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov
said.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
at gas stations began forming Monday as motorists filled up before
prices go up.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about six to the U.S. dollar
last month, was around 20 to the dollar on Tuesday.

Kenyan Muslims given brides after prayers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Twenty Muslim men attending a weekend
prayer service at a mosque in eastern Kenya returned home with a
bride each and money for a honeymoon, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The East African Standard said the cleric at a mosque in
Garissa, 330 kilometers (210 miles) northeast of Nairobi, asked if
any unmarried men were in the congregation because as he had 20
young women seeking husbands.
	   ``More than 40 men trooped to the front of the mosque to take a
glimpse of the girls,'' the newspaper said.
	   The cleric, whose name was not provided, decided it was improper
for the men to choose their brides individually and ordered the
women to put on veils.
	   The cleric immediately married the 20 couples, and gave the men
20,000 shillings (dlrs 335) each for a honeymoon.
	   Clerics told the newspaper the marriages were arranged to
``reduce immorality in the town.'' The women reportedly were going
to the local army camp to look for husbands.

China urges Macau to improve security after bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Macau to take tougher action against
crime to prevent recent violence such as Tuesday's bombings from
jeopardizing a smooth return of the Portuguese colony to Beijing's
control next year.
	   ``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will
conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take
further, effective measures to recover sound public security,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   His plea was the latest in a series of appeals in recent months
by China for Macau to put an end to violence widely attributed to
gang wars over payouts from casinos. Some reports have suggested
Chinese police may be in league with the gangs, but China has
denied these allegations.
	   Bombs believed to have been planted by gangsters exploded
Tuesday in Macau, wounding four senior police officers and 10
journalists.
	   Macau's inability to curb the violence has strained relations
between Chinese and Portuguese officials preparing for China's
takeover of the colony on Dec. 20, 1999.
	   Zhu said restoring public order would foster economic growth and
``ensure a balanced transition and smooth transfer of power.''
	   ``The Chinese government will as always render its support and
cooperation to the Portuguese side,'' Zhu said.

category codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Riot police swinging batons, bamboo
rods and rifle butts drove opposition supporters from a protest
camp in front of the National Assembly on Tuesday. Scattered
demonstrators battled with security forces in the streets, throwing
stones and setting fires. The surge of riot police through
makeshift shelters broke up a two-week protest against alleged
fraud in Cambodia's July 26 national election. The crowd, which at
times numbered 5,000, had called for the resignation of Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen. The protestors were trapped for several minutes
between lines of police pushing up from the south and a water
cannon directed at them from the north. Police plowed through the
camp, smashing shelters and pounding women and children with their
weapons. (CAMBODIA)

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rebuffing the latest Western demands
to halt the fighting in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic insists he has no intention of calling off his troops
battling ethnic Albanian rebels. But in a sign he is willing to
make a political compromise over the status of the troubled Serbian
province, Milosevic reportedly wants to hold elections for a Kosovo
parliament that would be dominated by rival ethnic Albanians. The
reliable independent daily Glas Javnosti said Tuesday that
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans. The daily quoted Kosovo Albanian sources as saying
parliamentary elections should be held within three months and that
the formation of a new Kosovo parliament should represent the basis
of an agreement between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leaders.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions. The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by
journalists and unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire,
committed the Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and
wounded more than 330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th
victim died of his wounds and was buried Monday. On Aug. 19, the
group declared a ``suspension'' of what it called its ``military
operations,'' in a step short of Tuesday's formal cease-fire. In
Tuesday's statement issued to state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves by the IRA's traditional Gaelic
sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann, or ``Soldiers of Ireland,''
said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks ... the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters returned to
Indonesia's Parliament on Tuesday after security forces used
batons, shields and tear gas to evict hundreds in a pre-dawn clash.
Violence also flared for a second day in a riot-torn town in the
center of the main island, Java, police said. About 200 students
staged peaceful sit-in protest on a road about 100 meters (yards)
from the main gate of the Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Several
hundred riot police stood guard over the gathering as the students
sang patriotic songs, chanted anti-government slogans and called on
President B.J. Habibie to resign. The group later marched back to a
nearby college campus after police made repeated requests to
disperse. (INDONESIA-PROTEST)
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Congolese government and
rebels who control a quarter of the huge central African country
have reached a breakthrough in peace talks here and details were
supposed to be released on Tuesday. Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, chairman of a regional summit aimed at ending the civil
war, refused to discuss details of Monday's breakthrough and would
not comment on whether a cease-fire had been reached, but said
there was some sort of an agreement. ``Details of the agreement
will be released tomorrow,'' he said. Chiluba said the group of
regional presidents will reconvene Tuesday for further
deliberations before issuing a statement. ``We have had a very good
meeting,'' he told reporters. ``Things have gone extremely well.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the three leading bourses posting moderate gains on a stronger
Japanese currency and positive local news. The benchmark Composite
Index in Malaysia, which imposed strict currency and stock trading
controls last week, fell 21 percent on profit-taking, largely
erasing Monday's 22.5 percent gain. Profit-taking also dragged down
shares in Thailand, where the key stock index sank 3.5 percent.
Stock markets in South Korea and Australia also declined, falling
0.6 percent and 0.5 percent lower, respectively. In Japan, the U.S.
dollar lost ground against the yen, reaching 131.99 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 0.07 yen from the previous day. Tokyo's
benchmark 255-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed 0.83 percent higher
at 14,913.49, adding to Monday's five percent gain. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's interbank currency exchange failed to
provide a formal ruble rate against the U.S. dollar for the second
straight day on Tuesday, leaving the market without an agreed upon
level for the Russian currency. However, street trading at currency
exchange booths carried on without interruption, with one U.S.
dollar buying about 20 rubles. The interbank currency exchange,
known by its acronym as MICEX, normally sets a rate in the morning
which serves as a benchmark for the day. But in the present
turmoil, MICEX has failed to set a rate on some days, adding to the
uncertainty about the ruble's real value. Trading in rubles was
canceled on the exchange Monday because there were no offers to
sell dollars, and no transactions were expected to be completed
Tuesday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The government downgraded its assessment of the
economy Tuesday and the head of the country's chief economic agency
warned Japan stands at the brink of a dangerous deflationary
spiral. Taichi Sakaiya, the director-general of Japan's Economic
Planning Agency, said that while the economy has not yet fallen
into a deflationary spiral in which prices sink lower and lower,
``we are at the entrance of one.'' ``We must take actions to
prevent the economy from being sucked in,'' he told reporters.
Sakaiya's remarks followed the release of the Economic Planning
Agency's latest monthly report on the economy, which used the term
``very severe'' to describe the current situation _ stronger
language than the agency has used in the past. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Airbus Industrie has scored deals to
sell widebody aircraft worth more than dlrs 2 billion to the Middle
East carrier Emirates Airlines and a big U.S. lending company,
aviation sources said Tuesday. Airbus was poised to announce the
sale of up to 10 A340 jets to International Lease Finance Corp., or
ILFC, a Los Angeles-based company that buys aircraft then rents
them out to air carriers, one source said, speaking to The
Associated Press only on condition of anonymity. Earlier, another
source told the AP that Emirates had placed six firm orders for
A340s, with a list price of around dlrs 810 million. Emirates has
options to purchase more of the Airbus planes which could push the
deal into the billions, the source said. It was not immediately
clear how many of the airplanes that ILFC wants are firm orders or
how many are options, but the models it would buy are listed at
between dlrs 148 million and dlrs 162 million per jet. If ILFC buys
10 of the jets, as one source suggested, it would put the deal in
the range of dlrs 1.5 billion. (BRITAIN-AIR SHOW)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's troubled
re-election campaign got a push Tuesday from lower jobless figures
released less than three weeks before national elections. Kohl said
the improvement confirmed a ``turnaround'' in Germany's job market,
and he credited his government's reforms to make the economy more
competitive. He predicted the jobless total would fall below the 4
million mark next month. The opposition Social Democrats, who polls
say will win the Sept. 27 election, said the latest numbers only
prove that voters should dump Kohl after 16 years in power. ``Never
before have there been so many jobless before a federal election as

Democrats will turn this election into a referendum on combating
unemployment.'' (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national carrier JAT
kept flying its flights to European Union countries Tuesday, but
prepared to be shut out of the airports under a new EU ban due to
take effect imminently.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15

Hungary's new premier promises to cut taxes, boost economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Prime Minister Viktor Orban promised
Tuesday to cut taxes and boost the Hungarian economy, making his
first speech to a regular session of Parliament since he took
office in July.
	   The country's bright economic outlook provides an opportunity
for the new government to ease the austerity policies imposed by
the previous leadership, he said.
	   Orban expressed hope that lowering the income tax by 1 percent
and employers' social security payments by 6 percent will help
employment and make Hungarian products more competitive abroad.
	   He called his new government the ``government of hope, and the
government of the future,'' saying it will reintroduce child
welfare benefits, extend family allowances and abolish higher
education tuition fees.
	   Orban's Young Democrats formed a new center-right government in
coalition with the agrarian-based Independent Smallholders Party
after winning elections in May. They ousted the Socialist-led
government of Gyula Horn, which presided over economic growth but
was criticized for not improving Hungarians' living conditions.
	   Hungary's stock market has taken a hit recently as a result of
the economic crisis in Russia. Orban said it should be only
temporary, blaming the false impression others have that Hungary
remains part of the Eastern bloc.
	   ``But we can't do anything if the investors do not want to
realize that we are no longer part of that bloc,'' he said.
	   There are no signs that investors will turn away from Hungary,
the premier maintained, noting as an example that General Electric
still plans to build a new plant in the country.
	   Orban said the crawling peg devaluation of the forint, currently
at 8 percent, will be cut by 1 percent in October and another 1
percent in January.
	   The most urgent priority facing his government is the 1999
budget, which he said must be completely overhauled from last year.

	   JAT, which was banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo
against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo. Independent
Belgrade media claimed Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the new EU ban
against the Yugoslav national carrier but suggested no reciprocal
measures be adopted against foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   The government called the ban ``another sad example of
discriminatory and capricious'' acts against Yugoslavia and
``indirect support for terrorism in Kosovo,'' the state news agency
Tanjug reported.

Singapore may recommend new wage guidelines as economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
worsens

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore said Tuesday that a deepening
economic crisis may force it to set new wage level guidelines later
this month for workers in the government, unions and private
businesses.
	   ``Given the deteriorating economic outlook and changed regional
situation, the National Wages Council will be reconvened on Sept.
23 to review its wage restraint guidelines issued in May and to
consider issuing new wage guidelines for implementation,''
Singapore's ministry of manpower said in a statement.
	   Wage guidelines were last issued in May when the country's
economic growth for the year was still forecast at as high as 4.5
percent. But since then the government has revised its official
growth estimate down to between 0.5 and 1.5 percent.
	   Many private analysts predict Singapore will slip into recession
in 1999.

Hun Sen asserts rule as police smash Cambodian protest

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen reasserted his
power Tuesday after weeks of political conflict, sending riot
police swinging batons, bamboo rods and rifle butts to drive
opposition supporters from a protest camp in front of the National
Assembly.
	   Scattered demonstrators battled with security forces in the
streets, throwing stones and setting fires. Soldiers fired
thousands of rounds of in the air and deployed four fire trucks to
disperse them.
	   Demonstrators tried to slow the police charges by pouring
gasoline across intersections and setting it afire.
	   The surge of riot police through the makeshift shelters broke up
a two-week protest against alleged fraud in Cambodia's July 26
national election. The crowd, which at times numbered 10,000, had
called for the resignation of Hun Sen.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party, whose leader was under U.N.
protection, issued a statement saying the use of force is ``final
proof that Hun Sen cares nothing about democracy or freedom of
expression.''
	   The protestors were trapped for several minutes between lines of
police pushing up from the south and a water cannon directed at
them from the north. Police plowed through the camp, smashing
shelters and pounding women and children with their weapons.
	   An APTV cameraman saw a soldier swing the butt of his rifle at a
woman in her mid 60s, shattering her elbow. Another woman was
smashed in the mouth with a baton.
	   A third elderly woman was hit so hard with a rifle butt that
what appeared to be a piece of the gun went flying loose. She
crumpled to the ground, then picked herself up and ran.
	   No arrests were witnessed. Several people were brought to local
hospitals.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' said On Samath, 30, his head
taped and his shirt spotted with blood. ``The police started
pouring down the street. The next thing I knew, three started to
beat me with electric prods.''
	   The assault followed an ultimatum by Hun Sen ordering the
protesters to leave the site by midnight Monday or he would use
force to evict them. The order came after grenades were tossed into
his Phnom Penh residence. He was not at home, and no one was
injured in the blast.
	   About 10 minutes after the police swarmed into the camp, the
crowd managed to flee on streets running north, slowly pursued by
police and troops firing automatic rifles into the air.
	   The demonstrators staged hit-and-run battles with the security
forces, regrouping to throw stones and loose objects at them.
	   Almost all shops and public places in the capital were closed.
	   Other groups of demonstrators on hundreds of motorcycles cruised
streets near the railway station, staging rock-throwing brawls when
stopped by 100 club-wielding police.
	   Riot police and soldiers armed with assault rifles gradually
asserted control over key intersections. Sullen-looking motorcycle
drivers huddled in large groups, sometimes shouting insults.
	   The motorcycle taxis, whose drivers are a core of opposition
support, had earlier roared through the streets, snarling traffic
and beeping horns to the rhythm of the name of the politician who
has led the protests: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack on his house Monday and
ordered his arrest. The opposition leader spent the night at the
offices of the United Nations representative in Cambodia in a
luxury Phnom Penh hotel surrounded by police.
	   Political tensions in Cambodia had apparently eased slightly
late Monday after soldiers trying to disperse protestors killed at
least one man and injured several others. The government backed off
its plan to arrest Sam Rainsy and rescinded the deadline for the
protests to end.
	   But on Tuesday, police went ahead with the raid on the camp
anyway.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official who negotiated the
stand-down had said efforts would be made to peacefully end the
confrontations Tuesday. There was no government comment after the
raids.
	   Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel,
hours before the raids on the park. He looked weary and nervous.
	   After a brief meeting with his opposition ally, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy returned to the U.N. offices in the company
of Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s special envoy in Cambodia.
	   ``It's probably the safest place in Phnom Penh,'' said his
spokesman, Rich Garrella. ``They say they rescinded the warrant,
but that's meaningless.''
	   The ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada, Australia,
Japan and Singapore consulted with the U.N. representative. The
contents of the talks were not immediately known.
	   Sam Rainsy was uncharacteristically closemouthed with the media,
responding simply ``Yes'' to questions of whether he had been
frightened and was now relieved.

Netanyahu approves sale of fighter planes to Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved
the sale of 10 MiG-21 fighter planes to Ethiopia despite objections
from neighboring Eritrea, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries had been deteriorating since last year and in June
a border dispute boiled over into armed clashes.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, could not immediately be
reached for comment Tuesday.
	   Bushinsky told The Jerusalem Post that Netanyahu decided not to
block the arms deal because he expected the conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea to die down by the time the aircraft are
delivered next year.

Speculation centers on several names as Vogts' successor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's soccer chiefs searched
Tuesday for a successor to national team coach Berti Vogts, who had
to call in police to protect him from reporters after his
resignation.
	   Dozens of reporters and camera crews assembled in front of
Vogts' house in Korschenbroich, near Duesseldorf, late Monday, soon
after Vogts' resignation became known.
	   Vogts called in the police, who asked the reporters to leave.
``We are still watching the area,'' police spokesman Wilfried
Goertz said.
	   The media-shy Vogts stepped down after eight years in the job
following relentless criticism from the press over Germany's
quarterfinal ouster at this summer's World Cup in France and dismal
performances in two exhibition matches last week.
	   While Vogts tried to stay away from the spot light, German
soccer federation president Egidius Braun scrapped a trip to Turkey
to concentrate on finding a successor.
	   The front runners for the job seemed to be former Real Madrid
coach Jupp Heynckes and Christoph Daum, coach of Bayer Leverkusen.
	   Heynckes was fired by Real Madrid although he led the Spanish
club to the Champions Cup title last season.
	   A former forward on the Borussia Moenchengladbach team while
Vogts was a defender there, Heynckes has coached a number of top
German clubs, including Bayern Munich.
	   Heynckes declined to comment as he checked his wife into a
hospital for an operation. ``I have other worries now,'' he said.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, now Bayern president and Vogts' predecessor
as national team coach, endorsed Heynckes for the job, while ruling
out himself.
	   ``That part of my life is over, I can't always take three steps
forward and one step backward,'' said Beckenbauer, who coached
Germany to its last World Cup title, in 1990.
	   Daum, recently mentioned by Vogts as the ideal successor, has a
contract with Bayer Leverkusen through 2001 and the club may not be
willing to release him.
	   While the name of former Dutch star Johan Cruyff also has been
mentioned, the German soccer federation is unlikely to go for a
foreign coach.

JAT continues flying, but prepares for EU ban

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national carrier JAT
kept flying its flights to European Union countries Tuesday, but
prepared to be shut out of the airports under a new EU ban due to
take effect imminently.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT's officials said flights would continue to EU countries
until they receive an official notification about the ban.
	   European officials indicated the ban was expected to go into
effect Tuesday, when it was published in the EU gazette.
	   But JAT flights will still be allowed for another year to
Britain, which said that under a 1959 air services agreement it is
required to give 12 months' notice before cancelling flights.
	   ``We are strongly in favor of the flight ban and we agreed to
it, but we have a pre-existing legal obligation that we must
honor,`` said a Foreign Office spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   JAT, which was banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo
against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo. Independent
Belgrade media claimed Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the new EU ban
against the Yugoslav national carrier but suggested no reciprocal
measures be adopted against foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   The government called the ban ``another sad example of
discriminatory and capricious'' acts against Yugoslavia and
``indirect support for terrorism in Kosovo,'' the state news agency
Tanjug reported.

Swiss architect wins top prize

 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Swiss architect Peter Zumthor on
Tuesday won the third edition of the dlrs 220,000 Carlsberg
Architectural Prize, the biggest award in the field.
	   He is best known for the Kunsthaus museum in Bregenz, Austria,
and the Thermal Bath Spa in Vals, Switzerland.
	   ``Light and its proper handling, dramatic or delicately graded,
is a key element in all his works,'' the six-person jury said in
its citation. ``It is always handled with imagination and
innovation, but his buildings are deeply sensuous at many levels
and play upon the senses of smell, touch and hearing as well as
sight.''
	   The 55-year-old architect also designed the ``Typographie des
Terrors,'' a Holocaust archive and exhibition hall, currently under
construction in Berlin. He also is in charge of the Swiss pavilion
at Expo 2000.
	   Zumthor was chosen from among 26 candidates from more than 20
countries nominated by the international architectural press.
	   The prize, given every three years, was first given in 1992, to
Tadao Ando of Japan. The 1995 winner was Juha Leiviska of Finland.

Tudjman amnesties woman jailed for moving into empty flat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ In a rare concession to public and media
appeals, President Franjo Tudjman on Tuesday amnestied a woman who
was jailed for moving into an unoccupied apartment after she lost
her job.
	   Jadranka Basic, a 40-year-old mother of two, was jailed three
weeks ago after she refused to leave the apartment in the southern
coastal town of Split. She was convicted of occupying the apartment
illegally.
	   The flat was previously owned by Basic's former company, Adria
Color. Basic moved in after she was fired and left without a source
of income or place to live.
	   Basic argued that she topped the list of the company's workers
who were to be taken care of before she was fired. She also had
said she could not afford to pay for a rented flat.

Greece accuses Turkish warplanes of violating its air space
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece complained Tuesday that Turkish
warplanes violated its national air space and international air
traffic regulations in areas controlled by Greek civil aviation
authorities. Turkey denied the claim.
	   Air force spokesman Col. Kosmas Vouras said a total of 26
Turkish fighter jets violated national air space seven times and
the Athens Flight Information Region 14 times late Monday, seven
nautical miles (13 kilometers) from the northeastern Aegean Sea
islands of Limnos and Lesvos.
	   Mock dogfights ensued on eight occasions, while 10 of the
Turkish aircraft were armed, Vouras said.
	   The Athens FIR is an area which includes international air space
and is under the jurisdiction of Greek commercial air traffic
controllers. Aircraft must file flight plans when they enter it,
but Turkey contends military jets from allied countries are not
obliged to file such plans.
	   ``The allegations are totally untrue. The Turkish air force is
carrying out its routine activities within the international
airspace,'' said Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Sermet
Atacanli.
	   Greece says its national air space extends to 10 miles but
Turkey recognizes only six, leading to frequent claims of
violations by Athens.

Netanyahu approves sale of fighter planes to Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved
the sale of 10 MiG-21 fighter planes to Ethiopia despite objections
from neighboring Eritrea, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993. Relations between the two Horn of
Africa countries have deteriorated year and in June a border
dispute boiled over into armed clashes.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, could not immediately be
reached for comment Tuesday.
	   Bushinsky told The Jerusalem Post that Netanyahu decided not to
block the arms deal because he expected the conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea to die down by the time the aircraft are
delivered next year.

Malaysian PM says ousted deputy flirting with arrest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Tuesday attacked his ousted deputy as immoral and accused him of
courting arrest to become a political martyr.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, Mahathir's former protege, was stripped of his
posts of deputy and finance minister last Wednesday on allegations
ranging from sexual misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were crafted by the
government to undermine his reform challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule. The two have also clashed on economic policy.
	   ``His morals are not good,'' Mahathir told reporters in his most
extensive public comments so far on Anwar's firing. ``He has such
low morals to get involved in such activities.''
	   ``He is trying his best to get the government to arrest him, so
he will become a martyr,'' said Mahathir, who once wooed Anwar into
his political party and helped make him the second most powerful
man in Malaysia.
	   Mahathir was scheduled later Tuesday to explain to 3,500 members
of the ruling United Malays National Organization why he dumped
Anwar from his posts and expelled him from UMNO.
	   Since the ouster, Anwar has been giving nightly speeches at his
home, declaring his innocence. He has also pledged to go on a
campaign to push for press freedoms and transparency within the
government _ reportedly infuriating the 72-year-old Mahathir.
	   A movement condemning government cronyism and corruption,
floated at the July UMNO convention, was seen to have Anwar's stamp
on it. Mahathir crushed the campaign.
	   On Tuesday, Anwar said his charges of cronyism were not directed
at Mahathir, but at the government.
	   ``We have to make certain reforms, adjustments to our policies,
to make sure they're more transparent,'' he said.
	   The sex allegations against Anwar first surfaced in a book, ``50
Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM.'' They range from the simple
groping of women to charges of sodomy. The police are investigating
and have filed affidavits in court.
	   Anwar has remained holed up at his residence since he was sacked
and then expelled from UMNO on Thursday. He said Tuesday he had
canceled a nationwide tour to launch his political reform campaign.
His wife, Azizah Ismail, said they were worried Anwar would be
arrested along the way.
	   More and varied people have been attending Anwar's nightly
gatherings. On Monday night, some 2,000 people packed the yard
outside his home in the posh Damansara neighborhood.

Explosions in Macau street injure 14 police, journalists

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior
police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said.
	   The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the
first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to
punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
	   Witnesses said a police officer's car exploded first. When
police and journalists gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb
apparently hidden in a motorcycle parked nearby exploded and
injured the crowd at around 2 a.m.
	   TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for
help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another
explosion. Police said the second bomb was believed to have been
set off by remote control.
	   The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained
hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday. Police said the injured
officers were members of the judiciary and security units.
	   Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions. But
police said the two incidents were probably not related.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the
explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said
Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the
population and the territory's stability.''
	   Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but
the motive was not yet known. They said they were searching for two
men, both aged 30.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Macau
to take tougher acts against crime lest the violence jeopardize the
Portuguese colony's smooth return to Beijing next year.
	   ``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will
conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take
further, effective measures to recover sound public security,'' Zhu
said.
	   Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed
shock and anger. The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong
statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to
injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. The
enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to
Chinese rule in December 1999.

Hong Kong government ready to prop up currency, stocks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout to ADD new comments by the financial
secretary; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong government will intervene to prop
up the territory's dollar if selling pressure on the currency
becomes heavy, the financial secretary said Tuesday.
	   The authorities would also keep buying stocks and futures
contracts to support prices if they detect harmful speculative
activities again, Donald Tsang told legislators.
	   Tsang's comments came after the government announced two
separate packages of measures to bolster the Hong Kong dollar's peg
to the U.S. currency and increase the government's control over
other local markets.
	   These measures, including fines, prison terms and expulsion of
brokers from the stock exchange for breaking market regulations,
are aimed at curtailing harmful short selling activities.
	   Short selling refers to investors who sell borrowed stocks or
currencies and buy them back later to return them at a promised
date, hoping the prices would fall and they can pocket the
difference.
	   Investors short selling in both the currencies and stock
markets, driving interest rates up and depressing stock prices at
the same time, have been blamed for volatility in the market.
	   To lift share prices to levels where speculators were stuck with
huge losses, the government launched a two-week buying spree of
stocks and futures late last month.
	   Tsang told legislators the government had spent slightly more
than expected on stock purchases, but didn't give an exact figure.
Market players estimate it has spent 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 96
billion in foreign reserves.
	   After a meeting with his senior advisers, Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa told reporters the market controls are needed to keep
interest rates low, set the stage for economic recovery and protect
the banking system.
	   ``A volatile interest rate environment will create difficulties
to our economic recovery, disturb our financial foundation ...(and)
may eventually affect our banking,'' he said.
	   These controls have been praised by some as a way to clamp down
on financial market chaos, while critics say the moves are late and
could scare away foreign investors.
	   Speaking on government-owned Radio Hong Kong earlier Tuesday,
Tsang said international cooperation is necessary to restore market
order.
	   ``We believe there has to be some ... internationally agreed
discipline in regulating the flow of funds which are used for
speculative purposes of this kind,'' he said.
	   Buoyed by the new measures, the main Hang Seng Index soared 7.9
percent Monday, and rose another 1.4 percent Tuesday.
	   But Jerome Fung, a research analyst at Lippo Securities in Hong
Kong, said investors have generally overlooked the market controls'
negative impact on investor confidence.
	   A survey of senior executives by the Hong Kong Policy Research
Institute indicated that 51 percent agreed with the government
intervention, while 41 percent disagreed.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A telecom satellite for Singapore and Taiwan,
which blasted into space from French Guiana on Aug. 25, on Tuesday
reached its final orbit destination, Singapore TV reported.
	   Singapore Telecom said transmissions between ST-1 satellite and
its ground stations indicated that the satellite was working well,
the report said.
	   Shortly after ST-1 reached its location, control of the
satellite was transferred from Stevenage, Britain, to the Seletar
Earth Station in Singapore.
	   Built by Matra Marconi Space for Singapore Telecom and Chunghwa
Telecom of Taiwan, the ST-1 telecommunications satellite, in orbit
over the Indian Ocean, will cover the Middle East and Far East for
the next 12 years. It was launched by an Ariane rocket, built by
the European Space Agency.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy mediating between Israel
and the Palestinians believes progress is possible, but doubts a
deal will be concluded during his visit to the Middle East this
week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater Palestinian
effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials were to meet Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation the three sides
had worked out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue for Ross will be the scope of an Israeli
pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent, Israel
accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of the land
set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full security
control and Palestinian land use restricted.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians agreed to the proposal in
principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said no agreement
was reached and that gaps remained wide.
	   Netanyahu reportedly suspects that Arafat was prodded by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to withdraw concessions he had
already made to Israel.
	   Netanyahu was to send two senior aides, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad, to Cairo on Wednesday to try
and soften Mubarak's position, the prime minister's office said.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
conflicting Israeli and Palestinian assessments on whether progress
had been made were part of an attempt to stake out positions ahead
of Ross' arrival.
	   Ross, a veteran of several exhausting and unsuccessful Mideast
shuttles, would not have agreed to return to the region if he did
not believe progress was possible, the official said.
	   However, this does not mean an agreement on the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation can be reached at the end of
this trip, the official said.

South Asian groups to lobby governments for legal rights for
</HEADLINE>
refugees &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Human rights groups are lobbying South
Asian governments to sign United Nations treaties and implement
laws protecting the rights of millions of people displaced by war
or religious repression, a leader of the campaign said Tuesday.
	   Some 30 delegates from India and neighboring countries like
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka met in New Delhi
this week and have begun finalizing drafts for national laws and
regional agreements on refugees. The drafts will be translated into
local languages within three months.
	   ``None of these countries have laws for refugees and none of
them have signed the U.N. declarations (on refugee rights). When
you have no law, everything becomes arbitrary,'' Tapan Kumar Bose,
secretary general of the South Asia Forum for Human Rights, said
Tuesday after the three-day meeting.
	   The forum estimates that at least 2 million people in South Asia
have crossed international borders due to armed conflicts, economic
hardship, religious conversion or environmental degradation.
	   While demanding governments sign the U.N.'s 1951 convection and
the 1967 protocol on refugees, most delegates criticized the
treaties as limited.
	   ``Displacement is not just due to war. It is more often due to
religious persecution and dictatorial rule. We want to go back to
the countries we came from with justice and dignity,'' said Thin
Thin Aung, a refugee who fled from Myanmar, formerly known as
Burma, eight years ago.
	   Some 45,000 Myanmar citizens have taken refuge in India due to a
military crackdown and forced labor, she said.
	   India and Pakistan have the largest number of refugees, but
successive governments have declined to ratify international
treaties on grounds that supporting refugees would devastate local
economies.

Shell and Petrofina announce swap properties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shell Europe Oil Products plans to take over
Petrofina service stations in Norway in exchange for a number of
Shell stations in the Netherlands, the companies announced Tuesday.
	   The swap is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
with the number of Shell stations to be taken over still under
discussion, the companies said.
	   Petrofina said the agreement is designed to allow the company to
concentrate marketing activities around its refineries.
	   The Brussels-based company said it plans to give up its
marketing activities in Norway, even though its Norske Fina unit
has improved operations and market share there over recent years.
	   Phil Tuberville, president of London-based Shell Europe Oil
Products, said the exchange would bolster the position of his
company in the Norwegian market, particularly through its Select
convenience stores.
	   Petrofina has 112 employees at 182 service stations and four
loading terminals in Norway. In the Netherlands, Shell employs
2,262 people at 780 service stations, three terminals and a
refinery.

Malaysia's PM: Economic woes won't cause political chaos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said
Tuesday that the country's worsening economic problems will not
lead to political chaos and ethnic strife.
	   ``We are still politically stable, and our multiracial
population still gets along well,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
told a business seminar.
	   Malaysia's economic problems, spurred by the Asian financial
crisis, are deepening. The economy contracted by almost 7 percent
in the second quarter of 1998, pushing it into full-blown
recession.
	   The prime minister blamed foreign investors for causing the
crisis, which has caused Malaysia to lose dlrs 60 billion from its
gross domestic product, while dlrs 500 billion have been
obliterated from the stock market.
	   Although he didn't directly refer to his firing last week of
Anwar Ibrahim, former finance minister and deputy prime minister,
he said that non-government organizations were eroding the
authority of his administration.
	   Many such organizations, ranging from the Malaysian Trades Union
Congress to human rights groups, have cried foul over Anwar's
dismissal.
	   Anwar was ousted by Mahathir amid a slew of police affidavits
which accused him of everything from sodomy to treason. Anwar
denies the charges, calling them a conspiracy to protect Mahathir's
rule.
	   Mahathir also continued his spirited defense of sweeping
currency curbs he introduced last week, which effectively pegs the
ringgit at 3.80 against the U.S. dollar.
	   Some economists have warned that the peg may crumble, but the
prime minister waved that notion aside.
	   Hours after he spoke, however, the benchmark Composite Index,
which monitors 100 blue-chip stocks, on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange plummeted by 21 percent. Traders said the nose-dive was
due to sharp selling by foreign investors and panic-selling by
local buyers.

 &UR; Russian ruble remains unstable, no rate set Tuesday &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with feud between government and Central Bank. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A feud between Russia's government and the
country's Central Bank escalated Tuesday with both sides accusing
the other of mishandling the worsening economic crisis.
	   In a related development, the government said the federal budget
would have to be revised for the rest of this year and next year
due to the financial turmoil. Also, the ruble remained highly
volatile Tuesday, trading at around 20 to the U.S. dollar at
currency exchange booths throughout the capital.
	   Speaking for the government, Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy
premier and tax chief, said the Central Bank should ``stop the
games with the ruble rate.''
	   ``At today's rate, the Central Bank could easily buy all the
rubles in circulation,'' added Fyodorov.
	   Both the government and the Central Bank believe that the ruble
has fallen too far. The ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar
before the crisis began less than a month ago.
	   However, neither the government nor the Central Bank has
announced a plan to halt the slide of the ruble, which is currently
at the mercy of the market.
	   Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin, who offered his
resignation Monday, was sharply critical of the government, saying
it had failed to implement a meaningful anti-crisis program.
	   ``Under my leadership, the Central Bank did not print worthless
money,'' Dubinin said in a statement Monday. ``However, monetary
policies cannot forever compensate for weaknesses in tax collection
and the management of the national debt.''
	   Meanwhile, Moscow's interbank currency exchange again failed to
provide a formal ruble rate against the U.S. dollar Tuesday. Still,
street trading at currency exchange booths carried on without
interruption.
	   The interbank exchange normally sets a rate in the morning which
serves as a benchmark for the day. But in the present turmoil, it
has failed to set a rate on some days, adding to the uncertainty
about the ruble's real value.
	   Government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said that while the
pre-crisis rate made the ruble overvalued, the current street
exchange rate was ``pure speculation.''
	   Since the crisis hit, people have been scrambling to get their
money out of the banks and prices have soared. This week has
provided only more bad news.
	   Central Bank hard currency reserves are down to dlrs 11 billion,
about half of what they were a year ago, officials said Tuesday.
	   Also, government officials said federal budget for the rest of
1998 and 1999 would have to be revised. The interim Cabinet will
discuss an emergency budget Thursday, said Shabdurasulov, the
government spokesman.
	   Many Russians who receive their salaries in fast-devaluing
rubles are stocking up on household items, clothing and basic
foodstuffs which are sometimes sold at pre-crisis prices.
	   Automatic banking machines have stopped operating in Moscow and
elsewhere, and many businesses have stopped honoring credit cards,
making it difficult for some people to obtain cash or make
payments.

Asian markets close mixed, yen's rise buoys major bourses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with market closing in Indonesia, Thailand, grafs 4-5,
19; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
the three leading bourses posting moderate gains on a stronger
Japanese currency and positive local news.
	   The benchmark Composite Index in Malaysia, which imposed strict
currency and stock trading controls last week, fell 21 percent on
profit-taking, largely erasing Monday's 22.5 percent gain.
	   Profit-taking also dragged down shares in Thailand, where the
key stock index sank 3.5 percent. Stock markets in South Korea and
Australia also declined, falling 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent lower,
respectively.
	   In Jakarta, the main index shed 1.6 percent as many investors
stayed sidelined amid a new wave of riots.
	   Indonesian police early Tuesday used batons and tear gas to
evict some 2,000 student protesters from the grounds of the
national Parliament in Jakarta. Riots also were reported in other
areas.
	   In Japan, the U.S. dollar lost ground against the yen, reaching
131.99 yen in late afternoon trading, down 0.07 yen from the
previous day. Tokyo's benchmark 255-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed 0.83 percent higher at 14,913.49, adding to Monday's 5
percent gain.
	   Hong Kong's main Hang Seng Index advanced 1.4 percent following
Monday's 7.9 percent increase, and Singapore's Straits Times Index
rose 0.8 percent after a 7.1 percent gain the day before.
	   Other markets closing higher included those in Taiwan, up 2.1
percent; New Zealand, up 1.6 percent; and the Philippines, up 0.4
percent.
	   ``The yen has gotten stronger ... There's no reason regional
stock markets shouldn't recover,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice
president of Diversified Securities Inc. in Manila.
	   The yen strengthened Tuesday as overseas funds tried to make up
for losses on their Russian investments by taking profits on dollar
positions, dealers said.
	   Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   Worries that Latin America might become the next victim of a
spreading global financial crisis and the recent drop in U.S. stock
prices also dampened interest in the dollar, traders said.
	   In Hong Kong, investors reacted positively to measures announced
Monday to limit short-selling, which has been blamed for the recent
chaos in the financial market.
	   The government announced a 30-point plan, including increased
fines and jail terms for investors caught illegally carrying out
short sales and expulsion from the stock exchange for brokers who
break trading rules.
	   In Malaysia, dealers said the drop was expected after the sharp
gains recorded since last week when the government imposed strict
currency and stock trading controls and set an exchange rate of
three ringgit to the U.S. dollar.
	   They said panic selling by retail investors, many of whom jumped
into the market Monday, also added to the drop.
	   In Thailand, dealers said the market was continually overcast
with negative sentiment on a banking sector with non-performing
loans touching 40 percent of all lending.
	   Jerome Fung, research analyst at Lippo Securities in Hong Kong,
said investors in the region have not yet digested the long-term,
negative impact of recently-announced market controls imposed in
Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
	   They have also ignored that fact that there have been no real
improvements in the financial fundamentals, he said.
	   ``Most foreign funds are sidelined,'' Fung said. ``The outlook
is still negative.''

More than 100 arrested after two days of rioting in Central Java

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs returned to the streets of a town
in Central Java province for second consecutive day of looting and
arson Tuesday, police and residents said.
	   Violence broke out Monday in Kebumen, about 350 kilometers (218
miles) southeast of Jakarta. Trouble flared again Tuesday with
attacks against dozens of Chinese-owned shops.
	   Local police chief Col. Dedi S.K. said 112 people were arrested
He said 49 shops, 23 cars and five motorcycles were damaged or set
afire.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only a small fraction of Indonesia's
population. However, they are active in commerce and industry and
have become scapegoats for Indonesia's economic problems, the worst
in 30 years.
	   Dedi said three people were reported injured: a police officer
and two fire fighters who were pelted with stones by rioters. Dedi
said the situation in the town was under control late Tuesday.
	   However, some residents contacted by The Associated Press
reported sporadic looting. Mobs were breaking into shops that had
been shut by frightened owners.
	   ``Some people including children looted shops near my house.
Another tried to set fire to a shop,'' said one woman, who
identified herself by the single name, Rianti.
	   The trouble broke out Monday after a fight between a local man
and an ethnic Chinese shopkeeper.
	   The rioting in Kebumen is the latest in a series to hit
crisis-ridden Indonesia recently.
	   Last week two people were killed and 12 were injured when riots
erupted in Lhokseumawe on the northern tip of Sumatra island, an
area that endured years of repression by Indonesia's military
following a separatist uprising in the late 1980s.
	   Those riots came after a major pullout by the army, but the mobs
soon turned on members of the ethnic Chinese minority.
	   In Jakarta on Tuesday security personnel clashed with students
outside the Parliament after several thousand protests demanded
that President B.J. Habibie resign.
	   Also on Tuesday police said they arrested 11 people after mobs
looted two warehouses and stole 80 tons of rice and 40 tons of
sugar in Pontianak, on the island of Borneo, about 800 kilometers
(500 miles) north of Jakarta.

European truckers strike to defend better working conditions

<TEXT>
	   REKKEM, Belgium (AP) _ Truckers from France and neighboring
countries rallied at dawn Tuesday to slow down traffic at border
crossings as part of a one-day strike to demand shorter working
hours.
	   At this French-Belgian border post, dozens of truckers slowed
traffic on both sides of the highway down to a steady trickle.
Under a persistent drizzle, they handed leaflets out to all drivers
crossing the frontier.
	   Similar actions were held in France at English Channel ports,
and on France's borders with Luxembourg, Italy and Spain, and in
Portugal.
	   ``There is a European Union law on working hours, we want it to
be properly implemented,'' said Rene Duhem, spokesman for the
French Workers' Force union.
	   He said many French truckers were obliged by their employers to
spend up to 60 hours on the road, creating a dangerous level of
fatigue.
	   ``Normally, drivers are supposed to take a 45-minute break after
they have driven four and a half hours. But this rarely happens,''
Dehem said.
	   The strike is a warning to employers ahead of a meeting with
labor unions scheduled Sept. 18 to find an agreement on working
conditions across Europe, Duhem said.
	   EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock urged both sides to
approve a draft agreement that will limit average working hours for
truck and coach drivers to 45 hours a week.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spend
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   ``This issue is literally a matter of life and death,'' Romolo
Vivarelli, spokesman for the Federation of Transport Workers'
Unions in the European Union, told a news conference in Brussels.
	   He said that in 1996, more than 1,300 professional drivers were
killed on European roads, many of them due to exhaustion. The
unions have warned they will step up their action if their demands
are not met.
	   ``We have the means to apply pressure,'' Dehem warned.
``Everything we've obtained so far, we obtained because we took
tough steps.''
	   French truckers are particularly insistent about their working
conditions. Last November a strike by French truckers disrupted the
country for five days, and in 1996 they stopped work for 12 days.
	   French radio said Tuesday that at least 20 roadblocks were in
effect, and more were expected through the day.
	   At Biriatou, a crossing on the Franco-Spanish border, traffic
was totally snarled for four hours. Spanish radio reported that at
La Jonquera, near Spain's border with France, blocked the road for
90 minutes.
	   Portuguese authorities said truck traffic was at a virtual
standstill at the Vilar Formoso-Fuentos de Onoro border crossing in
the northeast of Portugal.

Official: Robinson unlikely to meet dissidents while in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite the U.N. human rights chief's stated
desire to meet a wide range of Chinese, China suggested Tuesday
that Mary Robinson would unlikely see any dissidents.
	   On the third day of her 10-day groundbreaking mission to China,
Robinson met with members of the government-backed women's
federation and the senior official overseeing policies toward
ethnic minorities.
	   When asked by reporters if Robinson would meet any dissidents,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao recited her official
schedule. He noted she would meet with government officials,
government-backed groups and academics and travel to Tibet and
Shanghai.
	   ``I think apart from the set agenda agreed upon by the two
sides, I don't think there will be any other functions or
activities,'' Zhu said at twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Robinson's trip _ the first ever official mission to China by a
U.N. high commissioner for human rights _ has generated pleas from
dissidents to promote tolerance and curb police powers. One
dissident, Chu Hailan, asked her for a meeting to discuss freeing
her jailed, ailing husband, labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun.
	   Upon arriving in Beijing on Sunday, Robinson said she was aware
of the expectations created by her visit. She said she hoped to
``meet a wide range of the civil society in China.''
	   Robinson is treading a careful line. She hopes to promote human
rights and nurture a nascent dialogue with China's Communist Party
leaders without alienating them.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said he hoped Robinson's
trip will ``enhance our mutual understanding and promote China's
cooperation with the U.N. in the human rights field.''
	   China has been leery of discussing human rights with the United
Nations. The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   Speaking to a group of academics Monday, Robinson noted the
``important progress'' China has made in human rights. But she
urged Chinese leaders to make good on a six-month-old pledge to
sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
	   The treaty and along with the Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, are
considered basic guarantees of fundamental rights.

Airplane makers selling jets, but worry about downturn

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ European planemaker Airbus Industrie
scored big wins over rival Boeing on Tuesday, signing deals to sell
16 widebody jets in a batch of orders with list prices of about
dlrs 2.7 billion.
	   Airbus will deliver 10 big A340 models to International Lease
Finance Corp., or ILFC, a Los Angeles group that buys aircraft and
rents them out to air carriers.
	   Terms were not disclosed, but industry sources privately placed
the value of the widebody A340 jets at about dlrs 1.5 billion. ILFC
also ordered six smaller A320 jets with a list price of about dlrs
300 million.
	   The Dubai-based carrier Emirates ordered six A340-500 models,
with an asking price of roughly dlrs 900 million. Emirates took
options on another 10 A340s, which could add another dlrs 1.5
billion to its deal with Airbus, the consortium from France,
Britain, Germany and Spain.
	   The Emirates chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, told
reporters he would use the new Airbus jets to launch nonstop
flights from the Gulf to points as far away as North America and
Australia.
	   Airbus landed its orders on the second day of the Farnborough
International 98 show, the industry's top event of the year where
the Boeing Co., of Seattle, has thus far announced just dlrs 1.1
billion in new orders.
	   The planemakers are enjoying boom times along with busy
airlines, and Airbus indicated it will try to take advantage of
this by raising its asking prices by 3 percent, even though
analysts warn that the aviation business is headed for a sharp
downturn in 2000.
	   Boeing earlier raised list prices by about 5 percent.
	   The chief operating officer at ILFC, John Plueger, told a news
conference his company is looking beyond the imminent sluggish
market to a sharp increase in air travel by the middle of the next
decade. By then, Plueger is bullish about an Asian economic
recovery and strong demand for airline seats in the region.
	   ``The industry has reached a crescendo now, a peak,'' Plueger
said. ``The period 2002-2006 will be quite robust.''
	   Although air shows give planemakers the opportunity to hype
their orders and talk of building bigger and better aircraft, it
has become clear this week that the manufacturers see a growing
market for smaller jets.
	   The Canadian company Bombardier announced Tuesday it wants to
build a new 90-seat regional jet, dubbed the BRJ-X series.
	   Bombardier's chairman and chief executive, Laurent Beaudoin,
called the planned model ``the next logical step'' in the
short-haul aviation market.
	   Earlier, Airbus outlined plans for a 100-seat A318 model that it
hopes to build to compete with Boeing's recently launched small 717
jets.

Myanmar opposition party says government detains 220 members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Backing its threats with action, the
military government has detained 220 members of the opposition
National League for Democracy, including 63 would-be members of
parliament, the party said Tuesday.
	   ``The National League for Democracy calls for the unconditional
release of its members and strongly condemns the arbitrary arrests
by the authorities,'' said a written statement from the party.
	   The NLD and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, have announced plans
to sometime this month convene the parliament elected in 1990 but
never allowed by the military to meet. The NLD won a landslide
victory in the election.
	   The military has warned the NLD that convening parliament on its
own would be illegal and would result in the arrests of its members
and possibly revoking of the party's legal status.
	   The league on Monday had reported the arrests of 110 of its
members. Tallies of detentions are slow because communications are
poor in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   The new tally of NLD detainees, updated through Monday, includes
members from the capital.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to hold meetings of its members have
been met with mass arrests by the government, but in some previous
crackdowns only members from provincial areas were detained.
	   The government indirectly confirmed the crackdown in a statement
issued Monday night, saying it had ``invited'' members of the NLD
to official guesthouses for an exchange of views on the party's
plans to convene parliament.
	   The term ``invited'' is generally understood to be a euphemism
for ``detained.'' The guesthouses have been used in the past during
periods of political tension for temporary detention of dissidents.
	   A government spokesman, replying to a faxed query from The
Associated Press in Bangkok, Thailand, said he did not know the
number of NLD members invited for discussions.
	   It was difficult to say how long the discussions would continue,
he said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Monday's government statement said the government ``has
requested these NLD members to cooperate ... in working together in
the maintenance of the prevailing peace, stability and national
unity of the nation.''
	   A commentary in state-run newspapers meanwhile suggested that
opposition leader Suu Kyi had been conspiring with Western
countries to create disturbances and should be deported for
allegedly concealing that she was a British citizen.
	   Personal attacks on Suu Kyi are common in the state press but in
recent weeks there has been more mention than usual about the
possibility of deporting her.

Seoul official expresses concern over North Korea's nuclear program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A top South Korean official expressed
concern Tuesday about Japan's refusal to endorse its financial
commitment to a program designed to steer North Korea away from
developing nuclear weapons.
	   In a 1994 pact, North Korea agreed to halt nuclear weapons
development in exchange for two 1,000 megawatts Western-built
reactors and 500,000 tons of annual fuel oil shipments until the
reactors are built by 2003.
	   The four key financiers _ the United States, South Korea, Japan
and the European Union _ had planned to adopt a resolution on
funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion project early last week.
	   But after a missile test by the North last week, Japan is
refusing to endorse its dlrs 1 billion financial commitment.
	   ``We must guide North Korea toward the direction that it would
not develop nuclear weapons,'' Unification Minister Kang In-duk
told a luncheon meeting with foreign reporters.
	   Kang expressed concern that the Japanese move could jeopardize
the crucial nuclear deal with North Korea.
	   ``Without the implementation of the nuclear reactor project, it
would be difficult to solve the North Korean nuclear problem,'' he
said.
	   ``I am aware how angry Japan is over the missile issue. But I am
sure that Japan also knows the importance of the nuclear reactor
project,'' he said.
	   North Korea already is complaining that the project is lagging
behind and threatened to reactivate its nuclear weapons
development.
	   Despite denials, North Korea, a reclusive communist nation, is
believed to have already obtained enough weapons-grade plutonium to
make at least one atomic bomb.
	   The minister also said North Korea's recent structural change
shows that the isolated communist country will continue to rely on
its military and develop weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``North Korea's latest slogan is building a `strong and
prosperous' nation. We believe that the word `strong' implies that
the North will continue to build its military strength,'' Kang
said.
	   Under a constitutional amendment approved by its legislature on
Saturday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was reelected head of the
National Defense Commission, a post that makes him the nation's
head of state.
	   The latest North Korean missile, which is believed to have been
test-fired on Aug. 31, is known to have an estimated range of 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) that can reach Japan and the U.S.
territory of Guam.

Alatas: Indonesian missions abroad receive bomb threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Tuesday that a number of Indonesian missions abroad have received
bomb threats in connection with alleged rapes of ethnic Chinese
during riots in May.
	   Speaking at a parliament hearing, Alatas said the threats _
conveyed through telephone calls, petitions, leaflets and the
Internet _ came so far from unspecified groups in Hong Kong, Los
Angeles and Canada.
	   He added that those in Canada even threatened to destroy the
Indonesian Embassy's Internet network by sending an e-mail bomb,
prompting the mission to turn off the system temporarily.
	   According to Alatas, extensive reports about the alleged rapes
of Chinese women during the May 13-14 riots have helped to create a
negative image of Indonesian abroad.
	   He said protests against Indonesia have been held in Kuala
Lumpur, The Hague, London, Paris, San Francisco, New York, Bonn and
Washington.
	   However, there have been no reports of attacks on Indonesian
interests abroad, he said.
	   Human rights and women activists have claimed that 168 women and
girls were raped during the two-day riots, many of them ethnic
Chinese who were targeted for their affluence.
	   Police said they have not yet found any evidence of the rapes,
but some activists claim many victims are too frightened or ashamed
to go to the police.
	   Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and buildings were ransacked
and burned during the riot that helped oust former President
Suharto from his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, has established an
independence fact-finding team which is now probing the riots,
including the rapes.

Inter Milan's Colonnese gets four-match ban, club appeals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Inter Milan has appealed against a four-match ban
imposed on defender Francesco Colonnese by European soccer's
governing body, UEFA said Tuesday.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body suspended Colonnese after
the player was sent off for elbowing an opponent during the first
leg of Inter's Champions League second qualifying round encounter
against FC Skonto Riga of Latvia on August 12.
	   Colonnese was one of 24 players who received suspensions ranging
from one to five matches from the committee, a UEFA statement said.
	   The panel decided to fine Turkish team Samsunspor 50,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 35,460) after an object was thrown during its
Intertoto Cup match with German side Werder Bremen on August 5.
UEFA didn't give details of the incident.
	   Panel members also handed down fines to a long list of teams for
incidents ranging from improper conduct of players or supporters,
to failure to observe UEFA competition regulations.

Taiwan computer giant calls off purchase of Siemens' plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese computer giant Acer Group said
Tuesday it has called off a plan to purchase a personal computer
factory of the German firm Siemens because of the Asian financial
crisis.
	   Acer began negotiations with Siemens AG last April to buy the
plant in Augsburg, Germany, for an undisclosed amount to expand its
global computer business.
	   But the negotiations halted recently as Acer decided to exercise
caution in investment in the face of the regional financial crisis
that has shown no signs of abating, the group said in a statement.
	   It also said the group is now preoccupied with revamping its
loss-making semiconductor unit, formerly known as TI-Acer Inc.
After Texas Instruments pulled out of the venture early this year,
Acer took over its shares.
	   Simon Lin, president of Acer Inc., said the group now must give
top consideration to the semiconductor firm in terms of working
capital supply and other financial arrangements.
	   The Taiwanese company has faced intensified problems over the
past year owing largely to its unprofitable chip ventures and U.S.
subsidiaries.
	   Last month, the Acer Group slashed its net profit forecast for
this year by 36 percent to 3.5 billion Taiwan dollars (about U.S.
dlrs 100 million), following similar cuts made by other large
electronics companies.
	   Established in 1976, Acer is the world's third-largest personal
computer maker.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin huddled with top aides at his
country residence Tuesday amid growing speculation he may choose a
compromise candidate for prime minister to resolve a standoff with
parliament.
	   Yeltsin had said that Viktor Chernomyrdin was his only choice to
lead a new government that must deal with the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   The president spent the day conferring with senior aides at his
country home, Gorky 9, outside Moscow. But as of Tuesday afternoon,
Yeltsin had still not named his candidate for prime minister and
was unlikely to do so before Wednesday, the president's spokesman,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The delay suggested that Yeltsin was mulling over the
possibility of a compromise figure instead of renominating
Chernomyrdin, who has been rejected twice in two weeks by a hostile
parliament. Yeltsin has compromised in the past when government
policies have run into major political opposition.

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Seven African presidents, many
of whom back opposing sides in Congo's war, said Tuesday they were
close to a cease-fire agreement, but Congolese rebels disavowed any
part in it.
	   The rebels stalked out of the meeting site at a hotel in this
resort at 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), complaining they had been snubbed
at Tuesday's joint talks.
	   ``They will only know we exist when we start shooting,'' snapped
rebel leader Bizima Karaha.
	   Karaha said the rebels ``support a cease-fire'' but added:
``Because we have been excluded from this, we are not bound by
it.''
	   If the rebels are merely puppets of Uganda and Rwanda, as
Congolese President Laurent Kabila claims, then the agreement being
worked out by the seven presidents _ including the leaders of
Rwanda and Uganda _ could stop the fighting.
	   But if the rebels are a home-grown and self-supplied outfit as
they claim, then their exclusion from any cease-fire agreement
would virtually doom it.
	   The rebels were on the verge of taking the capital Kinshasa late
last month before Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops helped
Kabila blunt their offensive.
	   After the rebels stormed out of the Elephant Hills Hotel, the
seven heads of state said defense ministers would meet at the
Organization of African Unity headquarters in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, on Thursday to work out details of a cease-fire, the
withdrawal of foreign troops and for political reform in Congo.
	   Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said he hoped the rebels
would honor any agreement.
	   ``People are dying and we must stop these hostilities,'' Chiluba
said.
	   The Congolese rebels, excluded from two previous summits over
the past month, arrived Monday for the talks with Kabila and the
presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face with the rebels.
Instead, Chiluba on Monday shuttled between the two camps during
the talks, said George Charamba, spokesman for Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe. The rebels also met with OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim.
	   Salim said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire that
would ensure the continuation of Kabila's government but also bring
about democratic reforms.
	   But in addition to the rebels not signing on to any agreement,
there is another stumbling block: Kabila has said he will not agree
to a cease-fire until all Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from
Congo, but Uganda and Rwanda deny their troops are backing the
rebels.
	   Meanwhile, in the rebels' eastern Congo stronghold of Goma, a
rebel commander said Tuesday that 25 people were killed and 40
wounded on Monday when planes supporting Kabila's government bombed
the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie for the second straight day. It
was not possible to independently verify the rebel claim.
	   The rebels did not say which of Kabila's allies deployed the
fighter jets. Only Zimbabwe and Angola are known to have military
aircraft.
	   The rebel insurrection began in early August.

	   Fujimori, who arrived late Monday, is accompanied by Foreign
Minister Eduardo Ferero Costa, who will meet counterpart Andrei
Plesu on Wednesday.
	   On Wednesday, Fujimori is expected to sign a bilateral agreement
which aims to combat drug-smuggling. The two countries will also
agree to cooperate in promoting tourism.
	   Fujimori has been Peru's president since 1990. He was re-elected
for another five years in 1995.

power Tuesday after weeks of political conflict, sending riot
police swinging batons, bamboo rods and rifle butts to drive
opposition supporters from a protest camp in front of the National
Assembly.
	   Scattered demonstrators battled with security forces in the
streets, throwing stones and setting fires. Soldiers fired
thousands of rounds of in the air and deployed four fire trucks to
disperse them.
	   Demonstrators tried to slow the police charges by pouring
gasoline across intersections and setting it afire.
	   The surge of riot police through the makeshift shelters broke up
a two-week protest against alleged fraud in Cambodia's July 26
national election. The crowd, which at times numbered 10,000, had
called for the resignation of Hun Sen.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party, whose leader was under U.N.
protection, issued a statement saying the use of force is ``final
proof that Hun Sen cares nothing about democracy or freedom of
expression.''
	   The protestors were trapped for several minutes between lines of
police pushing up from the south and a water cannon directed at
them from the north. Police plowed through the camp, smashing
shelters and pounding women and children with their weapons.
	   An APTV cameraman saw a soldier swing the butt of his rifle at a
woman in her mid 60s, shattering her elbow. Another woman was
smashed in the mouth with a baton.
	   A third elderly woman was hit so hard with a rifle butt that
what appeared to be a piece of the gun went flying loose. She
crumpled to the ground, then picked herself up and ran.
	   No arrests were witnessed. Several people were brought to local
hospitals.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' said On Samath, 30, his head
taped and his shirt spotted with blood. ``The police started
pouring down the street. The next thing I knew, three started to
beat me with electric prods.''
	   The park was a wasteland of plastic sheeting, bags and straw
mats. Soldiers looted the belongings of those who fled, taking
everything from motorcycles to clothing. In the early evening, a
larger than usual file of motorists circled the park and other
trouble spots.
	   The assault followed an ultimatum by Hun Sen ordering the
protesters to leave the site by midnight Monday or he would use
force to evict them. The order came after grenades were tossed into
his Phnom Penh residence. He was not at home, and no one was
injured in the blast.
	   About 10 minutes after the police swarmed into the camp, the
crowd managed to flee on streets running north, slowly pursued by
police and troops firing automatic rifles into the air.
	   The demonstrators staged hit-and-run battles with the security
forces, regrouping to throw stones and loose objects at them.
	   Almost all shops and public places in the capital were closed.
	   Other groups of demonstrators on hundreds of motorcycles cruised
streets near the railway station, staging rock-throwing brawls when
stopped by 100 club-wielding police.
	   Riot police and soldiers armed with assault rifles gradually
asserted control over key intersections. Sullen-looking motorcycle
drivers huddled in large groups, sometimes shouting insults.
	   The motorcycle taxis, whose drivers are a core of opposition
support, had earlier roared through the streets, snarling traffic
and beeping horns to the rhythm of the name of the politician who
has led the protests: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack on his house Monday and
ordered his arrest. The opposition leader spent the night at the
offices of the United Nations representative in Cambodia in a
luxury Phnom Penh hotel surrounded by police.
	   Political tensions in Cambodia had apparently eased slightly
late Monday after soldiers trying to disperse protestors killed at
least one man and injured several others. The government backed off
its plan to arrest Sam Rainsy and rescinded the deadline for the
protests to end.
	   But on Tuesday, police went ahead with the raid on the camp
anyway.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official who negotiated the
stand-down, had said efforts would be made to peacefully end the
confrontations Tuesday. There was no government comment after the
raids.
	   Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel,
hours before the raids on the park. He looked weary and nervous.
	   After a brief meeting with his opposition ally, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy returned to the U.N. offices in the company
of Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s special envoy in Cambodia.
	   ``It's probably the safest place in Phnom Penh,'' said his
spokesman, Rich Garrella.
	   The ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada, Australia,
Japan and Singapore consulted with the U.N. representative. The
contents of the talks were not immediately known.

French government rejects U.S. bid for troubled bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government, concerned over potential job
losses, said Tuesday it had rejected a U.S. bid to buy into
troubled state-owned bank Credit Foncier de France.
	   General Motors Acceptance Corp. and U.S. investor Robert Bass
had tabled the only bid for the bank, which the government has long
sought to privatize in order to shore up its capital.
	   In a statement, the French Finance Ministry said the GMAC/Bass
employment plan ``is insufficiently precise, despite some progress
made over the summer.''
	   GMAC is a subsidiary of the Detroit-based General Motors Corp.
	   The bank's unions had been strongly opposed to the takeover,
saying it would result in large job losses.
	   In January 1997, about 500 employees held a three-week siege at
the bank's headquarters in central Paris to protest government
plans to lay off 3,300 workers. During the first week they held the
bank's president, Jerome Meussonnier, and other executives.
	   The radical downsizing plan came after the bank lost a
staggering dlrs 2 billion in 1995.
	   The bank is currently 90 percent-owned by state-controlled
financial institution Caisse des Depots et Consignations.
	   The government said it would try again to sell the bank in the
coming months, and that the lender would undergo a financial
restructuring before the next sale effort.
	   When a call for bids went out early this year, several other
institutions expressed interest, but other bidders such as the U.S.
GE Capital, the French insurance group Garantie Mutuelle des
Fonctionnaires and the French postal service all dropped out.
	   Credit Foncier has been struggling as a result of bad real
estate loans and because the government ended the bank's monopoly
on certain government-subsidized housing loans.

Slovene police start war crimes investigation against a Croat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ A Croat and former Yugoslav Air Force
pilot who's suspected of attacking a truck convoy during the 1991
``10-Day War'' in Slovenia faces up to 20 years in prison if
convicted of war crimes, police said Tuesday.
	   Vladimir Bodis, a 47-year-old citizen of neighboring Croatia,
was arrested earlier this month as he entered Slovenia. Police in
the northeastern town of Maribor, who disclosed his arrest on
Monday, said Tuesday they had started a criminal investigation
against him.
	   Bodis is suspected of participating in a June 24, 1991 attack on
the Slovenian border town of Sentilj that killed three truck
drivers _ two Turks and a Bulgarian.
	   Authorities said the investigation will likely lead to an
indictment and trial.
	   Slovenia fought a 10-day war with the Serb-led Yugoslav army
after it proclaimed independence from Yugoslavia. The army
eventually withdrew, but the Slovenian conflict was followed by
longer and much bloodier wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
	   Many Croats defected from the Yugoslav army when it got involved
in the Croatian war. Bodis joined the Croatian army and retired
with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
	   There was no immediate reaction in Croatia, but charges against
a Croat could be embarrassing for the country, which fought its own
six-month war against the Yugoslav army. The incident also could
further aggravate strained relations between neighbors Croatia and
Slovenia.
	   Slovenia has tried two former Yugoslav army officers for war
crimes connected with the brief 1991 conflict, as well as several
Slovene citizens suspected of collaboration with the army. But all
were acquitted.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Day after day for three years, Jews
were hauled out of Vilnius' ghetto, marched down a cobblestone road
to a forest, stripped naked and shot dead by Nazis. Aleksandras
Lileikis was head of the city's security police then.
	   Those facts are not in doubt. Whether they are connected has
been disputed for years. On Wednesday, a Lithuanian court is to
begin hearing the arguments when it opens the first Nazi war crimes
trial since the Baltic republic regained independence from the
Soviet Union.
	   Lileikis lived in the United States for 40 years after the war
and worked for a Boston-area Lithuanian publishing house. He
returned to Lithuania in 1995 as the United States was moving to
revoke his citizenship.
	   He is charged with genocide _ with a potential life sentence _
for allegedly taking part in one of World War II's most grisly and
concerted execution campaigns that claimed an estimated 70,000
victims.
	   The killings, during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation, wiped out one
of Europe's liveliest Jewish communities, renowned for its culture
and scholarship and earning Vilnius the nickname ``Jerusalem of the
North.''
	   Today, only a few traces remain: some faded Hebrew letters on a
back-alley wall, a single remaining synagogue. About 90 percent of
Lithuania's pre-war Jewish population of 240,000 was killed during
the war.
	   Basing their case on documents that came to light only after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, prosecutors say Lileikis
personally ordered scores of Vilnius Jews arrested and handed over
to a Nazi squad that slaughtered them amid the tall pines of the
Paneriai forest.
	   The United States, when it began the move to strip Lileikis of
his citizenship for lying about his past when he emigrated, said
the documents form a ``shockingly complete paper trail.''
	   Lileikis' attorneys are expected to argue that the documents
could have been forged, that he never pulled a trigger himself,
never commanded an execution squad and, even if he did turn over
Jews to the Nazis, didn't necessarily know that meant sending them
to near-certain death.
	   That's impossible, according to Svetlana Shatalova, a researcher
at Vilnius' Jewish Museum. Within months of the Nazi occupation,
virtually everyone in Vilnius knew of the executions, she said.
	   ``If he was handing over Jews and they were being taken away,
what did he think?,'' Shatalova said in a recent interview. ``He
knew very well they weren't being taken away for a picnic.''
	   Edvard Jankovski, who grew up at the edge of the blood-drenched
forest, knew what went on there. A half-century later, the memory
distresses him so much that he pulls at his shirt and stares at his
hands when he tells it.
	   ``We could hear them shooting people at the front of the line
while hordes of people at the back were still filing in,'' said
Jankovski, 63. ``It was horrible.''
	   Jankovski cannot forget, but many Lithuanians say there's no
point to remembering.
	   ``I think its absolutely wrong what they are doing to
Lileikis,'' said 62-year-old Stanislava Jevseyeva, selling flowers
on a Vilnius street corner ``If they put him on trial, what about
all the Soviets who killed and deported people?''
	   ``They're afraid that if Lileikis is found guilty, then
Lithuania itself will be seen as guilty by the world,'' said
Shatalova, the Jewish Museum researcher. ``So the reasoning is,
well, then we have no choice but to defend Lileikis.''
	   Some Jewish groups overseas denounce Lithuania as a country
unwilling to face its past. Although returned to Lithuania in 1995,
it was only this year that he was formally charged and his trial
has been postponed several times.
	   The delays, Jewish groups say, show that authorities hope the
91-year-old Lileikis will die before testimony can begin.
	   Even if the trial opens on schedule, it's doubtful whether
Lileikis will appear: his attorneys claim he is bedridden by a
stroke. Guards at Lileikis' downtown apartment building refused to
allow a reporter access to him.
	   President Valdas Adamkus says holding the trial is critically
important to Lithuania.
	   ``We have to show the world that we are not justifying these
crimes and that we will have nothing to do with people who
committed them,'' he said in an interview. ``However painful these
issues are, we have to deal with them.''
	   That position was echoed by Violeta Palcinskaite, a guide at the
Jewish Museum.
	   ``You can't have a future with vengeance in your heart,'' she
said. ``But you also can't have a future if you don't come to terms
with your past.''

Inter Milan's Colonnese gets four-match ban, club appeals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Inter Milan has appealed a four-match ban imposed
on defender Francesco Colonnese by European soccer's governing
body, UEFA said Tuesday.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body suspended Colonnese after
the player was sent off for elbowing an opponent during the first
leg of Inter's Champions League second qualifying round encounter
against FC Skonto Riga of Latvia on August 12.
	   Colonnese was one of 24 players who received suspensions ranging
from one to five matches from the committee, a UEFA statement said.
	   The panel decided to fine Turkish team Samsunspor 50,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 35,460) after an object was thrown during its
Intertoto Cup match with German side Werder Bremen on August 5.
UEFA didn't give details of the incident.
	   Panel members also handed down fines to a long list of teams for
incidents ranging from improper conduct of players or supporters,
to failure to observe UEFA competition regulations.

Malaysian PM says ousted deputy flirting with arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh comment from Mahathir, convinced
allegations against Anwar; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Tuesday attacked his ousted deputy as immoral and accused him of
courting arrest to become a political martyr.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, Mahathir's former protege, was stripped of his
posts of deputy and finance minister last Wednesday on allegations
ranging from sexual misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were crafted by the
government to undermine his reform challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule. The two have also clashed on economic policy.
	   ``His morals are not good,'' Mahathir told reporters in his most
extensive public comments so far on Anwar's firing. ``He has such
low morals to get involved in such activities.''
	   Mahathir said he explained to 3,500 members of the ruling United
Malays National Organization during a special meeting that Anwar
was dumped from his posts and expelled from UMNO on moral grounds,
not for allegations of selling state secrets or differences over
monetary policy.
	   He said he had conducted his own probe into the sexual
misconduct allegations after he learned of the police
investigation.
	   ``I concluded there there was substance to the allegations ...
His character does not qualify him to be a leader,'' Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir said Anwar's calls for a reform movement were a
diversion against the investigation. He said there was ``not a
hope'' that Anwar could be rehabilitated.
	   Earlier in the day, Mahathir said Anwar was purposely flirting
with arrest.
	   ``He is trying his best to get the government to arrest him, so
he will become a martyr,'' said Mahathir, who once wooed Anwar into
his political party and helped make him the second most powerful
man in Malaysia.
	   Since the ouster, Anwar has been giving nightly speeches at his
home, declaring his innocence. He has also pledged to go on a
campaign to push for press freedoms and transparency within the
government _ reportedly infuriating the 72-year-old Mahathir.
	   A movement condemning government cronyism and corruption,
floated at the July UMNO convention, was seen to have Anwar's stamp
on it. Mahathir crushed the campaign.
	   On Tuesday, Anwar said his charges of cronyism were not directed
at Mahathir, but at the government.
	   The sex allegations against Anwar first surfaced in a book, ``50
Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM.'' They range from the simple
groping of women to charges of sodomy. The police are investigating
and have filed affidavits in court.
	   Anwar has remained holed up at his residence since he was sacked
and then expelled from UMNO on Thursday. He said Tuesday he had
canceled a nationwide tour to launch his political reform campaign.
His wife, Azizah Ismail, said they were worried Anwar would be
arrested along the way.

Angolan gov't prepares for clashes with former rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior Angolan official said the
government expects military clashes soon with the former rebel
group UNITA, which it accuses of failing to comply with the 1994
peace pact that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   ``I won't say there'll be a (full-scale) war, but there are
going to be localized clashes,'' Gen. Higino Carneiro told
reporters late Monday. He declined to elaborate on the government's
plans.
	   The government has accused UNITA of keeping an army hidden in
the bush of this vast southwest African nation and of refusing to
relinquish control of its central highland strongholds in
contravention of the U.N.-brokered peace pact.
	   It says UNITA troops have launched offensives on remote villages
in recent months, killing more than 100 police and civilians.
	   ``Those who are acting against the sovereign state, who attack
the constitution, who attack the government, obviously have to be
fought,'' said Gen. Carneiro. Carneiro is the government's chief
negotiator on the so-called Joint Commission monitoring the peace
process.
	   Tension surrounding Angola's crumbling peace process mounted
over the weekend after the government said it was severing all
contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who lives in Andulo, 480
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   The government said it would deal only with a group of UNITA
dissidents who have broken with Savimbi and set up a rival
leadership in the capital Luanda. The dissidents accuse Savimbi of
not wanting peace.
	   Savimbi's supporters in Luanda claimed that Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos was seeking regional support for an
offensive against UNITA which would be launched after the U.N.
mandate in Angola expires Sept. 15.
	   Dos Santos has been sounding out regional leaders during this
week's Congo peace talks in Zimbabwe, the UNITA officials said on
condition of anonymity. They offered no evidence for their claim.
	   National police chief Fernando da Piedade on Monday described
Savimbi and his followers as ``bandits'' and said they would be
``fought and arrested'' on sight.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Foreign Ministers from Iran, Greece and
Armenia held talks here Tuesday on boosting economic cooperation,
Iranian radio reported.
	   During the meeting, the officials agreed to work together on
tourism, industry, technology and energy sectors, the radio said.
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos arrived for a two-day
visit on Tuesday, one day after Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanian came to Tehran.
	   The three countries first got together to promote closer
economic ties in 1995.
	   During a meeting in the Greek capital Athens last year, they
signed a memorandum to create joint committees to study cooperation
in transport, postal services, telecommunications and other fields.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's oil production for the fiscal year
that ended June 30 dropped by more than a million tons, or about 3
percent, from the previous year, Al-Gomhuriya newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Egypt produced 40.7 million tons of crude in the 1997-98 fiscal
year, compared with 41.78 million tons in the previous year, the
paper said, quoting the state-run Egyptian General Petroleum Co. It
said net income for the year was dlrs 434 million.
	   No reason was given for the decrease. But Egypt has a number of
old wells from which production is dropping, and it agreed to a
limited cutback in cooperation with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
	   The paper said that natural gas production rose 3 percent in the
fiscal year that ended June 30 to the equivalent of 13.24 million
tons of oil.
	   It said refinery output rose to 29.24 million tons from 28.27
million tons.
 &UR; ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Bank of Cyprus Group, the largest
financial institution on this Mediterranean island, announced
pretax profits on Tuesday of 21.58 million pounds (dlrs 34.5
million) for the first six months of 1998.
	   That represents an increase of 28.2 percent over the same period
last year, it said.
	   The group's chairman, Solon Triantafyllides, told a news
conference that operating profits were up 28.6 percent to 28.44
million pounds (dlrs 55.74 million) in the first half of 1998 from
22.11 million pounds (dlrs 43.33 million) in the first six months
of 1997.
	   He credited savings through the introduction of more technology
as well as good performance by the group's insurance companies and
its operations in Greece and Britain.
	   The bank also announced an interim dividend of 8 percent for
1998, up 2 percentage points from last year.

Henry Paul to team up with brother Robbie at Bradford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRADFORD, England (AP) _ New Zealand rugby league international
Henry Paul signed a three-year deal Tuesday with English Super
League champions Bradford Bulls and will team up with younger
brother, Robbie, next season.
	   Henry Paul, whose contract with Wigan expires at the end of the
season, had expressed his desire to play club rugby league with his
brother.
	   The pair have already teamed up at international level for New
Zealand but the link became a deciding factor in his move to
Bradford over other offers from London Broncos, Sheffield and
Halifax.
	   Henry, 24, joined Wigan in 1994 and helped the club win eight
trophies but elected to leave when the Warriors signed Australian
international Greg Florimo for the 1999 season.
	   Paul is expected to play for New Zealand against Great Britain
in a test series starting in October.
	   Bulls coach Matthew Elliot said the signing of Paul was part of
a plan to ensure the club remained at the top of Super League.

Interior minister defends handling of kidnapping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Adding fuel to a national debate over how to stop
Italy's kidnapping plague, the Italian interior minister has
defended prosecutors who promised leaner prison terms to mobsters
in exchange for help in winning a hostage's freedom.
	   In an interview published Tuesday in Rome daily La Repubblica,
Giorgio Napolitano said investigators who secured the release last
week of wealthy Milan businesswoman Alessandra Sgarella had acted
``within the limits of the law.''
	   On Sunday, Milan prosecutor Alberto Nobili said that he had
negotiated with members of the 'ndrangheta, a Calabrian organized
crime syndicate. Nobili said he pressured mobsters to tell what
they knew about the kidnapping by pledging to reduce their
sentences.
	   The 'ndrangheta, along with gangs of bandits in Sardinia and in
central Italy, have organized most of Italy's nearly 700
kidnappings since 1970.
	   Opposition leaders have heavily criticized investigators in the
Sgarella case and called on Napolitano to go before Parliament to
brief them on how it was handled.
	   How to handle kidnappings has been a simmering issue, especially
since 1991, when the government passed a controversial law aimed at
discouraging kidnappings by requiring that assets of victims and
their families be frozen to make ransom payment more difficult.
	   Supporters of the law credit it with reducing the number of
kidnappings, from an average of 30 reported per year before the law
to five. But opponents say it is cruel to hamper families from
trying to pay ransom for their loved one's freedom.
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said Tuesday that if
lawmakers consider the law inadequate, they can modify it.
	   Since 1970, ransoms are known to have been paid for 372 of the
479 victims who were released.
	   Sgarella, 40, was abducted Dec. 11 when she returned home after
work. Her captors initially demanded a ransom of 50 billion lire
(dlrs 28 million), the highest known in Italy, but Nobili said
nothing had been paid.

 &UR; Turkish leader: Syria encourages Kurdish separatists &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Turkish prime minister
after meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In an escalating war of words, the
Turkish prime minister on Tuesday accused Syria of hostile
intentions, saying it supported Kurdish separatists in his country.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's remarks came in response to claims
in state-run Syrian newspapers that Turkey's military alliance with
Israel was bringing more tensions to the Middle East.
	   The increasingly close Israeli-Turkish defense ties have caused
great concern among several Middle Eastern nations, especially
Syria, Iran and Iraq which believe it is directed at them.
	   Yilmaz confirmed Tuesday that his country and Israel plan to
conduct joint naval maneuvers in November, but would not comment on
reports that Egypt and Jordan were also invited.
	   The two nations held their first joint exercise in January, with
the participation of more than 1,000 sailors and five warships.
Jordan sent an observer.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday that the head of Jordanian
intelligence secretly visited Israel on Sunday to discuss the
possibility of Jordan joining the Israeli-Turkish alliance.
	   However, Israeli military commentators said they doubted
moderate Arab states, such as Egypt and Jordan, would break ranks
with the rest of the Arab world.
	   Turkey has said it did not believe a regional defense structure
could be set up before Israel has negotiated peace agreements with
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   In Damascus, the government daily Tishrin urged Turkey in an
editorial Tuesday to improve its relations with the Arabs and with
fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into Israel's
arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Asked about the Syrian comments, Yilmaz said in his halting
English: ``Anyone who speaks (about) hostility in the region with
hostile attitudes should focus on the policies of the Syrian
government that encourages separatist terrorism in the region.''
	   Yilmaz, who made the remarks after a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate. In the past, Turkey as
accused Syria, as well as Iraq, Greece and Armenia, of supporting
Kurdish separatists.
	   Asked about Turkey's position on Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, Yilmaz urged Israel to accept a U.S. plan that calls
for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have adopted the U.S. proposal which also calls
for a greater Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   ``Both sides must take constructive steps to get this peace
process out of the freeze it is in,'' Yilmaz said. ``We shall wait
and see for ... the Israeli side to accept the U.S. initiative as
the Palestinian side has accepted it.''
	   Yilmaz said Turkey and the Palestinian Authority have signed
cooperation agreements in the fields of culture, education and the
environment. He also said he has invited Palestinian officials to
Turkey to discuss loans to the Palestinian Authority.

WFP appeals for 9.7 million dlrs for food aid in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The U.N. World Food Program appealed Tuesday for 9.7
million dlrs to provide emergency food aid to some 200,000 refugees
from Sierra Leone's civil war who have fled to Guinea.
	   Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans have left their country to
escape revenge attacks by rebels and former junta forces ousted in
March by a West African intervention force.
	   Human rights groups and aid workers said thousands of people
have been killed, tortured or disfigured in a terror campaign
against civilians throughout the country.
	   Last week, rebels attacked a village in neighboring Guinea,
killing seven women Sierra Leonean refugees and three Guineans and
forcing other refugees to carry stolen food back over the border
into Sierra Leone.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said some 17,640 tons of salt,
sugar, corn-soya blend, vegetable oil and beans are needed to
provide daily rations to the refugees for six months.
	   Over the past two months, heavy rains have made it difficult for
WFP to deliver food to some refugee camps in southwestern Guinea.

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Horns blared, shoppers stopped and cheered, and
St. Louis generally went berserk when Mark McGwire hit his 61st
home run.
	   And it was even more nuts inside Busch Stadium, where McGwire
lined a 1-1 pitch from the Chicago Cubs' Mike Morgan deep into the
left-field seats in the first inning, tying Roger Maris'
37-year-old record for most homers in a season. Even Chicago's
Sammy Sosa, who with 58 homers is chasing both Maris and McGwire,
applauded into his glove in right field.
	   The roar from the 50,530 fans, including Maris' sons, lasted for
several minutes, well into the at-bat of teammate Ray Lankford. But
it masked emotions that ran even deeper in this baseball-crazy
town.
	   Many were moved to tears after watching McGwire circle the
bases, slap hands with Cubs first baseman Mark Grace and third
baseman Gary Gaetti, a former Cardinals teammate, before greeting
his 10-year-old son Matthew at home plate with a bear hug.
	   ``To be here, I will remember and cherish my entire life,'' said
Rick Faccin, 44, of Alton, Illinois. ``The reception he received
and what he did as he rounded the bases gave me chills all over.''
	   ``When I saw the ball hit off the glass and I knew he tied the
record, I had a few tears in my eyes,'' said Don Fisher, 51, of
Marion, Illinois. ``It made me feel like I was part of history
since I saw it live.''
	   During a curtain call, McGwire thumped his chest and pointed
skyward as he looked to the Maris family, sitting behind
photographers along the first-base line, and other family and
friends.
	   ``He acknowledged us. He tapped his heart, like dad was in his
heart,'' Kevin Maris said.
	   McGwire said he also looked for his parents and mouthed the
words, ``Happy Birthday'' to his father, who was celebrating his
61st birthday.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A glove worn by U.S. President Bill
Clinton when he golfed at Ireland's famous Ballybunion course on
Saturday may turn into a real moneymaker for a Dublin's children
hospital.
	   The glove, autographed by the president, fetched 6,000 Irish
pounds (dlrs 9,000) Tuesday for Tallaght Hospital. And the glove's
new owner said he now plans to rent it out for 100 Irish pounds
(dlrs 160) to be worn at golf outings to raise even more money for
the hospital.
	   ``We are putting the glove to work,'' said bar owner Louis
Fitzgerald, who bought it during a live radio auction.
	   Clinton gave the glove to Noeleen McCreevy, the wife of Irish
Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, who was part of the president's
golfing group at the southwest Ireland course. McCreevy donated the
glove to be auctioned.

Angolan gov't prepares for clashes with former rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Fighting between Angolan forces and the
former rebel group UNITA could soon begin again, a government
general warned, but he said clashes would probably be limited to
specific areas.
	   ``I won't say there'll be a (full-scale) war, but there are
going to be localized clashes,'' Gen. Higino Carneiro told
reporters late Monday. He declined to elaborate on the government's
plans.
	   The government has accused UNITA of failing to comply with a
1994 peace pact and keeping an army hidden in the bush of this vast
southwest African nation. UNITA has also refused to relinquish
control of its central highland strongholds in contravention of the
U.N.-brokered agreement.
	   ``Those who are acting against the sovereign state, who attack
the constitution, who attack the government, obviously have to be
fought,'' said Gen. Carneiro. Carneiro is the government's chief
negotiator on the so-called Joint Commission monitoring the peace
process.
	   Tension surrounding Angola's crumbling peace process mounted
over the weekend after the government said it was severing all
contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who lives in Andulo, 480
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda.
	   The government said it would deal only with a group of UNITA
dissidents who have broken with Savimbi and set up a rival
leadership in the capital Luanda. The dissidents accuse Savimbi of
not wanting peace.
	   Savimbi's supporters in Luanda claimed that Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos was seeking regional support for an
offensive against UNITA which would be launched after the U.N.
mandate in Angola expires Sept. 15.
	   Dos Santos has been sounding out regional leaders during this
week's Congo peace talks in Zimbabwe, the UNITA officials said on
condition of anonymity. They offered no evidence for their claim.
	   National police chief Fernando da Piedade on Monday described
Savimbi and his followers as ``bandits'' and said they would be
``fought and arrested'' on sight.

Vicar jailed after admitting overcharging for weddings and
</HEADLINE>
funerals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, England (AP) _ A vicar was ordered jailed for nine
months Tuesday after admitting he overcharged parishioners for
funerals and weddings _ including levying a fee to bury stillborn
babies when the church normally provides such services free.
	   The Rev. Roy Hibbert, who admitted 11 counts of false
accounting, was arrested after members of his congregations in
several communities in the southwest England area of Shropshire
complained they were being overcharged for weddings.
	   Prosecutor Nigel Rumfitt said Hibbert, 68, also underdeclared
his annual earnings and so was awarded extra income from church
funds.
	   The prosecution contended Hibbert had defrauded the diocese of
about 50,000 pounds (dlrs 83,000), but Judge Frank Chapman placed
the figure closer to 30,000 pounds (dlrs 50,000).
	   Parishioner Louise Talbot said she was duped twice, paying 118
pounds (dlrs 195) for her first wedding, which should have cost 37
pounds (dlrs 62), and a further 320 pounds (dlrs 530) for a
blessing to her second husband.
	   ``Who can you trust if you can't trust your vicar, if you can't
trust the person who is next to godliness in your eyes?'' Ms.
Talbot said Tuesday.
	   ``If he had been a plumber or a builder, I might have got a
second quote _ but not a priest,'' she said. ``You would never
imagine a priest to be dishonest.''
	   The Bishop of Lichfield, the Rt. Rev. Keith Sutton, issued a
statement saying Hibbert no longer was licensed to officiate as a
priest in the Church of England, and that the diocese had
instituted new accountancy procedures.

Report: Scams, thefts bring cars from Europe to Lebanon's wealthy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese customs agents have in the last
three months seized 75 cars stolen or acquired through insurance
fraud in Europe and shipped for sale to the wealthy in Lebanon, a
leading newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The daily An-Nahar quoted Intepol officials as saying Lebanon is
the Arab world's No. 1 haven for stolen cars. It added ``a large
number has ended up in the possession of personalities in important
political and economic positions.''
	   Many of the cars seized, in cooperation with Interpol, were
luxury vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz 600, the 12-cylinder
limousine nicknamed the ``Ghost'' because of its shape, the paper
said.
	   During the 1975-90 civil war, it was common knowledge that some
luxury cars in Lebanon had been stolen in Europe. But Tuesday's
disclosure in the independent daily marked the first time in
several years that the issue was publicly raised.
	   An-Nahar also said that the Customs Authority was under pressure
and even threats from some politicians to release the vehicles.
	   The unnamed sources told An-Nahar that insurance fraud in Europe
may have been committed in some cases. They said thefts are
sometimes carried out with the knowledge of the owner, who sells
the vehicle to thieves for less than half the market price, then
claims and collects insurance money.
	   The thefts are hurting the German and other European economies
and costing billions of dollars in insurance claims, An-Nahar
quoted a letter sent by Interpol's regional bureau in Germany to
Lebanon's Customs Authority.
	   The letter from the international police organization, sent
through the German Embassy in Cyprus, also listed Lebanon as the
top haven for stolen cars among Arab states.
	   In January, 30 luxury cars stolen in Belgium were discovered in
the French port of Le Havre, ready for shipment to Lebanon.

Employers' chief warns of French stock market isolation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of France's main employers organization
warned Tuesday that the country's stock market risks being
sidelined if it doesn't join forces with a new British-German
financial axis.
	   In an hour-long meeting with President Jacques Chirac,
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere said France, which felt snubbed by the
London-Frankfurt joint venture, could not afford to stay out.
	   ``London and Frankfurt have decided to launch this movement.
That's good. Paris must be part of it,'' Seilliere told reporters
after the meeting.
	   ``We haven't accepted the idea that French entrepreneurs can be
excluded from the progressive creation of this large European
market,'' he added. He said Chirac had understood his concern.
	   The head of the French stock market, Jean-Francois Theodore, has
said he favors the idea of an international stock exchange to rival
the London-Frankfurt link.
	   He has said it could include continental European markets such
as Milan, Brussels, Madrid and Paris, and also be linked to the New
York stock exchange.
	   London and Frankfurt, long-time rivals, announced July 7 that
they would join forces.

China's foreign minister to meet Albright in Washington
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's foreign minister will travel to
Washington later this month, his first visit since the Chinese and
U.S. presidents' June summit in Beijing, an official said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will hold talks with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and other U.S. officials during his Sept.
27-29 visit, Tang spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   The visit will build on the ``wide-ranging unanimity'' Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton reached
during their summit, Zhu said.
	   For Tang, the trip will be his first to the United States but
his third meeting with Albright since being named foreign minister
in March.
	   At their last meeting in July, Albright expressed disappointment
that China rounded up more than 20 dissidents in the weeks after
Clinton's departure. Tang assured her China would abide by a summit
pledge to stop targeting its long-range ballistic missiles at the
United States.
	   Aside from the ``detargeting'' commitment, Clinton and Jiang
agreed to improve ties between their militaries and cooperate on
environmental issues.
	   Although the meeting brought relations to their warmest in at
least six years, differences over trade, human rights, Tibet and
Taiwan all threaten to derail ties.
	   Tang will attend the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly
before his three-day U.S. visit. Afterwards, he will spend six days
in Canada.

detonated a suspicious package left in a trash can outside the U.S.
Embassy on Tuesday, but all it apparently contained was a bottle.
	   Liquid in the bottle was being analyzed but was apparently
harmless, the embassy said.
	   Security at American facilities has been tightened since the

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Arafat adviser &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy resuming mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians believes some progress is
possible, but does not count on a deal being concluded during his
visit to the Middle East this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater
Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials were to meet Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation the three sides
had worked out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue Ross will have to address is the scope of an
Israeli pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent,
Israel accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of
the land set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full
security control and Palestinian land use being restricted.
	   Netanyahu has claimed that the Palestinians agreed to the
proposal in principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said
no agreement was reached and that the gaps remained wide.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Tuesday the
Palestinians would not agree to changes in the U.S. initiative.
``We are waiting to see some U.S. pressure on the Israeli
government to accept this initiative,'' Abourdeneh said.

about possible other candidates, minor editing to trim. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin huddled with top aides at his
country residence Tuesday amid growing speculation he may choose a
compromise candidate for prime minister to resolve a confrontation
with parliament.
	   Yeltsin had said that Viktor Chernomyrdin was his only choice to
lead a new government that must deal with the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   The president spent the day conferring with senior aides at his
country home, Gorky 9, outside Moscow. But as of Tuesday afternoon,
Yeltsin had not named his candidate for prime minister and was
unlikely to do so before Wednesday, the president's spokesman,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The delay suggested that Yeltsin was mulling over the
possibility of a compromise figure instead of renominating
Chernomyrdin, who has been rejected twice in two weeks by a hostile
parliament. Yeltsin has compromised in the past when government
policies have run into major political opposition.
	   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met Tuesday afternoon, but no details
of the talks were announced.
	   ``Today the countdown has begun for the position of compromise
... with another candidate,'' Konstantin Titov, a member of
parliament's upper house, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. But the two names that prompted the
greatest amount of speculation among lawmakers were Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   However, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said Yeltsin
planned to stick with Chernomyrdin, who held the premier's post for
five years before he was sacked by Yeltsin in March.
	   ``It will be Chernomyrdin and no one else,'' Zhirinovsky said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said that the renomination of
Chernomyrdin would lead to the ``complete paralysis of the entire
political process.''
	   The first two votes in parliament demonstrated lawmakers' strong
opposition to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and have delayed the
formation of a new government during a time of turmoil.
	   If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's candidate a third time, then the
constitution calls on the president to dismiss parliament and call
new elections within three months. Yeltsin would rule by decree
until the new legislature is seated.
	   Legislators might be willing to change their votes in the third
round in order to preserve their own jobs. The dissolution of the
legislature would add to the country's political and economic
turbulence, and it's not clear how angry Russians would vote in new
elections. Many incumbents could lose their seats.
	   Chernomyrdin's efforts to win parliamentary confirmation have
left him little time to devote to the economy, which remained in a
downward spiral.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
at gas stations began forming Monday as motorists filled up before
prices go up.
	   The ruble, which was trading at about six to the U.S. dollar
last month, was around 20 to the dollar on Tuesday.
	   The government will need an emergency federal budget for the
remainder of the year, and plans for the 1999 budget will have to
be revised, government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said.

Ryder Cup hero's son dies in car crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GALWAY, Ireland (AP) _ Irish golfer Christy O'Connor Jr. has
withdrawn from this week's British Masters following the death of
his son in a car crash in Kilcolgan, near Galway, late Monday.
	   Darren O'Connor, 17, was one of three people killed in the
accident which happened about 15 miles (24 km) from the family home
in Galway.
	   Darren, the youngest of Christy's three children, was driving
one of two vehicles involved in the accident. The driver and
passenger of the second vehicle were also killed.
	   O'Connor, a hero of the 1989 Ryder Cup at the Belfry when he
powered a winning 2-iron to the flag to beat Fred Couples in the
singles, won the British Masters in 1992 after surviving a
helicopter crash weeks before.
	   He withdrew from this week's British Masters, which starts
Thursday at the Forest of Arden near Coventry, England. Other Irish
professionals, Eamonn Darcy and Des Smyth, also withdrew from the
tournament in a show of respect for O'Connor.
	   O'Connor, 50, last week played a round with Prince Andrew at the
re-opening of the Brabazon course at The Belfry.
	   His uncle, a legendary Irish golfer also named Christy O'Connor,
played golf with visiting President Bill Clinton on the
world-famous links at Ballybunion, County Kerry, last Saturday.

Turkish leader: Syria encourages Kurdish separatists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In an escalating war of words, the
Turkish prime minister on Tuesday accused Syria of hostile
intentions, saying it supported Kurdish separatists in his country.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's remarks came in response to claims
in state-run Syrian newspapers that Turkey's military alliance with
Israel was bringing more tensions to the Middle East.
	   The increasingly close Israeli-Turkish defense ties have caused
great concern among several Middle Eastern nations, especially
Syria, Iran and Iraq which believe it is directed at them.
	   Yilmaz confirmed Tuesday that his country and Israel plan to
conduct joint naval maneuvers in November, but would not comment on
reports that Egypt and Jordan were also invited.
	   The two nations held their first joint exercise in January, with
the participation of more than 1,000 sailors and five warships.
Jordan sent an observer.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday that the head of Jordanian
intelligence secretly visited Israel on Sunday to discuss the
possibility of Jordan joining the Israeli-Turkish alliance.
	   However, Israeli military commentators said they doubted
moderate Arab states, such as Egypt and Jordan, would break ranks
with the rest of the Arab world.
	   Turkey has said it did not believe a regional defense structure
could be set up before Israel has negotiated peace agreements with
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   In Damascus, the government daily Tishrin urged Turkey in an
editorial Tuesday to improve its relations with the Arabs and with
fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into Israel's
arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Asked about the Syrian comments, Yilmaz said in his halting
English: ``Anyone who speaks (about) hostility in the region with
hostile attitudes should focus on the policies of the Syrian
government that encourages separatist terrorism in the region.''
	   Yilmaz, who made the remarks after a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate. In the past, Turkey as
accused Syria, as well as Iraq, Greece and Armenia, of supporting
Kurdish separatists.
	   Asked about Turkey's position on Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, Yilmaz urged Israel to accept a U.S. plan that calls
for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Yilmaz said Turkey and the Palestinian Authority have signed
cooperation agreements in the fields of culture, education and the
environment. He also said he has invited Palestinian officials to
Turkey to discuss loans to the Palestinian Authority.

Iraq accuses U.S. Navy of `piracy' in inspection of wheat ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday accused the U.S. Navy of
``barbaric piracy'' for stopping an Iraqi ship carrying wheat, but
American officials termed it a routine inspection.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted an unnamed Trade Ministry official
as saying the ship, Al-Abed, was stopped in Iraqi waters shortly
before midnight Monday.
	   The agency quoted the official as saying that ``this aggressive
action and barbaric piracy show anew the American administration's
antagonism toward the Iraqi people.''
	   Cmdr. Gordon Hume, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet in
Bahrain, confirmed that the ship had been stopped.
	   ``We boarded and inspected the ship,'' Hume said. ``We verified
him (the captain) as a bona fide coastal trader and allowed him to
proceed to his destination.''
	   A U.S.-led multinational force has been inspecting ships in the
Gulf since 1994 to enforce the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Nearly 4,000 vessels have been inspected under the campaign,
with about 175 ships barred from proceeding on grounds of sanctions
violation.
	   The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, bar most financial dealings with the country, limit Iraq's
sale of oil and ban air travel.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said the ship was transporting nearly
1,500 tons of wheat to Basra in southern Iraq. Iraq can sell
limited quantities of oil under a special U.N. program to buy
needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.

Future Commonwealth Games to be slimmer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Commonwealth Games
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Worried about the slackening
interest in the Commonwealth Games, the competition's chief
organizer said Tuesday that future events would be made slimmer and
more attractive.
	   The Commonwealth Games Federation will adopt recommendations
made by the consultant company, Arthur Andersen, to make the
management of the sports event professional and appoint a full-time
paid chief executive, said CGF Chairman Michael S. Fennel.
	   ``I am not conceding that the games are losing relevance. But I
am conceding there are threats,'' Fennel told reporters after a
one-day meeting of the CGF that re-elected him as the chairman.
	   Voluntary work can no longer sustain the games, he said. The
search has begun for a sports manager who would ensure that games
are handled more professionally.
	   Fennel said that the games had grown beyond his wildest
imagination since they began in 1930.
	   From 2002, when the Commonwealth Games are scheduled to be held
in Manchester, there will be a limit of 14 sports, including a
maximum of four team events.
	   There are 16 sports in Malaysia, the largest Commonwealth event
so far. The CGF was forced to include several new categories at the
insistence of Malaysia, Fennel said.
	   About 5,000 athletes are competing in Kuala Lumpur, which begins
hosting events Wednesday, two days before the official opening. The
number of participants four years ago in Victoria, Canada, was
3,200.
	   Kuala Lumpur has admitted six new events to spice up interest in
the sporting event. But organizers still face an uphill battle
enlisting sponsors and selling tickets.
	   Cricket, sevens rugby, men's and women's field hockey, netball,
squash and tenpin bowling have been added.
	   The Commonwealth Games have been increasingly losing importance
in world sport as athletes concentrate on events that either have
prize money or focus on specific disciplines like the world cups
for football, cricket and hockey and the track and field
championships.
	   ``We have to keep pace with the times,'' Fennel said. But the
Commonwealth Games would not consider giving cash prizes, he added.
	   Athletes should realize that events such as the Commonwealth
Games and Olympics help them achieve the fame that takes them to
the other competitions, Fennel said.
	   He said private sports managers were often responsible for
keeping athletes away from events without cash prizes.
	   ``Some agents will convince athletes to run for money, so that
the agent and athlete both benefit,'' he said.
	   The CGF will also launch an aggressive marketing drive to raise
finances for Commonwealth Games that many nations are finding
increasingly hard to pay for, he said.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 11th graf with quote from Arafat spokesman, picks
up 11th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy mediating between Israel
and the Palestinians believes progress is possible, but doubts a
deal will be concluded during his visit to the Middle East this
week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater Palestinian
effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials were to meet Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation the three sides
had worked out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said they would not accept any
changes, but have agreed to attend Tuesday's meeting.
	   The second issue for Ross will be the scope of an Israeli
pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent, Israel
accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of the land
set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full security
control and Palestinian land use restricted.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians agreed to the proposal in
principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said no agreement
was reached and that gaps remained wide.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Tuesday the
Palestinians would not agree to changes in the U.S. initiative.
``We are waiting to see some U.S. pressure on the Israeli
government to accept this initiative,'' Abourdeneh said.

At least one dead, 15 wounded, in Algerian bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful car bomb exploded Tuesday at
a packed market in southern Algeria, killing at least one person
and injuring 15 others, the security forces said.
	   The bomb exploded during a weekly market at Rahoui, near the
town of Tiaret, 300 kilometers (188 miles) south of the capital.
	   The death toll was expected to increase: hospital sources, who
requested customary anonymity, said two people died, and witnesses
said some of the injured were in critical condition.
	   Since the beginning of the year, the west and south of Algeria
have increasingly become targets for violence that used to focus
more on central and northern Algeria.
	   An estimated 75,000 people _ including civilians, Islamic
militants and security forces _ have been killed since the start of
an Islamic insurgency in 1992.
	   The violence was triggered by the army's decision to annul
legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by Muslim
fundamentalists.
	   Tuesday's bombing came after a spate of violence that claimed
around 30 lives in three days.
	   A bomb exploded early Monday southwest of the capital, killing
five people and injuring 11 others. Over the weekend, at least two
dozen people died in scattered violence across the country,
including a shootout in the capital and a bomb explosion under
train tracks south of Algiers.

U.S. 6th Fleet flagship visits Georgian port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet
arrived in the former Soviet republic of Georgia on Tuesday, and
6th Fleet commander Vice Admiral Daniel J. Murphy Jr. held meetings
with Georgian officials.
	   Murphy flew to the capital Tbilisi to meet Defense Minister
David Tevzadze and parliament speaker Zurab Zhvania. On Thursday,
Murphy will be conferring with Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
	   The flagship, the USS LaSalle, docked in the Black Sea port of
Poti. The ship, which carries 658 sailors, brought medical supplies
and medical books, warm clothes and even children's toys as part of
a humanitarian shipment to the Caucasus nation.
	   Georgian officials described the visit as historic.
	   ``The visit is of historical importance. The visit is a starting
point for cooperation between U.S. and Georgian fleets,'' said
Georgian Defense Ministry spokesman Koba Liklikadze.
	   The USS LaSalle is making a three-week voyage around the Black
Sea. It has visited Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine and is scheduled
to visit Russia and Turkey.

responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday, but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   In a statement issued to the Irish state broadcasters RTE, the
so-called Real IRA said it had decided on a ``complete cessation of
all military activity.''
	   Last month, the splinter group had declared a ``suspension'' of
what it called its ``military operations,'' a step short of a
formal cease-fire.
	   The Real IRA, which had previously rejected the Irish Republican
Army's July 1997 cease-fire, has admitted responsibility for the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 29 people and wounded 330 in the
Northern Ireland town of Omagh. The last victim was buried Monday.
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who heads the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, welcomed the cease-fire announcement, but said it
did not diminish the tragedy of the Omagh bombing.
	   ``I am glad that these people have come to their senses and
realized the futility of their actions,'' he said. ``That doesn't
change the enormity of what they have done and their culpability
for it.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair also said the statement was
welcome, but vowed that authorities would ``continue to pursue
those responsible for the Omagh bomb, those who organized it, those
carried it out.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern called it ``both an important
and a positive development,'' but added, ``It will not,
unfortunately, bring the dead of Omagh back to life, heal the
injured or comfort their families.''
	   The British government's Northern Ireland Office issued its own
statement emphasizing that ``the Real IRA needs not just to talk,
but to convince the Irish people that their violence is at an end
for good.''
	   The Real IRA's announcement came hours after Northern Ireland's
major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist party, ended
its ban on direct communication with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, another symbolic step down the road to reconciliation.
	   At a two-hour meeting Monday at Stormont Parlimentary Building
in Belfast, the venue for a new cross-community government outlined
in April's peace accord, Trimble discussed the establishment of a
multi-party administration with seven other party leaders,
including Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams.
	   Trimble had sat through eight months of negotiations opposite
Adams without saying a direct word to him, citing the IRA's refusal
to start disarming as proof it had really renounced violence. The
April agreement commits Sinn Fein to secure the IRA's disarmament
by mid-2000.
	   The Real IRA's statement brought the group into line with the
mainstream IRA and several other paramilitary groups: the IRA's
main anti-British rival, the Irish National Liberation Army, which
called its own truce Aug. 22, and Northern Ireland's two major
outlawed pro-British gangs _ the Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force _ which called a joint cease-fire in 1994.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation that gave
police greater power to seek conviction of alleged Real IRA
members. So far, however, police have yet to round up suspects on
their list.
	   Real IRA members and supporters claimed last week that senior
IRA figures had visited their homes and threatened that ``direct
action'' would be taken against them if they committed any more car
bombings in Northern Ireland.
	   The Omagh attack was at least the seventh car bomb planted in
Northern Ireland by the dissidents. The others had either been
defused or exploded after police evacuated the immediate area,
causing severe commercial damage and many injuries but no deaths.

Luxembourg prime minister visits Vienna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Luxembourg's prime minister and Austria's
chancellor discussed plans Tuesday for next month's informal
European Union summit as well as the financial and political crisis
in Russia which has rattled European currency and stock markets.
	   Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker stopped by Vienna on Tuesday
morning after visiting Slovenia and before traveling on to
Bulgaria.
	   During their talks, Juncker and Chancellor Viktor Klima
discussed plans for EU internal reforms which will be on the agenda
for the October summit in the Austrian resort town of Poertschach.
	   Klima said the two reviewed plans for the EU's Agenda 2000
program as well as plans for expanding the EU to include Eastern
European countries _ a priority issue for Austria.
	   Juncker, who also holds the finance portfolio, also met with
Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger to discuss the financial crisis in
Russia and its impact on European economies.
	   The Austrians, like others in the EU, have insisted that Russia
first resolve its political problems and install a functioning
government before any talk of economic help for Moscow.
	   Klima said that as soon as the Russian Duma endorses a prime
minister, Edlinger and senior diplomats from Austria, Germany and
Britain -- the so-called ``EU troika'' _ would travel to Moscow for
talks with the Russians.
	   On Kosovo, Klima and Juncker also repeated EU demands for an end
to the Serb crackdown on Albanian extremists to avoid a
humanitarian disaster for the tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanians
left homeless by the conflict.
	   The two said the international community could make a
contribution to a longterm settlement in Kosovo only the fighting
stops and the safety of international monitors there can be
guaranteed.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shooters training for the
Commonwealth Games have spotted some bold intruders roaming the
range: rats.
	   Following competitors' complaints, pest controllers have been
summoned to the Langkawi International Shooting Range ahead of the
opening ceremony of the games on Friday.
	   The rat hunters have installed traps at the 80 million ringgit
(21 million) venue in a forested area at the foot of Gunung Raya,
the highest mountain on the island, the national Bernama news
agency said.
	   Shooting will be held Sept. 13-20. Categories for men and women
include air rifle and rapid fire pistol.

Leaders of Ukraine, Azerbaijan discuss Caspian oil export route
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
Tuesday that Azerbaijan supports transportation of its oil from
Caspian Sea deposits through Ukraine, a news agency reported.
	   Speaking in the Azerbaijani capital Baku after a meeting with
President Geidar Aliev, Kuchma said Aliev supported ``in
principle'' the possibility of exporting oil to Western Europe
through Ukraine, Interfax reported.
	   Kuchma and presidents of seven other nations arrived in Baku on
Monday to to participate in an international conference organized
by Aliev to discuss a future transportation corridor that would
stretch from European countries to Asia through the Caucasus
Mountains.
	   The conference, meant to revive the ancient Great Silk route,
brought together a total of some 700 delegates from 12
international organizations and more than 30 countries in Europe in
Asia.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to take part in the transportation of oil from Azerbaijan's huge
Caspian Sea deposits.
	   The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers
from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to the Black Sea port of
Odessa, where a large oil terminal is currently under construction.
	   From there, the oil will flow via a pipeline _ also under
construction _ to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export.
	   Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko, who
also attended the conference in Baku, said the country would be
ready to start transporting Caspian Sea oil in two years.
	   He told Interfax that the Odessa oil terminal is being rapidly
completed, while half of the Odessa-Brody pipeline also has been
finished. Ukraine needs about dlrs 400 million to complete the
pipeline, Holubchenko said.

Ivory Coast leader expects South Africa to play peace-keeping role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Ivory Coast President Henri Konan
Bedie on Tuesday called on South Africa to play an essential
peace-keeping role on the African continent.
	   Warning that trouble spots in Africa hampered economic
development, Bedie told lawmakers that post-apartheid South Africa
had a huge responsibility on the continent.
	   ``The return on the African scene of your country will speed up
the implementation of solutions,'' he told Parliament during a
state visit.``The whole African continent is turning towards the
new South Africa and is expecting a lot from it.''
	   Since all-race elections ended white rule in 1994, South Africa
has tried to broker peace agreements in conflicts from Sudan to
Congo.
	   However, the country has been more reticent about committing
forces on the ground.
	   President Nelson Mandela refused to comment to reporters about
the possibility of sending peace-keeping troops to Congo, where a
civil war has dragged in armies from up to six nations.
	   ``When we are invited to do (it), we will then make a public
statement,'' he said.
	   Earlier Bedie received a ceremonial welcome and was awarded the
Order of Good Hope, South Africa's highest medal for foreigners. In
return Bedie gave Mandela Ivory Coast's Grand Cross of National
Unity.
	   As a 21-gun salute boomed over Cape Town, Bedie inspected a
military guard of honor and listened as an army band played his
national anthem. The two leaders also signed a letter of intent to
strike an agreement to protect each others' business investments.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli shelling eastern Lebanon,
monitoring committee ends meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) - Israel sent warplanes against
suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Tuesday and
unleashed an artillery barrage on two villages in the country's
east, security officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from two attacks by
Israeli jets at 8:30 a.m. (0530GMT) and 11:00 a.m. (0800GMT) or
from the artillery fire.
	   As violence escalated, a multinational committee monitoring a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire in south Lebanon urged Israel and Lebanese
guerrillas to avoid targeting civilians.
	   The committee, with truce monitors from the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, was set up to oversee the
agreement to spare civilians reached after an Israeli bombing blitz
of southern Lebanon in April 1996.
	   The Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said in the first air raid two Israel jets each fired
an air-to-surface rocket on targets in the hills between the
villages of Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
	   Two jets returned to fire a rocket on Louweizeh 2 1/2 hours
later, the officials said.
	   Israel frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel's panhandle, but it wasn't
clear exactly why Tuesday's raids were carried out.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   A Lebanese security official said the Israeli may have detected
guerrilla movements and decided to strike to prevent infiltration
into the Israeli-held territories.
	   In Israel, the army had said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   The air attacks were followed by 30 minutes of artillery fire
targeting areas near the villages of Maidoun and Ein el-Tineh in
eastern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   The two villages are near the provincial town of Rashaya, which
is on the southern edge of the Bekaa Valley about seven kilometers
(four miles) from Lebanon's border with Syria.

Tanker truck explodes near two buses, at least 45 killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A tanker truck flipped and exploded on
a highway early Tuesday, igniting two charter buses returning from
a religious festival, firefighters said. At least 45 people burned
to death and dozens were injured.
	   The accident happened just before 3 a.m. local time (0600 GMT)
on the Anhanguera Highway near Araras, about 110 miles (180 kms)
northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   ``The tanker truck lost control and flipped,'' Wilson Lima of
the Araras fire department said by telephone. ``A liquor truck
rammed it from behind, and the fuel or chemicals _ we don't know
for sure yet _ spilled on to the highway.''
	   The two buses drove by and were in the pool of flammable liquid
when it burst into flame, Lima said.
	   ``It was incredible bad luck,'' he said. ``They just happened to
be right on top when it exploded. The victims were carbonized.''
	   TV film footage showed a long stretch of the highway's median
strip charred black, and a row of wooden coffins on the roadside.
	   Many passengers escaped with minor injuries. Lima said 39 people
were hospitalized in Araras and Leme, but most were released.
	   The buses were heading to the midwestern city of Anapolis with
pilgrims returning from Aparecida do Norte, a town 107 miles (173
kms) east of Sao Paulo that houses the basilica of Our Revealed
Lady, Brazil's patron saint.
	   Some 50,000 people attended a mass and protest rally in
Aparecida do Norte on Monday, Brazil's independence day. The rally
was part of a nationwide protest to call attention to poverty and
unemployment.
	   News reports put the number of victims at 50, but Lima said the
real number wouldn't be known until police and firefighters
returned from the scene.

Airplane makers selling jets, but worry about downturn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to show all airplanes ordered from Airbus, adding
2 grafs at end with American Eagle ordering up to 150 small
Brazilian jets from Embraer, no pickup
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ European planemaker Airbus Industrie
scored big wins over rival Boeing on Tuesday, signing deals to sell
16 widebody jets and six smaller ones with list prices totaling
dlrs 2.7 billion.
	   Airbus will deliver 10 big A340 models to International Lease
Finance Corp., or ILFC, a Los Angeles group that buys aircraft and
rents them out to air carriers.
	   Terms were not disclosed, but industry sources privately placed
the value of the widebody A340 jets at about dlrs 1.5 billion. ILFC
also ordered six smaller A320 jets with a list price of about dlrs
300 million.
	   The Dubai-based carrier Emirates ordered six A340-500 models,
with an asking price of roughly dlrs 900 million. Emirates took
options on another 10 A340s, which could add another dlrs 1.5
billion to its deal with Airbus, the consortium from France,
Britain, Germany and Spain.
	   The Emirates chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, told
reporters he would use the new Airbus jets to launch nonstop
flights from the Gulf to points as far away as North America and
Australia.
	   Airbus landed its orders on the second day of the Farnborough
International 98 show, the industry's top event of the year where
the Boeing Co., of Seattle, has thus far announced just dlrs 1.1
billion in new orders.
	   The planemakers are enjoying boom times along with busy
airlines, and Airbus indicated it will try to take advantage of
this by raising its asking prices by 3 percent, even though
analysts warn that the aviation business is headed for a sharp
downturn in 2000.
	   Boeing earlier raised list prices by about 5 percent.
	   The chief operating officer at ILFC, John Plueger, told a news
conference that his company is looking beyond the imminent sluggish
market to a sharp increase in air travel by the middle of the next
decade. Plueger is bullish that by then there will be an Asian
economic recovery and strong demand for airline seats in the
region.
	   ``The industry has reached a crescendo now, a peak,'' Plueger
said. ``The period 2002-2006 will be quite robust.''
	   Although air shows give planemakers the opportunity to hype
their orders and talk of building bigger and better aircraft, it
has become clear this week that the manufacturers see a growing
market for smaller jets.
	   The Canadian company Bombardier announced Tuesday it wants to
build a new 90-seat regional jet, dubbed the BRJ-X series.
	   Bombardier's chairman and chief executive, Laurent Beaudoin,
called the planned model ``the next logical step'' in the
short-haul aviation market.
	   Earlier, Airbus outlined plans for a 100-seat A318 model that it
hopes to build to compete with Boeing's recently launched small 717
jets.
	   The Brazilian jet maker Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A.
said Tuesday it sold a big batch of its small regional aircraft to
American Eagle, the commuter carrier of American Airlines, in a
deal potentially worth dlrs 2 billion.
	   American Eagle ordered 75 of the 37-seat ERJ-135 jets, with
options on 75 more as it moves to replace turboprop airplanes that
are unpopular with many passengers. The Brazilians also signed
smaller deals Tuesday with carriers from Luxembourg, France and
Australia.

Forest fires raging in Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires were raging across Russia's Far
Eastern region of Khabarovsk on Tuesday despite massive efforts to
put out the blazes, officials said.
	   Fires in more than 60 areas have engulfed a total of 419,000
hectares (1 million acres) of taiga forest. Some 600 people and 300
firefighting machines were combating the fires, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   However, it quoted officials in the Far Eastern forest
protection air base as saying only several days of rain could stop
the flames.
	   Large forest areas in the Khabarovsk area already have been
consumed by fire, which luckily left forest villages and industrial
projects intact, said ITAR-Tass. Fires also were reported in 26
areas in other regions of Russia's Far East on Tuesday.

Muralitharan to play in England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Sri Lankan spin-bowler Muttiah
Muralitharan has signed a one-year contract to play for Lancashire
in England's county cricket competition.
	   Muralitharan, the leading bowler in international cricket with
68 wickets this year, will join Lancashire after his commitments
with World Cup holders Sri Lanka end at the 1999 World Cup in May,
Lancashire officials said Tuesday.
	   The move was announced less than two weeks after the prolific
bowler's action was criticized by England coach David Lloyd, as
Muralitharan tore through his England side in a one-off test at the
Oval.
	   Lloyd, whose son Graham is a prominent batsman in the Lancashire
team, was ``severely reprimanded'' by the English Cricket Board
after criticizing Muralitharan as he took 16 wickets in Sri Lanka's
10-wicket win over England.
	   Muralitharan, whose unusual bent-arm bowling action has been
cleared by the International Cricket Council after medical tests
proved a deformity prevented him from straightening his arm
completely, has been one of the key players in Sri Lanka's rise out
of cricket obscurity in the 1990s.
	   Lancashire capped off a successful week by signing the
27-year-old international after clinching two league limited-overs
titles in two days on Sunday and Monday.
	   Old Trafford officials have been tracking Muralitharan since
current captain Wasim Akram announced his unavailability next
season due to his World Cup commitments with Pakistan.
	   Akram, who has played for Lancashire for 10 seasons, has since
decided to have another season in England but will be forced to
play for another county after Lancashire signed the top-class
spinner.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ If Christian Vieri stays with Lazio of Rome long
enough, he might bring the team its first Italian League title
since 1974. But that's a big if.
	   In his swift rise to prominence in international soccer, Vieri
has made two things perfectly clear: he has a gift for scoring
goals and he doesn't stay with one club for long.
	   By moving to Lazio last month from Spanish club Atletico Madrid
on a dlrs 30 million transfer fee and signing a five-year, dlrs 15
million contract, the burly forward joined his eighth club in seven
seasons.
	   After landing Vieri, Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti proclaimed his
team ready to win the Serie A title. The season starts this
weekend, with Lazio at Piacenza.
	   ``Vieri is not synonymous with `title,' but it makes sense that
Lazio would expect a lot from me, given how much it's paying me,''
the 25-year-old player said. ``But I don't feel the weight of being
the big signing nor do I want to be called the anti-Ronaldo.''
	   The burden of expectations is enormous.
	   Vieri is not only seen as the key to Lazio's hopes, but is
widely considered the brightest star on Italy's embattled national
team. He already has eight goals in just 14 appearances with the
Azzurri, including five goals during the World Cup.
	   At Lazio, Vieri is slated to pair in attack with another new
arrival and World Cup standout, Chile's Marcelo Salas. While on
paper the duo seems capable of scoring in bunches, neither is
likely to create many opportunities for the other. They both tend
to specialize in putting the ball in the back of the net, rather
than setting up teammates.
	   That could be a problem, though Vieri insists it won't be.
	   ``Personally, I have a lot of confidence,'' he said. ``I am sure
that with great players like (Spanish midfielder Ivan) De la Pena
and (veteran Roberto) Mancini, who are perfect passers, it will be
easy for me to find shots on goal. If I am well physically, I don't
fear anything or anyone.''
	   His biggest assest may be his physique. At 6-foot-1 (1.85
meters) and 180 pounds (82 kilograms), Vieri can muscle many
defenders off the ball. While at times he can seem clumsy, he can
score with both feet and is dangerous in aerial play. Still, this
will be his first season as the focal point of an attack in the
defense-minded Serie A.
	   With so many new parts _ De la Pena was also signed over the
summer, as were eight of 11 starters Lazio used when it beat
defending Serie A champion Juventus of Turin 2-1 in August for the
Italian SuperCup _ it could take some time for Lazio to gel.
	   Some have questioned whether Vieri's penchant for moving from
team to team reflects an inability to get along with coaches or
teammates. A very public flap with Atletico _ sparked by the
striker showing up late for an exhibition game _ preceded his
switch to Lazio.
	   But Vieri says his moves are merely the result of him taking
advantage of his hot stock to improve his situation.
	   And he does come by his wanderlust honestly. Vieri lived for 11
years in Australia with his French mother and Italian father, a
player-turned-coach.
	   While it may be too much to ask of Vieri and Co. to take the
title this season, the future _ if there is one in Rome for the
traveling scorer _ could be bright for him and Lazio.
	   ``Compared to Juventus, we're hungrier,'' said Vieri, who spent
the 1996-97 with the Turin team. ``When was the last time Lazio won
the league title?''

	   LARYMNA, Greece (AP) - The coast guard Tuesday released 12
Greenpeace activists arrested for seizing waste shipping facilities
owned by Greece's largest nickel producer.
	   The activists were arrested late Monday after chaining
themselves to the facility, owned by Larco, to protest the
company's dumping of industrial waste into the Euboean Gulf about
130 kilometers (81 miles) north of Athens. They were not charged
with any crime.
	   Greenpeace claims that Larco's dumping of rust, a byproduct in
nickel manufacture, causes severe environmental problems to the
water and marine life.
	   Coast guard officers arrested the activists after a request by
Larco, which has denied the waste is environmentally hazardous.
	   Greenpeace spokesman Kostas Dombros, who also had been arrested,
said his organization ``will continue its efforts to stop Larco's''
dumping.

Hun Sen asserts rule as police smash Cambodian protest

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen reasserted his
power Tuesday after weeks of political conflict, sending riot
police swinging batons, bamboo rods and rifle butts to drive
opposition supporters from a protest camp in front of the National
Assembly.
	   Scattered demonstrators battled with security forces in the
streets, throwing stones and setting fires. Soldiers fired
thousands of rounds of in the air and deployed four fire trucks to
disperse them.
	   Demonstrators tried to slow the police charges by pouring
gasoline across intersections and setting it afire.
	   The surge of riot police through the makeshift shelters broke up
a two-week protest against alleged fraud in Cambodia's July 26
national election. The crowd, which at times numbered 10,000, had
called for the resignation of Hun Sen.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party, whose leader was under U.N.
protection, issued a statement saying the use of force is ``final
proof that Hun Sen cares nothing about democracy or freedom of
expression.''
	   The protestors were trapped for several minutes between lines of
police pushing up from the south and a water cannon directed at
them from the north. Police plowed through the camp, smashing
shelters and pounding women and children with their weapons.
	   An APTV cameraman saw a soldier swing the butt of his rifle at a
woman in her mid 60s, shattering her elbow. Another woman was
smashed in the mouth with a baton.
	   A third elderly woman was hit so hard with a rifle butt that
what appeared to be a piece of the gun went flying loose. She
crumpled to the ground, then picked herself up and ran.
	   No arrests were witnessed. Several people were brought to local
hospitals.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' said On Samath, 30, his head
taped and his shirt spotted with blood. ``The police started
pouring down the street. The next thing I knew, three started to
beat me with electric prods.''
	   The park was a wasteland of plastic sheeting, bags and straw
mats. Soldiers looted the belongings of those who fled, taking
everything from motorcycles to clothing. In the early evening, a
larger than usual file of motorists circled the park and other
trouble spots. Police broke up clusters of people gathering in
their neighborhoods.
	   The assault followed an ultimatum by Hun Sen ordering the
protesters to leave the site by midnight Monday or he would use
force to evict them. The order came after grenades were tossed into
his Phnom Penh residence. He was not at home, and no one was
injured in the blast.
	   About 10 minutes after the police swarmed into the camp, the
crowd managed to flee on streets running north, slowly pursued by
police and troops firing automatic rifles into the air.
	   The demonstrators staged hit-and-run battles with the security
forces, regrouping to throw stones and loose objects at them.
	   Almost all shops and public places in the capital were closed.
	   Other groups of demonstrators on hundreds of motorcycles cruised
streets near the railway station, staging rock-throwing brawls when
stopped by 100 club-wielding police.
	   Riot police and soldiers armed with assault rifles gradually
asserted control over key intersections. Sullen-looking motorcycle
drivers huddled in large groups, sometimes shouting insults.
	   The motorcycle taxis, whose drivers are a core of opposition
support, had earlier roared through the streets, snarling traffic
and beeping horns to the rhythm of the name of the politician who
has led the protests: ``Sam Rain-sy! Sam Rain-sy!''
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy for the attack on his house Monday and
ordered his arrest. The opposition leader spent the night at the
offices of the United Nations representative in Cambodia in a
luxury Phnom Penh hotel surrounded by police.
	   Political tensions in Cambodia had apparently eased slightly
late Monday after soldiers trying to disperse protestors killed at
least one man and injured several others. The government backed off
its plan to arrest Sam Rainsy and rescinded the deadline for the
protests to end.
	   But on Tuesday, police went ahead with the raid on the camp
anyway.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official who negotiated the
stand-down had said efforts would be made to peacefully end the
confrontations Tuesday. There was no government comment after the
raids.
	   Shielded by U.N. officials and cheered by a mob of thousands of
motorcycle riders, Sam Rainsy walked free Tuesday from the hotel,
hours before the raids on the park. He looked weary and nervous.
	   After a brief meeting with his opposition ally, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy returned to the U.N. offices in the company
of Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s special envoy in Cambodia.
	   ``It's probably the safest place in Phnom Penh,'' said his
spokesman, Rich Garrella.
	   The ambassadors of the United States, France, Canada, Australia,
Japan and Singapore consulted with the U.N. representative. The
contents of the talks were not immediately known.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli shelling eastern Lebanon,
monitoring committee ends meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel sent warplanes against
suspected guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Tuesday and
unleashed an artillery barrage on two villages in the country's
east, security officials said.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from two attacks by
Israeli jets or from the artillery fire.
	   As violence escalated, a multinational committee monitoring a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire in south Lebanon urged Israel and Lebanese
guerrillas to avoid targeting civilians.
	   The committee, with truce monitors from the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, was set up to oversee the
agreement to spare civilians. The agreement was reached after an
Israeli bombing blitz of southern Lebanon in April 1996.
	   The Lebanese security officials, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, said in the first air raid two Israeli jets each
fired air-to-surface rockets at targets in the hills between the
villages of Mlita and Louweizeh in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province.
	   Two jets returned to fire again on Louweizeh 2 1/2 hours later,
the officials said.
	   Israel frequently conducts air raids in the area, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) north of Israel, but it wasn't clear exactly
why Tuesday's raids were carried out.
	   The area is a stronghold of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militia
that attacks Israeli troops and the allied South Lebanon Army
militia in the Israeli-occupied strip to the south.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is trying to oust
1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members from the occupied zone
established by Israel in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   A Lebanese security official said Israel may have detected
guerrilla movements and decided to strike to prevent infiltration
into the Israeli-held territories.
	   In Israel, the army had said air force planes attacked ``terror
bases'' in the area of Sojud, scoring ``precise hits'' and
returning safely to base.
	   The air attacks were followed by 30 minutes of artillery fire
targeting areas near the villages of Maidoun and Ein el-Tineh in
eastern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   The two villages are near the provincial town of Rashaya, which
is on the southern edge of the Bekaa Valley about seven kilometers
(four miles) from Lebanon's border with Syria.

 &UR; Milosevic stands ground in Kosovo, but hints at political
compromise
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported new battles; reaction from militant
spokesman; CHANGES byline; TRIMS. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a short reprieve, battles in
Kosovo intensified Tuesday, and a spokesman for ethnic Albanian
militants blasted U.S. envoys for their policies in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by the Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported a heavy Serb offensive near the Albanian
border and in central region of Kosovo.
	   The report, which could not be independently confirmed, said
``numerous (ethnic) Albanians were killed and injured, including
women and children.'' The fighting between ethnic Albanian
separatists and Serb-led forces followed a brief lull over the past
week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted Monday he has no
intention of calling off his offensive, despite renewed appeals
from American and European officials.
	   But in an apparent sign he is willing to compromise, Milosevic
was reported considering holding new elections for a Kosovo
parliament that would be dominated by rival ethnic Albanians.
	   The reliable independent daily Glas Javnosti said Tuesday that
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans.
	   The newspaper said parliamentary elections should be held within
three months and that the formation of a new Kosovo parliament
could represent the basis of an agreement between Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia, has indicated its opposition to an
agreement in principle reached last week under U.S. mediation
between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Under the proposed formula, Kosovo would eventually be granted
self-rule but not full independence. Details remain unresolved, and
Western diplomats say it could take months to finalize them.
	   Adem Demaci, the KLA's political representative, complained
Tuesday that the draft of the interim agreement does not include
any guarantees that Milosevic, who has been known for breaking
promises, would live up to the accord.
	   ``Only force can make him carry out what he promises,'' Demaci
told reporters. ``That's the only language he understands.''
	   Demaci also blasted U.S. envoys Christopher Hill, who has been
shuttling between Milosevic and Rugova, and Richard Holbrooke, who
has visited the region several times since fighting started in
early March.
	   Holbrooke negotiated a Dayton peace deal for Bosnia with
Milosevic in 1995. Demaci accused the two of favoring the Serbs.
	   ``I don't have complaints about the orientation of the American
foreign policy ... but we are unhappy with American envoys in
Kosovo,'' Demaci said.
	   He said Hill, the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
should deal with problems between the Albanian minority and
Macedonian authorities there, instead of mediating in Kosovo.
	   ``Therefore, Kosovo should have someone who has no (Macedonian)
or Dayton prejudices and should not favor (Serbian) force and its
results,'' Demaci said.
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.
	   United Nations agencies appealed Tuesday for dlrs 54 million to
help the estimated 265,000 people who have fled the fighting. About
50,000 of them are living in makeshift shelters scattered
throughout the province.
	   ``Adequate funding is critical to avert further tragedy in the
freezing hills where tens of thousands of displaced people are
huddling,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said
in Geneva. ``We have to act very quickly since time is running
out.''

Police: man in alleged beating case died of natural causes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday dismissed
allegations that a man had been beaten to death at one of its Gaza
offices and said an autopsy showed he died of natural causes.
	   However, human rights activists demanded a more thorough
investigation of the death of Hussein Abed Abu Ghali, 55, from the
Khan Yunis refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip.
	   On Sunday, Abu Ghali had gone to a Palestinian government office
in Gaza to ask the Palestinian Authority to intercede with the
Israeli government, which had refused to grant him permits to take
his 16-year-old son to Jordan for medical treatment.
	   It wasn't clear what happened during his visit, but he was
pronounced dead later at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, where a doctor
signed the death certificate without an autopsy, the Palestinian
Human Rights Monitoring Group said.
	   Family members and the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group
accused the officials of beating the father of 10 children to death
since he had blood and a boot print on his shirt.
	   The commander of the Palestinian police, Ghazi Jabali, said the
body was exhumed on Tuesday so an autopsy could be conducted in the
presence of family members and human rights officials.
	   Jabali said the autopsy found no evidence of violence.
	   ``The death came as a result of diabetes, which lead to high
blood pressure in his head and a normal death,'' Jabali said. ``The
report says he was not tortured or beaten and there was no criminal
behavior behind his death.''
	   However, the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens'
Rights in Gaza City demanded that security officials Abu Ghali came
in contact with questioned about what happened.
	   The human rights group said it could not be ruled out that Abu
Ghali was insulted or even roughed up and that this caused his
blood pressure to rise.
	   Abu Ghali's son Taha was severely wounded during violent
demonstrations in May against the anniversary of Israel's
establishment 50 years ago.

Late Japanese film director Kurosawa laid to rest in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The late Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa was
honored by close friends and family members Tuesday at a private
funeral service two days after he died at age 88.
	   Those in attendance were joined by dozens of fans who crowded
outside the Kurosawa home in a residential neighborhood of Tokyo to
bid farewell as the filmmaker's unpainted wooden casket was lowered
into a hearse.
	   About 100 people, including many famous names in Japan's film
industry, were invited to the non-denominational service Tuesday
afternoon before Kurosawa's body was cremated.
	   The master director was dressed in his trademark black jacket,
sunglasses and cap, according to local media reports.
	   Kurosawa, who won a trio of Oscars for films such as
``Rashomon,'' died of a stroke on Sunday. He was Japan's best known
director overseas and word of his death inspired tribute from
around the world.
	   A memorial service open to the public will be held on Sunday at
Kurosawa's studio in Yokohama just outside of Tokyo, Kyodo News
reported.
	   Kurosawa's wife of 35 years, actress Yoko Yaguchi, died in 1985.
They are survived by their son, Hisao, and daughter, Kazuko.

Opposition leader: Nigerian exiles still won't return

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's leading exiles will not return
home until the military junta revokes a sweeping security decree
allowing people to be arrested without charge, an opposition figure
has said.
	   The comments from Abraham Adesanya, chairman of the National
Democratic Coalition, came one day after Nigeria's military ruler
again invited the country's political exiles to return to their
home country, saying he had asked his justice minister to drop
felony charges against many of them.
	   But the continued existence of decree No. 2 _ which gives the
security services wide latitude to make arrests _ will keep the
exiles abroad, Adesanya said.
	   ``What drove many of those exiles out of the country is this
decree,'' he told the Lagos-based Guardian newspaper for its
Tuesday editions.
	   Many of the country's most prominent exiles belong to the
Democratic Coalition.
	   Nigeria's most prominent exile, Nobel Prize-winning writer Wole
Soyinka, was among a group of Nigerian dissidents who planned to
return from exile if the military regime dropped criminal charges
against them, a Lagos newspaper reported last week.
	   The exiled activists met recently in London and decided to
return to their homeland if Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's government
formally withdrew murder, treason and other charges lodged by late
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, the Lagos daily This Day reported.
	   But the exiles also demanded the repeal of decrees allowing the
government to detain opponents without trial.
	   Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, fled
Nigeria in 1995 after learning that military authorities were going
to arrest him for criticizing the government. He now teaches at
Emory University in Atlanta.
	   Abacha regularly jailed and sometimes executed his critics,
prompting international condemnation of his government.
	   Abubakar, who took over after Abacha's sudden death in early
June, has appealed to exiles to return home before national
elections scheduled for Feb. 27.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ India, Australia and Canada are
among the teams playing opening matches in the first cricket event
ever at a Commonwealth Games.
	   Although the limited-over matches are not recognized by the
International Cricket Council (ICC), the game is likely to draw a
crowd, mainly to see Indian master blaster Sachin Tendulkar in
action.
	   Canada returns to international exposure after nearly two
decades. The country last qualified for the World Cup in 1979.
	   India will be without a proper bowling line up when it plays
Antigua as its main bowlers are playing in Toronto, Canada, against
Pakistan for the Sahara Cup.
	   India's bowling against the Caribbeans will be led by Debashish
Mohanty and Paras Mahambrey. They will be supported by spinners
Harbhajan Singh, Rahul Sanghvi and Robin Singh.
	   Canada's batting against the mighty Australians will be led by
George Cordinton and Paul Prashad while Daves Joseph, Brian
Rajadurai and Sanjay Thuraisingam will be their main bowlers.
	   ``We'll be out to win as convincingly as we can,'' Australian
skipper Steve Waugh said after Australians braved steady rain
during their first training session.
	   The Australian one-day skipper said he was happy to face Canada
before confronting Antigua, which boasts West Indies paceman Curtly
Ambrose, on Saturday and an Indian side with Tendulkar on it next
Tuesday.
	   The other matches scheduled for Wednesday are between Sri Lanka
and Malaysia, Pakistan and Scotland and Jamaica and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Commerce Ministry will extend
anti-dumping tariffs on imports of U.S. high fructose corn syrup to
include syrup above grade 55.
	   In January, the ministry placed tariffs on imports of grade 42
and grade 55 of high fructose syrup, also known as HFCS, following
an investigation in which it determined that imports of the
sweetener were damaging Mexico's domestic sugar industry. The
higher the grade the sweeter the syrup.
	   In a press release Monday, the secretariat said the new tariffs
were dlrs 90.26 per metric ton for HFCS imports from A.E. Staley
Manufacturing Company and dlrs 55.37 per metric ton on imports from
Archer Daniels Midland Company.
	   The ministry said it was also investigating charges that HFCS
exporters were using grade 90 HFCS to circumvent the tariff on
grade 55.
	   Mexico's National Sugar and Alcohol Industries Chamber brought
charges against imports of HFCS in February 1997, arguing that its
use among soft-drink makers was displacing Mexican sugar.

 &UR; Milosevic stands ground in Kosovo, but hints at political
compromise
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported new battles; reaction from militant
spokesman; CHANGES byline; TRIMS. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After a short reprieve, battles in
Kosovo intensified Tuesday, and a spokesman for ethnic Albanian
militants blasted U.S. envoys for their policies in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by the Kosovo Albanian
leadership, reported a heavy Serb offensive near the Albanian
border and in the central region of Kosovo.
	   The report, which could not be independently confirmed, said
``numerous (ethnic) Albanians were killed and injured, including
women and children.'' The fighting between ethnic Albanian
separatists and Serb-led forces followed a brief lull over the past
week.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted Monday he has no
intention of calling off his offensive, despite renewed appeals
from American and European officials.
	   But in an apparent sign he is willing to compromise, Milosevic
was reported considering holding new elections for a Kosovo
parliament that would be dominated by rival ethnic Albanians.
	   The independent daily Glas Javnosti said Tuesday that Milosevic
has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting election
plans.
	   The newspaper said parliamentary elections should be held within
three months and that the formation of a new Kosovo parliament
could represent the basis of an agreement between Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia, has indicated its opposition to an
agreement in principle reached last week under U.S. mediation
between Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Under the proposed formula, Kosovo would eventually be granted
self-rule but not full independence. Details remain unresolved, and
Western diplomats say it could take months to finalize them.
	   Adem Demaci, the KLA's political representative, complained
Tuesday that the draft of the interim agreement does not include
any guarantees that Milosevic, who has been known for breaking
promises, would live up to the accord.
	   ``Only force can make him carry out what he promises,'' Demaci
told reporters. ``That's the only language he understands.''
	   Demaci also blasted U.S. envoys Christopher Hill, who has been
shuttling between Milosevic and Rugova, and Richard Holbrooke, who
has visited the region several times since fighting started in
early March.
	   Holbrooke negotiated the Dayton peace deal for Bosnia with
Milosevic in 1995. Demaci accused the two of favoring the Serbs.
	   ``I don't have complaints about the orientation of the American
foreign policy ... but we are unhappy with American envoys in
Kosovo,'' Demaci said.
	   He said Hill, the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
should deal with problems between the Albanian minority and
Macedonian authorities there, instead of mediating in Kosovo.
	   ``Therefore, Kosovo should have someone who has no (Macedonian)
or Dayton prejudices and should not favor (Serbian) force and its
results,'' Demaci said.
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.
	   United Nations agencies appealed Tuesday for dlrs 54 million to
help the estimated 265,000 people who have fled the fighting. About
50,000 of them are living in makeshift shelters scattered
throughout the province.
	   ``Adequate funding is critical to avert further tragedy in the
freezing hills where tens of thousands of displaced people are
huddling,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said
in Geneva. ``We have to act very quickly since time is running
out.''

EU warns Italy over Milan airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Italy is facing a showdown with the
European Commission over a plan to expand Milan's Malpensa airport
which rival airlines denounce as unfairly favoring the Italian
carrier Alitalia.
	   The 20-member European Union executive meets Wednesday to
discuss a proposal by Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock to demand
Italy alter its plans to oblige foreign airlines flying in and out
of Milan to move to Malpensa next month.
	   ``What they are doing is illegal and they must change that
system right away,'' Kinnock's spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said
Tuesday.
	   Nine European airlines have complained about the plan to move
them to Malpensa on Oct. 25. They say the poor road and rail links
from Malpensa to downtown Milan 53 kilometers (33 miles) away means
they'll lose passengers to Alitalia.
	   Under the Italian government's plans, flights to Milan will be
switched to the new terminal from the current Linate airport which
is just 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city center.
	   An exception will be made for Alitalia's shuttle flights between
Rome and Milan which will be allowed to stay at Linate. Competitors
fear that long-haul passengers will prefer flying with the Italian
carrier from Linate to Rome and on to their final destination,
rather than trekking out to Malpensa.
	   Kinnock agrees and is expected to secure approval from the
Commission for a demand that Italy change its plans or face legal
action. However, his spokeswoman said they were hoping a compromise
could be found.
	   ``We are looking for a solution that does not slam the door in
Italy's face,'' Lambert told reporters.

Official: Robinson unlikely to meet dissidents while in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS grammar in lead; SUBS 5th graf pvs with 2 grafs to
UPDATE with appeal from family of jailed dissident &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite the U.N. human rights chief's stated
desire to meet a ``wide range'' of Chinese, China suggested Tuesday
that Mary Robinson was unlikely to see any dissidents.
	   On the third day of her 10-day groundbreaking mission to China,
Robinson met with members of the government-backed women's
federation and the senior official overseeing policies toward
ethnic minorities.
	   When asked by reporters if Robinson would meet any dissidents,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao recited her official
schedule. He noted she would meet with government officials,
government-backed groups and academics and travel to Tibet and
Shanghai.
	   ``I think apart from the set agenda agreed upon by the two
sides, I don't think there will be any other functions or
activities,'' Zhu said at twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Robinson's trip _ the first ever official mission to China by a
U.N. high commissioner for human rights _ has generated pleas from
dissidents to promote tolerance and curb police powers. The family
of a jailed veteran democracy campaigner appealed to Robinson to
monitor a labor camp hearing Thursday on his claim of wrongful
imprisonment, a Hong Kong-based rights group said.
	   Yang Qinheng was sentenced by police without trial in February
to three years in a labor camp, apparently for writing an open
letter on rising unemployment, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Upon arriving in Beijing on Sunday, Robinson said she was aware
of the expectations created by her visit. She said she hoped to
``meet a wide range of the civil society in China.''
	   Robinson is treading a careful line. She hopes to promote human
rights and nurture a nascent dialogue with China's Communist Party
leaders without alienating them.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu said he hoped Robinson's
trip will ``enhance our mutual understanding and promote China's
cooperation with the U.N. in the human rights field.''
	   China has been leery of discussing human rights with the United
Nations. The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
	   Speaking to a group of academics Monday, Robinson noted the
``important progress'' China has made in human rights. But she
urged Chinese leaders to make good on a six-month-old pledge to
sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
	   The treaty and along with the Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which China has signed but not ratified, are
considered basic guarantees of fundamental rights.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian helicopter maker Agusta on Tuesday said it
had signed a joint venture with Bell Helicopter, a U.S. maker, to

Papua New Guinea team scrambled for funds after killer tsunami
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Papua New Guinea has sent 41
athletes to the Commonwealth Games, but their path was a troubled
one after the killer tsunami in July.
	   The nation's sporting bodies, which were relying on private
corporate sponsors for financial support, had to scramble when
sponsorship money was re-directed to assist victims of the
tsunamis.
	   More than 2,000 people died and thousands were left homeless
when the 10-meter (33-foot) wave swept ashore.
	   The Papua New Guinea Sports Federation was forced to seek out
new sources of revenue, the national Bernama news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   To raise money, the federation organized ``fun runs'' in which
more than 10,000 people took part. It raised 350,000 kina (dlrs
342,000).
	   Ivan Ravu, general manager for the team, said neither the size
of the team nor the members' morale had been affected by the quest
for funds.
	   Papua New Guinea has representatives in boxing, lawn bowls,
rugby, shooting, squash, swimming and weightlifting, as well as
lone sprinter Peter Pulu in athletics.

 &UR; Russian ruble remains unstable, no rate set Tuesday &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with former Prime Minister Gaidar saying
it could take up to 2 years to stabilize the economy in grafs 6 and
13, Fyodorov and Dubinin quotes, Duma to discuss price freeze,

 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government accused the Central Bank on Tuesday
of mishandling Russia's spiraling economic crisis, while the
nation's top economic policy maker said the government was
committed to genuine reforms _ not just printing money.
	   Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax chief, said
the Central Bank should ``stop the games with the ruble rate.''
	   ``At today's rate, the Central Bank could easily buy all the
rubles in circulation,'' added Fyodorov.
	   Both the government and the Central Bank believe that the ruble
has fallen too far. The ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
16 cents per ruble, before the crisis took off less than a month
ago. As of Tuesday, it reached 20 to the dollar _ or 5 cents per
ruble _ in street trading, though no official rate was set.
	   Neither the government nor the Central Bank has announced a plan
to halt the slide of the ruble.
	   Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin, who offered his
resignation Monday, told reporters Tuesday that he had offered his
resignation to ease political pressure on the bank, and appealed
for the bank to be permitted to retain its independence.
	   He said that it would be possible for the bank to increase the
money supply to meet government needs, but that the move would have
to be followed by a period of tougher monetary policy to avoid
hyperinflation.
	   He also said it would be possible to increase the bank's foreign
exchange reserves only with the help of the International Monetary
Fund. Russia's reserves have fallen to about dlrs 11 billion _
about half of what they were a year ago, officials said Tuesday.
	   Fyodorov, currently the architect of official economic policy,
denied that the government intended to print money _ a step that
could stem panic over the rocketing dollar-to-ruble rate but spawn
runaway inflation.
	   He reiterated in a statement released through the ITAR-Tass news
agency Tuesday that the acting government would stick to a strict
monetary policy to stabilize prices and the exchange rate, balance
the budget, and carry out a radical tax reform.
	   However, both local authorities and the Communist-dominated
parliament signaled they wanted to return to Soviet-style controls
over the economy. Regional governors have began introducing
measures to regulate prices, while the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, scheduled debate this week on establishing price
freezes.
	   Government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said that price-fixing
was illegal. He warned that ``state regulation of prices ... will
push goods `under the counter,' resulting in a black market and
black-market prices,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The Duma will also demand that bank account-holders be
compensated for their losses by a system of indexing, Duma speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Since the crisis hit, people have been scrambling to get their
money out of the banks and prices have soared. By Monday, some
store shelves had been picked clean, while other stores were simply
closed in the face of rapidly rising prices.
	   Former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar told reporters that it could
take up to two years for the economy to stabilize.
	   ``With sensible economic policies, it would be quite possible to
stabilize the country within six months,'' Gaidar said. ``More
realistically, it is likely the crisis will last at least two
years.''

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan, home to the world's longest-living
population and one of the world's lowest fertility rates, now has
more than 10,000 centenarians, the government said Tuesday.
	   There will be 10,158 Japanese 100 years or older at the end of
September _ 1,667 more than a year ago, the Health and Welfare
Ministry said. Of those who have lived a century, 82.2 percent are
women.
	   It is the 28th year-to-year increase in the number of the
centenarians, according to a list of the centenarians released by
the ministry ahead of Respect for the Aged Day, Sept. 15.
	   Japan's oldest citizen, 114-year-old Tase Matsunaga, is in a
nursing home in Tokyo.
	   No international comparisons of the number of centenarians were
available, a ministry official said.
	   Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy _ 83.82 years
for women and 77.19 years for men _ thanks in large part to high
income levels, modern and widely available health care services and
a low-fat diet.
	   The birthrate, however, is declining fast. the ministry reported
earlier this year that the average Japanese woman has an average of
only 1.39 babies in her lifetime.

Macedonia's president breaks his arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonia's 81-year-old president, Kiro
Gligorov, broke his right arm Tuesday after falling down the stairs
in his residence, officials said.
	   Tuesday is the seventh anniversary since Macedonia declared
independence from former Yugoslavia and Gligorov, who led the
country then, was scheduled to hold a news conference and attend a
cocktail party.
	   Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic which gained
independence without bloodshed, largely thanks to Gligorov's
policies. More than 1,000 U.N. soldiers, including Americans, have
been deployed along Macedonia's volatile borders.
	   The president survived a car bomb attack in 1995 in which he
lost his right eye and received serious head injuries. The
attackers have not been captured.
	   Gligorov was elected president in 1991 and then again in 1994.
He is banned by the constitution from running for a third term.
	   The team of doctors attending Gligorov said Tuesday that the
president feels fine but must remain in the hospital for a while
for observation.

Buffaloes beat Fighters 5-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Phil Clark went 4-for-5, leading the Kintetsu
Buffaloes to a 5-3 victory over the Pacific League's front-running
Nippon Ham Fighters at Osaka Dome on Tuesday.
	   In the four-run third inning, Clark, formerly with the Boston
Red Sox, hit a single and scored a run.
	   The Fighters are still one game ahead of the second-place Seibu
Lions who tied with the Orix BlueWave 2-2 in 12 innings. Under
Pacific League rules, games are limited to 12 innings.
	   The Lions tied 2-2 in sixth inning on former Triple-A Rochester
player Domingo Martinez's home run, his 25th homer of the season.
	   At Chiba, the Chiba Lotte Marines rapped out 11 hits, including
two singles by Julio Franco and a grand slam by Mitsuchika Hirai,
and blanked the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 11-0.
	   Franco formerly played with the Milwaukee Brewers. Hirai has
eight homers this season.
	   In the Central League, Takahiro Saeki tripled home three runs in
the third inning, leading the front-running Yokohama BayStars to a
5-3 victory over the Yakult Swallows at Sagamihara.
	   The BayStars are five games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who beat the Hanshin Tigers 5-3 at Nagoya Dome.
	   Leo Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, singled home the
first run in the two-run first inning for the Dragons.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Mariano Duncan singled home a tie-breaking run in
the fourth innig as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp
4-1 and extended their winning streak to four.
	   Duncan formerly played with the Toronto Blue Jays.

Police: man in alleged beating case died of natural causes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday dismissed
allegations that a man had been beaten to death at one of its Gaza
offices and said an autopsy showed he died of natural causes.
	   However, human rights activists demanded a more thorough
investigation of the death of Hussein Abed Abu Ghali, 55, from the
Khan Yunis refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip.
	   On Sunday, Abu Ghali had gone to a Palestinian government office
in Gaza to ask the Palestinian Authority to intercede with the
Israeli government, which had refused to grant him permits to take
his 16-year-old son to Jordan for medical treatment.
	   It wasn't clear what happened during his visit, but he was
pronounced dead later at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, where a doctor
signed the death certificate without an autopsy, the Palestinian
Human Rights Monitoring Group said.
	   Family members and the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group
accused the officials of beating the father of 10 children to death
since he had blood and a boot print on his shirt.
	   The commander of the Palestinian police, Ghazi Jabali, said the
body was exhumed on Tuesday so an autopsy could be conducted in the
presence of family members and human rights officials.
	   Jabali said the autopsy found no evidence of violence.
	   ``The death came as a result of diabetes, which lead to high
blood pressure in his head and a normal death,'' Jabali said. ``The
report says he was not tortured or beaten and there was no criminal
behavior behind his death.''
	   However, the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens'
Rights in Gaza City said it could not be ruled out that Abu Ghali
was insulted or even roughed up and that this caused his blood
pressure to rise.
	   Abu Ghali's son Taha was severely wounded during violent
demonstrations in May against the anniversary of Israel's
establishment 50 years ago.

FA backs away from job ultimatum to Hoddle.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Football Association confirmed Tuesday
it wanted to open contract extension talks with national team coach
Glenn Hoddle as soon as possible but denied giving him an
ultimatum.
	   FA spokesman Steve Double said Hoddle had not been given a
deadline to agree to a new deal.
	   ``The concept that there's some kind of ultimatum over the new
contract offer is nonsense,'' Double said Tuesday.
	   Double said that FA chief executive Graham Kelly and chairman
Keith Wisemen would ``like talks to begin sooner rather than
later.''
	   The FA has backed Hoddle in a series of controversies since
England was eliminated from the France 98 World Cup by Argentina in
the second round. FA officials have made no secret of their desire
for Hoddle to lead the team into the 2002 World Cup in Japan and
South Korea.
	   Hoddle has been besieged by controversy since the start of the
World Cup when he left Liverpool striker Michael Owen and
Manchester United star David Beckham off his starting team for the
tournament opener.
	   His support increased after England's spirited showing as it
played Argentina with 10 men, after Beckham was red-carded, through
the second half and extra time before losing on a penalty
shoot-out.
	   But Hoddle has since been accused of betraying the confidences
of players by publishing his World Cup diary and criticized for
using faith healer Eileen Drewery in team preparation.
	   England's 2-1 loss to Sweden in its opening Euro 2000 clash at
Stockholm on Saturday led to renewed calls for Hoddle to resign.
	   His contract expires at the end of England's Euro 2000 campaign
and he has refused to resign until then. Hoddle has said he is
considering extending his contract to take in the next World Cup.
	   Speculation over his tenure as national coach has increased
since his old club Tottenham fired head coach Christian Gross on
Saturday. Hoddle is reportedly a leading candidate to replace Gross
at the North London club.

Russian ruble remains unstable

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with Central Bank setting official ruble
rate at 20.825. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government accused the Central Bank on Tuesday
of mishandling Russia's spiraling economic crisis, while the
nation's top economic policy maker said the government was
committed to genuine reforms _ not just printing money.
	   Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax chief, said
the Central Bank should ``stop the games with the ruble rate.''
	   ``At today's rate, the Central Bank could easily buy all the
rubles in circulation,'' added Fyodorov.
	   Both the government and the Central Bank believe that the ruble
has fallen too far. The ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
16 cents per ruble, before the crisis took off less than a month
ago. As of Tuesday, it reached 20 to the dollar _ or 5 cents per
ruble _ in street trading, and the official rate was set late in
the day at 20.825.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ For their 15th wedding anniversary, Vera and Sasha
Sorokin invited all their friends and put out a big spread: fruit,
sausages, salads, and plenty of vodka.
	   That was in July, several weeks before the government devalued
the ruble and prices soared as Russia plunged into economic crisis.
Since then, big plans for Vera's upcoming 40th birthday have
evaporated.
	   ``I already know that I won't be able to have such a good
birthday party,'' she said glumly.
	   With few signs that the economy will stabilize soon, many
Russians are tightening their belts and falling back on Soviet-era
survival skills learned during decades of hardship.
	   Vera and Sasha don't fear they will go hungry. Instead, they
worry about a return to the chronic shortages, long lines and
rationing of the past.
	   Old words like ``kartochka,'' which means ration card, and
``defitsit,'' which literally means ``scarce item'' but in the
Soviet Union meant ``doesn't exist'' had been virtually extinct
until the latest crisis brought them back to people's lips.
	   Rationing in Moscow in the Soviet era was common on many items,
including butter, sugar, macaroni, vodka and cigarettes. In the
provinces, restrictions were even more severe.
	   ``People are afraid,'' said Vera, formerly a factory worker but
now employed in a state savings bank. ``We are afraid of rationing
again. We don't want lines.''
	   Food is the biggest item in most Russians' budgets, and what
goes on the table is usually the first place they feel the pinch in
times of economic crisis.
	   To make ends meet, there are several important rules. Cut back
and adjust your diet. Stock up on staples. Get out in the garden.
Scrap holidays. Don't get sick.
	   Vera has already dropped chicken from their diet. They never ate
a lot of red meat, but now it will be used just for making soup
stock.
	   She's loathe, however, to eliminate hot dogs.
	   ``Sasha just loves hot dogs. They're his favorite food. I really
don't want to have to stop buying them,'' said Vera.
	   Vera and Sasha, a shop assistant, don't really have the option
of going out and snapping up staples like many Russians are doing
these days.
	   ``We'd like to stock up on things, but we can't,'' said Vera.
``We don't have the money, and the prices are unreal.''
	   Although most aren't panicking, Russians are spending what they
can to stock up on rice, spaghetti, oats, flour, sugar and tea.
	   Russian newspapers have been advising their readers on ways to
cope. According to the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, rice can be kept
for three years and the best way to protect potatoes from rot is to
store them in the basement or on an enclosed balcony.
	   Russian officials say there is little chance people will go
hungry. Bread and potatoes make up 50 percent of the national diet,
and while the potato crop is expected to be worse than usual, grain
supplies are sufficient to guarantee the stores will be stocked
with bread.
	   In order to survive in the Soviet era, Russians relied on what
they they could grow. More than 40 million people have plots, which
as in Soviet times provide the nation with most of its food.
	   Vera and Sasha don't have a plot, but her parents do and it is
essential for their survival. Some people resent the idea that they
might have to farm to survive.
	   ``I work all the time,'' said Inna Muranova, a doctor in a
Moscow clinic. ``I don't have time to be a farmer.''
	   To make sure she has enough money for food, Muranova says she
won't buy anything new _ at all _ until the crisis passes.
	   ``We're in a trance,'' she said. ``We all work. We can't save,
and now they want us to be farmers.''

Japan's ruling party wants to stop cash flow to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment from Japanese foreign
minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Alarmed by North Korea's missile launch last week,
Japan's ruling party has decided to study ways of stopping a
regular flow of cash from reaching the coffers of its reclusive
communist neighbor, a party official said Tuesday.
	   In a meeting Monday, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
discussed the North Korean missile threat and decided to start
mulling legal changes to halt cash transfers from Japan to North
Korea, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Tokyo has no diplomatic ties with North Korea, but some ethnic
Koreans living in Japan are believed to regularly send money to
Pyongyang. About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of whom were
born in Japan. There is no official tally, but about 180,000 are
estimated to be loyal to the North.
	   The private flow of funds to North Korea has come under
increased scrutiny since Japanese officials announced the Stalinist
state fired a new type of ballistic missile over Japan into the
Pacific Ocean. North Korea, however, has countered that it only
launched a scientific satellite.
	   On Tuesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Japan
will not lift sanctions imposed on North Korea even if the firing
did launch a satellite into orbit as Pyongyang claims, Kyodo news
reported.
	   ``The fact that a booster flew over Japan remains unchanged and
there was no warning beforehand,'' Komura was quoted as saying by
Kyodo before a Parliamentary committee.
	   ``North Korea's possession of long-range missiles itself poses a
threat to Japan,'' he said.
	   The Defense Agency says the apparent missile test last Monday
proved North Korea is capable of striking any part of Japan. As a
result, the incident has prompted some Japanese politicians to push
for Japan's own missile monitoring and defense system.
	   Japan has stopped food aid, frozen its pledge to contribute dlrs
1 billion to an international nuclear power plant project in North
Korea and halted all charter flights between the two nations in
retaliation for the missile firing.
	   Quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, the ITAR-Tass news
agency of Russia reported Monday that North Korea will test another
missile on Wednesday.

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congo peace talks attended by
seven African presidents derailed Tuesday when rebels stormed out
of the meeting site, complaining they had been snubbed and
mistreated.
	   A draft of a cease-fire agreement that the presidents had been
expected to sign was withdrawn as the leaders bickered over the
treatment of the rebels, according to Zimbabwean officials hosting
the summit.
	   The rebels left the meeting site at the Elephant Hills Hotel in
this resort at 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), saying they had not been
allowed to attend the joint talks.
	   ``They will only know we exist when we start shooting,'' snapped
rebel leader Bizima Karaha.
	   Karaha said the rebels ``support a cease-fire'' but added:
``Because we have been excluded from this, we are not bound by
it.''
	   The Congolese rebels, excluded from two previous summits over
the past month, arrived Monday for the talks with the presidents of
Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Karaha said the rebel delegation was harassed at the Victoria
Falls airport and was kept under guard in an unventilated room for
four hours Monday.
	   Joseph Bideri, spokesman for Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, said the talks broke up after Rwanda and Uganda failed
to persuade the summit to meet with the rebels face to face.
	   ``You can't talk about a cease-fire without talking to fighters.
It is going to be difficult to come to any meaningful cease-fire,''
he said.
	   Most observers believe the rebels depend on Rwanda and Uganda
for support. Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe said Uganda has moved armored units, missiles and trucks
deeper into eastern Congo.
	   Rwanda and Uganda deny their troops are aiding the rebels.
	   The rebels were on the verge of taking the capital Kinshasa late
last month before Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian troops helped
Congolese President Laurent Kabila blunt their offensive.
	   Lolakombe said Kabila's allies would leave Congo only when
Rwanda and Uganda retreated completely behind their own borders.
	   ``The people of the Congo won't accept aggressors on a
centimeter of our country,'' he said.
	   After the rebels stormed out of the hotel, the seven heads of
state said defense ministers would meet at the Organization of
African Unity headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Thursday to
try to work out details of a cease-fire, of the withdrawal of
foreign troops and for political reform in Congo.
	   But the acrimonious nature of the talks here did not bode well
for the success of lower-level talks in Ethiopia.
	   Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face with the rebels.
Instead, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on Monday shuttled
between the two camps during the talks, said George Charamba,
spokesman for Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The rebels also met
with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim.
	   Salim said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire that
would ensure the continuation of Kabila's government but also bring
about democratic reforms.
	   Meanwhile, in the rebels' eastern Congo stronghold of Goma, a
rebel commander said Tuesday that 25 people were killed and 40
wounded on Monday when planes supporting Kabila's government bombed
the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie for the second straight day. It
was not possible to independently verify the rebel claim.
	   The rebels did not say which of Kabila's allies deployed the
fighter jets. Only Zimbabwe and Angola are known to have military
aircraft.
	   The rebel insurrection began in early August.

Explosions in Macau street injure 14 police, journalists

	   MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the
violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior
police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said.
	   The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the
first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to
punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
	   Witnesses said a police officer's car exploded first. When
police and journalists gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb
apparently hidden in a motorcycle parked nearby exploded and
injured the crowd at around 2 a.m.
	   TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for
help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another
explosion. Police said the second bomb was believed to have been
set off by remote control.
	   The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained
hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday. Police said the injured
officers were members of the judiciary and security units. The
journalists were from Hong Kong and Macau.
	   Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions. But
police said the two incidents were probably not related.
	   The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of
gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many
targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
	   Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the
explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said
Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the
population and the territory's stability.''
	   Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but
the motive was not yet known. They said they were searching for two
men, both aged 30.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Macau
to take tougher acts against crime lest the violence jeopardize the
Portuguese colony's smooth return to Beijing next year.
	   ``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will
conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take
further, effective measures to recover sound public security,'' Zhu
said.
	   Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed
shock and anger. The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong
statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to
injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image.
	   Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is
linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking
because of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular
tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. The
enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to
Chinese rule in December 1999.

Macedonia's president breaks his arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonia's 81-year-old president, Kiro
Gligorov, broke his right arm Tuesday after falling down the stairs
in his residence, officials said.
	   Tuesday is the seventh anniversary since Macedonia declared
independence from former Yugoslavia and Gligorov, who led the
country then, was scheduled to hold a news conference and attend a
cocktail party.
	   Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic which gained
independence without bloodshed, largely thanks to Gligorov's
policies. More than 1,000 U.N. soldiers, including Americans, have
been deployed along Macedonia's volatile borders.
	   The president survived a car bomb attack in 1995 in which he
lost his right eye and received serious head injuries. The
attackers have not been captured.
	   Gligorov was elected president in 1991 and then again in 1994.
He is banned by the constitution from running for a third term.
	   The team of doctors attending Gligorov said Tuesday that the
president feels fine but must remain in the hospital for a while
for observation.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Head of Russian Orthodox Church prayed before one
of Russia's most revered icons on Tuesday, seeking help to save the
nation from deepening economic crisis and political turmoil.
	   ``Civil war is the most terrible thing that the current
political crisis could bring Russia, because blood always
divides,'' Patriarch Alexy II said after praying before the icon of
Our Lady of Vladimir.
	   The medieval icon is believed to have averted foreign invasions
and other woes that befell Russia in the past.
	   After the service, Alexy said he prayed before the same icon
when the old Russian parliament staged a rebellion against
President Boris Yeltsin five years ago. Yeltsin suppressed the
uprising with troops and tanks; over 150 people were killed.
	   ``Today too, at a time of new crisis, we put our hopes and faith
in the intercession of the innocent Mother of God of our land,''
Alexy said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We believe that the Lord will protect our land from
misfortunes, sorrows and internecine war,'' Alexy said.

Disarmament session winds up with little visible progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's main disarmament forum closed its
annual session Tuesday amid much procedural wrangling and only
slight progress in key areas like a ban on production of nuclear
weapons material and land mines.
	   In a sign of the national sensitivities frustrating arms
negotiations, the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament failed to
reach consensus on whether to admit new members.
	   Proposals drafted by Swiss diplomat Erwin Hofer to admit
Ecuador, Ireland, Kazakstan, Malaysia and Tunisia _ representing
each of the major continents _ were blocked. Sources said Iran had
vetoed the expansion, although the reasons were not immediately
clear.
	   No decision will be taken before the conference reconvenes next
January.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include accords to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs _ even though
India and Pakistan did not sign up to this.
	   The main achievement this year was the agreement to start talks
on a treaty banning the production of ``fissile materials'' like
plutonium and highly enriched uranium, which can be used to make
nuclear weapons.
	   Under international pressure following test explosions in May,
India and Pakistan reluctantly agreed to join the talks and Israel,
the last holdout, subsequently followed suit.
	   Canadian Ambassador Mark Moher was approved to chair the
committee.
	   But there was no movement toward narrowing the differences on
real issues like whether any potential deal will cover existing
stockpiles as well as banning future production.
	   Pakistan says negotiations should deal with India's stocks.
Others, including China and France, believe the treaty should only
address future production. With divisions running deep, some
diplomats expect the talks to last up to five years.
	   There was also no progress toward how to work toward a worldwide
ban on land mines because of procedural differences.

French government sets up group to fight doping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YANN OLLIVIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Amid increasing concern over drug use in sports,
the French government said Tuesday it would set up a new working
group to help clamp down on illegal substances and improve
implementation of the law.
	   The announcement by Health Minister Bernard Kouchner and Sports
Minister Marie-George Buffet comes in the aftermath of the Tour de
France, which was overshadowed by banned drug-taking by cyclists.
	   It includes leading figures from sports medicine, law and
sociology, among them the presidents of the National Commission of
the Order of Doctors, the French Society of Sports Doctors and the
National Order of Pharmacists.
	   Jean-Paul Escande, former president of the National Commission
against Doping, and Olivier Rousselle, Head of Requisitions at the
State Council, are the group's co-presidents.
	   The group will make a preliminary report in mid-October, one
month before the National Assembly's second reading of a new
anti-doping law, and present its final recommendations by April
1999, officials said.
	   The launch of the working group came as a report in French daily
France Soir revealed confessions by several members of the Festina
team which was thrown out of the Tour de France after organizers
found the banned substance EPO in a team car.
	   ``I acknowledge the use of EPO for about the last four years,''
cyclist Alex Zulle told police, according to the newspaper.
	   ``The first time, I was racing for the Spanish team ONCE. I was
using the product while preparing for the Tour de France, Giro and
the Tour of Spain, taking two injections of EPO a week for three or
four weeks before and during the race.''
	   ``I cannot prove it, but I believe that today one can find it
used by all the large cycling teams. For the first time, this year
I used a growth hormone in addition to EPO. (Team doctor) Erik
Ryckaert gave me the substance, which I injected myself.''
	   Laurent Brochard also admitted taking EPO, according to France
Soir.
	   ``When I considered stopping taking EPO I asked myself if I
could maintain my performances at the same level. Therefore, I
didn't dare stop.''
	   Teammate Pascal Herve said he was misled by team doctors.
	   ``I ignored the exact nature of the products that were injected
into me,'' Herve said. ``I didn't try to know more because I was
trusting the team physician. If the products injected were doping
me, I then was misled.''
	   According to the newspaper, Festina teammate Christophe Moreau
admitted to knowing that Ryckaert administered EPO.
	   ``In 1997, my results were more than satisfying in Festina and
Ryckaert explained to me that if I wanted to progress, I had to
follow his medical protocol based on the administration, among
other things, of this doping product.
	   He said all nine Festina racers at the Tour followed the same
advice.

Croatian party says election judge should resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Croatian-backed political
party called Tuesday for the resignation of the judge who banned 15
of its candidates from upcoming Bosnian elections.
	   Marko Tokic, general secretary of the Croatian Democratic Union
in Bosnia, rejected the ruling by the judge, Finn Lynghjem, of the
OSCE's provisional election commission.
	   Lynghjem last week ordered the names of 15 of the party's
candidates removed from electoral lists because of violations of
rules set by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is running the weekend voting.
	   Tokic called the decision a ``culmination of political judgment
and cynicism of the modern world towards justice.''
	   ``For such kind of justice, believe me Mr. Lynghjem, your
presence is not needed,'' he wrote in a letter.
	   His last sentence began, ``Hoping you will resign ... ''
	   Nicole Szulc, an OSCE spokeswoman, said Lynghjem's decision was
fully backed by the agency.
	   While the Croatian Democratic Union, known by its Croat language
initials HDZ, has threatened to boycott the election, that is
considered unlikely because other Croat parties would still run and
the vote would likely be ruled legitimate.
	   Eleven of the 15 HDZ candidates were banned because of the
illegal participation of the Bosnian Croat army in the election
campaign. Four others were removed because of what the OSCE called
persistently unfair election coverage on neighboring Croatia's
state-run television, which is broadcast throughout western Bosnia.
	   The HDZ is the ruling party in Croatia, and the Bosnian party of
the same name is fielding candidates for the three-member
presidency and separate parliaments in the divided state.
	   Lynghjem also threatened to remove more candidates if Croat
state television failed to balance its coverage.
	   Szulc said broadcasts monitored Monday provided fair coverage.
She said the broadcasts would continue to be monitored this week
before the voting Saturday and Sunday.
	   Tokic's party promotes Croatian nationalism and is considered
obstructionist by international officials trying to enforce the
1995 Dayton peace accord that divided Bosnia in half _ one a
Serbian republic and the other a Croat-Muslim federation.
	   The election, the second vote for national leaders since the
Dayton accord, is part of the laborious process started by the
Dayton accord to introduce democratic structures in Bosnia.
	   A 3 1-2 year war that pitted the three main ethnic groups
against each other devastated the country, destroying its economic
and social fabric.
	   The OSCE also has banned two Serb candidates for using posters
of Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb nationalist accused of war
crimes. OSCE rules prohibit any role in the election for people
indicted on war crime charges.
	   Karadzic led Bosnian Serbs into the 1992 rebellion against the
Muslim-led Bosnian government and headed the breakaway Bosnian Serb
entity during most of the war. He is believed to be hiding
somewhere in the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia to avoid arrest by
NATO-led troops.
	   A top European Union official called Tuesday for Bosnians to
choose moderate leaders who would implement the Dayton accord.
Gerhard Jandl, who heads the EU committee on Balkan issues, said
the EU would work with leaders committed to the Dayton agreement
but would reject those who obstruct it.

<TEXT>
	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities detained 67 would-be
immigrants from Asia, Europe and Africa as they tried sneak across
the border into Greece, the Anatolia news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Authorities also detained five Turks suspected of smuggling the
immigrants, according to Anatolia, Turkey's semiofficial news
agency.
	   The refugees were rounded up in at least seven villages along
the Meric River, which marks the border between Turkey and Greece.
The river is known as Evros in Greece.
	   Fifty of the immigrants were Iraqis. The rest were five
Romanians, four Bangladeshis, three Palestinians, two Iranians, two
Pakistanis and one Rwandan, Anatolia said.
	   It was not clear when the detentions took place.
	   Turkey is a world crossroads for immigrants trying to make their
way to more prosperous countries in Western Europe; the Meric River
alone sees thousands of attempted illegal border crossings each
year.

Gdansk shipyard finally sold, but Solidarity plans appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A shipbuilding consortium signed an
agreement Tuesday to take over the bankrupt Gdansk shipyard,
Solidarity's cradle, pledging to modernize the yard and create new
jobs.
	   The consortium of the Gdynia shipyard and Evip Progress
consulting firm agreed to pay 115 million zlotys (dlrs 31 million)
for the historic shipyard, troubled by debts of 628 million zlotys
(dlrs 170 million).
	   The government receiver, taking care of the Gdansk plant since
it was declared bankrupt in August 1996, chose the consortium's
offer in July.
	   The new owners agreed to maintain Gdansk Shipyard as a separate
company and pledged to spend dlrs 80-100 million through 2010 to
modernize the shipyard and boost the work force from the current
2,000 to as many as 3,500-4,500.
	   The Gdynia and Gdansk shipyards will have a production potential
comparable to 50 percent of all German shipyards and competitive
for Asian yards, said Janusz Szlanta, Gdynia shipyard chairman.
	   Solidarity unionists and the board of the bankrupt yard have
opposed the sale of the company to a competitor, but a court ruling
in July made the sale possible.
	   However, Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski said the union
was planning to file an appeal in Poland's Supreme Court to bloc
the sale. Solidarity argues the shipyard board could still
negotiate a settlement with the shipyard's creditors.
	   At the height of anti-communist strikes in August 1980, a
shipyard electrician, Lech Walesa, launched Solidarity, the former
East Bloc's first independent trade union and a pro-democracy
movement which led Poles to topple the totalitarian regime in 1989.

<TEXT>
	   REKKEM, Belgium (AP) _ A one-day protest by truckers from
several European countries in support of shorter working hours
dwindled to a slow halt Tuesday, but unions warned of stronger
action if their demands are not met next week.
	   Hundreds of truckers rallied at dawn at border posts in France,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Germany,
to slow down traffic and hand leaflets out to all drivers crossing
the frontiers.
	   By midday most of the roadblocks had been lifted.
	   ``This was not a strike, it was a day of action to make a
point,'' said Romolo Vivarelli, the acting secretary-general for
the Federation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union,
in Brussels.
	   At this French-Belgian border post, dozens of truckers slowed
traffic on both sides of the highway down to a steady trickle.
	   ``There is a European Union law on working hours, we want it to
be properly implemented,'' said Rene Duhem, spokesman for the
French Workers' Force union.
	   He said many French truck drivers were obliged by their
employers to spend up to 60 hours on the road, creating a dangerous
level of fatigue.
	   ``Normally, drivers are supposed to take a 45-minute break after
they have driven four and a half hours. But this rarely happens,''
Dehem said.
	   The strike is a warning to employers ahead of a meeting with
labor unions scheduled Sept. 18 to find an agreement on working
conditions across Europe, Duhem said.
	   EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock urged both sides to
approve a draft agreement that will limit average working hours for
truck and coach drivers to 45 hours a week.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spent
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   According to Vivarelli, more than 1,300 professional drivers
were killed on European roads in 1996, many of them due to
exhaustion. The unions have warned they will step up their action
if their demands are not met.
	   ``We have the means to apply pressure,'' Dehem warned.
``Everything we've obtained so far, we obtained because we took
tough steps.''
	   French truckers are particularly virulent about their working
conditions. Last November a strike by French truckers disrupted the
country for five days, and in 1996 they stopped work for 12 days.
	   In France, the worst protests were at the English Channel ports,
and at Biriatou on the Spanish border, where traffic was snarled
for four hours.
	   On France's border with Italy, the Mont Blanc tunnel was also
disrupted, and 500 trucks stood in a jam trying to get through.
	   By midday, news reports said traffic had been fully restored on
Spain's borders with France and Portugal. Traffic between Austria
and Italy was flowing normally.

Syria criticizes Turkey after Turkish leader's visit to Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Syria seeking better relations with
Turkey, fresh quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria unleashed a fresh barrage of
criticism Tuesday at Turkey's military alliance with Israel but
also said it sought better relations with Ankara.
	   The Israeli-Turkish alliance is a ``danger to the stability of
the (Middle Eastern) area and Arab-Turkish relations,'' the Cabinet
said in a statement published by the official Syrian Arab News
Agency.
	   The alliance supports Israel's occupation of Arab lands, the
Cabinet said a day after Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz held
talks with the Israeli government in Jerusalem.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the government-run newspaper Tishrin said in an
editorial that the alliance aims to ``plunge the region into a
cycle of endless violence.''
	   But both Prime Minister Mahmoud al-Zoubi and Tishrin also urged
Turkey to think again.
	   ``Syria is keen to restore historical relations with Turkey as
they serve the interests of their two peoples,'' SANA quoted
al-Zoubi as saying.
	   Tishrin appealed to Turkey to improve its relations with the
Arabs and fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into
Israel's arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Asked about the Syrian comments, Yilmaz told reporters after a
meeting Tuesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that ``Anyone
who speaks (about) hostility in the region with hostile attitudes
should focus on the policies of the Syrian government that
encourages separatist terrorism in the region.''
	   Turkey accuses Syria of providing support to Kurdish insurgents
in southeastern Anatolia. Syria, on the other hand, accuses Turkey
of taking more than its fair share of water from the Euphrates
River through a series of new dams.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Monday
the ties between Israel and Turkey were intended ``to contribute to
the stability of the region.''
	   Yilmaz confirmed Tuesday that Turkey and Israel plan to conduct
joint naval maneuvers in November. They held their first joint
exercise last January.
	   Syria has frequently criticized the Israeli-Turkish military
alliance since it was begun in 1996, saying it is aimed at adding
to Israel's military capabilities and at forcing concessions from
Syria in stalled Mideast peace talks.

Rwandan, accused of genocide, says he tried to spare children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ An ex-Rwandan governor, defending
himself against genocide charges, told a U.N. court Tuesday he
tried to help Tutsi children who survived a first wave of massacres
in 1994 but failed.
	   ``When we were burying corpses, we found survivors,'' said
Clement Kayishema, a Hutu who has pleaded innocent to 25 counts of
genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.
	   Kayishema said he took about 100 injured children, ages 8 to 15,
to a hospital and asked for help for them from visiting government
officials, who brushed aside his pleas.
	   Hours later, all of the children were killed, he told the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in northern
Tanzania.
	   Kayishema is on trial with businessman Obed Ruzindana, who also
has pleaded innocent. Prosecutors were expected to begin
cross-examinations of the two men Wednesday, the private news
agency Hirondelle reported.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide launched by Hutu extremists on April 7, 1994,
the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down
by unidentified assailants.
	   The prosecution alleges Kayishema masterminded a policy of
encouraging frightened Tutsis to take shelter in churches and a
stadium on the pretext of offering them protection, then
slaughtering them.
	   Ex-Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, sentenced last week to life
imprisonment for genocide, said in his guilty plea on May 1 that he
congratulated Kibuye officials on their efficient massacre of
Tutsis. Kayishema was then governor, the highest ranking official
in the district on Lake Kivu, west of the capital Kigali.
	   Kambanda's speech on May 3, 1994 was broadcast to the public
from a small town hall because the stadium ``was still stinking''
after the massacre of Tutsis that took place there two weeks
earlier, Kayishema said.
	   From a pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis _ the highest
concentration in the country _ only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis were left
alive in Kibuye by the end of June 1994, according to African
Rights, a London-based human rights group.
	   Kayishema said the mass killings that swept across Rwanda were
perpetrated by lawless peasants and bandits whose violence
overwhelmed him and other government officials.
	   Kayishema said he appealed for calm, but someone in an angry
crowd threw a spear at him. ``I had been threatened. I was
scared,'' Kayishema told the court late Monday, adding that he hid
during the massacres.
	   But the prosecution alleges Kayishema was an active participant
in the slaughter, including at a Catholic Church where on April 17,
1994 he led attackers armed with guns, grenades, machetes, spears
and other weapons to kill Tutsis. Thousands died.
	   The next day, Kayishema allegedly led military police,
militiamen and armed civilians to a soccer stadium where he fired a
gun into the air to start the massacre of Tutsis gathered there.
Thousands more were killed.
	   Under Kayishema's direction, similar executions occurred at
other locations in the district, the prosecution alleges.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Separate from the U.N. tribunal, Rwanda has carried out its own
prosecutions, has executed 22 people, and has about 130,000 people
in jail awaiting genocide trials.

Speculation centers on several names as Vogts' successor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Heynckes turning down job &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ While Berti Vogts sought police
protection from reporters, former Real Madrid coach Jupp Heynckes
on Tuesday turned down an offer to become Vogts' successor as
German national team boss.
	   One day after Vogts resigned, Heynckes said he would not be
available for the job.
	   ``For personal reasons, I have to turn down the offer to train
the national team,'' Heynckes said in a statement.
	   ``Worries about the condition of my wife ... leave me at the
moment no time for the necessary intensive preparation of the
German team for the European Championship qualifying game in Turkey
in October,'' Heynckes said.
	   His wife, Iris, is suffering from blood pressure problems after
two operations and has been hospitalized.
	   Heynckes, who was sacked from Real Madrid this summer despite
guiding the Spanish club to the Champions Cup title, had been the
top candidate to take over Vogts' job.
	   His refusal to step in creates more problems for the German
soccer, which is in a deep slump following its ouster by Croatia in
the quarterfinals of the World Cup this summer in France.
	   Germany begins the defense of its European title by traveling to
Turkey for a tricky qualifying match Oct. 10.
	   Meanwhile, the media-shy Vogts remained cloistered in his house
in Korschenbroich, near Duesseldorf, and sought police protection
from reporters.
	   ``I am being hunted in my own home like a wild animal,'' Vogts
told the German sports news agency SID, but refused to give any
interviews.
	   Vogts' relations with reporters always have been tense.
	   Dozens of reporters and camera crews have been assembled in
front of his house since Vogts' resignation became known Monday.
	   Police came at least twice to ask reporters to leave.
	   ``We are still watching the area,'' police spokesman Wilfried
Goertz said.
	   Vogts stepped down after eight years in the job following
relentless criticism from the press over Germany's World Cup
failure and dismal performances in two exhibition matches last
week.
	   With Heynckes declining the job, the German soccer federation
will have to search elsewhere to find a coach quickly.
	   Three Bundesliga coaches have been mentioned as possible
candidates, but all three have contracts with their clubs.
	   The leading candidate now seems to be Christoph Daum, whose
contract with Bayer Leverkusen runs through 2001. There was
speculation Tuesday that Daum could remain Leverkusen coach until
the end of the season while doubling as national team chief.
	   Earlier this summer, Vogts had mentioned Daum as his best
possible successor.
	   Another candidate, Ottmar Hitzfeld, is in his first season with
Bayern Munich, which wants to regain the Bundesliga title and go
far in the Champions League.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, Bayern chairman, said the club would not
release Hitzfeld for national team duty.
	   Although Beckenbauer also had been mentioned as a possible
interim solution, the former star ruled himself out.
	   ``That part of my life is over, I can't always take three steps
forward and one step backward,'' said Beckenbauer, who coached
Germany to its last World Cup title, in 1990.
	   Otto Rehhagel, who took Kaiserslautern from the second division
to the Bundesliga title last season, is another candidate. He
declined to comment.
	   While the name of former Dutch star Johan Cruyff also has been
mentioned, the German soccer federation is unlikely to go for a
foreign coach.

	   ``Normally, drivers are supposed to take a 45-minute break after
they have driven four and a half hours. But this rarely happens,''
Dehem said.
	   The strike is a warning to employers ahead of a meeting with
labor unions scheduled Sept. 18 to find an agreement on working
conditions across Europe, Duhem said.
	   EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock urged both sides to
approve a draft agreement that will limit average working hours for
truck and coach drivers to 45 hours a week.
	   Current EU legislation limits the time the drivers should spend
at the wheel, but does not include time spent on other work such as
loading and unloading trucks or cleaning and maintenance of
vehicles.
	   According to Vivarelli, more than 1,300 professional drivers
were killed on European roads in 1996, many of them due to
exhaustion. The unions have warned they will step up their action
if their demands are not met.
	   ``We have the means to apply pressure,'' Dehem warned.
``Everything we've obtained so far, we obtained because we took
tough steps.''
	   French truckers are particularly insistent about their working
conditions. Last November a strike by French truckers disrupted the
country for five days, and in 1996 they stopped work for 12 days.
	   In France, the worst protests were at the English Channel ports,
and at Biriatou on the Spanish border, where traffic was snarled
for four hours.
	   On France's border with Italy, the Mont Blanc tunnel was also
disrupted, and 500 trucks stood in a jam trying to get through.
	   By midday, news reports said traffic had been fully restored on
Spain's borders with France and Portugal. Traffic between Austria
and Italy was flowing normally.

Report: Pakistani arrested in Georgia for watching U.S. embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Police have detained a Pakistani citizen
for ``regularly watching'' the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi amid fears
of terrorist attacks against American citizens, a news report said
Tuesday.
	   Georgian state television, which reported the incident, gave no
details about the Pakistani's identity. Police and U.S. Embassy
officials in Tbilisi refused to comment.
	   A radical Islamic group earlier this month threatened to attack
U.S. property and kidnap Americans in Pakistan unless Washington
apologizes for last month's missile strikes in neighboring
Afghanistan.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States launched Tomahawk missiles against
suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, as well as a
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan that Washington feared was being
used to make biological weapons.

Suspected grenade blasts injure nine in ferry terminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOEK VAN HOLLAND, Netherlands (AP) _ A man possibly armed with
hand grenades set off a series of explosions that injured nine
people, including a 1-year-old British baby, at a ferry terminal
Tuesday.
	   Police spokesman Anne Geelof said witnesses reported three or
four loud blasts in the terminal shortly before 1 p.m. (1100 GMT).
``We do not know if they were hand grenades but there were three,
four big explosions,'' Geelof added.
	   Police were treating the attack as an attempted robbery on a
money-changing bank at a railway station linked to the terminal,
Geelof said. The terminal is used by Stena Line passengers
traveling to and from the port of Harwich in eastern Britain from
this western Dutch port.
	   Stena Line spokeswoman Sue Kirk said the blasts occurred at a
time when the terminal was sparsely populated because the next
sailing was not due for three hours.
	   One of the injured, a customs policeman, was rushed to a
hospital with a serious ear injury after bearing the brunt of the
explosions in the terminal.
	   A British family of four _ a 34-year-old man, his 22-year-old
wife and their children aged six and one year _ also was being
treated in hospital for minor injuries, said Geelof.
	   An elderly British couple, aged 62 and 61, also were slightly
injured by flying glass. They were released after hospital
treatment. Identities of the injured passengers were not released.
The other two injured people were Dutch women.
	   A scheduled 4.15 p.m. (1415 GMT) ferry departure was briefly
delayed while a police sniffer dog checked the ferry for
explosives. No explosives were found.
	   Police were hunting for a masked man who fled the building
shortly after the blasts. The bank he is believed to have tried to
rob was the target of an unsolved 1995 robbery in which explosives
also were used, Dutch television reported.

JAT continues flying, but prepares for EU ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ban official, JAT statement; RECASTS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national carrier JAT
kept flying to European Union countries despite a EU ban that took
effect Tuesday.
	   Adding to the confusion, Britain announced it could implement
the embargo only after a year.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT said said its flights would continue to EU countries until
they receive an official notification about the ban from each
member country. It said in a statement it will fly to the EU
countries on Wednesday as well.
	   The EU published the ban in its official gazette on Tuesday,
making it official.
	   But JAT flights will still be allowed for another year to
Britain, which said that under a 1959 air services agreement it is
required to give 12 months' notice before canceling flights.
	   ``We are strongly in favor of the flight ban and we agreed to
it, but we have a pre-existing legal obligation that we must
honor,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   JAT, which was banned worldwide during a 1992-95 U.N. embargo
against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian war, has reportedly
starting negotiations with some foreign carriers on taking over its
EU destinations during the duration of the embargo. Independent
Belgrade media claimed Swissair has entered such negotiations.
	   The Serbian government on Monday condemned the new EU ban
against the Yugoslav national carrier but suggested no reciprocal
measures be adopted against foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   The government called the ban ``another sad example of
discriminatory and capricious'' acts against Yugoslavia and
``indirect support for terrorism in Kosovo,'' the state news agency
Tanjug reported.

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Rival planemakers Boeing and Airbus
staged a duel of jet orders on Tuesday, with Boeing taking thBoeing's sales could move higher with airplane options
taken by Varig that are worth about another dlrs 900 million.
	   Airbus scored earlier in the day with deals to sell 16 widebody
jets and six smaller ones with list prices totaling dlrs 2.7
billion.
	   Airbus will deliver 10 big A340 models to International Lease
Finance Corp., or ILFC, a Los Angeles group that buys aircraft and
rents them out to air carriers.
	   Terms were not disclosed, but industry sources privately placed
the value of the widebody A340 jets at about dlrs 1.5 billion. ILFC
also ordered six smaller A320 jets with a list price of about dlrs
300 million.
	   The Dubai-based carrier Emirates ordered six A340-500 models,
with an asking price of roughly dlrs 900 million. Emirates took
options on another 10 A340s, which could add another dlrs 1.5
billion to its deal with Airbus, the consortium from France,
Britain, Germany and Spain.
	   The Emirates chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, told
reporters he would use the new Airbus jets to launch nonstop
flights from the Gulf to points as far away as North America and
Australia.
	   Seattle-based Boeing's orders from Varig included four 777-200s,
10 737-800s, four 737-700s and six 767-300ERs. Varig took options
on another four Boeing 777-200s and 11 737-700s.
	   Varig's president, Fernando Pinto, said he would use the first
Boeing 777s to be purchased by a Latin American carrier on longhaul
routes between Brazil and Europe.

Kinkel assails Yugoslavs for telling OSCE envoy he is not welcome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel sharply
criticized the Yugoslav government Tuesday for blocking an official
visit to Belgrade by the OSCE press freedom representative.
	   Yugoslavia's letter telling Freimut Duve he was unwelcome
``shows that Belgrade, for its part, is not seriously striving for
membership in the European family of nations,'' Kinkel said in a
statement.
	   Duve, also a member of the German parliament, sought to visit
Belgrade on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe to press foreign reporters' complaints about problems
securing Yugoslav visas.
	   Dobrosav Veizovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to Austria, wrote to
Duve last week saying there were ``no real possibilities'' for him
to visit until Yugoslavia is readmitted into the OSCE.
	   The OSCE suspended Yugoslavia in 1992 for its role in supporting
rebel Serbs in ethnic wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
	   Kinkel said Yugoslavia should maintain press freedom whether or
not it is suspended from the OSCE.

Head of Greek Church makes first ever visit to AIDS clinic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: one name cq for archbishop &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archbishop Christodoulos, the
controversial and outspoken head of the Orthodox Church of Greece,
Tuesday appealed for Greeks to end discrimination against people
infected with the AIDS virus.
	   ``I want to appeal to all people to stop acting with such
inhuman and anti-Christian discrimination,'' Christodoulos said
after visiting an AIDS clinic in a central Athens hospital.
	   It was the first time ever that a head of the Greek church has
visited an AIDS treatment facility.
	   There are no figures available on cases of discrimination, which
is illegal. But it has been reported here that people suffering
from AIDS have suffered discrimination both at work and at home.
For many, AIDS is still considered a disease prevalent among
intravenous drug users.
	   ``We are all children of God, we are all sinners and no can can
say he is better than others. Let he who has never sinned cast the
first stone,'' Christodoulos said.
	   AIDS cases in Greece are among the lowest in Europe, with a
total of 1,853 reported from 1987 to 1997. There are no accurate
figures available for the number of people with HIV.
	   Christodoulos has created a great deal of controversy since his
enthronement four months ago. The 59-year-old church leader has
been accused of meddling in both domestic and foreign political
affairs. Premier Costas Simitis and government officials have
called on the archbishop to stop involving himself in such matters.

Indian president says his country wants nuclear disarmament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 1900 GMT, per speech embargoes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ India's president on Tuesday defended his
country's recent nuclear bomb tests as necessary for security but
also stressed that India wants a world free of nuclear weapons.
	   Raman Narayanan, on a European tour, noted that India has
announced a voluntary moratorium on further testing and vowed never
to use nuclear weapons in a first strike.
	   ``We will work for a nuclear weapons convention as part of our
priority commitment to global nuclear disarmament,'' the Indian
president said, according to an advance copy of his speech at a
dinner given by German President Roman Herzog.
	   The Indian president met earlier Tuesday with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who warned of an arms race between India and its neighboring
rival Pakistan. Kohl urged the countries to deepen their dialogue.
	   Herzog, in his dinner speech, also appealed to India to
reconcile with Pakistan and to follow the pacifist example of
Mohandas Gandhi, also known as Mahatma, or ``Great Soul'' who
successfully led India's freedom struggle against the British
rulers in 1940s.
	   ``We in Europe have learned the value of burying old enmities,''
Herzog said, according to a copy of his statements. ``One of our
role models, to whom we oriented ourselves here, was Mahatma
Gandhi.''
	   Herzog also urged India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty, although Narayanan did not indicate whether his country
would abandon its longstanding objections to the agreement.
	   India slams the treaty for preventing developing nations from
cultivating nuclear weapons while doing nothing to curb the
arsenals of the five tradition nuclear powers _ Russia, China,
France, Britain and the United States.
	   Narayanan, in his speech, said it was necessary to test India's
atomic devices in May because of ``security'' reasons and because
of ``the nuclear regime which consolidates nuclear weapons in the
hands of a group of countries.''
	   The tests drew international censure and sparked fears of war
between India and Pakistan, which responded with its own tests. The
neighbors already have fought three wars.
	   The Indian president, whose duties are largely ceremonial,
travels to Portugal on Thursday.

Romanian government selling off 60 state companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian government on Tuesday
said it was selling 60 companies, worth almost dlrs 900 million, as
part of its privatization plans.
	   Foreign and Romanian investors have often accused the government
of stalling on transferring companies from state to private
control.
	   Reformers who came to power almost two years ago promised to
speed up state sell-offs, but sales have been mired in red tape.
	   In a statement, the State Property Fund, which oversees
privatization, said the companies which were located all over
Romania.
	   They are active in the food, energy and heavy industries and are
worth an estimated 8 trillion lei (dlrs 889 million).
	   By the end of this year, the government wants to privatize 2,800
companies.

Two Japanese men hospitalized in more drink-tampering cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two men were hospitalized on Tuesday after drinking
tainted beverages and a pesticide was found in two drinks in a
vending machine in the latest in a string of poisonings in Japan, a
news report said.
	   One man fell ill and went to a hospital after drinking a vending
machine beverage in Togane, outside Tokyo, Kyodo News agency
reported. The drink was contaminated with a chemical used to
protect crops from smog.
	   His condition was not serious, Kyodo said, citing police.
	   In Hirakata, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, another man was hospitalized after drinking a beverage he
bought in a convenience store. The man's condition was also not
serious, police were quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Two bottles left in the dispensing windows of two vending
machines in Koriyama, 195 kilometers (121 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, were also found tainted with a pesticide, the report said.
	   Police could not be reached late Tuesday for comment.
	   The incidents follow a string of poisonings that have killed
five people, starting in July with a mass poisoning at a community
festival where four people died after eating curry spiked with
arsenic.
	   A 58-year-old man died last week after drinking canned tea
poisoned with potassium cyanide. The tea had been bought at a
supermarket.

Malaysian PM says ousted deputy flirting with arrest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
Tuesday attacked his ousted deputy as immoral and accused him of
courting arrest to become a political martyr.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, Mahathir's former protege, was stripped of his
posts of deputy and finance minister last Wednesday on allegations
ranging from sexual misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were crafted by the
government to undermine his reform challenge to Mahathir's 17-year
rule. The two have also clashed on economic policy.
	   ``His morals are not good,'' Mahathir told reporters in his most
extensive public comments so far on Anwar's firing. ``He has such
low morals to get involved in such activities.''
	   Mahathir said he explained to 3,500 members of the ruling United
Malays National Organization during a special meeting that Anwar
was dumped from his posts and expelled from UMNO on moral grounds,
not for allegations of selling state secrets or differences over
monetary policy.
	   He said he had conducted his own probe into the sexual
misconduct allegations after he learned of the police
investigation.
	   ``I concluded there there was substance to the allegations ...
His character does not qualify him to be a leader,'' Mahathir said.
	   Earlier in the day, Mahathir said Anwar was purposely flirting
with arrest.
	   ``He is trying his best to get the government to arrest him, so
he will become a martyr,'' said Mahathir, who once wooed Anwar into
his political party and helped make him the second most powerful
man in Malaysia.
	   Anwar responded to Mahathir's comments with anger. Addressing a
crowd of more than 4,000 people who jammed the yard outside his
residence Tuesday night, Anwar reminded his supporters that he
spent nearly two years in jail after leading an impoverished
farmers movement in 1974.
	   ``I've been in jail for 22 months. Why would I want more? He
should try it,'' Anwar screamed to the cheering crowd, which raised
their fists at a hovering police helicopter.
	   Anwar noted there were no formal charges against him, yet he'd
already been convicted by the ruling party.
	   ``It's the law of the jungle,'' he shouted. ``The reason given
for my expulsion due to my moral character is unacceptable. There
are no charges.''
	   Mahathir said Anwar's calls for a reform movement were a
diversion against the investigation. He said there was ``not a
hope'' that Anwar could be rehabilitated.
	   Since the ouster, Anwar has been giving nightly speeches at his
home, declaring his innocence. He has also pledged to go on a
campaign to push for press freedoms and transparency within the
government _ reportedly infuriating the 72-year-old Mahathir.
	   Chandra Muzaffar, a political science professor at the
University of Malaya who attended the latest rally, called the
political conflict unprecedented.
	   ``We are facing a crisis of an extraordinary nature in this
country for the first time in our history,'' he said.
	   ``Our nation's leader has set aside all judicial and democratic
principles for his own political importance,'' said Chandra, who
usually is subdued in his comments about the Malaysian government.
	   Chandra said he was most shocked by Mahathir's claim that he had
conucted his own investigation into Anwar's sexual misconduct and
concluded he was guilty.
	   ``This is something that transcends the very grain of Malaysia's
constitution,'' he said. ``Whenever something shakes up Dr.
Mahathir, he does not hesitate to destroy the institution of
democracy to retain his power.''
	   The sex allegations against Anwar first surfaced in a book, ``50
Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM.'' They range from the simple
groping of women to charges of sodomy. The police are investigating
and have filed affidavits in court.

In latest twist _ a shortage of rubles

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Long lines snaked out from exchange booths in
Moscow on Tuesday as locals swarmed for a chance to snap up quickly
disappearing banknotes.
	   But in the latest twist in the country's wrenching economic
crisis, the banknotes they wanted weren't dollars _ they were
rubles. And some exchange booths are running out.
	   ``Last week everyone was running around hunting for dollars, and
today they're all running around hunting for rubles,'' said Natasha
Radion, a clerk holed up inside a tiny exchange booth bereft of the
Russian currency.
	   The shift may seem surprising since the ruble has done nothing
but fall in the last few weeks, losing more than half its value and
spurring demand for dollars.
	   But a glance around one Moscow neighborhood showed a growing
shortage of rubles _ of 10 exchange booths, three had no rubles at
all.
	   ``There's certainly a pattern to it,'' Radion said. ``Almost
everybody who comes here is selling dollars now.''
	   The rush for rubles has partly to do with widely different
exchange rates across the city. Radion's booth had an unusually
good rate: one dollar bought more than 20 rubles. In other booths
that had rubles, the rate was less than 19 to the dollar.
	   Moreover, it remains illegal to make purchases in dollars, so
people must exchange their dollars for rubles before going
shopping. With the rate fluctuating by the day, people are changing
only small amounts at a time.
	   For now, the rush for dollars is also cooling down because
people are waiting for the ruble to gather strength, Radion said.
Government officials have encouraged these hopes, suggesting that
the ruble may be undervalued.
	   But Radion admitted that the situation remains volatile, and
tomorrow shoppers could be clamoring for dollars once again.
	   ``I don't know why it's happening. Maybe people saw something
good on television last night,'' she said. ``Yesterday was one way,
today was another, and tomorrow will be different again.''

Italy's president postpones state visit amid Russia's crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Wednesday put off
a state visit to Russia set for Sunday, when Boris Yeltsin may be
facing a final showdown over his choice of prime minister.
	   Both governments agreed a brief postponement was best, a
statement from the president's office said. The statement said a
new date would be set soon.
	   The visit was to have lasted three days and include talks with
Yeltsin, who invited Scalfaro during his own state visit to Italy
in February. Scalfaro's visit had been seen as a show of support
for the Russian government, which is struggling with political and
economic crises.
	   On Monday, Russia's State Duma overwhelmingly rejected Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister for a second time. Yeltsin was
considering whether to nominate him again for the third and final
round of voting.
	   Scalfaro's state visit would have been the first to Russia since
that of U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month. The summit
largely was viewed as ineffectual, given the domestic crises
preoccupying both leaders.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav national carrier JAT
kept flying to European Union countries despite a EU ban that took
effect Tuesday.
	   Adding to the confusion, Britain announced it could implement
the embargo only after a year.
	   The EU said Sunday it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   JAT said said its flights would continue to EU countries until
they receive an official notification about the ban from each
member country. It said in a statement it will fly to the EU
countries on Wednesday as well.
	   The EU published the ban in its official gazette on Tuesday,
making it official.

Congolese rebels unlikely to compromise with Kabila
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Zimbabwe-Congo-Peace Talks &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels are unlikely to reach a
political settlement with President Laurent Kabila because all they
want is to see him out of power.
	   As long as Kabila remains, they will have reason to fight.
	   Their list of grievances is long: Kabila runs a dictatorial
regime; he's incompetent; he's failed to form a broad-based
government; he's put family and friends in power, especially Baluba
kinsmen from the province of Katanga. His son, nephew and
brother-in-law head the armed forces and powerful security
agencies.
	   ``What we want to negotiate is Laurent Desire Kabila's
departure,'' said Lunda Bululu, who was prime minister under
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, whom Kabila toppled in May
1997.
	   Seven African presidents, a number of whom are lined up on
opposite sides of the civil war in Congo, said Tuesday that they
were nearing a cease-fire agreement, but the rebels stalked out of
the meeting in Zimbabwe, complaining that they were snubbed.
	   ``They will only know we exist when we start shooting,'' snapped
rebel leader Bizima Karaha, adding that the rebels would not be
bound by a cease-fire.
	   Resentment of Kabila and his policies has forged an unusual and
loose alliance: ethnic Tutsis who put him in power but now feel
betrayed; former Mobutu allies; disenchanted army officers, unpaid
under both regimes; and opposition leaders and exiled academics who
dream of a democratic, multi-party Congo.
	   The rebels have received logistical and intelligence support,
and, apparently, troops, weapons and ammunition from neighboring
Uganda and Rwanda, which want stability in Congo to preserve their
own security.
	   Both countries deny Kabila's accusation that they sponsored the
revolt, but threaten to intervene to protect their borders if
necessary.
	   Although they privately admit to having the backing of Rwanda
and Uganda, rebel leaders say the revolt is a Congolese affair and
the real issue is Kabila _ Nothing short of his departure will do.
	   ``Fundamentally, this is a problem of how power is being
organized through clans,'' said the rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, a former Harvard University lecturer.
	   Even if the rebels agree to a cease-fire, peace is likely to be
short-lived unless a political settlement follows immediately.
	   But is it possible for the rebels compromise with the man who is
the focus of their anger?
	   ``If Kabila becomes a democrat overnight, why not?
Unfortunately, people don't change,'' said Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, a
chief rebel negotiator.
	   Against such deep-seated rebel hostility, it is unlikely that
Kabila, saved from overthrow at the last hour by troops from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, can survive once his allies pull out,
as they have promised to do.
	   Kabila, who has ruled out direct talks with the rebels, says he
won't agree to a cease-fire until Rwandan and Ugandan forces
withdraw. That's not likely to happen because both countries deny
having troops on the ground _ apart from Uganda's two battalions
protecting their border in eastern Congo.
	   As things stand, the rebels may be trying to buy time, waiting
for the departure of Kabila's allies to strike at Kinshasa again.
	   And Kabila wants his allies to back him all the way to rebel
strongholds in eastern Congo: His only chance for survival is to
defeat the rebels.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Police bomb disposal experts blew
up a suspicious package left in a trash can outside the U.S.
Embassy on Tuesday, but it turned out to be harmless.
	   All the package contained was a bottle with unidentified liquid.
	   ``It was not an explosive device,'' said embassy spokesman Bruce
Wharton.
	   Security at American facilities has been tightened since the
Aug. 7 bomb attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. On Aug. 25, a Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town
was bombed, fatally wounding two people. No arrests have been made.

American Koven wins repechage, continues defense of crown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ American James Koven took advantage of
his last chance to defend his crown, earning a place in the single
scull semifinals after winning his repechage heat on Tuesday.
	   Koven, who won the title last year in France, covered the
2,000-meter (1.25-mile) course on the Fuehlinger See in 7 minutes,
18.50 seconds, a convincing 2.59 seconds ahead of Latvia's Andris
Reiholds, who also qualified.
	   Britain's Greg Searle, the Olympic single sculls bronze
medalist, won his heat to advance, crossing in 7:26.43.
	   Clocking the top two chronos in their heat, Fredrik Bekken of
Norway and 1994 world champion Andre Willms of Germany also
qualified. The two finished ahead of Olympic silver medalist and
1993 world champion Derek Porter, preventing the Canadian from
reaching the semifinals.
	   Porter wasn't the only former champion to be thwarted, with 1990
world champion Jueri Jaanson of Estonia also missing the boat,
finishing third in his heat.
	   In the women's single sculls, 35-year-old Maria Brandin of
Sweden, winner at Henley, also made the cut, winning her heat in
8:08.15.
	   Britain's Peter Haining, the only sculler to win a world title
three times, made the most of his second chance, clinching his
repechage leg in 7:36.76.
	   Australia's Michael McKay and Drew Ginn kept alive their hopes
for a title in the men's coxless pair, finishing second in their
heat behind Britons Stephen Williams and Fred Scarlett, heat
winners in 6:44.79.
	   The two Aussies are also competing in the coxed four, where they
joined forces with James Tomkins, Nicholas Green and Brett Hayman
on Sunday to qualify for the semifinals.
	   The Olympic coxless four champions missed selection for the
event this season, after illness kept them out of Australian
trials, so decided on a different tack.
	   The ``oresome foursome'' are making an unusual attempt at three
different titles at the worlds, rowing together in the coxed four,
then splitting up to race in the coxed and coxless pairs and have
qualified for all three.

Report: Israel denies water to West Bank Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel gives Jewish West Bank settlers three
times as much water as their Palestinian neighbors, an Israeli
human rights organization said Tuesday.
	   As a result of the water shortages, Palestinians in some areas
of the West Bank have to ration water for washing and flushing the
toilet, the human rights group Betselem said in a 25-page report.
	   Palestinian hospitals in the West Bank town of Hebron do not
have enough water to treat patients, said Tomer Feffer, a Betselem
researcher. The report cites several cases of patients suffering
from diarrhea and dehydration blamed on the water shortage.
	   Israel's water commissioner, Meir Ben Meir, confirmed the 3:1
ratio. ``Israelis need three times as much water for household use
as Palestinians,'' Ben Meir told The Associated Press. ``It's an
expression of differences in standard of living.''
	   However, Ben Meir said the distribution was in accordance with
Israeli-Palestinian agreements on water sharing. He also said the
shortage affected everyone and that several Jewish settlements had
gone without water for several days this summer.
	   Betselem said Israel restricts Palestinian water use by
preventing them from drawing from some existing wells and drilling
new ones. During nearly three decades of military occupation of the
West Bank, Israel has done little to repair leaky pipes serving
Palestinian communities, the group said.
	   Betselem said it based its report on field surveys, data from
the Israeli water commission and academic research.
	   Although the Palestinians have autonomy in major West Bank
cities, Israel retains control of the water sources there, which
account for one-third of Israel's total water supply.

Sierra Leone ex-junta and rebel fighters kill 50 in sneak attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel fighters and ousted junta
soldiers have ambushed a town in northern Sierra Leone, killing at
least 50 people and burning down several homes, witnesses said
Tuesday.
	   A local journalist interviewed by a Catholic Church-run radio
station said many of the civilians had been shot dead
execution-style by the attackers.
	   ``My three children were killed but I managed to escape,'' said
Ya Yanor Turay, a local resident who said she saw the bodies of at
least eight other people.
	   The group attacked the town of Kamalu, 150 kilometers (95 miles)
northwest of the capital, before dawn Monday.
	   Roman Catholic missionaries speaking on the radio station said
the well-armed insurgents wore uniforms identifying them as Kamajor
and Civil Defense Force traditional fighters as well as former
Sierra Leone soldiers.
	   Normally, the Kamajors and Civil Defense Force members are
allied to Sierra Leone's current government. The Kamajors, fighting
alongside a Nigerian-led intervention force, helped oust the junta
earlier this year. However, junta soldiers are known to have formed
alliances with several rebel groups.
	   Members of Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma's ousted military junta,
with their allies in the rebel Revolutionary United Front, have
killed, raped and maimed thousands of people in a revenge campaign
against the restored government led by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
	   The motive behind Monday's attack was not immediately clear.
	   Catholic parishioners held a mass prayer meeting Monday in the
central town of Makeni to pray for the rebels to stop the killings.

	   HOEK VAN HOLLAND, Netherlands (AP) _ A man possibly armed with
hand grenades set off a series of explosions at a ferry terminal
Tuesday during an apparent bungled robbery attempt. Nine people
were wounded, including a 1-year-old British baby.
	   Police spokesman Anne Geelof said witnesses reported three or
four loud blasts in the terminal shortly before 1 p.m. (1100 GMT).
``We do not know if they were hand grenades but there were three,
four big explosions,'' Geelof added.
	   Dutch television images showed shattered glass and rubble strewn
across a deserted cafe in the terminal building as police combed
through the debris searching for clues that could lead to the
attacker.

Pivotal co-star in new 'Anthony and Cleopatra' slinks off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One of Helen Mirren's pivotal co-stars in the
Royal National Theater's new staging of Shakespeare's ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' is refusing to work with her.
	   It seems Cedric the snake has slunk off, rather than participate
in the climactic scene in which Mirren commits suicide by pressing
a snake to her bosom to administer a fatal bite.
	   The Californian King snake _ said to be quite convincing as an
Egyptian asp _ has not been seen since he escaped from his box in
the theater's offices four days ago, a theater spokeswoman says.
	   But the show will go on _ with Indigo, another Californian King
snake who has played the Egyptian asp in rehearsals.
	   ``Anthony and Cleopatra,'' which also stars Alan Rickman, opens
Oct. 20.

Top Bulgarian investigator to seek arrest in umbrella murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria plans to ask Interpol to arrest
an Italian-born Dane who ``remains the most likely perpetrator'' of
the mysterious 1978 umbrella murder of a defector in London, a
federal investigator was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   Bogdan Karayotov, a department chief at the National
Investigation Office, told the daily Demokratsiya that authorities
still see Francesco Guillino as the main suspect in the sensational
killing, which occurred 20 years ago Monday.
	   British investigators long have suspected Bulgarian agents in
the murder of Georgi Markov, which has never been solved.
	   Markov, known for his criticism of Bulgaria's Communist regime,
died after being injected with poison Sept. 7, 1978. A writer and
journalist who defected to Britain in 1969, he worked for the
Bulgarian-language service of the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Investigators determined a poison pellet was fired into Markov
from a mechanism concealed in an umbrella.
	   Guillino was charged by Danish authorities in 1993 with
collaborating with the Bulgarian secret service in the murder,
despite his denial of any ties with the Bulgarians. He eventually
was freed while Danish police awaited further evidence from
Bulgaria, which never came.
	   He later moved out of Denmark and according to press reports may
have settled in Hungary or Romania.
	   Karayotov said police have evidence that Guillino, known by the
code name Piccadilly, worked for the Bulgarian secret police from
his 1972 arrest on drug smuggling charges until 1989.
	   Suspicions that Bulgarians were involved in the killing
increased when Oleg Kalugin, a former KGB agent, said Bulgaria
asked Moscow for help in the assassination.
	   Bulgaria was the most loyal Soviet ally under decades of
Communist rule. Post-Communist leaders have vowed to clear the
Markov case in an effort to clean up Bulgaria's image.

Romanian government selling off 60 state companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian government on Tuesday
said it was selling 60 companies, worth almost dlrs 900 million, as
part of its privatization plans.
	   Foreign and Romanian investors have often accused the government
of stalling on transferring companies from state to private
control.
	   Reformers who came to power almost two years ago promised to
speed up state sell-offs, but sales have been mired in red tape.
	   In a statement, the State Property Fund, which oversees
privatization, said the companies were located all over Romania.
They are active in the food, energy and heavy industries and are
worth an estimated 8 trillion lei (dlrs 889 million).
	   By the end of this year, the government wants to privatize 2,800
companies.

Sudan's president arrives on official visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Sudan's president arrived Tuesday in this
North African nation on a three-day official visit expected to
include talks with the Moroccan monarch on the U.S. missile strike
on a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory.
	   Gen. Omar Hassan Al-Bashir, accompanied by three ministers, is
also expected to use the visit to strengthen bilateral ties.
	   Morocco has solid ties with the United States, and King Hassan
II has proven himself a valued intermediary in the search for peace
in the Middle East.
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail was among the
dignitaries accompanying his president.
	   The Aug. 20 cruise missile strikes targeted a Sudanese factory
which the United States claims made ingredients for chemical
weapons and Islamic extremist training camps in Afghanistan.
	   The strikes where a reprisal for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania which the United States blames on
Osama bin Laden, a millionaire thought to be at the center of a
vast terrorist network. Sudan has in the past given refuge to bin
Laden, a Saudi now based in Afghanistan.

Bulgaria, Greece, Romania agree on joint action against crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Balkan neighbors Bulgaria, Greece and
Romania agreed Tuesday to join efforts against organized and
trans-border crime.
	   Under an accord signed by interior ministers Bogomil Bonev of
Bulgaria and Gavril Dejeu of Romania and Greece's minister of
public order, Georgios Romaios, police forces of the three
countries will exchange information and launch concerted actions
against drug and weapons smuggling, illegal immigration rackets,
money laundering and illegal financial operations.
	   The cooperation will be controlled by a joint committe of
experts, Bonev said.
	   ``Our three countries have a mutual interest to make the Balkans
a zone of security and present a new image of our region to the
rest of Europe,'' Dejeu said.
	   Romaios said the accord ``demonstrates the political will'' of
European Union member Greece and formerly Communist Bulgaria and
Romania ``to act profoundly against crime.''
	   Bonev and Dejeu said the accord will help their countries match
border control standards of the European Union which they want to
join.
	   Organized and trans-border crime has surged across the Balkans
since Bulgaria's and Romania's communist regimes fell in 1989 and
Cold War border regulations were removed.

American Marion Jones wants to set records at IAAF World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ American sprinter and long
jumper Marion Jones said Tuesday she would like to beat some of her
own records at the International Amateur Athletics Federation World
Cup that starts here Friday.
	   ``It's ... my first time at altitude so I don't really know what
to expect,'' said the 22-year-old athlete who has remained unbeaten
this season.
	   She said Namibian runner Frank Fredericks had told her
Johannesburg Stadium had a fast track.
	   Jones will join other athletes on Thursday to launch an IAAF
project in the black township of Soweto, where she said she will
encourage young people to enter sports.
	   ``Sport is a healthy activity and if you succeed, it can open
many doors such as scholarships at universities and colleges,''
said Jones, who has also played championship basketball.
	   Jones enters this weekend's competition with a 35-for-35 record
in competition this year. At an IAAF event in Moscow last weekend,
she shared a million-dollar jackpot after winning the long jump and
the 100 meters an hour apart.
	   She said she hopes to hold world records in her three events,
which also includes the 200 meters, but was not prepared to
forecast it would happen this week.
	   ``We are all coming off a very tough and long season but I will
make one last big effort here. The 200 meters is one event I'm
hoping to at least top my personal best of 21.76 seconds,'' she
said.

Russian economic crisis could cost Dutch bank millions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Russia's economic meltdown could
cost leading Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV several hundred million
guilders (dlrs), the bank said Tuesday.
	   The losses would be caused mainly by the bank's trading
portfolio of non-deliverable forwards, contracts traded against the
value of commodities, worth a nominal several hundred million
guilders (dlrs).
	   All the positions are covered by Russian banks but, as it's
likely that a number of the bank's won't be able to meet the dollar
payments to ABN, the bank will have to pay out ``many tens of
millions of dollars.''
	   The bank's provisions for loan losses rose to 892 million
guilders (dlrs 456 million) in the first half of 1998, which
includes 365 million guilders (dlrs 186.6 million) for the
increased country risk for a number of countries, mainly in Asia.
	   The remaining 527 million guilders (dlrs 269.4 million), of
which 50 percent hadn't been allocated by early July, won't be
enough to cover the possible Russian losses, the bank said.
	   ABN stressed the possibility of the extra provisions for Russian
losses won't change its full-year forecast.
	   During the presentation of its six-month results, Aug. 20, the
bank said it expects net profit in the second half to continue to
grow from the same period in 1997.

Report: minister didn't receive basic pre-surgery test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's interior minister, in a coma due to an
allergic reaction during surgery, didn't receive a required
pre-anesthesia consultation a few days before the operation, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The hospital responded, however, that such a consultation wasn't
necessary because Jean-Pierre Chevenement was a well-known patient
at Val de Grace, the elite military hospital that treats the
nation's top leaders.
	   Chevenement, a key political ally of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, has been in a coma for nearly a week.
	   He entered the hospital last Wednesday for a gallbladder
operation, but suffered a severe heart attack due to an allergic
reaction to a component in the anesthesia.
	   The Liberation newspaper said Tuesday that the minister did not
receive the required consultation with an anesthesiologist a few
days before the operation. He did, however, meet with an
anesthesiologist the night before the procedure, as is also
required.
	   A spokesman for the hospital, which is under the aegis of the
Defense Ministry, responded Tuesday that Chevenement didn't need
the earlier test, because he was known to doctors at Val de Grace.
	   Liberation, which cited only informed medical sources, also said
that a test exists to determine allergies to the drug that caused
Chevenement's reaction _ curare _ but that he wasn't given the
test.
	   Anesthesiologists told Liberation that such tests are not done
as a matter of course. But the newspaper also said that an ``old''
form of curare was used _ one that is highly allergic and thus less
commonly used these days.
	   The hospital spokesman, speaking on customary anonymity, said he
wouldn't discuss the allegation, due to strict rules of medical
secrecy and respect for the patient's privacy.
	   Doctors said Monday the condition of the 59-year-old Chevenement
had improved in the last 48 hours. But they still didn't know what
kind of lasting neurological damage he may have suffered, or when
he might be taken off life support.

Suspects arrested in killing of U.N. workers in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Authorities have arrested and begun
interrogating three suspects in the killing of four United Nations
workers in this Central Asian country, Tajikistan's prosecutor
general said Tuesday.
	   The government and opposition have spent weeks negotiating the
arrest of the suspects, who were staying on territory controlled by
the political opposition, which signed a peace deal with the
government last year.
	   In the wake of the killings, the United Nations has recalled all
non-essential foreign staff from Tajikistan and announced it would
not assist the return of former Tajik rebels from Afghanistan until
the suspects are arrested.
	   The interrogation is being carried out in accord with
international norms and is being monitored by International Red
Cross observers and opposition members, said Prosecutor General
Salomiddin Sharopov.
	   ``Neither force nor psychological pressure'' have been applied
to the suspects, Sharopov said.
	   A police official speaking on condition of anonymity said two of
the suspects ``do not deny'' their involvement in the killing.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while on a regular
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.

Gdansk shipyard finally sold, but Solidarity plans appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A shipbuilding consortium signed an
agreement Tuesday to take over the bankrupt Gdansk shipyard,
Solidarity's cradle, pledging to modernize the yard and create new
jobs.
	   The consortium of the Gdynia shipyard and Evip Progress
consulting firm agreed to pay 115 million zlotys (dlrs 31 million)
for the historic shipyard, troubled by debts of 628 million zlotys
(dlrs 170 million).
	   The government receiver, taking care of the Gdansk plant since
it was declared bankrupt in August 1996, chose the consortium's
offer in July.
	   The new owners agreed to maintain Gdansk Shipyard as a separate
company and pledged to spend dlrs 80-100 million through 2010 to
modernize the shipyard and boost the work force from the current
2,000 to as many as 3,500-4,500.
	   The Gdynia and Gdansk shipyards will have a production potential
comparable to 50 percent of all German shipyards and competitive
for Asian yards, said Janusz Szlanta, Gdynia shipyard chairman.
	   Solidarity unionists and the board of the bankrupt yard have
opposed the sale of the company to a competitor, but a court ruling
in July made the sale possible.
	   However, Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski said the union
was planning to file an appeal in Poland's Supreme Court to bloc
the sale. Solidarity argues the shipyard board could still
negotiate a settlement with the shipyard's creditors.
	   At the height of anti-communist strikes in August 1980, a
shipyard electrician, Lech Walesa, launched Solidarity, the former
East Bloc's first independent trade union and a pro-democracy
movement which led Poles to topple the totalitarian regime in 1989.

Dalai Lama postpones visit to Russia because of crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Dalai Lama has postponed a visit to Russia
because of the country's economic and political turmoil, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   The Dalai Lama apologized to Russia's Buddhists and said his
decision was caused by overall instability in Russia, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing a spokesman for Russian Buddhists.
	   The Dalai Lama had earlier planned to begin his visit on Sept.
19 and visit the republics of Buryatia, Tuva and Kalmykia, where
many of the country's Buddhists live, as well as Moscow and St.
Petersburg.
	   The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, has
been living in exile since 1959, when China forcibly annexed Tibet.
About 100,000 other Tibetans also fled.

Swissair plane's flight recorder found but missing crucial data

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers have retrieved Swissair
Flight 111's flight-data recorder despite an emergency which
endangered their lives, but experts say the ``black box'' contains
no information from the final minutes of the doomed flight.
	   Crash investigators had high hopes after the data recorder was
recovered from the ocean floor Sunday. But laboratory examinations
on Monday revealed that there was no data from at least the last
six minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off
Nova Scotia last week, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the data recorder
stopped once the plane dipped below 10,000 feet (3048 meters). A
strong possibility, he said, was that the plane lost electrical
power at that stage.
	   In Zurich, Swissair's chief pilot-designate, Rainer Hiltebrand,
rejected as ``irresponsible'' suggestions that the plane's pilots
reacted too late to the situation.
	   A total loss of power was virtually unthinkable, he added
Tuesday. The MD-11 has three normal generators, as well as a
back-up generator and an emergency generator. There is also a
battery which would power all the plane's essential functions for
15 minutes, Hiltebrand said.
	   Gerden said the data recorder was in good condition and should
provide useful evidence about more than 100 types of information
ranging from altitude and airspeed to whether the plane's smoke
warning lights were on.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Mark McGwire's record-tying 61st home run finally
caught the attention of Europe, while baseball-playing Japan
saluted the U.S. Major League Baseball slugger.
	   News of the homer was the leading sports story in Japan, where
national baseball leagues are widely popular. McGwire's homer was
featured on the front pages of some of the country's top
newspapers. ``McGwire's No. 61. All of America cheers the `modern
Ruth,''' announced the nation's biggest newspaper, the Yomiuri.
	   The holder of Japan's single-season home run total also saluted
McGwire, whose homer tied the record set by New York Yankee Roger
Maris in 1961.
	   ``It's great for him to hit such a number. Congratulations. I
express my respect for him, particularly his power of
concentration,'' Sadaharu Oh told Kyodo News Tuesday morning. Oh
holds Japan's single-season record of 55 homers, as well as career
total record of 868.
	   The media in soccer-mad Europe, however, had paid little
attention while McGwire and Sammy Sosa closed in on Maris' record.
	   But, finally, the chase for the most acclaimed individual record
in U.S. sports has made it onto the radar screens in European
countries where baseball has only a minority following.
	   McGwire's 61st homer even made the front page of Tuesday's Daily
Telegraph, bringing the slugger's name to the attention of the
general British public for the first time.
	   There was a picture of McGwire, pumping his right fist as he
circled the bases, next to a story headlined ``America stops as
sporting history is made.''
	   ``McGwire has all of America on the edge of its seat and the
whole country gives the impression of supporting him,'' the
Telegraph said. ``But his run chase has not been without
controversy, for he admits to taking a dietary supplement that
contains steroids in order to maintain his muscle-bound bulk.''
	   The tabloid Daily Express ran a full-page feature on the home
run chase, written by its tennis correspondent covering the U.S.
Open.
	   ``America is totally transfixed,'' he wrote. ``Bill Clinton's
bedroom indiscretions? No. Wall Street's latest rollercoaster ride?
Wrong again. In a nation preoccupied with sports and statistics,
the race to break the number of home runs in one baseball season
merits top place in the public interest polls.''
	   Most other British papers ran brief stories.
	   Britain's detachment from baseball came through in a news story
in the Guardian, which began:
	   ``In one of those classic moments in American sport that becomes
imperishable legend throughout the United States _ while remaining
all but incomprehensible to the rest of the world _ Mark McGwire of
the St. Louis Cardinals hit a record 61st home run of the 1998
season.''
	   Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television network broadcast footage and
stories on McGwire's 61st, but the anchorman showed his ignorance
by saying McGwire ``scored'' a home run.
	   His female co-anchor pitched in with, ``It's amazing. The ball
is so small and the stadium is so big, how do they see anything?''
	   In Italy, where the leading sports daily Gazzetta Dello Sport
has been giving daily updates for the past two weeks on the home
run tally, most papers reported briefly Tuesday on McGwire's 61st
``fuoricampo.''
	   Corriere dello Sport wrote that McGwire is now ``entrenched in
American history and given the same respect that is accorded
Abraham Lincoln or Michael Jordan.''
	   Oddly, there was not even a brief mention of the record Tuesday
in the prestigious French sports daily L'Equipe, possibly because
of its early deadlines.

Manchester United call urgent meeting to discuss Murdoch bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United called an urgent board meeting
as the backlash mounted Tuesday against a proposed takeover of
Britain's richest soccer club by Rupert Murdoch's satellite
television network BSkyB.
	   BSkyB confirmed Monday that it was negotiating to buy the club.
Newspapers said the group was offering 575 million pounds (dlrs
685.5 million).
	   The club's directors are scheduled to hold an emergency meeting
Wednesday to discuss the offer before the home Premier League game
against Charlton.
	   Before news of the bid broke Sunday, Manchester United was
valued at 413 million pounds (dlrs 685.5 million) at close of
trading Friday.
	   But fans, soccer officials and even government ministers have
unleashed a storm of negative sentiment to the proposal, fearing it
would give the Australian-born media baron a stranglehold on
Premier League soccer.
	   Joe Ashton, chairman of the government's all-party Football
Committee, said all sides of politics should unite to stop the
deal.
	   ``We're not just concerned, we're trying to stop it. That
includes the Conservatives and Liberals in our group as well,''
Ashton, a member of Tony Blair's Labor Government, said Tuesday.
	   ``This isn't in the public interest,'' he told BBC radio.
``Murdoch wants to sit on one side of the table offering a price
for televised games then move round and sit on the other side for
Manchester United, accepting or rejecting it.
	   ``That can't be fair. That can't be a fair trading practice.
That's why we want this to go to the (Office of Fair Trading _ a
regulatory body),'' he said.
	   Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said takeover talks
would not affect the performance of his team on the field.
	   ``It's been no problem,'' he said. ``The game comes first and we
are all ready (for Wednesday's match against Charlton).''
	   ``I don't know what (the atmosphere at the game) will be like.
We'll just have to wait and see,'' he added.
	   Fans are reportedly planning demonstrations at Old Trafford to
protest against what they view as plans by chairman Martin Edwards
to ``sell out.''
	   The Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association has
publicly opposed the deal and was planning a meeting Tuesday night
to vote on what action to take.
	   David Mellor, chairman of the government's Football Task Force
chairman and a former British Sports Minister, said Manchester
United directors should draw back from committing ``an act of
cardinal folly.''
	   Mellor, who said he was not speaking on behalf of the Task
Force, said he was concerned ``this proud club with all its
traditions'' could become ``just a pawn in a global media
power-play by Rupert Murdoch.''
	   Rogan Taylor, director of Liverpool University's Football
Research Centre and former Football Supporters' Association
chairman, said fans were uneasy about Murdoch's bid.
	   ``The fans' worry is that football clubs like Manchester United,
although they are global brand names, are also local cultural
entities,'' he said. ``They see this as an act of uprooting the
club, taking it out of its cultural inheritance forever,
probably.''
	   Taylor compared Murdoch's bid to buy Manchester United as a
possible European Super League looms with precautions he would take
to protect against a disaster.
	   ``If there is a flood coming, you buy Mount Everest and make
sure you keep your toes dry. That's what Murdoch's doing here.''

Gabon president offers to mediate in Congo's war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ Gabon's President Omar Bongo said
Tuesday he had been asked to mediate between Congo's warring sides.
	   Bongo told Gabon's state-run radio station that he did not know
whether the request would result in another round of talks between
Congo President Laurent Kabila and rebels believed backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   ``I have been already been asked to mediate, but I'm waiting for
the details to be confirmed,'' Bongo said in the broadcast. He did
not say who had asked him to get involved.
	   The Gabonese leader hosted talks early last year between
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila, whose then-rebel
group subsequently took power in Congo, then called Zaire, in May
1997.
	   Gabon says it has detained about 300 armed Congolese rebels who
tried to enter the country after their forces were routed by
government-allied troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia last
month.
	   The rebels include many of the same fighters who helped Kabila
rise to power.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Coastal showers Tuesday morning were associated with the last
remnants of a weak tropical wave that moved across the local area
on Monday.
	   Behind this wave, drier air and African dust was moving into the
northeast Caribbean, producing hazy skies.
	   However, enough lingering moisture remained to generate
scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms this afternoon,
especially across the northwest third of Puerto Rico. Locally thick
haze may also reduce visibility.
	   A tropical wave was located several hundred miles east of the
Lesser Antilles this morning. This system has weakened considerably
but was still associated with scattered showers and thunderstorms,
although much of this precipitation will pass south of the local
islands.
	   Enough will cross beginning late Wednesday and early Thursday
for an increase in clouds and precipitation.
	   San Juan and the northern sections of Puerto Rico:
	   Today... Variably cloudy in the morning, becoming partly sunny
and hazy in the afternoon. A 30 percent chance of showers. Slight

Supreme Court increases sentences in airport killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's Supreme Court on Tuesday
increased the sentences of three Hells Angels who took part in a
fatal shooting attack on rival Bandidos members at the Copenhagen
airport.
	   The attack in March 1996 marked the escalation of the Nordic
biker war, which ended with a truce between the gangs in September
1997.
	   One Bandido was killed and three others wounded in the attack.
	   In October, a lower court sentenced Joergen Nielsen to 15 years
in prison for the shooting, Johnny Engelshof Nielsen to nine years
and 10 months and Sven Erik Holst to 9 1/2 years.
	   However, on appeal from the prosecutor, the Supreme Court raised
Nielsen's sentence to life, Holst's to 11 1/2 years and Engelshof
Nielsen's to 11 years and 10 months.
	   In an initial court case in December 1996, the three had been
acquitted while three other Hells Angels were convicted.
	   One of them, Michael Brokside, later unwittingly discussed the
group's involvement on a celluar telephone smuggled into his cell.
Police tapes of the calls provided evidence for a new trial.
	   In all, 12 people were killed and more than 70 wounded in the
three-year feud in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway which left
residents of the generally quiet and safe countries increasingly
frightened.
	   After the airport shooting, the feud erupted into shootings on
crowded streets and a series of anti-tank grenade attacks,
including one on the Hells Angels headquarters in Copenhagen in
which two people died and 19 were injured.
	   The feud went dormant shortly after a passerby was killed in a
bombing at a Bandidos clubhouse in Norway.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin hesitated Tuesday over ramming
through his unpopular choice for prime minister, while opposition
and religious leaders warned that the political standoff could
spark civil war.
	   The nation's top clergyman expressed fear of unrest, praying
publicly before Russia's holiest icon for divine protection against
``misfortunes, sorrows and internecine war.''
	   Yeltsin conferred with top aides at his country residence amid
growing speculation he may choose a compromise candidate to stave
off a showdown with the Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament, the State Duma.
	   Up to now, he had insisted that acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin was his only choice, but the Duma on Monday rejected
Chernomyrdin a second time. Yeltsin, who is known for trampling
over his political opponents, has compromised before in the face of
popular anger.
	   The president has one more chance to win parliamentary approval
for his prime ministerial pick. If the Duma refuses to confirm the
candidate, Yeltsin must dissolve the legislature and call
parliamentary elections within three months.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that if
Yeltsin continued to demand approval of Chernomyrdin, Russia's
crisis would deepen.
	   ``A mistake for the president and his team can cost the
country's civic peace. This is a very high price,'' Zyuganov said.
	   He added that disbanding the Duma would be tantamount to
dissolving the Russian Federation, and ``I am afraid that would end
in fighting throughout Russia's expanses.''
	   It was typically incendiary talk from Zyuganov, who has piled
all the blame for Russia's crippling economic crisis on Yeltsin and
his government _ and none on the Duma, which continually blocked
economic reforms that might have strengthened the economy. Among
stalled measures are a radical overhaul of the tax collection
system, legislation on land ownership, and laws that would
accelerate the bankruptcy of enterprises.
	   Yet the possibility that economic and political crisis could
spill over into violence _ though there have been no signs of
unrest up to now _ was on the minds of others, as well.
	   Alexy II, the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, prayed
for peace before a revered icon, Our Lady of Vladimir, in a central
Moscow museum.
	   ``Civil war is the most terrible thing that the current
political crisis could bring Russia, because blood always
divides,'' Alexy said. ``We believe that the Lord will protect our
land from misfortunes, sorrows and internecine war.''
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin
was unlikely to name his candidate for prime minister before
Wednesday. There was rampant speculation in the Duma corridors that
the president was trying to find a way out of a confrontation that
could end in the legislature's dissolution.
	   Duma Deputy Yelena Mizulina, one of the initiators of a campaign
to impeach Yeltsin, said Tuesday that the Duma would put
impeachment on its agenda if the president named Chernomyrdin a
third time. If the Duma votes for impeachment proceedings the
Constitution bars Yeltsin from dissolving the body.
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. The two names that have prompted the
greatest speculation among lawmakers were Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a statement circulated Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry,
Primakov said he would not agree to take the prime minister's post,
though he would be willing to continue serving in the Cabinet.
	   Luzhkov, too, coyly denied he'd been negotiating for the top
government post.
	   Noting that he was already ``prime minister of the Moscow
government,'' Luzhkov asked ``Is that so little?,'' the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Chernomyrdin's efforts to win parliamentary confirmation have
left him little time to devote to the economy, which remained in a
downward spiral. The ruble, which bought about 16 cents last month,
was worth around 5 cents on Tuesday.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
began forming at gas stations before gasoline prices went up
Tuesday.

Open battles for governorships in Mexico's governing party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Democratic reforms have turned the
once-silent struggle for power in Mexico's governing party into a
noisy, public skirmish in Guerrero state.
	   Six contenders for the Guerrero state gubernatorial nomination
have asked the national head of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party to demand that current Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero butt out of
the selection process, the newspaper Reforma reported Tuesday.
	   Two of the candidates _ including the current governor's alleged
favorite _ have complained of death threats or gunfire attacks in
recent days.
	   Political reforms in Mexico which have given opposition parties
a greater chance to win elections against the party known as the
PRI, which has governed Mexico since 1929.
	   The PRI has responded with internal reforms making its own
candidate selection process more open in hopes of picking more
popular candidates. In the past, it relied on candidates
hand-picked by party chieftains _ often national presidents or
state governors.
	   Six of the contenders in Guerrero charged that Aguirre is trying
to continue the old policy by imposing Manuel Anorve as the PRI
candidate.
	   In a letter to party President Mariano Palacios Alcocer, they
denounced ``meddling in the process'' by Aguirre and asked Palacios
Alcocer to speak with the governor ``so that only PRI members and
society'' decide the candidate.
	   Such a letter would have been political suicide within the PRI a
decade ago.
	   One of the candidates, Rene Juarez Cisneros, claims that
gunshots were fired at his car on Sept. 1 on the highway from
Acapulco to Mexico City. Anorve claims he has received death
threats and said heavily armed men menaced his wife recently.
	   PRI candidates also are squabbling in the Caribbean coastal
state of Quintana Roo, where some party officials have accused a
leading candidate of being ineligible under party rules and another
would-be candidate is threatening to quit the party.

Facing increasing accidents on Bosporus, Turkey joins world accord
</HEADLINE>
on oil spills &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ With crowding and accidents increasing on
its busy Bosporus Strait, Turkey announced Tuesday it was belatedly
joining an international convention that makes tankers financially
liable for oil spills.
	   The strait, a narrow, 40-kilometer (24-mile) passageway linking
the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, has been the site of nearly 200
accidents in the past decade, some of which have caused major
spills.
	   ``It is no longer possible to compensate, as a nation, the
environmental, life and material damages that a ship carrying
petroleum could cause in our seas, and especially in the Turkish
straits,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Foreign Ministry official Selahattin Alpar said Turkey had
chosen not to adhere to the 1969 Civil Liability Convention until
now because Turkish ships would also be liable to pay.
	   Already, 440 million barrels of oil transit the Bosporus
annually. Nearly 3,500 ships pass through the Bosporus each month,
making it one of the world's most active shipping channels.
	   A proposed oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Russia's main
Black Sea port of Novorossiysk would increase the flow of oil
tankers and add to Turkey's woes. Turkey has proposed an
alternative route that bypasses the Bosporus.

Sudan mobilizes forces to fight Nile flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has mobilized its military
reservists and militiamen to help counter the worst floods to hit
the country in half a century.
	   The interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein,
appealed to all states threatened by the rising Nile rivers to move
citizens away from lowlands and off islands.
	   His call, on state television late Monday, applied to areas from
the capital Khartoum to the Egyptian border.
	   ``We have now mobilized all Popular Defense Forces troops and
all the national service reserves to take part in this national
call until we are out of the dangerous phase,'' Hussein said.
	   The Popular Defense Forces is a paramilitary militia that often
fights beside the army against southern rebels.
	   The daily Akhbar Al-Sa'a reported Tuesday the three women and a
baby girl died in the Omdurman neighborhood of the capital when
their house collapsed because of the floods.
	   State radio reported Tuesday that in the Al-Azouzab quarter of
Khartoum, 332 houses have been destroyed and hundreds remained
surrounded by water.
	   The radio also said 2,840 houses have been destroyed in the
northern province of Dongola and that damage to agriculture was
estimated at dlrs 25 million.
	   Flood waters are expected to crest in Khartoum on Thursday,
according to Sherif Tuhami, minister of irrigation and water
resources.
	   The government fears this year's floods will be second only to
those of 1946.
	   In 1988, Sudan declared most areas along the Nile river disaster
areas because of floods that left hundreds of thousands of people
homeless.
	   The Blue and White Nile rivers merge in Khartoum and flow north
into Egypt. Sudan, a very poor country, doesn't have enough
resources to build dams and dikes to protect shorelines.
	   The country often has a flooding problem in September, when the
rivers are at their highest and seasonal rains begin.
	   The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said Monday that more than 20,000 homes have been
destroyed by the floods and appealed for donations to help 95,500
of the most needy victims.

 &UR; Authorities undeterred by IRA dissidents' `complete' cease-fire &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. New throughout; DELETES byline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British and Irish authorities
Tuesday welcomed the cease-fire announced by a dissident IRA group,
but vowed they would not be deterred in hunting down those members
behind a car bomb that claimed 29 victims in the town of Omagh.
	   ``We will continue to pursue those responsible for the Omagh
bomb, those who organized it, those who carried it out,'' British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern pledged the ``unrelenting
determination'' of both governments to hunt down those who planned
and carried out the Aug. 15 terrorist strike, the worst in the
30-year history of Northern Ireland's conflict.
	   In a statement issued early Tuesday to the Irish state
broadcasters RTE, the so-called Real IRA _ which claimed
responsibility for the Aug. 15 car bomb _ said it had decided on a
``complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   Last month, the splinter group had declared a ``suspension'' of
what it called its ``military operations,'' a step short of a
formal cease-fire.
	   The Real IRA's latest statement brought the group in line with
the mainstream Irish Republican Aarmy and several other
paramilitary groups: the IRA's main anti-British rival, the Irish
National Liberation Army, which called its own truce Aug. 22, and
Northern Ireland's two major outlawed pro-British gangs _ the
Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force _ which
called a joint cease-fire in 1994.
	   Ahern said intelligence reports indicated the Real IRA
cease-fire was genuine. But he said he was still not clear about
the ``state of mind'' of another dissident group, the Continuity
IRA.
	   He pointed out the danger of Real IRA members opposed to the
cease-fire now joining up with the Continuity IRA.
	   ``That is ... the reason why I have not been over the moon about
this statement, the possibility that they would drift back,'' he
said. ``That means there is an obligation on the Continuity IRA to
make absolutely clear what their position is.''
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation that gave
police greater power to seek conviction of alleged Real IRA
members. So far, however, police have yet to round up suspects on
their list.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government accused the Central Bank on Tuesday
of mishandling Russia's spiraling economic crisis, while the
nation's top economic policy maker said the government was
committed to genuine reforms _ not just printing money.
	   Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax chief, said
the Central Bank should ``stop the games with the ruble rate.''
	   ``At today's rate, the Central Bank could easily buy all the
rubles in circulation,'' added Fyodorov.
	   Both the government and the Central Bank believe that the ruble
has fallen too far. The ruble was trading at 6.2 to the dollar, or
16 cents per ruble, before the crisis took off less than a month
ago. As of Tuesday, it reached 20 to the dollar _ or 5 cents per
ruble _ in street trading, and the official rate was set late in
the day at 20.825.
	   Neither the government nor the Central Bank has announced a plan
to halt the slide of the ruble.
	   Russian share prices ended slightly lower Tuesday on negligible
volume as the country's financial markets remain transfixed by the
political crisis. The Russian Trading System Index closed at 62.61,
down 1.05 percent from 63.28 Monday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economic crisis deepening, the
governor of the western Kaliningrad enclave has declared an
``emergency situation'' to ensure the region does not run out of
food, fuel and other vital supplies, officials said Tuesday.
	   In several regions across Russia, authorities have imposed price
controls so that people won't go hungry because they can't afford
to buy food.
	   Kaliningrad Governor Leonid Gorbenko ordered his staff on Monday
night to find funds to support pensioners and other people with low
incomes, and to develop a plan to ensure that the region of more
than 900,000 residents does not run out of basic medicines, said
administration spokeswoman Antonina Maidak.
	   He also demanded that measures be taken to get the harvest in.
Many crops in the region have already been ruined by an unusually
wet summer.
	   Maidak emphasized that the ``emergency situation'' does not call
for any restrictions on residents' rights.
	   ``These are purely economic measures,'' she said. ``We have
appealed to our people, so that we could join forces and not get
lost in the time of crisis.''
	   As the ruble's value has plunged, Kaliningrad officials worry
that the funds that had been budgeted to heat apartments during the
winter will not be nearly enough.
	   Gorbenko appealed to Kaliningrad utility authorities to avoid
middlemen and buy fuel directly from producers, Maidak said.
	   He also asked Kaliningrad food producers to take food to cities
and sell directly to customers, bypassing retail companies, in
order to keep prices lower, she said.
	   In Siberia, governors Alexander Lebed of the Krasnoyarsk region
and Leonid Polezhayev of the Omsk region have imposed price
controls, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Polezhayev has also
banned exports of Omsk foodstuffs to other regions.
	   ``By regulating the prices, I certainly place myself on the
brink of violating the law, but I consider these actions quite
warranted,'' Lebed was quoted as saying.
	   ``The emergency situation forces me to take emergency measures.
I believe that businessmen, managers of food processing enterprises
would understand me,'' he added.
	   In the Stavropol region in central Russia, authorities have
decided to hold fairs in cities and towns so that staple goods
would be sold directly to residents.
	   While prices have been rising sharply in most of the country,
they fell in the arctic port of Murmansk after residents used up
their savings and were forced to stop buying, ITAR-Tass reported.

Sierra Leone ex-junta and rebel fighters kill 50 in sneak attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify in 5th and 6th grafs that Revolutionary
United Front rebels identified among the attackers. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Rebel fighters and ousted junta
soldiers have ambushed a town in northern Sierra Leone, killing at
least 50 people and burning down several homes, witnesses said
Tuesday.
	   A local journalist interviewed by a Catholic Church-run radio
station said many of the civilians had been shot dead
execution-style by the attackers.
	   ``My three children were killed but I managed to escape,'' said
Ya Yanor Turay, a local resident who said she saw the bodies of at
least eight other people.
	   The group attacked the town of Kamalu, 150 kilometers (95 miles)
northwest of the capital, before dawn Monday.
	   Roman Catholic missionaries speaking on the radio station said
the well-armed insurgents wore uniforms identifying them as Kamajor
and Civil Defense Force traditional fighters as well as former
Sierra Leone soldiers and Revolutionary United Front rebels.
	   Normally, the Kamajors and Civil Defense Force members are
allied to Sierra Leone's current government. The Kamajors, fighting
alongside a Nigerian-led intervention force, helped oust the junta
earlier this year. However, junta soldiers are known to have formed
alliances with several rebel groups, including the RUF.
	   Members of Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma's ousted military junta
and their rebel allies have killed, raped and maimed thousands of
people in a revenge campaign against the restored government led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   The motive behind Monday's attack was not immediately clear.
	   Catholic parishioners held a mass prayer meeting Monday in the
central town of Makeni to pray for the rebels to stop the killings.

Briton remanded to custody for soccer hooliganism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A court on Tuesday returned to custody
a 22-year-old British football fan suspected of violence after
Sweden's European championship qualifying game against England.
	   The man is expected to face prosecution on charges of violent
disorder, vandalism and creating danger for others, the Swedish
news agency TT reported.
	   Following usual practice, the man's name was not publicized and
court officials could not be reached for comment after-hours. But
the British Foreign Office told The Associated Press that a
22-year-old named Cameron Calhoun had been scheduled to appear in
court in Stockholm on Tuesday.
	   The man was arrested after hooligans broke windows in the top
tier of the Rasunda stadium at the end of the game, which Sweden
won 2-1. The man has admitted throwing an object through one of the
broken windows, TT said.
	   The trial is to begin by Sept. 18.

Stars back out in Venice

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Last year's Venice Film Festival was doom
and gloom on the lagoon. This year, the stars are out. The Lido's
got its glamor back.
	   Hollywood is boffo at the Venice box office again, just a year
after being snubbed over what festival director Felice Laudadio
called a creative slump.
	   American movies are getting warm reviews _ and the stars even
warmer welcomes.
	   The frantically snapping photographers and the star-struck fans
staking out the elaborate Excelsior Hotel are making mush of
Laudadio's crack last year that the ``Venice Film Festival isn't
for paparazzi.''
	   The tinsel town roster is impressive: a score of movies and
stars such as Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas, Jim Carrey, George
Clooney, Matt Damon, Melanie Griffith, Robert De Niro and Warren
Beatty.
	   Festival veterans say so much celestial wattage has restored the
festival's luster. The introduction of a black-tie rule at the gala
events has also upped the gliz factor.
	   Laudadio staunchly defends the cold shoulder he gave
techno-heavy Hollywood last year. This time around, he says, the
big studios are back to the grand tradition of storytelling.
	   ``Sure, they still use special effects, but they use them in the
service of the story,'' he told the entertainment weekly Variety.
	   As a special badge of honor, Laudadio chose Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan'' as the festival's opening film.
	   Other big American films being shown here include De Niro's spy
thriller ``Ronin,''''Out of Sight,'' ``The Perfect Murder'' and
``Poodle Springs.''
	   The American independents as well as the majors are
well-represented, with a number of movies making their world
premieres. Among them are Woody Allen's ``Celebrity,'' John Dahl's
``Rounders'' with Damon, Abel Ferrara's ``New Rose Hotel'' with
Willem Dafoe and Christopher Walken and Tony Drazan's
``Hurlyburly'' with Sean Penn, Meg Ryan and Kevin Spacey.
	   The critics have embraced the Hollywood offerings this year.
``Ryan'' got excellent reviews, and ``The Truman Show,'' both shown
out of competition, was greeted by many as a masterpiece.
	   ``It's a shame that ``The Truman Show'' was shown out of
competition,'' a review in the daily La Repubblica lamented. ``It
could have been a contender for the Lion,'' the festival's top
prize.
	   If Venice needs Hollywood, then the relationship is reciprocal.
The strategically timed festival is an ideal launching pad for the
European releases of big American films. Raves like those for ``The
Truman Show'' should translate into bucks at the box office.
	   In fact, most major American films show in special sections of
the festival, like this year's ``Nights and Stars'' and don't even
bother to compete. It's not the prize that matters, it's the press.
And Hollywood's getting plenty at Venice this year.
	   Beatty's ``Bulworth' is a rare exception. It opened in the
United States to decent reviews but an indifferent box office, and
a prize at Venice could give it a boost.
	   In addition to ``Bulworth,'' three U.S. indies are in the
competition: ``Rounders,'' ``New Rose Hotel'' and ``Hurlyburly.''

Paper reports claims of EPO use, French form anti-doping group
</HEADLINE>
EDS: REWORKS, moving up confessions from Festina cyclists &QL; 
 &UR; By YANN OLLIVIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Amid reports that cyclists from the disgraced
Festina team admitted to using the doping substance EPO, the French
government Tuesday created its own team to tackle what is
increasingly seen as a widespread problem -- drugs in sports.
	   France Soir, the evening paper here, said Monday that it had
obtained details of confessions by several members of the Festina
team which was thrown out of the Tour de France in July for EPO
use.
	   ``I acknowledge the use of EPO for about the last four years,''
Swiss cyclist Alex Zulle told police, according to the newspaper.
	   ``The first time, I was racing for the Spanish team ONCE. I was
using the product while preparing for the Tour de France, Giro and
the Tour of Spain, taking two injections of EPO a week for three or
four weeks before and during the race.''
	   In response to mounting concern over the use of illegal drugs in
sports, the French government said it would set up a working group
to help clamp down on illegal substances.
	   The announcement by Health Minister Bernard Kouchner and Sports
Minister Marie-George Buffet comes in the aftermath of the dramatic
Tour de France, dominated by the doping scandal.
	   The working group includes leading figures from sports medicine,
law and sociology, including the presidents of the National
Commission of the Order of Doctors, the French Society of Sports
Doctors and the National Order of Pharmacists.
	   The group is to make a preliminary report in mid-October, one
month before the National Assembly's second reading of a new
anti-doping law, and present its final recommendations by April
1999, officials said.
	   According to France Soir, cyclists admitted to widespread use of
EPO during police questioning.
	   ``I cannot prove it, but I believe that today one can find it
used by all the large cycling teams,'' Zulle was quoted by France
Soir as saying. ``For the first time, this year I used a growth
hormone in addition to EPO. (Festina team doctor) Erik Ryckaert
gave me the substance, which I injected myself.''
	   French cyclist Laurent Brochard also admitted taking EPO,
according to the daily.
	   ``When I considered stopping taking EPO I asked myself if I
could maintain my performances at the same level. Therefore, I
didn't dare stop.''
	   Teammate Pascal Herve said he was misled by team doctors.
	   ``I ignored the exact nature of the products that were injected
into me,'' Herve said. ``I didn't try to know more because I was
trusting the team physician. If the products injected were doping
me, I then was misled.''
	   According to the newspaper, Festina teammate Christophe Moreau
admitted to knowing that Ryckaert administered EPO.
	   ``In 1997, my results were more than satisfying in Festina and
Ryckaert explained to me that if I wanted to progress, I had to
follow his medical protocol based on the administration, among
other things, of this doping product.''
	   He claimed all nine Festina racers at the Tour followed the same
advice.

Polish telecom and postal workers fight over privatization shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poles may have their phones cut off and
mail undelivered as a result of a fight that stepped up Tuesday
between telecommunication and postal workers over shares in the
country's biggest privatization .
	   Employees of Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPSA), who are due to
receive free shares of their company next month as part of
privatization, protest against making workers of the Polish Post
eligible for the part of the pie.
	   TPSA held a referendum Tuesday in which more than 90 percent of
the employees said they would go on strike to fight for their
shares estimated at 60,000 zloty (dlrs 16,200) per person, said
Tadeusz Najbauer of the Solidarity national board.
	   If parliament approves the government's plan to enlarge the
number of eligible for free shares, a TPSA employee would get
shares worth less than half as much.
	   Average monthly salary in Poland is about dlrs 300.
	   The government announced Aug. 25 that workers of the Polish
Post, which was separated from the TP SA in 1991 as part of
restructuring, are also eligible for free shares.
	   That would increase the number of eligible employees to 180,000
from the current 75,000, according to Telecommunications Minister
Marek Zdrojewski.
	   Postal workers will decide about a possible strike if parliament
rejects the government's proposal to allow them to participate in
the shares distribution, said Bogumil Nowacki of the Polish Post
Solidarity union.
	   Selling TPSA, which has practically a monopoly of the Polish
telephone market - Central Europe's largest, with 39 million
consumers - will be one of the country's biggest privatizations.
	   The government plans to sell between 20 and 25 percent of the
shares through an initial public offering in November, including 85
percent sold to domestic and international institutions.
	   Fifteen percent will be distributed to employees free of charge.
	   Under current law, the state must keep 51 percent of the
company's stock. But the Treasury has said the law may be amended
to allow for a sale of a majority of TPSA.
	   A study by the Warsaw office of Price Waterhouse LLP estimates
TPSA's worth at dlrs 10 billion. That would make it the largest
company ever listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
	   TPSA earned a net profit of 970 million zloty (dlrs 262 million)
last year.
	   The TPSA Solidarity may decide on Wednesday whether to go on
strike.

Minister says freeing Iranian captives is priority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Saving the Iranians believed held captive by
Afghanistan's Taliban militia is a priority for Tehran, and all
options are being explored to free them, a senior Iranian official
said Tuesday.
	   Mohsen Aminzadeh, the deputy foreign minister responsible for
Afghan affairs, said in an interview with The Associated Press that
``We are considering all possible means to save them.''
	   He added: ``We hope the Taliban have received our message
correctly and do not let this condition worsen.''
	   Aminzadeh emphasized that Tehran will continue to pursue a
peaceful and diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   Tehran has accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist.
	   The diplomats and the journalist for the state-run Islamic
Republic News Agency went missing after the Taliban captured the
city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month.
	   The Taliban, which accused the Iranians of aiding opposition
forces, denies any knowledge of the diplomats. Last Thursday, it
freed five other Iranian prisoners in a goodwill gesture.
	   Aminzadeh acknowledged that there have been contradictory
reports about the fate of the Iranian diplomats, but said ``we have
reliable news that our diplomats are alive and healthy.''
	   He pointed out that Iran has appealed to international
organizations, such as the United Nations, and Pakistan to help
secure the release of the missing diplomats.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban.
	   ``We'd like to solve the crisis with Afghanistan through
political and diplomatic ways but, as we've emphasized earlier, we
give high importance to the lives of our nationals and diplomats,''
Aminzadeh said.
	   Over the past few days, Iran has warned the Taliban that it
would take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of its
nationals.
	   U.S. intelligence has suggested that Iran was poised for an
incursion into Afghanistan. Iran last week massed troops and
equipment on the Afghan border for military exercises, and it has
left a lot of that in place.
	   Aminzadeh said that Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, an Iranian ally, would visit Tehran soon. He did not give
details.
	   He also said the Afghan crisis will be discussed during next
week's visit to Iran by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.

Woman dies of infection caused by salmonella
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ In the first known case in Denmark, a
62-year-old woman has died from a strain of salmonella resistant to
antibiotics, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The woman, whose name was not given, was one of seven persons
admitted to hospitals this summer with fever and diarrhea after
eating pork from an eastern Denmark farm, the Berlingske Tidende
newspaper said.
	   A government health agency found the antibiotics-resistant
salmonella strain DT104 at the farm, the newspaper said.
	   DT104 has been rampant in Britain for a decade and is known to
have caused at least one death in the United States. DNA tests made
on the ailing people showed they all had the salmonella DT104, the
newspaper said.

American Koven wins repechage, continues defense of crown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ American James Koven took advantage of
his last chance to defend his crown, earning a place in the single
scull semifinals after winning his repechage heat on Tuesday.
	   Koven, who won the title last year in France, covered the
2,000-meter (1.25-mile) course on the Fuehlinger See in 7 minutes,
18.50 seconds, a convincing 2.59 seconds ahead of Latvia's Andris
Reiholds, who also qualified.
	   Britain's Greg Searle, the Olympic single sculls bronze
medalist, won his heat to advance, crossing in 7:26.43.
	   Clocking the top two chronos in their heat, Fredrik Bekken of
Norway and 1994 world champion Andre Willms of Germany also
qualified. The two finished ahead of Olympic silver medalist and
1993 world champion Derek Porter, preventing the Canadian from
reaching the semifinals.
	   Porter wasn't the only former champion to be thwarted, with 1990
world champion Jueri Jaanson of Estonia also missing the boat,
finishing third in his heat.
	   In the women's single sculls, 35-year-old Maria Brandin of
Sweden, winner at Henley, also made the cut, winning her heat in
8:08.15.
	   Britain's Peter Haining, the only sculler to win a world title
three times, made the most of his second chance, clinching his
repechage leg in 7:36.76.
	   Australia's Michael McKay and Drew Ginn kept alive their hopes
for a title in the men's coxless pair, finishing second in their
heat behind Britons Stephen Williams and Fred Scarlett, heat
winners in 6:44.79.
	   The two Australians are also competing in the coxed four, where
they joined forces with James Tomkins, Nicholas Green and Brett
Hayman on Sunday to qualify for the semifinals.
	   The Olympic coxless four champions missed selection for the
event this season, after illness kept them out of Australian
trials, so decided on a different tack.
	   The ``oresome foursome'' are making an unusual attempt at three
different titles at the worlds, rowing together in the coxed four,
then splitting up to race in the coxed and coxless pairs and have
qualified for all three.

Spanish judiciary denies political bias in Basque dirty war trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's judiciary branch on Tuesday denied
that political bias had played any part in recent convictions
linking former high officials in the government of ex-premier
Felipe Gonzalez to a ``dirty war'' against Basque separatists.
	   The denial came a day after Gonzalez directly accused Supreme
Court President Javier Delgado of anti-Socialist bias in the trial
stemming from the 1983 kidnapping of a businessman who had been
mistaken for a separatist hitman.
	   Gonzalez, Spain's best-known politician, has said Delgado
covered up political pressure from the current conservative
government on his court to find former interior minister Jose Luis
Barrionuevo and top ministerial aide Rafael Vera guilty of
organizing the abduction.
	   The kidnapping was the first action attributed to an
anti-separatist death squad known as GAL which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years, many of them mistaken targets.
	   Claims that the shadowy group was set up by Gonzalez's
government contributed to the Socialists' electoral defeat in 1996.
The conviction of Barrionuevo and Vera provided the first legal
backing to the allegations of direct ministerial involvement.
	   Faced with Gonzalez' damage-control crusade, the General Council
of the Judiciary, a judicial oversight panel which Delgado also
heads, issued a statement Tuesday stressing the legal propriety of
the Supreme Court verdict, issued at the end of July.
	   Tuesday's denial of bias also included a defense of an earlier
statement from Delgado that criticized the ``emotionally-based''
reaction of those convicted in the trial or those close to them,
either personally or politically.
	   Analysts say Gonzalez' charges of political conspiracy help
justify his decision to represent Barrionuevo and Vera in their
appeals to the Constitutional Court.
	   On Tuesday a congressional commission said Gonzalez' status as a
Socialist Party deputy would not be affected by his high-profile
return to the legal profession.
	   Ten other lower-ranking officials and former police agents were
also convicted of the kidnapping, although they pleaded guilty
during the trial.
	   The Supreme Court met Tuesday to discuss when the convicted
dozen should begin serving their jail terms.

Moussa pessimistic about Israeli, Palestinian peace prospects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday
there was ``little hope'' of an agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians on Israel's long-delayed troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Moussa spoke with reporters on the eve of a visit by U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross to the region for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel pull back from 13
percent of the West Bank territory in exchange for greater
Palestinian efforts to fight Islamic militants.
	   ``If we rule according to what we are hearing and reading, there
is little hope of reaching a balanced and just agreement,'' Moussa
told reporters. ``But let us wait and see what is going to happen
after Ross arrives.''
	   Israel initially rejected the American proposal, saying such a
move would compromise its security. In recent weeks, the Jewish
state has talked of withdrawing from 10 percent of the land and
turning an additional 3 percent into ``nature reserves.''
	   The Palestinians have been reluctant to accept the alternative
on grounds they would have limited authority in the nature areas.
	   On Wednesday, two Netanyahu envoys _ Israeli Cabinet secretary
Danny Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad _ are due in Cairo for
talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Moussa said they were coming to speak about ``the Israeli stance
concerning the possibility of reaching an agreement with the
Palestinian side.''
	   Asked if this visit would help improve Egyptian-Israeli
relations, Moussa said: ``The freeze between Israel and Egypt is
connected to the freeze in the peace process. If the peace process
moved ... and a fair agreement was reached, this could help.''
	   Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool since their 1979 peace
treaty, have worsened since the election of the hard-line Netanyahu
in 1996. Egypt has joined other Arab countries in blaming Netanyahu
for the stalemate in Arab-Israeli negotiations.

Turkish leader: Syria encourages Kurdish separatists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turkey promising to give Palestinians documents
from Ottoman archives, 16th graf
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ In an escalating war of words, the
Turkish prime minister on Tuesday accused Syria of hostile
intentions, saying it supported Kurdish separatists in his country.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's remarks came in response to claims
in state-run Syrian newspapers that Turkey's military alliance with
Israel was bringing more tensions to the Middle East.
	   The increasingly close Israeli-Turkish defense ties have caused
great concern among several Middle Eastern nations, especially
Syria, Iran and Iraq which believe it is directed at them.
	   Yilmaz confirmed Tuesday that his country and Israel plan to
conduct joint naval maneuvers in November, but would not comment on
reports that Egypt and Jordan were also invited.
	   The two nations held their first joint exercise in January, with
the participation of more than 1,000 sailors and five warships.
Jordan sent an observer.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday that the head of Jordanian
intelligence secretly visited Israel on Sunday to discuss the
possibility of Jordan joining the Israeli-Turkish alliance.
	   However, Israeli military commentators said they doubted
moderate Arab states, such as Egypt and Jordan, would break ranks
with the rest of the Arab world.
	   Turkey has said it did not believe a regional defense structure
could be set up before Israel has negotiated peace agreements with
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   In Damascus, the government daily Tishrin urged Turkey in an
editorial Tuesday to improve its relations with the Arabs and with
fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into Israel's
arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Asked about the Syrian comments, Yilmaz said in his halting
English: ``Anyone who speaks (about) hostility in the region with
hostile attitudes should focus on the policies of the Syrian
government that encourages separatist terrorism in the region.''
	   Yilmaz, who made the remarks after a meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate. In the past, Turkey as
accused Syria, as well as Iraq, Greece and Armenia, of supporting
Kurdish separatists.
	   Asked about Turkey's position on Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, Yilmaz urged Israel to accept a U.S. plan that calls
for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have adopted the U.S. proposal which also calls
for a greater Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   ``Both sides must take constructive steps to get this t of the
freeze it is in,'' Yilmaz said. ``We shall wait and see for ... the
Israeli side to accept the U.S. initiative as the Palestinian side
has accepted it.''
	   Yilmaz also said Turkey will give the Palestinians documents
from the Ottoman-era archives to help Palestinians prove ownership
of land in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel, Israel radio
reported. Palestine was part of the Ottoman empire until World War
I, when it was captured by the British.
	   The Turkish leader said Turkey and the Palestinian Authority
have signed cooperation agreements in the fields of culture,
education and the environment. He also said he has invited
Palestinian officials to Turkey to discuss loans to the Palestinian
Authority.

	   The suspect was identified as A. Frangopulov of the Eskado bank.
His arrest was apparently linked with the arrest last week of
acting First Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Petrov, who according
to media reports had taken about dlrs 1 million in bribes from
Eskado.
	   In the Far Eastern region of Magadan, Deputy Governor Vyacheslav
Kobets was accused of abuse of power and organizing an illegal
trade in precious metals, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Kobets passed several regulations on the Magadan regional
administration's sales of silver and gold to middlemen in 1997,
while he was serving as acting governor, the news agency said. He
has been released on his own recognizance.

Tour of Spain lead changes hands again as Guidi wins fourth leg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Fabrizio Guidi won the fourth leg
of the Tour of Spain _ and the front-runner's yellow jersey _ on
Tuesday as the overall lead changed hands for the second time in as
many days.
	   Guidi, riding for the Polti team, covered the 173.5-kilometer
(108-mile) stretch between Malaga and Granada in 4 hours, 27
minutes and 22 seconds.
	   He ousted France's Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche bank as
overall leader of the three-week cycling marathon. Jalabert has
emerged as the man to beat, though, showing fine physical form.
	   Jalabert, now second in the standings, said he did not mind
giving up the lead, saying it meant less stress for him. Third is
Markus Szberg, a Swiss rider with Post Swiss.
	   Second place in the day's leg went to Italy's Giovanni Lombardi
of Telekom and third to Dutchman Jeroen Blijlevens of TVM. They
were both credited with the same time as Guidi.
	   As was the case on Monday, the fourth leg saw a number of
breakaway attempts, again by Spanish riders. Vicente Garcia Acosta
of Banesto jumped out in the 110th kilometer (69th mile) and rode
alone to the outskirts of Granada until the pack caught up.
	   Guidi won the leg in a sprint across the finish line.
	   Wednesday's fifth leg covers 165.5 kilometers (100 miles)
between Olula del Rio and Murcia.

Leaders of Ukraine, Azerbaijan discuss Caspian oil export route
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuchma describing Ukraine's oil transportation
route in grafs 8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
Tuesday that Azerbaijan supports transportation of its oil from
Caspian Sea deposits through Ukraine, a news agency reported.
	   Speaking in the Azerbaijani capital Baku after a meeting with
President Geidar Aliev, Kuchma said Aliev supported ``in
principle'' the possibility of exporting oil to Western Europe
through Ukraine, Interfax reported.
	   Kuchma and presidents of seven other nations arrived in Baku on
Monday to participate in an international conference organized by
Aliev to discuss a future transportation corridor that would
stretch from European countries to Asia through the Caucasus
Mountains.
	   The conference, meant to revive the ancient Great Silk route,
brought together a total of some 700 delegates from 12
international organizations and more than 30 countries in Europe in
Asia.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to take part in the transportation of oil from Azerbaijan's huge
Caspian Sea deposits.
	   The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers
from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to the Black Sea port of
Odessa, where a large oil terminal is currently under construction.
	   From there, the oil will flow via a pipeline _ also under
construction _ to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export.
	   Speaking at the conference later in the day, Kuchma said
Ukraine's route for transporting Caspian oil offers the shortest
way from Azerbaijan to northern Europe, providing for lower
transportation costs than other routes.
	   But he added that the present pattern of oil consumption in
Europe necessitates exports of Caspian oil to the region by a few
different routes besides Ukraine.
	   Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Holubchenko, who
also attended the conference in Baku, said the country would be
ready to start transporting Caspian Sea oil in two years.
	   He told Interfax that the Odessa oil terminal is being rapidly
completed, while half of the Odessa-Brody pipeline also has been
finished. Ukraine needs about dlrs 400 million to complete the
pipeline, Holubchenko said.

Yeltsin delays choice for prime minister; may signal change of

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new final 2 grafs with Chernomyrdin's economic
directives. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin hesitated Tuesday over ramming
through his unpopular choice for prime minister, while opposition
and religious leaders warned that the political standoff could
spark civil war.
	   The nation's top clergyman expressed fear of unrest, praying
publicly before Russia's holiest icon for divine protection against
``misfortunes, sorrows and internecine war.''
	   Yeltsin conferred with top aides at his country residence amid
growing speculation he may choose a compromise candidate to stave
off a showdown with the Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament, the State Duma.
	   Up to now, he had insisted that acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin was his only choice, but the Duma on Monday rejected
Chernomyrdin a second time. Yeltsin, who is known for trampling
over his political opponents, has compromised before in the face of
popular anger.
	   The president has one more chance to win parliamentary approval
for his prime ministerial pick. If the Duma refuses to confirm the
candidate, Yeltsin must dissolve the legislature and call
parliamentary elections within three months.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday that if
Yeltsin continued to demand approval of Chernomyrdin, Russia's
crisis would deepen.
	   ``A mistake for the president and his team can cost the
country's civic peace. This is a very high price,'' Zyuganov said.
	   He added that disbanding the Duma would be tantamount to
dissolving the Russian Federation, and ``I am afraid that would end
in fighting throughout Russia's expanses.''
	   It was typically incendiary talk from Zyuganov, who has piled
all the blame for Russia's crippling economic crisis on Yeltsin and
his government _ and none on the Duma, which continually blocked
economic reforms that might have strengthened the economy. Among
stalled measures are a radical overhaul of the tax collection
system, legislation on land ownership, and laws that would
accelerate the bankruptcy of enterprises.
	   Yet the possibility that economic and political crisis could
spill over into violence _ though there have been no signs of
unrest up to now _ was on the minds of others, as well.
	   Alexy II, the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, prayed
for peace before a revered icon, Our Lady of Vladimir, in a central
Moscow museum.
	   ``Civil war is the most terrible thing that the current
political crisis could bring Russia, because blood always
divides,'' Alexy said. ``We believe that the Lord will protect our
land from misfortunes, sorrows and internecine war.''
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin
was unlikely to name his candidate for prime minister before
Wednesday. There was rampant speculation in the Duma corridors that
the president was trying to find a way out of a confrontation that
could end in the legislature's dissolution.
	   Duma Deputy Yelena Mizulina, one of the initiators of a campaign
to impeach Yeltsin, said Tuesday that the Duma would put
impeachment on its agenda if the president named Chernomyrdin a
third time. If the Duma votes for impeachment proceedings the
Constitution bars Yeltsin from dissolving the body.
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. The two names that have prompted the
greatest speculation among lawmakers were Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a statement circulated Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry,
Primakov said he would not agree to take the prime minister's post,
though he would be willing to continue serving in the Cabinet.
	   Luzhkov, too, coyly denied he'd been negotiating for the top
government post.
	   Noting that he was already ``prime minister of the Moscow
government,'' Luzhkov asked ``Is that so little?,'' the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The economy remained in a downward spiral. The ruble, which
bought about 16 cents last month, was worth around 5 cents on
Tuesday.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
began forming at gas stations before gasoline prices went up
Tuesday.
	   With the political stand-off continuing, Chernomyrdin moved to
set his economic policies in motion. He named Fyodorov, the acting
deputy premier, to be Russia's chief envoy to the International
Monetary Fund, Interfax reported.
	   The acting government also instructed tax police to start raids
Thursday on firms suspected of setting excessively high prices,
ordered a swift cut in oil excise taxes, and directed the Central
Bank to require exporters to sell half their hard-currency proceeds
for rubles. Russian customs officers will be allowed to levy duties
in foreign currencies, including dollars, Interfax said.

 &UR; German transport minister issues ban on Yugoslav airline flights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The transport ministry on Tuesday banned
flights by Yugoslav airliners, two days after EU foreign ministers
agreed to up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
over violence against ethnic Albanians in the country's southern
Kosovo province.
	   The ban announced by Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann,
applies to planes belonging to operators of airliners in Yugoslavia
flying to and from EU members states.
	   The German federal flight office was instructed by Wissmann to
suspend its permission for incoming Yugoslav flights, he said.
	   At the same time the German Flight Security office was
instructed to stop issuing start and landing permission for the
flights, Wissmann said.
	   The only exceptions would be for emergency landings and
resulting starts, and for Montenegro Airlines charter planes
between Leipzig and the Adriatic airport Tivat, the minister said.
Montenegro and Serbia are Yugoslavia's two states.
	   Overflights by Yugoslav airliners were not suspended, the
ministry said.
	   According to Wissmann, the ban affects JAT and Aviogenex
airlines, although Aviogenex has not had any flights between
Yugoslavia and Germany since last month. JAT had been flying 17
times a week to Berlin, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
	   Plans for an EU flight ban against Yugoslavia were already
announced in June, but Greece originally declined to go along with
it. But on Sunday at a meeting of EU foreign ministers revived the
ban after Greece's Theodoros Pangalos said his country would
respect it.

Report: 200 people die in Congo lake accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ At least 200 people have drowned when two
boats overloaded with passengers capsized in strong winds on Lake
Kivu, Congolese regional radio reported on Tuesday.
	   The radio in Bukavu, on the southern tip of Kivu 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Goma, said one of the boats that capsized on
Sept. 2 was carrying gasoline and caught fire.
	   There was no immediate explanation why the incident was not
reported until Tuesday.
	   The boats were carrying passengers returning from a market in
Bukavu, on the border with Rwanda, to the islands of Nyamizi and
Muhembe. Only 20 people survived the accident, the radio said. It
gave no other details.
	   Boat accidents in central and eastern African lakes are not
unusual, because most boats are poorly maintained and travel
overloaded with cargo and people. Officials rarely enforce safety
regulations.

Iraq: UN inspector report is politically motivated propaganda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday called a report by the
chief U.N. weapons inspector that U.N. monitors had been barred
from visiting certain sites baseless and politically motivated.
	   In a letter to the Security Council president, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said the inspector, Richard Butler, distorted
the facts in his briefing Thursday to the council.
	   Butler was updating the 15 council members on the status of
monitoring following Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to freeze cooperation
with U.N. inspectors, which has prevented any new inspections from
being carried out.
	   Though Iraq has pledged to allow ongoing monitoring to continue,
Butler told the council of incidents in which monitors had been
blocked from doing their work.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Saddam
Hussein's 1990 invasion of Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, the council was to continue work on a draft
resolution that would suspend regular sanctions reviews on Iraq
until it rescinds its decision _ essentially leaving Baghdad with
no means to have sanctions lifted.
	   Last Thursday, Butler told the council that Iraq prevented a
monitoring team from entering a camp on Aug. 19 that had been
monitored in the past.
	   In his letter Tuesday, Aziz said the team was rejected because
they were looking for something that didn't exist at the site: a
military workshop.
	   ``It is nothing but a tendentious propaganda which aims at
exaggeration for political reasons and purposes,'' Aziz said.
Butler's charges, he added, were baseless.
	   In another incident, Butler said a team had been prevented from
checking up on missile components that had been monitored in the
past because it was not a site that Iraq had said was acceptable to
search.
	   Both Iraq and Butler's U.N. Special Commission designate sites
for inspections, but often they don't concur.
	   Aziz said Iraq hadn't designated the site. In such a case, Aziz
said, the U.N. monitors should have done what they have done in the
past when components were at a site that hadn't been designated:
request the missile parts themselves be displayed.
	   ``From the foregoing, it has become clear that the content of
the briefing made by the executive chairman that Iraq has limited
the Special commission to the inspection of the sites declared by
it only, is absolutely untrue,'' Aziz said in the letter to Hans
Dahlgren of Sweden, the current council president.

Minister says freeing Iranian captives is priority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Saving the Iranians believed held captive by
Afghanistan's Taliban militia has become a top priority for the
government, a senior Iranian official said Tuesday.
	   ``We are considering all possible means to save them,'' said
Mohsen Aminzadeh, the deputy foreign minister responsible for
Afghan affairs, in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We
hope the Taliban have received our message correctly and do not let
this condition worsen.''
	   Tehran has accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist. The diplomats and the
journalist for the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency went
missing after the Taliban captured the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan last month.
	   ``We'd like to solve the crisis with Afghanistan through
political and diplomatic ways but, as we've emphasized earlier, we
give high importance to the lives of our nationals and diplomats,''
Aminzadeh said.
	   The Taliban, which accused the Iranians of aiding opposition
forces, denies knowing what happened to the diplomats. Last
Thursday, it freed five other Iranian prisoners in a goodwill
gesture.
	   Aminzadeh acknowledged that there have been contradictory
reports about the fate of the diplomats, but said ``we have
reliable news that our diplomats are alive and healthy.''
	   He said that Iran has appealed to international organizations,
such as the United Nations, and Pakistan to help secure the release
of the missing diplomats. Pakistan is widely believed to provide
arms and other support to the Taliban.
	   U.S. intelligence has suggested that Iran was poised for an
incursion into Afghanistan. Iran last week massed troops and
equipment on the Afghan border for military exercises, and has left
troops in place.
	   Aminzadeh said that Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, an Iranian ally, would visit Tehran soon. He did not give
details. He also said the Afghan crisis will be discussed during
next week's visit to Iran by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.

More Israeli-Turkish maneuvers planned, unnerving some neighbors
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Turkey and Israel will conduct joint
military maneuvers in November, the Turkish prime minister
confirmed Tuesday, prompting some jitters among Israel's neighbors.
	   Syria, Iran and Iraq have all expressed concern about Turkey's
cooperation with Israel, and Syrian state-run newspapers said the
two countries' military ties were increasing regional tensions.
	   Asked about that, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that
anyone talking about hostility in the region ``should focus on the
policies of the Syrian government (encouraging) separatist
terrorism in the region.''
	   In the past, Turkey as accused Syria, as well as Iraq, Greece
and Armenia, of supporting Kurdish separatists. Yilmaz, who made
the remarks after a meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
did not elaborate.
	   In Damascus, the Syrian government daily Tishrin urged Turkey in
an editorial Tuesday to improve its relations with the Arabs and
with fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into
Israel's arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   Turkey, however, has said it did not believe a regional defense
structure could be set up before Israel has negotiated peace
agreements with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday that the head of Jordanian
intelligence secretly visited Israel on Sunday to discuss the
possibility of Jordan joining an Israeli-Turkish alliance, but
Jordanian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied the
report.
	   The Turkish prime minister would not comment on reports that
Egypt and Jordan had been invited to join in November's exercise.
	   Israeli military commentators said they doubted moderate Arab
states such as Egypt and Jordan would break ranks with the rest of
the Arab world, and warned against making too much of the joint
Israeli-Turkish maneuvers.
	   ``It would be far-fetched to say it is a defense strategic
pact,'' said Amikam Nahmani, a senior lecturer with the Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies. ``Nobody expects Turkish soldiers to

	   Israel and Turkey held their first joint exercise in January,
with the participation of more than 1,000 sailors and five
warships. Jordan sent an observer.

Lazio asks federation for compensation for Nesta injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian first-division club Lazio of Rome asked the
national soccer federation Tuesday to hand over compensation for
the lost services of defender Alessandro Nesta, who was injured
during the World Cup.
	   The request is believed to be unprecedented in Italy.
	   Nesta tore ligaments in his right knee four minutes into Italy's
2-1 victory over Austria in first-round play at France '98 in June.
He is expected to miss about a third of the Serie A season, which
opens this weekend.
	   Lazio spokesman Giuseppe De Mita would not say how much money
the club had asked for, but the ANSA news agency put the figure at
13 billion lire (about dlrs 7.5 million).
	   Federation president Luciano Nizzola was outraged.
	   ``If this principle holds, the existence of national teams will
be put into doubt,'' Nizzola told reporters. ``No federal budget is
capable of handling this type of request. I'm amazed. Our lawyers
will have to study this, because it catches us unprepared.''
	   Nesta said he is anxious to get back into uniform.
	   ``I'm aware of this request, but nothing is going to my
pockets,'' he said. ``All I can think about is returning to the
field as soon as possible and I hope to do so within two or two and
a half months.''

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Flooding in southern
Mexico Tuesday caused by three days of nearly continuous rain
washed away bridges, cut off towns and killed at least three
people.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast. He said at least 5,000 people in more than
50 towns and villages were displaced by dozens of rivers that
swelled beyond their banks.
	   Civil protection authorities confirmed three deaths and said
there were several other people missing, but didn't give details.
	   They said more than 10 bridges had fallen and that washed-out
roads had cut off 57 villages. Electricity, water and sewage
services also were cut to many villages, and mudslides and fallen
trees blocked many roads.
	   The governor said police officers, soldiers and Red Cross
workers were spreading out in the area to help the thousands of
people affected by the flooding.
	   The mayor of Pijijiapan, a municipality of 53,000 people along
the coast 90 miles (145 kilometers) from the Guatemalan border,
said 70 percent of his territory was flooded.
	   ``It's been raining nonstop for the last 72 hours and the water
is rising,'' the mayor, Gilberto de los Santos Cruz, said in a
telephone interview.
	   ``All the streets are filled with water,'' said Pijijiapan
police Cmdr. Hector Romero. ``The bridge on the highway is
destroyed. We have no electricity.''
	   He said four people had disappeared in that town, and that many
outlying villages were incommunicado.
	   Heavy rains in the central states of Michoacan, Sinaloa and
Nayarit also forced some families from their homes.

Swissair plane's flight recorder found but missing crucial data

 &UR; Eds: ADDS UPDATE on memorial services later this week, graf 12 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers have retrieved Swissair
Flight 111's flight-data recorder despite an emergency which
endangered their lives, but experts say the ``black box'' contains
no information from the final minutes of the doomed flight.
	   Crash investigators had high hopes after the data recorder was
recovered from the ocean floor Sunday. But laboratory examinations
on Monday revealed that there was no data from at least the last
six minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off
Nova Scotia last week, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the data recorder
stopped once the plane dipped below 10,000 feet (3048 meters). A
strong possibility, he said, was that the plane lost electrical
power at that stage.
	   In Zurich, Swissair's chief pilot-designate, Rainer Hiltebrand,
rejected as ``irresponsible'' suggestions that the plane's pilots
reacted too late to the situation.
	   A total loss of power was virtually unthinkable, he added
Tuesday. The MD-11 has three normal generators, as well as a
back-up generator and an emergency generator. There is also a
battery which would power all the plane's essential functions for
15 minutes, Hiltebrand said.
	   Gerden said the data recorder was in good condition and should
provide useful evidence about more than 100 types of information
ranging from altitude and airspeed to whether the plane's smoke
warning lights were on.
	   The data recorder, found at a depth of 190 feet (57 meters),
nearly didn't make it to the surface. Navy Capt. Phil Webster said
one of the two divers developed a leak in his suit, and the pair
had to make an ascent _ clutching the black box _ much more rapidly
than is considered safe.
	   One of the divers became ill from the rapid change in pressure.
Both were put in a decompression chamber, then taken to hospital.
Both were recovering at home, Webster said.
	   At the crash site, five miles (eight kilometers) offshore,
divers equipped with hand-held sonar searched Monday for the
plane's other black box _ the cockpit-voice recorder. The signals
from the device have been detected, but bad weather forced
suspension of the diving until at least Wednesday.
	   If retrieved intact, the voice recorder would reveal other
noises in the cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with
controllers, portions of which were released Saturday. That
conversation was cut off 10 minutes after the pilots reported smoke
in the cockpit and six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to confirm if three large pieces of
wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections of the
plane's fuselage.
	   Memorial services were planned later this week in Halifax and at
U.N. headquarters in New York for victims of the crash. Among those
attending the ceremony in Halifax will be Swiss President Flavio
Cotti. Several U.N. workers died in the crash.

Tour of Spain lead changes hands again as Guidi wins fourth leg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Fabrizio Guidi won the fourth leg
of the Tour of Spain _ and the front-runner's yellow jersey _ on
Tuesday as the overall lead changed hands for the second time in as
many days.
	   Guidi, riding for the Polti team, covered the 173.5-kilometer
(108-mile) stretch between Malaga and Granada in 4 hours, 27
minutes and 22 seconds.
	   He ousted France's Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche bank as
overall leader of the three-week cycling marathon. Jalabert has
emerged as the man to beat, though, showing fine physical form.
	   Jalabert, now second in the standings, said he did not mind
giving up the lead, saying it meant less stress for him. Third is
Markus Szberg, a Swiss rider with Post Swiss.
	   Second place in the day's leg went to Italy's Giovanni Lombardi
of Telekom and third to Dutchman Jeroen Blijlevens of TVM. They
were both credited with the same time as Guidi.
	   As was the case on Monday, the fourth leg saw a number of
breakaway attempts, again by Spanish riders. Vicente Garcia Acosta
of Banesto jumped out in the 110th kilometer (69th mile) and rode
alone to the outskirts of Granada until the pack caught up.
	   Guidi won the leg in a sprint across the finish line.
	   Wednesday's fifth leg covers 165.5 kilometers (100 miles)
between Olula del Rio and Murcia.

Report: 200 people die in Congo lake accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ At least 200 people have drowned when two
boats overloaded with passengers capsized in strong winds on Lake
Kivu, Congolese regional radio reported on Tuesday.
	   The radio in Bukavu, on the southern tip of Kivu 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Goma, said one of the boats that capsized on
Sept. 2 was carrying gasoline and caught fire.
	   There was no immediate explanation why the incident was not
reported until Tuesday.
	   The boats were carrying passengers returning from a market in
Bukavu, on the border with Rwanda, to the islands of Nyamizi and
Muhembe. Only 20 people survived the accident, the radio said. It
gave no other details.
	   Boat accidents in central and eastern African lakes are not
unusual, because most boats are poorly maintained and travel
overloaded with cargo and people. Officials rarely enforce safety
regulations.

Costa Rica to deport woman who claimed Castro ill

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ A Cuban woman who claimed to be a
doctor who had seen Fidel Castro gravely ill has been denied asylum
in Costa Rica, according to officials and news reports Tuesday.
	   Elizabeth Trujillo had appealed for refugee status in July.
	   In interviews with local and foreign journalists, she had
claimed to be a doctor who had worked at a hospital in Havana where
Castro had been treated secretly for a serious illness in August
1997.
	   However Cuban officials and her ex-husband denied the claims,
saying she was not a doctor and had left Cuba long before August
1997.
	   Immigration officials here rejected her petition, saying she did
not face ``a well-founded fear of persecution'' and because of the
``incoherence of her declarations.''
	   ``Immigration police have instructions to locate Trujillo and
proceed with her eventual invitation to leave Costa Rican
territory,'' the state security ministry said in a news release on
Monday.
	   Officials have not said to which country she might be sent.

This year's anniversary of Pinochet's coup will be different
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY91 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ It will be a legal holiday for the last
time. There will be no military parades. And Gen. Augusto Pinochet
is no longer the army's commander in chief.
	   The 25th anniversary of Pinochet's bloody military coup of Sept.
11, 1973 will not be just like the others. But there will be
similarities.
	   Authorities say privately that they expect the usual clashes, as
well as continuing protests over human rights abuses under
Pinochet.
	   In past years, military and right-wing anniversary celebrations
and the creation of the national holiday marking the coup have
infuriated the thousands of people who suffered under Pinochet's
repression.
	   This year, leftist groups said they would challenge a ban on
marching past the presidential palace on Friday by including the
building on their route to the General Cemetery for a tribute to
Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president overthrown
by Pinochet.
	   Pinochet, 82, ruled until March 1990. He retained the powerful
post of army commander until March, when he was made a senator for
life _ a job he gave himself in the constitution he wrote.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
his, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons during his
dictatorship, including 1,102 who disappeared after Pinochet's
security agents detained them. Thousands more were tortured or
forced into exile, or both.
	   The coup anniversary has been a legal holiday since 1981. The
right-wing controlled Senate has blocked three attempts by
post-Pinochet civilian governments to drop it.
	   But last week, in a surprise move, Pinochet agreed to replace
the holiday with a ``day of national unity,'' to be observed on the
first Monday in September starting in 1999.
	   Pinochet said he acted ``for the sake of national unity and
reconciliation among Chileans.''
	   Senate President Andres Zaldivar and rightist senators promptly
approved the measure.
	   ``This will contribute to improved relations between civilians
and military,'' Zaldivar told The Associated Press. But, he said,
``it also shows that Pinochet retains a very decisive leadership on
the political right. His word still has a very strong power
there.''
	   The decision to eliminate the coup holiday was followed by other
surprises: The commanders of the armed forces and the national
police said that there will be no anniversary celebrations at the
barracks this year, a change the government called ``positive,
important, valuable.''
	   And the military commanders said they will join government
officials and politicians in a Mass for national reconciliation led
by Santiago Archbishop Francisco Errazuriz.
	   But victims' relatives angrily objected to establishment of a
day of national unity, saying the military should first disclose
the whereabouts of their missing loved ones and show repentance.
	   In a rare interview with Radio Cooperativa of Santiago on
Thursday, Pinochet said dropping the holiday was a gesture in that
direction.
	   Leftists ``keep asking for gestures from us, but they do not
make any,'' he said. ``I don't think reconciliation may occur now
because a very deep hatred still exists.''
	   And in an interview published Sunday in the Santiago daily El
Mercurio, Pinochet claimed he has no information on the whereabouts
of the missing. ``I have asked some friends of mine, and no one
knows anything,'' he said.
	   Even some rightists admit that the issue of human rights
violations, especially the uncertainty over those who have
disappeared, is a big obstacle to reconciliation.
	   ``It is an open wound in our society that must be cured,'' said
Joaquin Lavin, the strongest right-wing presidential candidate for
next year's election and an avowed Pinochet supporter.

Tanker truck explodes near two buses, at least 57 killed

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A tanker truck flipped and exploded on
a highway early Tuesday, igniting two charter buses returning from
a religious festival, firefighters said. At least 57 people burned
to death and dozens were injured.
	   The accident happened just before 3 a.m. (0600 GMT) on the
Anhanguera Highway near Araras, about 110 miles (180 kms) northwest
of Sao Paulo.
	   ``The tanker truck lost control and flipped,'' Wilson Lima of
the Araras fire department said by telephone. ``A liquor truck
rammed it from behind, and the fuel or chemicals _ we don't know
for sure yet _ spilled on to the highway.''
	   The two buses drove by and were in the pool of flammable liquid
when it burst into flame, Lima said.
	   ``It was incredible bad luck,'' he said. ``They just happened to
be right on top when it exploded. The victims were carbonized.''
	   The four vehicles were reduced to a heap of twisted and charred
metal.
	   TV footage showed a long stretch of the highway's median strip
charred black, and a row of wooden coffins on the roadside. The
coffins were later taken to the Araras morgue where they filled two
rooms.
	   Many passengers escaped with minor injuries. Lima said 39 people
were hospitalized in Araras and Leme, but most were released.
	   He said the death toll could rise ``if some of the more
seriously injured die.'' He did not know how many were in serious
condition.
	   The buses were heading to the midwestern city of Anapolis with
pilgrims returning from Aparecida do Norte, a town 107 miles (173
kms) east of Sao Paulo that houses the basilica of Our Lady
Revealed, Brazil's patron saint.
	   Some 50,000 people attended a mass and protest rally in
Aparecida do Norte on Monday, Brazil's independence day. The rally
was part of a nationwide protest to call attention to poverty and
unemployment.

Italian Left leader Massimo D'Alema meets with British prime
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy's leftist leader said he emerged from a
``positive and friendly'' meeting with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Tuesday confident he has Blair's support in developing a
coalition of socialist groups throughout Europe and beyond.
	   Massimo D'Alema, leader of Italy's Democratic Left party and
widely regarded as one of the country's most powerful politicians,
said his meeting with Blair focused on ``how to build Europe'' by
fostering communication and cooperation among its leftist
movements.
	   ``I expressed to Mr. Blair my support ... for his actions and
his efforts in developing and fostering a dialogue of cooperation
between the left (groups), particularly the European left and other
Democratic forces, more specifically the American Democrats,''
D'Alema said at a news conference at the Italian Embassy following
the meeting.
	   D'Alema's visit with the prime minister was a prelude to Italian
Premier Romano Prodi's meeting in New York later this month with
Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss the same
prospects.
	   D'Alema said he was particularly pleased with Blair's assertion
that the prime minister would use his good relations with the
United States to promote the interests of all of Europe, and not
just those of Britain.
	   He said he sees Blair as an ``ambassador'' to the United States
for European socialists.
	   ``It can't be Europe alone,'' he said. ``It has to be larger
than Europe.''
	   The Italian leader stressed that the goal of the talks with
Blair was not to create a new leftist movement in Europe, but to
get the existing groups communicating.
	   ``It is a not a matter of a new movement, but dialogue among
existing movements,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ The kidney ailment of Malawi's vice
president has led to an upgrade of the availability of medical
technology to treat kidney disease in this southeast African
country.
	   Justine Malewezi, who is now receiving kidney dialysis treatment
three times a week, is to receive a kidney from his brother in an
all-time-first surgical procedure for the country, Malawi's news
media reported Monday.
	   The venue for the transplant was not disclosed but the
operation, routine in the developed world, is unprecedented in
Malawi.
	   ``Medical examinations have already been conducted, and
everything seems to be on course,'' said a doctor who said he could
not reveal his name for ethical reasons.
	   Malewezi, who was earlier this year hospitalized for three
months in Germany and then in South Africa, was advised to have a
kidney transplant later in the year to avoid the continuing
dialysis treatment.
	   After being discharged from Bonn's University Hospital in April,
Malewezi could not be flown home immediately because there were no
dialysis machines in Malawi.
	   His condition prompted hurried training of medical staff and
importation of Malawi's first dialysis machines for hundreds of
similar sufferers in this impoverished, landlocked country.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Japan has given Ethiopia dlrs 37.7
million to improve water, power and road systems in the capital, a
government minister said.
	   The grant also includes a first contribution towards improving a
300-kilometer (190-mile) highway linking the capital to the
agriculturally rich northwest, Ghirma Birru, minister for economic
development and cooperation, said Monday on receiving the grant.
	   Japanese Secretary of State Keizo Takemi said the total cost of
the highway project was estimated at dlrs 77.9 million, which will
be the largest single grant provided by Japan for a project in the
Middle East or Africa.
	   Takemi was in Ethiopia to promote the second Tokyo International
Conference on Africa Development, scheduled for Oct. 19-21.
	   The conference is aimed at reducing poverty.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.N World Food Program suspended its
feeding program in northwestern Rwanda after a fatal land mine
accident last week, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   One person was killed and a driver injured when a five-vehicle
convoy drove over a mine on Friday.
	   ``Following the last week mine explosion, we have suspended our
operations in Ruhengeri until a security review is undertaken and
completed,'' said WFP spokeswoman Linsley Davies.
	   Davies said WFP has been feeding needy Rwandans the northwest
three times a week.
	   -----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ One of the main donors during Malawi's
first multiparty democratic elections' in 1994, the United Nations
Development Programme, Monday pledged assistance for next year's
presidential elections.
	   UNDP resident Representative Terence Jones said the donor
community was wanted to support Malawi's electoral process that
began with the 1994 ouster of ``life president'' Hastings Kamuzu
Banda after 30 years of one party rule.
	   Jones said donors would be channelling their assistance through
UNDP. They were waiting for the Electoral Commission, appointed
three months ago, to finalize a budget. UNDP will support
international observers, electoral staff training and provide
office equipment. President Bakili Muluzi's Government has said it
has put aside dlrs 7.5 million for the polls.
	   Church and non-governmental organizations are being assisted to
register and educate voters in poll procedure. Lack of funding was
the major reason for Malawi's failure to hold overdue local
government elections, estimated to cost dlrs 20 million, after
1994.
	   ----
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia's foreign minister has met with
opposition on the home front to his bid for presidency of the
United Nations Security Council.	   A Namibian group, the Forum for the Protection of the
Constitution of the Republic of Namibia, on Monday opposed the
candidacy of Theo-Ben Gurirab because he was part of a government
that sent its military abroad to help quell a rebel insurrection in
nearby Congo.
	   The government ``has plunged our people into a potentially
debilitating conflict against the people of neighboring African
states,'' the group said in a memorandum to the United States and
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Gurirab has been nominated by the Organization of African Unity
as Africa's candidate for the U.N. post from 1999 to 2000.

Annan concerned about lack of progress in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Prospects for a political settlement in
separatist Kosovo province appear bleak and more than 230,000
refugees face a tough winter, according to a report Tuesday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Also Tuesday, international humanitarian agencies appealed for
dlrs 54 million to help the refugees fleeing fighting between
Yugoslav forces and the militant Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   In his report to the Security Council, Annan said he was
``alarmed by the lack of progress toward a political settlement in
Kosovo and by the further loss of life, displacement of civilian
population and destruction of property.''
	   He reiterated his plea to both sides ``to demonstrate restraint
and to start the negotiating process.'' He said he was prepared to
intervene to negotiate an end to the violence.
	   The council was expected to begin discussions on the report
later this week. In his report, Annan noted that although the scale
of fighting has decreased some ``it is evident that the conflict
continues and any prediction of its end would be premature.''
	   It said an estimated 600 to 700 civilians have been killed in
six months of battle between Serb-led forces and Kosovo Albanian
rebels who want independence from Serbia, the dominant of two
republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Nearly 270,000 people have been driven from their homes,
according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``Deserted towns and villages, as well as destroyed houses,
slaughtered livestock and burned fields, bear witness to the scale
of displacement and destruction in Kosovo,'' Annan's report said.
	   ``There are disturbing reports that some returnees, mostly young
men, were taken by police for `informative talks,''' Annan added.
	   The UNHCR has expressed concern over the roundup of some 450 men
in one village two days earlier, an estimated 40-50 of whom remain
in detention and have been charged.
	   The UNHCR and other U.N. relief agencies say more than 400,000
people in Kosovo are expected to need help through the winter and
into next spring.
	   Sub-freezing temperatures are expected to take hold in the
region in October and continue until March or April, the agencies
say.
	   UNHCR was sending out a convoy of supplies for 80,000 people in
western and central Kosovo on Tuesday.

ANC activists receive amnesty for killings in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid crimes
on Tuesday granted amnesty to four men who killed a black policeman
they believed was collaborating with white rule.
	   Joseph Elias Makhura, Frans Ting Ting Masango, Obed Masina and
Neo Potsane were all members of the African National Congress'
armed wing. They shot Brig. Andrew Molope, a policeman in the now
defunct black homeland of Bophuthatswana, at a house near Pretoria
in 1986.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission said the applicants had
fulfilled the two main conditions for amnesty by telling the truth
and proving a political motive.
	   In their applications the four men testified to being members of
an ANC assassination squad tasked with eliminating opponents of the
struggle to end white rule.
	   ``The applicants bona fide believed that the elimination of
Brigadier Molope would protect the opponents of the then
Bophuthatswana government from further suffering,'' the commission
said.
	   Molope's family had opposed the amnesty, but will now be
entitled to compensation as victims of an apartheid crime.
	   Homelands like Bophuthatswana were set up under apartheid as a
dumping ground for blacks, while the minority white population kept
most of South Africa's land. Though nominally independent, few
other countries recognized the often corrupt homeland governments
and many blacks saw their officials as collaborating with white
rule.
	   Set up a year after 1994's all-race elections ended apartheid,
the Truth Commission is tasked with uncovering the facts about
apartheid-era atrocities. Though it has wound up its investigative
work, its amnesty committee has been extended indefinitely after
being swamped with applications.

Ethnic Albanians report fresh Serb attacks in western Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with more report on the fighting,
Shattuck in Montenegro, trims
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Slobodan Milosevic's security forces
were reported on a fresh offensive Tuesday in western Kosovo, one
day after the latest U.S. attempt to persuade the Yugoslav
president to halt the attacks.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed Serb-led forces launched Tuesday
a major offensive near the Albanian border and in central region of
Kosovo, following a brief lull in the fighting.
	   The Albanian-controlled Kosovo Information Center said at least
two people were killed Tuesday in Prilep, one of several villages
near the Albanian border reported under attack. The center said 15
others were wounded, including two children.
	   Albanian sources accused government forces of burning houses in
several villages. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   But residents who live near the border said at least 17 people
were killed in two border villages over the weekend. A middle-aged
man showed reporters the recently-dug graves of six men and one
women in a village of Jeskovo, 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the
border.
	   Residents said Serb police looted and burned houses in the
village during the weekend after civilians fled. Some of them began
returning home Tuesday.
	   Reporters who visited the village Tuesday saw shattered roofs
and burned-out hulks that had been cars. Pieces of smashed
televisions and stereos littered the dirt road that had turned to
mud in a torrential downpour.
	   The latest fighting was reported one day after a top State
Department official met Milosevic to call for a cease-fire and
partial withdrawal of the police and army so that thousands of
displaced Kosovo Albanian civilians could return home.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said in Montenegro that Milosevic was responsible for the situation
in Kosovo and that war or peace in the province depended on him
alone. Shattuck pledged more U.S. efforts to solve the crisis
peacefully.
	   But a spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army criticized
U.S. envoys who have been trying to hammer out an agreement for
Kosovo. The KLA is fighting for independence for the province from
Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   Adem Demaci, the KLA's political representative, said U.S.
special envoy Christopher Hill and U.N. Ambassador-designate
Richard Holbrooke favored the Serbs. The United States opposes
independence for Kosovo, fearing it could destabilize the southern
Balkans.
	   ``I don't have complaints about the orientation of the American
foreign policy,'' Demaci said. ``But we are unhappy with American
envoys in Kosovo. Kosovo should have someone who ... (does) not not
favor (Serbian) force and its results.''
	   On Tuesday, the reliable Belgrade newspaper Glas Javnosti said
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans for Kosovo, an apparent sign that the Yugoslav
president was seeking a compromise.
	   The newspaper said parliamentary elections should be held within
three months and that the formation of a new Kosovo parliament
could be the basis of an agreement between Milosevic and ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The deal was reached in principle under U.S. mediation, but the
rebels have indicated they would not accept it. Under the proposed
formula, Kosovo would eventually be granted self-rule but not full
independence.
	   Details remain unresolved, and Western diplomats say it could
take months to finalize them.
	   But Demaci doubted whether any deal with Milosevic was possible.
	   ``Only force can make him carry out what he promises,'' Demaci
told reporters. ``That's the only language he understands.''
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.

Netanyahu approves sale of fighter planes to Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution from newspaper report to prime minister's
spokesman, ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved
the sale of 10 MiG-21 fighter planes to Ethiopia, his spokesman
said. The move comes despite objections from neighboring Eritrea.
	   Relations between the two Horn of Africa countries had been
deteriorating since last year and in June a border dispute boiled
over into armed clashes.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said in principle, Israel
does not supply arms to areas of conflict, but he said the sale was
agreed to on the assumption that the conflict would have died down
by the time the planes are delivered, probably next year.
	   The MIGs were bought by Israel from Romania and upgraded with
modern avionics and other state-of-the-art systems, he said.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Slobodan Milosevic's security forces
were reportedly on a fresh offensive Tuesday in western Kosovo, one
day after the latest U.S. attempt to persuade the Yugoslav
president to halt the attacks.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources claimed Serb-led forces launched a major
offensive Tuesday near the Albanian border and in central region of
Kosovo, following a brief lull in the fighting.
	   The Albanian-controlled Kosovo Information Center said at least
two people were killed Tuesday in Prilep, one of several villages
near the Albanian border reported under attack. The center said 15
others were wounded, including two children.
	   Albanian sources accused government forces of burning houses in
several villages. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   But residents who live near the border said at least 17 people
were killed in two border villages over the weekend. A middle-aged
man showed reporters the recently-dug graves of six men and one
women in a village of Jeskovo, 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the
border.
	   Residents said Serb police looted and burned houses in the
village during the weekend after civilians fled. Some of them began
returning home Tuesday.
	   Reporters who visited the village Tuesday saw shattered roofs
and burned-out hulks that had been cars. Pieces of smashed
televisions and stereos littered the dirt road that had turned to
mud in a torrential downpour.
	   The latest fighting was reported one day after a top State
Department official met Milosevic to call for a cease-fire and
partial withdrawal of the police and army so that thousands of
displaced Kosovo Albanian civilians could return home.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said in Montenegro that Milosevic was responsible for the situation
in Kosovo and that war or peace in the province depended on him
alone. Shattuck pledged more U.S. efforts to solve the crisis
peacefully.
	   But a spokesman for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army criticized
U.S. envoys who have been trying to hammer out an agreement for
Kosovo. The KLA is fighting for independence for the province from
Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   Adem Demaci, the KLA's political representative, said U.S.
special envoy Christopher Hill and U.N. Ambassador-designate
Richard Holbrooke favored the Serbs. The United States opposes
independence for Kosovo, fearing it could destabilize the southern
Balkans.
	   ``I don't have complaints about the orientation of the American
foreign policy,'' Demaci said. ``But we are unhappy with American
envoys in Kosovo. Kosovo should have someone who ... (does) not
favor (Serbian) force and its results.''
	   On Tuesday, the Belgrade newspaper Glas Javnosti said Milosevic
has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting election plans
for Kosovo, an apparent sign that the Yugoslav president was
seeking a compromise.
	   The newspaper said parliamentary elections should be held within
three months and that the formation of a new Kosovo parliament
could be the basis of an agreement between Milosevic and ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The deal was reached in principle under U.S. mediation, but the
rebels have indicated they would not accept it. Under the proposed
formula, Kosovo would eventually be granted self-rule but not full
independence.
	   Details remain unresolved, and Western diplomats say it could
take months to finalize them.
	   But Demaci doubted whether any deal with Milosevic was possible.
	   ``Only force can make him carry out what he promises,'' Demaci
told reporters. ``That's the only language he understands.''
	   Milosevic abolished Kosovo's ethnic Albanian-dominated
parliament when he stripped the province of autonomy in 1989. Since
then, ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs roughly 9-to-1 in
Kosovo, have held two underground elections for their parliament,
which the Serb authorities branded illegal.

Netanyahu approves sale of fighter planes to Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution from newspaper report to prime minister's
spokesman, ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved
the sale of 10 MiG-21 fighter planes to Ethiopia, his spokesman
said. The move comes despite objections from neighboring Eritrea.
	   Relations between the two Horn of Africa countries has
deteriorated and in June a border dispute boiled over into armed
clashes.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said in principle, Israel
does not supply arms to areas of conflict, but he said the sale was
agreed to on the assumption that the conflict would have died down
by the time the planes are delivered, probably next year.
	   The MIGs were bought by Israel from Romania and upgraded with
modern avionics and other state-of-the-art systems, he said.
	   Eritrean rebels fought Ethiopia for 30 years to gain
independence, succeeding in 1993.

Israel says Russian Jews seeking immigration advice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Spurred by Russia's economic crisis, Russian
Jews are lining up to seek advice and information about immigration
to Israel, an official in Jerusalem said Tuesday.
	   The lines at the offices of the Jewish Agency in Moscow and
other cities in the former Soviet republics are so long that the
agency officials have begun briefing the people in groups instead
of individually, Jewish Agency official Amos Lahat said.
	   The Jewish Agency is a semi-official body based in Israel that
promotes immigration by Jews living abroad. Lahat is head of the
department dealing with the Jews in most of the former Soviet
Union.
	   ``I'm not saying there's a wave of hysteria,'' Lahat told Israel
radio, ``but a process has begun and it will gather impetus.''
	   He said Jews from Siberia and the Far East as well as from
Moscow and other big cities were asking about how to register for
Hebrew language courses and where to settle in Israel.
	   On Monday the Israeli government adopted a contingency plan for
absorbing a new wave of immigrants, if there is one.
	   Trade and Industry minister Natan Sharansky, who recently
visited Russia, said, ``I got the feeling that the self-confidence
of the Jews in Russia in their ability to make a living has been
shaken.''
	   Israel believes if the economic crisis continues, the flow of
immigrants from Russia and the other former Soviet republics could
swell from about 50,000 a year to 80,000 or even 120,000,
Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein said.
	   Sharansky and Edelstein are themselves immigrants from the
former Soviet Union.
	   Under the plan, officials are pinpointing cities, towns and
villages in Israel where housing and jobs are available for
immigrants, and increasing public housing for immigrants.
	   Also, places are to be made available at Hebrew language
schools, and Russian-speaking immigrants who have already settled
in Israel are to be enlisted to help newcomers adjust.
	   ``I wish the Russian government success in stabilizing its
economy, but we have to be prepared to receive the immigrants, on
the basis of the lessons of the past,'' Edelstein said.

Police say they found bodies of Serb civilians near KLA stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLODJANE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police Tuesday accused
ethnic Albanian rebels of mass executions of Serb civilians in
western Kosovo and showed reporters and international observers
bodies of some of the alleged victims.
	   Seven heavily decomposed bodies, one beheaded and another
missing limbs, lay in the grass and in a river near the former
rebel stronghold of Glodjane, in western Kosovo.
	   Police said the bodies were those of Serb civilians executed by
the rebels and claimed 40 people were shot there. Empty gun
castings were shattered around indicating some shooting took place
on the spot. Four bodies lay in dirty shallow water, three more on
nearby grass.
	   Parts of nearby Glodjane village, known to be the stronghold of
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, were ablaze Tuesday as security
forces apparently continued their sweep in the area. Sounds of
shelling could be heard in the distance.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources have reported a Serb offensive in the
area earlier in the day.

Opposition minister resigns to protest corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ The only opposition minister in Yemen's
Cabinet submitted his resignation Tuesday to protest what he said
was wide-spread corruption within his ministry.
	   Minister of Religious Endowments Ahmed al-Shami submitted his
resignation to President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Yemeni official
said.
	   It was not immediately clear if the president accepted it, said
the official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Al-Shami was the only minister in Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Iryani's government from an opposition party. He is a cleric and
a member of the Al-Haq party.
	   He had not carried out his duties for more than a month after
complaining of interference by senior officials in the ruling
General People's Congress.
	   Yemen is still reeling from a devastating 1994 civil war and is
having difficulty repaying its foreign debt of about dlrs 10
billion.

Peru's president said the country needs money for pensions

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Peru's president Alberto Fujimori said
Tuesday that his country would open its gates toward Eastern Europe
which could be a useful source of trade and investment.
	   ``The countries in Eastern Europe are mostly unknown for the
Latin America,'' Fujimori, who arrived here late Monday, said.
``These countries are sources of technology and potential business
markets.''
	   Late Tuesday, during an official ceremony, Fujimori awarded
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu with his country most
honorary medal, the Orden del Sol del Peru.
	   The three-day visit is the first visit to Romania by a Peruvian
president.
	   Fujimori showed interest in a potential investment in the
Romanian port of Constanta, some 222 kilometers (139 miles) east of
Bucharest and said the volume of the bilateral trade exchange is
too small.
	   He that his country faces some difficulties as paying the money
necessary for pensions and it would need dlrs 18 billion to cover
the required funds.
	   ``When I came to power in 1990 there was no money for the social
insurances, but the situation was changed since then,'' Fujimori
said at a meeting at the Latin American House in Bucharest.
	   He said that the necessary money for pensions have to come from
privatization.
	   Peru's public services have improved dramatically since the
privatization of its telephone, electricity and bus systems under
Fujimori's free-market reforms.
	   He said that his people should change the mentality that the
state owns and has to own everything.
	   ``There are some domains in which you have to let the private
monopoly to dictate.''
	   He added that there are still some companies which have to
remain under the state property, including the company which
assures the water supply.
	   He said the country is facing an acute crisis of drinking water.
	   On Wednesday, Fujimori is expected to sign a bilateral agreement
which aims to combat drug-smuggling. The two countries will also
agree to cooperate in promoting tourism.
	   Fujimori also condemned the recent terrorist attacks on the
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania but stressed that Peru''
disagrees with the U.S. retaliation in two poor countries,''
meaning U.S. missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan, according to
Romania's Rompres news agency.
	   Fujimori has been Peru's president since 1990. He was re-elected
for another five years in 1995.

Mass trial stumbles in its second week as protests mount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A mass trial of suspected Islamic militants began
stumbling under its own weight Tuesday a week after it started,
with dozens of personalities adding their voices to protesting
lawyers and defendants who deserted the proceedings after the first
day.
	   Representatives of France's lawyers association met with Justice
Minister Elisabeth Guigou. And the man who founded the special
prosecutors office for terrorism cases said he is opposed to
dispensing giant-sized justice.
	   More than half of the 138 defendants and some 50 lawyers have
walked out of the makeshift courtroom in a gym of the
Fleury-Merogis prison south of Paris, calling the trial a
masquerade.
	   Presiding Judge Bruno Steinmann has refused to halt the
proceedings.
	   ``I don't think we should hold trials of such a size .... This
is a first in French judicial history but it's not a very good
thing,'' Alain Marsaud was quoted as saying in the daily Le Figaro.
Marsaud created the 14th Section of the Prosecutors Office to
handle terrorism cases.
	   Representatives of the Council of the Order of Lawyers,
comparable to the American Bar Association, met with the justice
minister Elisabeth Guigou to share concerns about public defenders
who have replaced some 50 protesting lawyers -- but had no time to
read the tens of thousands of pages that make up the case.
	   The defendants, all arrested in 1994-95, are accused of
belonging to three separate but overlapping networks that allegedly
served as support bases for Islamic insurgents in Algeria. Only 27
of the defendants have been kept behind bars.
	   The suspects are accused of sending arms and medicine,
recruiting fighters, and providing funds and safe havens in France
for Algerian insurgents trying to topple their country's
military-backed government since 1992.
	   Isabelle Coutant Peyre, a defense lawyer speaking for her
client, Mohamed Chalabi, one of the top defendants, said in a faxed
statement that the trial is an ``infamy.''
	   By Tuesday night, some 60 personalities had signed a petition
protesting the conditions of the trial. Among the signers were
Danielle Mitterrand, the former first lady of France, movie
director Andre Techine and historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet.

Spain to send addition evidence for extradition of Basque suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government, seeking custody of a
suspected Basque extremist held in Florida, has gathered more
documentation for a U.S. judge who stayed an extradition order for
lack of evidence, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The documents have been gathered by the National Court, which is
seeking extradition of Ramon Aldasoro, 41, over the killings of a
Spanish general and two policemen in two bombings committed in
1988, the state news agency Efe said.
	   In an order issued Aug. 28, U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King said the only evidence linking Aldasoro to the crimes
are statements by four men who allegedly were fellow members of the
armed Basque separatist movement ETA.
	   The judge said all four have stated they implicated Aldasoro
only after being tortured or otherwise mistreated by Spanish
authorities. King gave the U.S. government 30 days to come up with
more evidence.
	   However, Spanish judicial officials say only one of those four _
Juan Carlos Arruti _ claimed torture, Efe said, quoting judicial
sources.
	   And Spanish authorities will pass on documents that attempt to
refute his version. They include a medical report which says
doctors examined Arruti at the police station where he fingered
Aldasoro and found no evidence of torture.
	   The documents will be passed on to King via the Spanish Embassy
in Washington, Efe quoted judicial sources as saying.
	   Aldasoro had been ordered extradited in June after a judge
rejected his claims that the Spanish government's charges of murder
and kidnapping against him were politically motivated.
	   Under the assumed name Gaspar Axpe, Aldasoro obtained a Florida
driver's license in April 1996 _ about the time he immigrated from
Mexico, according to state records. He had been living in the
middle-class suburb and working as an auto salesman.
	   Aldasoro was arrested last December by FBI agents on a tip by
the Spanish government. He was charged in the extradition complaint
with assault, murder, and robbery with intimidation in violation of
the Spanish penal code.

Malta's new premier picks Cabinet, reappointing pro-EU foreign
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Malta's new premier picked his Cabinet on
Tuesday, putting an energetic advocate of European Union membership
in the key Foreign Affairs post.
	   Eddie Fenech Adami of the conservative Nationalist Party has
claimed his weekend election victory _ Malta's biggest since World
War II _ as a mandate to link the island nation to the EU.
	   His pick as Foreign Affairs minister, Guido de Marco, held the
same post during Fenech Adami's 1987-1996 tenure and has been an
active proponent of getting Malta into the now 15-nation European
bloc.
	   Fenechi Adami won a 35-seat majority in the 65-seat Parliament,
routing Alfred Sant of the Labor Party, who had put Malta's
membership campaign on hold.
	   Sant cited public anger over his administration's utility rate
hikes in explaining his defeat. Fenech Adami's choice as Economic
Services minister, Josef Bonnici, is expected to preside over a
revision of those rates.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Foreign Ministers from Iran, Greece and
Armenia signed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday to increase
economic cooperation.
	   Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazzi, called it a step toward
improving relations among the three countries and said other
nations had expressed interest in joining the group, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   He also said new committees were formed to look into health and
environmental issues and ways to deal cooperatively with natural
disasters.
	   Visiting Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos proposed the
formation of a data bank through which the three countries could
share information on energy, trade, investment and other issues.
Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanian also attended the
meeting.
	   The three countries first got together to promote closer
economic ties in 1995.
	   During a meeting in the Greek capital Athens last year, they
signed a memorandum to create joint committees to study cooperation
in transport, postal services, telecommunications and other fields.

<TEXT>
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ The kidney ailment of Malawi's vice
president has led to an upgrade of the availability of medical
technology to treat kidney disease in this southeast African
country.
	   Justine Malewezi, who is now receiving kidney dialysis treatment
three times a week, is to receive a kidney from his brother in an
all-time-first surgical procedure for the country, Malawi's news
media reported Monday.
	   The venue for the transplant was not disclosed but the
operation, routine in the developed world, is unprecedented in
Malawi.
	   ``Medical examinations have already been conducted, and
everything seems to be on course,'' said a doctor who said he could
not reveal his name for ethical reasons.
	   Malewezi, who was earlier this year hospitalized for three
months in Germany and then in South Africa, was advised to have a
kidney transplant later in the year to avoid the continuing
dialysis treatment.
	   After being discharged from Bonn's University Hospital in April,
Malewezi could not be flown home immediately because there were no
dialysis machines in Malawi.
	   His condition prompted hurried training of medical staff and
importation of Malawi's first dialysis machines for hundreds of
similar sufferers in this impoverished, landlocked country.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Japan has given Ethiopia dlrs 37.7
million to improve water, power and road systems in the capital, a
government minister said.
	   The grant also includes a first contribution towards improving a
300-kilometer (190-mile) highway linking the capital to the
agriculturally rich northwest, Ghirma Birru, minister for economic
development and cooperation, said Monday on receiving the grant.
	   Japanese Secretary of State Keizo Takemi said the total cost of
the highway project was estimated at dlrs 77.9 million, which will
be the largest single grant provided by Japan for a project in the
Middle East or Africa.
	   Takemi was in Ethiopia to promote the second Tokyo International
Conference on Africa Development, scheduled for Oct. 19-21.
	   The conference is aimed at reducing poverty.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.N World Food Program suspended its
feeding program in northwestern Rwanda after a fatal land mine
accident last week, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
	   One person was killed and a driver injured when a five-vehicle
convoy drove over a mine on Friday.
	   ``Following the last week mine explosion, we have suspended our
operations in Ruhengeri until a security review is undertaken and
completed,'' said WFP spokeswoman Linsley Davies.
	   Davies said WFP has been feeding needy Rwandans the northwest
three times a week.
	   -----
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ One of the main donors during Malawi's
first multiparty democratic elections' in 1994, the United Nations
Development Programme, Monday pledged assistance for next year's
presidential elections.
	   UNDP resident Representative Terence Jones said the donor
community was wanted to support Malawi's electoral process that
began with the 1994 ouster of ``life president'' Hastings Kamuzu
Banda after 30 years of one party rule.
	   Jones said donors would be channelling their assistance through
UNDP. They were waiting for the Electoral Commission, appointed
three months ago, to finalize a budget. UNDP will support
international observers, electoral staff training and provide
office equipment. President Bakili Muluzi's Government has said it
has put aside dlrs 7.5 million for the polls.
	   Church and non-governmental organizations are being assisted to
register and educate voters in poll procedure. Lack of funding was
the major reason for Malawi's failure to hold overdue local
government elections, estimated to cost dlrs 20 million, after
1994.
	   ----
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia is expected to be one of five
new countries to be represented on the 15-member United Nations
Security Council.
	   Namibia, which would replace Kenya, has the full backing of the
African region for one of five non-permanent seats representing
specific geographic constituencies.
	   The formal elections, expected to occur in October, are also
expected to see Malaysia represent Asia and Argentina represent
Latin America.
	   Two other seats _ representing Western Europe and Northern
America together _ are hotly contested by Canada, the Netherlands
and Greece.
	   There are 10 non-permanent seats on the council and five
permanent ones _ the United States, Britain, China, France and
Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats comes up for
election to a two-year term.

Taliban not ready to hand over Osama bin Laden to US
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, enemy No. 1 in the
United States, has a home in Afghanistan as long as he wants it _
even if his presence invites another barrage of U.S. Tomahawk
missiles.
	   A top Taliban official, Abdul Sattar Paktis, strokes his
gray-streaked beard and speaks of the man accused of masterminding
bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania as an old friend
and honored guest.
	   ``Let me tell you something about Osama, he didn't just come to
Afghanistan. He has been here for the past 14 years off and on,''
Paktis, the Taliban's protocol officer, said in an interview Monday
with The Associated Press in Kabul's war-damaged foreign ministry.
	   ``He is our guest and we will never force him out,'' he said.
	   The United States fired Tomahawk cruise missiles into
Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings, which killed 258 people and wounded thousands. In
Afghanistan, two alleged terrorist training camps were hit Aug. 20,
including one believed to have been operated by bin Laden. He was
not harmed in the attack.
	   Bin Laden's threats against Americans and U.S. interests
worldwide have turned American embassies and consulates in several
countries, including neighboring Pakistan, into virtual fortresses.
	   Bin Laden, probably in his 40s, is the son of a Saudi
construction magnate. Shortly after Soviet troops invaded
Afghanistan in December 1979, he joined the Afghan struggle against
Moscow, gaining a reputation for bravery and determination. He is
estimated to have spent more than dlrs 200 million to recruit and
equip thousands of Muslim fighters.
	   His hatred of the United States seems to stem from outrage about
America's warm relations with Israel, and fury over the 500,000
U.S. troops deployed in his homeland of Saudi Arabia in 1990 and
1991 to help drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. He considered that a
desecration of his native soil.
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban religious army, already a virtual
pariah in the world because of its radical interpretation of Islam,
says it doesn't share bin Laden's burning hatred of the United
States.
	   ``We want very much to have very close relations with the
international community,'' Paktis said. ``We never expected this of
the United States because of our very long friendship with them
against the Russians.''
	   The Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan for 10 years before being
forced out by U.S.-backed insurgents.
	   The Taliban, he added, do not share bin Laden's goal of toppling
Muslim governments is such places as Egypt and Saudi Arabia to
replace them with radical Islamic regimes.
	   ``The Taliban authorities assure the world that it would never
interfere in other countries,'' Paktis said.
	   A week before the U.S. missile attack on Afghanistan, Paktis
said bin Laden gave a written guarantee ``not to be involved in any
way with international terrorism from Afghanistan'' to the
Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, Paktis said.
	   Afghanistan owes a debt to bin Laden, said Sher Mohammed
Stanikzai, deputy health minister.
	   ``I remember every year Osama was coming here for two or three
months and he himself, a rich man, taking a Kalashnikov in his
hands and fighting against the Russians,'' said Stanikzai.
	   ``We don't forget this. He defeated, along with us, our enemy,''
he said. ``Now, he has an enemy. We will not turn him over.''
	   Paktis said the Taliban is firm in its intent to protect bin
Laden: ``He is our guest and we will not hand over a guest to his
enemies. This is our Afghan culture.''
	   Paktis dismissed accusations that bin Laden has used his vast
wealth to buy safety in Afghanistan.
	   ``What do we need with his money? He is just one man, we are a
government,'' he said. ``His money can't buy us unity or
security.''
	   Although bin Laden is well known by governments around the
world, most Afghans were just learning his name after the U.S.
attack.
	   ``Who is this bin Laden? He should leave our ruins. We already
have so many problems,'' said Bibi Jan, trying to squeeze onto a
crowded women's-only bus in Kabul, where Taliban rulers forbid
women mingling with men.

American, Iranian wrestlers heading to showdown

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ American wrestlers were greeted by cheers
from Iranian fans and responded with three victories on Tuesday,
the first day of the World Wrestling Championships.
	   The Americans, on their second visit to Iran in seven months,
were greeted with almost as much enthusiasm as the host nation by
the 10,000 fans at the Azadi wrestling arena.
	   The return of the American athletes is important to the
Iranians, who see the visit as further proof of the potential for
improving relations with the United States.
	   Melvin Douglas and Stephen Marianetti are almost household names
in Iran, and the fans clapped in a frenzy when the stars' names
were called out.
	   ``Iran is top in wrestling. They are at home and, with the
turnout of fans, we will have a hard task ahead of us,'' said USA
Wrestling president Larry Sciacchetano.
	   ``We have to win at least one gold medal. It is very important
that our national anthem is played here,'' he added.
	   Douglas, Marianetti and Sam Henson all advanced to the next
round with victories Tuesday.
	   Douglas easily triumphed over Germany's Hiko Balz and Ralf
Scherrer of Switzerland in the 97 kilo (214 pound) class while
Marianetti, in the 76 kilo (168 pound) class, dropped one of two
matches.
	   Henson defeated Vasilie Zeiher of Germany in the first round and
Amirax Kartanov of Greece in the second round.
	   The Iranians did just as well, with Abbas Jadidi and Pejman
Dorostkar winning their matches and advancing to the next round.
	   Douglas looks almost certain to meet Jadidi in the 97 kilo (214
pound) class, and matches between other American and Iranian
wrestlers also appear likely.

Ethnic Albanians report fresh Serb attacks in western Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with police accusing KLA of mass
executions of Serb civilians, showing bodies, color, background,
trims
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police, on the attack in
western Kosovo, accused ethnic Albanian rebels Tuesday of mass
executions of Serb civilians and showed reporters bodies of some of
the alleged victims.
	   Police took international observers and reporters close to the
rebel stronghold of Glodjane, where they claimed some 40 Serb
civilians were executed. They said they knew of more similar
execution sites in the area.
	   Reporters saw seven decomposed bodies, one beheaded and another
missing limbs, lying on the ground under a heavy rain. Police said
the bodies were those of Serb civilians executed by the rebels.
	   Empty shell castings were shattered around. Four bodies lay in
dirty shallow water, three more on nearby grass. No more bodies
could be immediately seen _ despite pollice claims there were
others _ and no details on the victims were available.
	   Police have reported about 170 Serbs missing in Kosovo since
fighting started in early March. They claim the rebels kidnapped
them. Earlier this month, police showed charred remains of what
they said were burned bodies of Serb civilians in another Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians claimed two Albanians were killed
and 15 wounded, including two children, in the government sweep of
western Kosovo Tuesday.
	   The Albanian-controlled Kosovo Information Center said several
villages were under attack and accused government forces of burning
houses in some of them.
	   Reporters on the convoy to western Kosovo saw heavy police
presence in the area. Parts of Glodjane, known to be the KLA
stronghold, were ablaze and sounds of shelling could be heard.
	   Earlier in the day, residents who live in other village near the
border said at least 17 people were killed in two border villages
over the weekend. A middle-aged man showed reporters the
recently-dug graves of six men and one women in Jeskovo, 10
kilometers (6 miles) north of the border.
	   Residents said Serb police looted and burned houses in the
village. Reporters who visited the village Tuesday saw shattered
roofs and burned-out hulks that had been cars. Pieces of smashed
televisions and stereos littered the dirt road that had turned to
mud in a torrential downpour.
	   The latest fighting was reported one day after a top State
Department official met Milosevic to call for a cease-fire and
partial withdrawal of the police and army so that thousands of
displaced Kosovo Albanian civilians could return home.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said in Montenegro that Milosevic was responsible for the situation
in Kosovo and that war or peace in the province depended on him
alone. Shattuck pledged more U.S. effort to solve the crisis
peacefully.
	   But a KLA spokesman criticized U.S. envoys who have been trying
to hammer out an agreement for Kosovo. The KLA is fighting for
independence for the province from Serbia, the main part of
Yugoslavia.
	   Adem Demaci, the KLA's political representative, said U.S.
special envoy Christopher Hill and U.N. Ambassador-designate
Richard Holbrooke favored the Serbs. The United States opposes
independence for Kosovo, fearing it could destabilize the southern
Balkans.
	   ``I don't have complaints about the orientation of the American
foreign policy,'' Demaci said. ``But we are unhappy with American
envoys in Kosovo. Kosovo should have someone who ... (does) not not
favor (Serbian) force and its results.''
	   On Tuesday, the reliable Belgrade newspaper Glas Javnosti said
Milosevic has ordered the Serbian government to start drafting
election plans for Kosovo, an apparent sign that the Yugoslav
president was seeking a compromise.

Spain to send additional evidence for extradition of Basque

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government, seeking custody of a
suspected Basque militant held in Florida, has gathered more
documentation for a U.S. judge who stayed an extradition order for
lack of evidence, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The documents have been gathered by the National Court, which is
seeking extradition of Ramon Aldasoro, 41, over the killings of
Spanish General Miguel Azcarraga and two policemen in two bombings
committed in 1988 in the Basque country of northern Spain, the
state news agency Efe said.
	   In an order issued Aug. 28, U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King said the only evidence linking Aldasoro to the crimes
are statements by four men who allegedly were fellow members of the
Basque separatist movement ETA.
	   ETA is an armed group that has killed nearly 800 people over the
past 30 years in a drive for independence for the Basque country of
northern Spain.
	   King said all four men who implicated Aldasoro have stated they
did so only after being tortured or otherwise mistreated by Spanish
authorities. King gave the U.S. government 30 days to come up with
more evidence.
	   However, Spanish judicial officials say only one of those four _
Juan Carlos Arruti _ claimed torture, Efe said, quoting judicial
sources.
	   And Spanish authorities will pass on documents that attempt to
refute his version. They include a medical report which says
doctors examined Arruti at the police station where he fingered
Aldasoro and found no evidence of torture.
	   The documents will be passed on to King via the Spanish Embassy
in Washington, Efe quoted judicial sources as saying.
	   Aldasoro had been ordered extradited in June after a judge
rejected his claims that the Spanish government's charges of murder
and kidnapping against him were politically motivated.
	   Under the assumed name Gaspar Axpe, Aldasoro obtained a Florida
driver's license in April 1996 _ about the time he immigrated from
Mexico, according to state records. He had been living in the
middle-class suburb and working as an auto salesman.
	   Aldasoro was arrested last December by FBI agents on a tip by
the Spanish government. He was charged in the extradition complaint
with assault, murder, and robbery with intimidation in violation of
the Spanish penal code.

	   ``We hope that before it is too late, the Taliban will respond
positively to Iran's request to free the captive Iranian diplomats
and nationals,'' Kharrazi was quoted as saying.
	   He said he expected U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a

Norman, Faldo still believe they've got another run left in them
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ The two players who make up golf's
best rivalry of the decade were thousands of miles (kilometers)
apart, on different continents and under very different
circumstances.
	   Australian Greg Norman was at home in south Florida, hitting
balls for the first time since surgery on his left shoulder nearly
five months ago. Englishman Nick Faldo was in Switzerland, missing
the cut at a European tour event for the first time in four years.
	   Both are approaching the twilight of their peak years. Both
believe they have another major championship in them. How
appropriate if both could make their last stand at the same time.
	   Another chance for Faldo to join Harry Vardon, Bobby Jones, Gene
Sarazen, Sam Snead and Arnold Palmer with his seven professional
majors. Another chance for Norman to validate himself as one of
golf's greats by winning a third major to go along with 16 other
top-5 finishes in the majors and 72 victories around the world.
	   Only at this rate, one has to wonder if either of them will be
heard from again.
	   Norman has been a no-show since April because of his shoulder
injury, which stemmed from two dozen years of pounding balls. Faldo
has been a no-show all year because of his putting, which has put
pressure on the rest of his game.
	   ``It just gives me a knocking every time I get out there,'' said
the 41-year-old Faldo, who hasn't won since the 1997 Nissan Open at
Riviera and is facing his first winless season since 1986. ``I just
keep getting a kicking every day.''
	   Faldo is at an all-time low since building a swing to stand the
test of major championship golf. He slipped to No. 69 this week in
the world rankings, and is in jeopardy of missing the first World
Championship of Golf event in February, a match-play tournament
with a dlrs 5 million purse involving the top 64 players in the
world.
	   Norman, 43, is also at a career low on the world rankings _ down
one notch this week to No. 13, the result of playing just 19 1-2
competitive rounds. He says his rehabilitation went well and that
he's stronger than ever, but there's no telling how he will bounce
back from the experimental surgery.
	   And while Norman has bounced back from one crushing blow after
another, he concedes that golf won't dominate his life the way it
used to. He saw a couple of PGA Tour events on TV during his summer
off and yawned. They did little more than remind of the travel, the
pro-ams, the grind.
	   ``I don't want to go back to that same old mundane routine,'' he
said.
	   He'll make his return in November at the 10th anniversary of his
own Shark Shootout, then gear up for the Presidents Cup in his
native Australia and ease into the 1999 season.
	   ``I'm not going to hit balls every day until the third week of
the November,'' he said. ``Basically, I'll be practicing three
weeks, take a week off. It's not going to be the same old grinding
because that's when you get into bad habits. I'm going to change it
up and get ready to play.''
	   Faldo tried to change it up by going back to Europe. The Canon
European Masters was the first tournament to earn Ryder Cup points,
and Faldo wants to try to make the team without Mark James having
to consider him as a captain's choice.
	   He also wants to see his name on the leaderboard to gain some
measure of confidence. But as evidenced by him missing the cut, the
only place Faldo can expect to show up and scare people away is on
the Hooters Tour.
	   ``When I was doing my winning in Europe, there were five or six
names, maybe 10, who you were looking at,'' Faldo said before
missing the cut. ``Now, I'm sure it's closer to 20 guys, and you've
got to work hard and keep looking for ways to improve.''
	   Faldo has won three times as many majors as Norman, along with
two honors that Norman doesn't have _ a permanent locker in the
Augusta National clubhouse and a crystal image in the World Golf
Hall of Fame.
	   Norman will have to win the Masters to get the former, and he
may need to win at least one other major to get the latter.
	   ``I think there are still majors in me,'' Norman said earlier
this year. ``There is still a lot on my plate I would like to
achieve.''
	   The road back starts with every day on the range that he can
take a full swing with a longer club. He began with a 9-iron Friday
and hopes to be hitting driver in a couple of weeks. Unless the
shoulder doesn't recover like Norman believes it will, he will find
a way to get back to the top of his game.
	   And maybe he'll find Faldo waiting for him.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy resuming mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians believes some progress is
possible, but does not count on a deal being concluded during his
visit to the Middle East this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater
Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials met Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a memorandum of
understanding on security cooperation the three sides had worked
out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   The Palestinian negotiators told him if the United States wishes
to make amendments in the memorandum ``we will study them, but we
will not agree to the original document being canceled,'' a senior
Palestinian source told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier, Palestinian negotiators said they would not accept any
changes.

Peres calls for Palestinian state to avoid a ``new Bosnia''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
called on Tuesday for creation of a Palestinian state to avoid the
kind of strife that ravaged Bosnia.
	   ``We must have a Palestinian state,'' Peres told a press
conference in Madrid. ``It's better to build two states and be
friends than build one and become enemies for the rest of our
lives.''
	   Peres said an economically viable Palestinian state is the best
way to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Otherwise, one tragic alternative would ``a new Bosnia,'' he said.
	   Peres spoke after attending a ceremony setting up a so-called
Foundation for the Three Cultures (Muslim, Jewish and Christian) in
the southern city of Seville.
	   Peres stressed that ties between Israel and a future Palestinian
state could not be those of a rich country with a very poor one.
	   ``Israel needs a developed Palestinian state because otherwise
the economic differences will intensify the conflict,'' Peres said.
	   Peres was widely credited with engineering the Oslo peace
accords signed with the PLO in 1993, and shared the Nobel Peace
Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat a year later.
	   Peres became prime minister after Rabin was assassinated by a
rightwing Jewish extremist in November 1995. In elections held in
1996, Peres was defeated by Likud candidate Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In Seville, Peres represented Jews in the inauguration of a
foundation which will work closely with the Jerusalem-based Peres
Peace Center, which tries to arrange financing for Israeli-Arab
joint ventures.
	   The Spanish-based foundation will also try to advance the peace
process, said Peres.
	   Peres, in Spain for a three-day visit that began Monday, is to
meet with King Juan Carlos, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and
former prime minister Felipe Gonzalez.

Two policemen and two U.S. tourists injured in car crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Two policeman and two tourists from
the United States were seriously injured Tuesday when a police car
crashed into a minibus carrying 13 people, including 11 elderly
Americans.
	   Police said that the accident took place on a main road in
central Scotland near the town of Lochearnhead, 50 miles (80 kms)
northeast of Edinburgh, when the minibus and the police car
collided. The car, which was being driven by a trainee on an
advanced driver course, was also carrying two passengers.
	   The four seriously injured were airlifted 35 miles (55 kms)
south to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, the Scottish
Office said. The remaining 13 people suffered more minor injuries
and were taken to hospital in Stirling, 25 miles (40 kms) southeast
of Lochearnhead.
	   Geoffrey Williams, deputy head of Central Scotland Fire Brigade,
said that the minibus stopped on the edge of a ravine after the
accident.
	   ``It could have gone right over the edge and down into the
ravine, but fortunately it stopped only about four or five feet
(1.2 or 1.5 meters) from the edge,'' Williams said.
	   Police did not name the injured, and could not immediately say
where in the United States the tourists were from.

Saro-Wiwa's co-accused freed after four years in Nigerian jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Looking frail but jubilant, 19 ethnic
Ogoni political prisoners were released after four years behind
bars for murders leading to the execution of author Ken Saro-Wiwa
in 1995, witnesses said Tuesday.
	   The prisoners _ mostly in their late teens or 20's _ were freed
on Monday night after a court judge in Nigeria's oil-rich
southeastern city of Port Harcourt gave the order, local
journalists and other witnesses said.
	   Most had returned to their homes throughout southwestern Nigeria
by Tuesday afternoon, according to an ethnic Ogoni advocacy group
representing the prisoners. There were originally 20 accused, but
one youth died in custody.
	   Within 12 hours of the release, Pope John Paul II sent a message
of hope to Nigerian Catholics, praising moves towards democracy by
the country's new military ruler, who has freed scores of detainees
and pledged a return to civilian rule by the end of May. National
elections are scheduled for February 27.
	   There is ``a new air of optimism that can be discerned among
people of all classes and ages in Nigeria since the coming to power
of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,'' the pope said in a statement read
Monday by church officials at a conference of Nigerian Catholic
bishops in the southwestern city of Ibadan.
	   ``There is every indication that the prayer for Nigeria in
distress which for more than five years ascended to the throne of
God at every mass in this country has been powerfully answered,''
the statement added.
	   The pope visited Nigeria in late March, calling on Abacha to
free political detainees.
	   Britain praised the latest releases with Foreign Office Minister
Tony Lloyd hailing the move as a sign that Abubakar was serious
about human rights and the rule of law.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' Lloyd said in a statement. ``They
have endured 4 miserable years in detention in appalling
conditions. We have lobbied tirelessly for their release and for
that of all political prisoners in Nigeria.''
	   Lloyd called on Abubakar to withdraw troops stationed in
Ogoniland, the oil-rich southern area coveted by the tribe _ one of
250 ethnic groups in Africa's most populous country _ and prized by
government officials and foreign petroleum companies.
	   The prisoners had been held without trial since 1994 for the
murders of four traditional chiefs allied to the late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha, who died suddenly in June.
	   Saro-Wiwa, an award-winning playwright and author, and eight
others were put to death in November 1995 in connection with the
murders, sparking widespread international outrage and condemnation
of Nigeria's military rulers.
	   Under Saro-Wiwa's leadership, Ogoni activists had campaigned
against alleged pollution by Shell Oil in the oil-producing Niger
Delta. Violent disruptions of oil production by disgruntled
communities continue.
	   The inmates released Monday endured ``bestial'' prison
conditions during their four year incarceration, including
unsanitary cells, little food and poor medical care, said Bari-Ar
Kpalap, an Ogoni activist.
	   ``They competed for sleeping and sitting space with lice,
cockroaches, rats, snakes and mosquitoes,'' Kpalap said.
	   Family members were seldom allowed to visit, and when they did
they were forced to pay bribes to prison guards.
	   Although the international community has begun rebuilding
diplomatic ties with Nigeria, some activists remain wary of the
military regime's promises for democratic change. Abraham Adesanya,
chairman of the opposition National Democratic Coalition warned in
a newspaper interview Tuesday that leading exiles will not return
home until a sweeping security decree allowing people to be
arrested without charge is revoked.
	   Nigeria's last presidential elections, held in 1993, were
annulled by the military. Abacha imprisoned the apparent winner,
millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola, one year later.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Swollen rivers
churning with mud after nearly a week of heavy rains swept away
houses, bridges and huge trees in southern Mexico on Tuesday. At
least seven and possibly as many as 18 were killed.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast. He said at least 5,000 people in more than
50 towns and villages were driven from their houses by rampaging
rivers and creeks.
	   Television footage showed muddy torrents, some more than 100
yards (meters) wide, ripping concrete slabs from houses, pulling
and twisting railroad bridges and dragging huge trees downstream.
Waters reached the tops of windows on tin-roofed houses.
	   Barefoot people in rain slickers hauled away suitcases,
mattresses and even stoves as the rain pelted them.
	   Albores Guillen put the death toll at seven, but the mayor of
one of the most affected areas, Pijijiapan, said rescuers had
pulled 18 bodies from the waters in his town alone.
	   ``The water is rising,'' Gilberto de los Santos Cruz said in a
telephone interview.
	   More than 10 bridges were destroyed and 57 villages were cut off
by washed-out roads, authorities said. Many villages also lost
electricity, water and sewage services.
	   Because of downed bridges, mudslides and fallen trees, the
coastal highway to Guatemala was cut off in four places, the
television network Televisa reported.
	   Police, soldiers and Red Cross workers were spreading out in the
area to help the thousands of affected people, Albores Guillen
said.
	   Seventy percent of the territory in Pijijiapan, a municipality
of 53,000 people 90 miles from the Guatemalan border, was flooded,
Mayor Cruz said.
	   Heavy rains in the central states of Michoacan, Sinaloa and
Nayarit also forced some families from their homes.

Spanish court orders former minister and aide to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that two
former government officials found guilty of kidnapping as part of a
so-called ``dirty war'' against Basque separatists must go to jail
while they appeal their convictions.
	   The court said it would notify the Interior Ministry Wednesday
for it to carry out the order immediately.
	   Ten other people, who pleaded guilty in the same case and have
requested pardons, can remain free for now, the court said.
	   The two high-profile defendants are former Interior Minister
Jose Luis Barrionuevo and ex-secretary of state for security Rafael
Vera. Both served under Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist who was prime
minister for nearly 14 years until 1996.
	   In July the court handed down 10-year sentences against
Barrionuevo and Vera after finding them guilty of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a businessman who was mistaken for a Basque
separatist hitman.
	   That abduction was the first act attributed to the so-called
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign to crush the armed
Basque separatist movement ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken
targets.
	   Lawyers for Barrionuevo and Vera had asked the Supreme Court to
let their clients remain free while the Constitutional Court
considers appeals they have filed against the convictions.
	   But after a lengthy meeting Tuesday on procedural aspects of the
sentences, the Supreme Court said the two must go to prison right
away.
	   Until now they had stayed out of prison by filing motions
seeking clarifications of the verdicts against them.

Ethnic Albanians report fresh Serb attacks in western Kosovo

executions of Serb civilians, showing bodies, color, background,

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces reportedly launched a
new offensive against separatists in western Kosovo on Tuesday, a
day after U.S. envoys failed to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the attacks.
	   Serb forces also accused ethnic Albanian rebels of mass
executions of Serb civilians and showed reporters the bodies of
some of the alleged victims.
	   For their part, ethnic Albanian villagers said at least 19
people were killed in the last few days and reported Serb troops
looting and burning homes in villages near the border with Albania.
	   Aid workers have warned of an increasing humanitarian disaster
in Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia, one of the two republics
that make up Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been killed and an estimated
230,00 villagers have been forced from their homes since Milosevic
launched a crackdown in February against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo.
	   Serb police on Tuesday took international observers and
reporters close to the Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold of
Glodjane, where they claimed about 40 Serb civilians were executed.
They claimed to know of other execution sites in the area, about 40
miles (60 kilometers) southwest of the Pristina, the provincial
capital.
	   Reporters saw seven decomposed bodies, included one that was
beheaded and another missing limbs, lying on the ground in a heavy
rain. Police said the bodies were those of Serb civilians executed
by the rebels, but no details on the victims were given.
	   Police say about 170 Serbs are missing in Kosovo since fighting
started and claim the rebels kidnapped them.
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Information Center, controlled by
separatist ethnic Albanians, said at least two people were killed
Tuesday in Prilep, one of several villages near the Albanian border
it said were under attack. The center said 15 people were wounded,
including two children.
	   Residents said at least 17 people were killed in Jeskovo and
another border village over the weekend. A middle-aged man showed
reporters the recently dug graves of six men and one woman.
	   Residents said Serb police looted and burned houses in the
village during the weekend after civilians fled. Some villagers
began returning home Tuesday.
	   On Monday, a top U.S. State Department official met with
Milosevic to call for a cease-fire and partial withdrawal of the
police and army so that thousands of civilians could return home.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said Milosevic was responsible for the situation in Kosovo and that
war or peace in the province depended on him alone. He and former
U.S. Sen. Bob Dole both said they were shocked by the destruction
and human rights abuses in Kosovo.
	   KLA political representative Adem Demaci criticized U.S. envoys
Christopher Hill and Richard Holbrooke, the U.N.
Ambassador-designate, who have been trying to hammer out an
agreement for Kosovo, saying they favor the Serbs.
	   The United States opposes independence for Kosovo, fearing it
could destabilize the southern Balkans.
	   At the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said he was prepared to intervene to negotiate an end to the
violence in Kosovo. The council was expected to begin discussions
on Kosovo later this week.

Brazil launches export-boosting program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Tuesday announced a program aimed at reducing the country's foreign
trade deficit by boosting exports.
	   The program, whose prime objective is to have exports total dlrs
100 billion by the year 2000, does not include a devaluation of
Brazil's currency, the real.
	   Analysts have said that an overvalued real is one of the chief
culprits for the trade deficits that Brazil has sustained for more
than three consecutive years.
	   Among other things, the program will diversify markets,
encourage small and medium-sized companies to export, and eliminate
red tape.
	   After posting foreign trade surpluses for 15 straight years,
Brazil registered its first deficit in 1995, the first year of the
Cardoso administration.
	   It's been downhill since.
	   In 1997, Brazil chalked up a deficit of dlrs 8.5 billion, while
over the first eight months of 1998 imports have surpassed exports
by dlrs 3.03 billion.

Britain promises more aid to Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Tuesday it will contribute 21 million
pounds (dlrs 34 million) in relief aid to Bangladesh after July
monsoon rains in the Asian country displaced or marooned at least
30 million people.
	   George Foulkes, junior minister at the Department of
International Development said that the money will go towards food
relief and agricultural rehabilitation projects.
	   ``The Government and people of Bangladesh have made enormous
efforts to deal with the crisis,'' Foulkes said. ``But 53 percent
of the country is under water,crops, livestock and homes have been
lost, and disease and malnutrition are on the increase.''
	   Britain, which was the former colonial power in Bangladesh,
already spends annually about 45 million pounds (dlrs 70 million)
in development programs in the country.

Sleep disorders may explain some youngsters' poor grades
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HERBERT G. McCANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Youngsters who do poorly in school may be
suffering from a severe sleep disorder, and surgery can help these
children bring home better grades, according to a study.
	   Sleep apnea _ and the poor academic performance it causes _ can
be cured by removing the tonsils and adenoids, Dr. David Gozal, a
professor of pediatrics at Tulane University, reported in the
September issue of the journal Pediatrics.
	   Apnea, the severest kind of snoring, is a condition in which
narrowed airways cause people to stop breathing briefly as they
sleep. This causes them to wake up, sometimes hundreds of times a
night, and often leaves them feeling tired the next day.
	   In children, signs of apnea include hyperactivity, a short
attention span and aggressive behavior, all major hindrances to
learning.
	   Tonsils can obstruct the airways, and Gozal said doctors have
long known of the connection between tonsils and children's
abilities. In 1889, for example, the British Medical Journal
published a study titled ``The Awkwardness and Stupidity of
Children With Large Tonsils.''
	   However, no good clinical studies had documented the connection,
said Gozal, who decided to investigate further when the parents of
children who underwent tonsillectomies reported improved grades.
	   Gozal questioned the parents of nearly 300 first-graders whose
school performance was in the bottom 10th of their class. He asked
whether their children snored and how loudly, and whether they
stopped breathing during sleep, had to be shaken awake or fell
asleep during school or while watching television. All are symptoms
of sleep apnea.
	   Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was found in 54 children, of
whom 24 had their tonsils and adenoids removed. Parents decided not
to have surgery on the remaining 30 children.
	   A year later, almost all the children who underwent surgery
improved their school performance an average of half a letter
grade. The grades of the children who weren't treated remained the
same.
	   ``The conclusion of the study is if you intervene and treat the
problem you should expect some improvement in the academic
performance of these kids,'' Gozal said.
	   An expert not associated with the study said the findings shed
light on an important issue. Dr. Carole Marcus, a professor of
pediatrics at John Hopkins University and medical director of its
Pediatrics Sleep Laboratory, said pediatricians and parents should
pay more attention to the possibility of sleep apnea.
	   While all children snore, parents should be concerned if their
child snores every night with occasional gasping or choking noises,
she said. Severe cases of sleep apnea can stunt growth, lead to
heart failure, cause seizures and result in mental retardation.
	   Snoring alone, however, does not mean a child's tonsils should
be removed, she said.
	   Gozal said a thorough study is needed before parents decide on
surgery.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ American wrestlers were greeted by cheers
from Iranian fans and responded with a string of victories on
Tuesday, the first day of the World Wrestling Championships.
	   The Americans, on their second visit to Iran in seven months,
were greeted with almost as much enthusiasm as the host nation by
the 10,000 fans at the Azadi wrestling arena.
	   The return of the American athletes is important to the
Iranians, who see the visit as further proof of the potential for
improving relations with the United States.
	   Melvin Douglas and Stephen Marianetti are almost household names
in Iran, and the fans clapped in a frenzy when the stars' names
were called out.
	   ``Iran is top in wrestling. They are at home and, with the
turnout of fans, we will have a hard task ahead of us,'' said Larry
Sciacchetano, the past president of USA Wrestling.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces reportedly launched a
new offensive against separatists in western Kosovo on Tuesday, a
day after U.S. envoys failed to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to halt the attacks.
	   Serb forces also accused ethnic Albanian rebels of mass
executions of Serb civilians and showed reporters the bodies of
some of the alleged victims.
	   For their part, ethnic Albanian villagers said at least 19
people were killed in the last few days and reported Serb troops
looting and burning homes in villages near the border with Albania.
	   Aid workers have warned of an increasing humanitarian disaster
in Kosovo, a southern province in Serbia, one of the two republics
that make up Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been killed and an estimated
230,000 villagers have been forced from their homes since Milosevic
launched a crackdown in February against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Elvis Stojko, saying he wants to take his skating
to a higher level, is sticking around to try for a fourth world
championship.
	   In announcing Tuesday he will continue as an Olympic-eligible
skater, Stojko indicated he will begin his season at Skate America
in Detroit in October.
	   Stojko, a three-time world champion, has not competed since
winning a second Olympic silver medal in Nagano in February. He
finished second despite a painful groin injury that forced him to
skip the 1998 world championships.
	   The 25-year-old Stojko said he has recovered sufficiently to be
able to do all his difficult jumps at his training base in Barrie,
Ontario.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican police have found five bodies
half-buried near the U.S. border, all with bullet wounds to the
forehead. Authorities said they suspected the killings were
drug-related and that the victims were forced to dig their own
graves.
	   The discoveries near Piedras Negras, just across the border from
Eagle Pass, Texas, was reported Tuesday by Mexican news media.
	   According to the newspaper La Jornada, a peasant stumbled across
the graves and called police. Local, state and federal officers
responded, as did soldiers, La Jornada said. They found casings
from .380, .12 and .45-caliber weapons, as well as from Kalashnikov
rifles.
	   Police said they were investigating whether the victims had drug
ties and said there could be other bodies buried nearby.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Officials at Argentina's Foreign
Ministry and members of the armed forces exchanged accusations on
Tuesday over suspicious arms shipments which wound up in Ecuador
and Croatia.
	   Argentine Foreign Minister Guido DiTella confirmed he had
received a 1995 report from the Argentine ambassador in Peru of a
possible arms sale, according to reports in the La Nacion
newspaper. DiTella said at the time he referred the issue to the
Army.
	   Army officials have denied direct involvement in the arms
shipments and said Monday the sale couldn't have taken place
without knowledge of someone at the foreign ministry.
	   A federal judge is investigating whether government officials
authorized a 1991 weapons shipment to Panama, later diverted to
Croatia in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. The shipment included
some 6,500 tons of cannons, machine guns, rifles and ammunition.
	   Also under investigation is a 75-ton arms shipment to Ecuador
during its 1995 border war with Peru. Argentina was one of the
countries helping to negotiate a peace settlement to the war.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Forty military officers and 15 civilian
employees have been withdrawn from police duties at Mexico City
international airport after investigators uncovered corruption
among their ranks, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Nine other officers _ who had been placed on leave from the
military while serving at the airport _ are also under arrest on
suspicion of helping smuggle drugs and illegal immigrants into the
country.
	   El Universal said all 64 were replaced earlier this week by
young graduates from a federal judicial police academy. Thirty
other military officers on duty there are to stay on their jobs.
	   All belong to the anti-drug and racketeering unit of the
attorney general's federal judicial police.

Potvin expects Leafs to trade him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Felix Potvin will report to the Maple Leafs
training camp Saturday, even though he expects to be traded.
	   The goaltender, on the trading block since Toronto signed free
agent Curtis Joseph to a four-year, dlrs 24 million deal earlier
this summer, ended speculation he would hold out if a deal was not
reached before the Maple Leafs underwent medical exams.
	   ``I think that by coming to camp it gives me a chance to get
ready and be at my best if a trade does happen,'' Potvin said from
Montreal. ``I just want to go to camp, get ready like everyone else
and do what I've always done.''
	   Potvin met with his agent Jay Fee over the weekend and the
goaltender said both of them believed joining the team at Hamilton
was the best move. The 27-year-old goalie has been working out in
Montreal with two relatives and three junior players.
	   Potvin said his presence might put pressure on Toronto to
expedite a trade.
	   ``I don't know if it will. I hope it does something,'' he said.
``As far as I'm concerned, the sooner something gets done, the
better.''

Feyenoord plunders five goals, PSV struggles to win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord Rotterdam heads the
Dutch premiership after three straight victories, the latest a 5-0
win over De Graafschap Doetinchem Tuesday.
	   In stark contrast, Champions League contender PSV Eindhoven had
to dig deep to earn its first win of the season, owing its 4-3
triumph over RKC Waalwijk to a late Gilles de Bilde penalty.
	   Tuesday saw a goal bonanza in the Dutch top flight, with 16
strikes in the three games played. In the third game SC Heerenveen
drew 2-2 with Willem II Tilburg.
	   Striker Peter van Vossen, fresh back in the Netherlands after
three years in Scotland with Glasgow Rangers, was Feyenoord's
inspiration and opened the scoring after 27 minutes.
	   A defense-obsessed De Graafschap kept things quiet until Pole
Tomasz Rzasa's misdirected backpass beat keeper Ron Olyslager on 69
minutes to make it 2-0.
	   Feyenoord switched into overdrive. Patrick Paauwe scored his
first goal for the club and Van Vossen fell theatrically for a
penalty, converted by Jean-Paul van Gastel to make it 4-0.
	   Robin Nelisse snatched the fifth in injury time to hand
Feyenoord a rather flattering win.
	   Before PSV could blink, it was two goals down. The Eindhoven
defense was laid wide open with decisive strikes from RKC's Russian
striker Juri Petrov and Belgian midfielder Garry de Graef.
	   But it struck back immediately through a Dmitri Khokhlov header,
and De Bilde seized on a defensive error to tie the game up at 2-2.
Then a Ruud van Nistelrooy free kick put PSV 3-2 up at the half.
	   Richard Beekink equalized for RKC, but PSV pressure finally
produced a penalty 10 minutes from time, which De Bilde coolly
converted to give a relieved PSV its first win.

Leeds goes to the top of Premier League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leeds United moved to the top of the Premier
League table for the first time since 1995 with a 3-0 win over
bottom-placed Southampton at Elland Road on Monday.
	   Leeds, with two wins and two ties, has a slender one point
buffer over Liverpool and Aston Villa at the top of the table,
although both the Reds and Villa have games in hand to be played
Wednesday.
	   Leeds had a 1-0 advantage at halftime courtesy of an own-goal by
Southampton defender Scott Marshall in the 38th minute, after
striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's curling long-range shot
ricocheted off Marshall's back and into goal.
	   Ian Harte increased the margin to two with a penalty in the
opening minutes of the second half and Leeds clinched the game when
Clyde Wijnhard drove a rebound from a Harte cross into the top of
the net with four minutes remaining.
	   At the City Ground, Duncan Ferguson scored Everton's
long-awaited first goal of the season and then backed-up ten
minutes later to score its second as the Blues beat Nottingham
Forest 2-0.
	   Everton had not scored a goal in its first three games this
season, stretching the drought back to the last game of last
season, and was languishing in second-last place on the table, just
ahead of Southampton.
	   But Ferguson, who has been linked with a move to Middlesbrough,
struck twice late in the second half to temporarily lift morale at
the Liverpool-based club.
	   The 26-year-old Scottish international broke the 0-0 deadlock in
the 73rd minute and then extended the margin to two in the 83rd
minute.
	   Everton moved from 19th place to 12th with one win, a loss and
two ties, but could lose ground Wednesday to teams with a game in
hand.
	   In Scottish League Cup matches, Premier Division side Kilmarnock
bowed out in its quarterfinal match to first division Airdrie when
Marvyn Wilson scored in the 24th minute of extra-time.
	   In other matches, Glasgow Rangers beat Ayr 2-0 and St. Johnstone
beat Hibernian 4-0.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy resuming mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians believes some progress is
possible, but does not count on a deal being concluded during his
visit to the Middle East this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater
Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials met Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a memorandum of
understanding on security cooperation the three sides had worked
out in December.

Peres calls for Palestinian state to avoid a ``new Bosnia''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
called Tuesday for creation of a Palestinian state to avoid the
kind of strife that ravaged Bosnia.
	   Peres was widely credited with engineering the Oslo peace
accords signed with the PLO in 1993, and shared the Nobel Peace
Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat a year later.
	   ``We must have a Palestinian state,'' Peres told a press
conference in Madrid. ``It's better to build two states and be
friends than build one and become enemies for the rest of our
lives.''
	   Peres said an economically viable Palestinian state is the best
way to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Otherwise, one tragic alternative would ``a new Bosnia,'' he said.
	   Peres spoke after attending a ceremony setting up a so-called
Foundation for the Three Cultures (Muslim, Jewish and Christian) in
the southern city of Seville.
	   Peres stressed that ties between Israel and a future Palestinian
state could not be those of a rich country with a very poor one.
	   ``Israel needs a developed Palestinian state because otherwise
the economic differences will intensify the conflict,'' Peres said.
	   Peres became prime minister after Rabin was assassinated by a
right-wing Jewish extremist in November 1995. In elections held in
1996, Peres was defeated by Likud candidate Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   In Seville, Peres represented Jews in the inauguration of a
foundation that will work closely with the Jerusalem-based Peres
Peace Center, which tries to arrange financing for Israeli-Arab
joint ventures.
	   The Spanish-based foundation will also try to advance the peace
process, said Peres.
	   Peres, in Spain for a three-day visit that began Monday, is to
meet with King Juan Carlos, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and
former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy resuming mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians believes some progress is
possible, but does not count on a deal being concluded during his
visit to the Middle East this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater
Palestinian effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials met Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a memorandum of
understanding on security cooperation the three sides had worked
out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian

U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.

Spanish court sends former minister, aide to prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on other defendants, background &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that two
former government officials found guilty of kidnapping as part of a
so-called ``dirty war'' against Basque separatists must go to jail
while they appeal their convictions.
	   The court said it would notify the Interior Ministry Wednesday
for it to carry out the order immediately.
	   Ten other people, who pleaded guilty in the same case and have
requested pardons, can remain free for now, an 11-member court
panel said in a unanimous ruling.
	   The two high-profile defendants are former Interior Minister
Jose Luis Barrionuevo and ex-secretary of state for security Rafael
Vera. Both served under Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist who was prime
minister for nearly 14 years until 1996.
	   In July the court handed down 10-year sentences against
Barrionuevo and Vera after finding them guilty of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a businessman who was mistaken for a Basque
separatist hitman. The man was held for 10 days before being
released.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the so-called
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign designed to crush
the armed Basque separatist movement ETA.
	   Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   Lawyers for Barrionuevo and Vera had asked the Supreme Court to
let their clients remain free while the Constitutional Court
considers appeals they have filed against the convictions.
	   But after a lengthy meeting Tuesday on procedural aspects of the
sentences, the Supreme Court said the two must go to prison right
away.
	   Until now they had stayed out of prison by filing motions
seeking clarifications of the verdicts against them.
	   In the trial, the other ten defendants _ policemen, politicians
and security officials _ received sentences ranging from two years
and four months to 10 years.
	   They all pleaded guilty, some of them testifying that took part
in the kidnapping on orders from Barrionuevo and Vera. One said he
talked to Gonzalez about the GAL.
	   The Supreme Court said it would consult with prosecutors on
whether these 10 should go to prison while the Constitutional Court
considers their pardon requests but for the time being they could
remain free.
	   Gonzalez has denied allegations that it was he who ordered the
creation of the GAL death squads, and the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 that there was insufficient evidence to try him in the
kidnapping case.
	   But the convictions against two senior security officials in his
government have been seen here and abroad as a stinging indictment
against Spain's best-known politician, a key figure in its
transition from decades of rightwing dictatorship to membership in
the club of Europe's elite.
	   The GAL scandal helped bring down the Gonzalez government in
1996 elections after nearly 14 years in power.
	   Critics say that if Gonzalez knew nothing about the death squads
while they were active, as he has stated, then at the very least he
is guilty of incompetence.

Bobic carries Stuttgart to rout of Kaiserslautern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former German national team player Fredi Bobic's
successful return from injury Tuesday lifted VfB Stuttgart to a 4-0
home rout of defending champion FC Kaiserslautern in the
Bundesliga.
	   Bobic, also embroiled in a fued with management over his
criticism that the UEFA Cup team had not strengthened itself this
year, ignited Stuttgart with a fifth minute header in his first
season start.
	   The hard shot was parried, but it kicked off a flurry of chances
for Bobic and a dominant Stuttgart, which handed Kaiserslautern its
first season loss.
	   The 28-year-striker's well-struck roller into the long corner in
the 71st minute put Stuttgart up 2-0, while Yugoslav teammate Sreto
Risti scored the team's first and third goals in the 32nd and 79th.
	   Bulgarian international Krassimir Balakov converted a penalty
four minutes before the whistle as Stuttgart moved to the head of
the table in front of 44,000.
	   ``The spectators can finally see that we're on the move,'' said
Winfried Schaeffer, the side's new coach fighting to win favor with
Stuttgart fans.
	   Kaiserslautern had won a dramatic title last season, making
Bundesliga history as the first promoted team to accomplish the
feat.
	   But the Otto Rehhagel-led team held first during the entire
campaign, never lost on a foreign field and hadn't been beaten this
badly since regaining the Bundesliga.
	   Bobic has been one of Germany's top forwards for years, but his
national team career has been blocked by untimely injuries and the
likes of Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff and Ulf Kirsten.
	   Moenchengladbach salvaged a 1-1 draw against Eintracht
Frankfurt, still looking for its first win, as Swedish striker
Jorgen Pettersson equalized in the last minute.
	   But Chen Yang became the first Chinese player to score in the
Bundesliga, lifting Frankfurt to a 1-0 69th minute lead by blasting
a 25 meter (25-yard) shot into the corner of the net.
	   MSV Duisburg, another UEFA Cup team, turned in a weak 1-1 home
performance against 1860 Munich.
	   After Markus Beierle put the team ahead in the eighth minute,
Bernhard Winkler's third season goal evened the match in the 56th
and capped a strong Munich spurt.
	   VfL Bochum also picked up its first season win, a 2-0 win that
dropped Werder Bremen to the bottom of the table. In a matchup
between lower echelon clubs, Wolfsburg played 1-1 against Freiburg.

Feyenoord scores five goals, PSV struggles to win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord Rotterdam heads the
Dutch premier division after three straight victories, the latest a
5-0 victory over De Graafschap Doetinchem Tuesday.
	   By contrast, Champions League contender PSV Eindhoven had to dig
deep to earn its first victory of the season, defeating RKC
Waalwijk 4-3 on a late Gilles de Bilde penalty.
	   In the third game, SC Heerenveen drew 2-2 with Willem II
Tilburg.
	   Striker Peter van Vossen, fresh back in the Netherlands after
three years with Scotland's Glasgow Rangers, was Feyenoord's
inspiration and opened the scoring after 27 minutes.
	   A defense-obsessed De Graafschap kept things quiet until Pole
Tomasz Rzasa's misdirected backpass beat keeper Ron Olyslager at 69
minutes to make it 2-0.
	   Feyenoord then switched into overdrive. Patrick Paauwe scored
his first goal for the club and Van Vossen fell theatrically for a
penalty, converted by Jean-Paul van Gastel to make it 4-0.
	   Robin Nelisse snatched the fifth in injury time.
	   In the PSV-RKC game, Waalwijk opened the scoring with two quick
goals by Russian striker Juri Petrov and Belgian midfielder Garry
de Graef.
	   But Eindhoven struck back with a Dmitri Khokhlov header, and de
Bilde seized on a defensive error to tie the game. Then Ruud van
Nistelrooy's free kick put PSV up 3-2 at the half.
	   Richard Beekink equalized for RKC, but PSV pressure finally
produced a penalty 10 minutes from time, which De Bilde converted
to give PSV the victory.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The managing board of Manchester United has agreed
to sell the club, one of the biggest names in the soccer world, for
625 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion) to a satellite TV station owned
by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The Times, which is also owned by Murdoch, said that the deal
between the club and BSkyB was the most lucrative acquisition of a
sports club in the world, and would be formally announced later
Wednesday at the London Stock Exchange.
	   The Times said that a final price for the club was agreed
Tuesday afternoon when the price offered for it rose from 230 pence
(dlrs 3.70) per share to 240 pence (dlrs 3.85), valuing it at 50
million pounds (dlrs 80 million) more than expected.
	   Manchester United's chief executive, Martin Edwards, owns a 14
percent stake in the club and stands to earn 85 million pounds
(dlrs 135 million) from the BSkyB acquisition, the newspaper said.
	   BSkyB confirmed Monday that it was negotiating to buy the club.
Neither party was immediately confirmed the reported sale.

Ross believes progress in Israeli-Palestinian talks possible
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES top 10 grafs with expansion of settlement, security
talks. Minor edits. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A U.S. envoy mediating between Israel
and the Palestinians believes progress is possible, but doubts a
deal will be concluded during his visit to the Middle East this
week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region on Wednesday
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank, to be met by a greater Palestinian
effort to fight Islamic militants.
	   Ahead of Ross' visit, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials met Tuesday evening in Tel Aviv to review a memorandum of
understanding on security cooperation the three sides had worked
out in December.
	   The memorandum is to serve as a blueprint for a Palestinian
campaign against militants and stipulates, among other things, that
U.S. officials monitor the release of security prisoners from
Palestinian jails. Israel has complained that the Palestinian
Authority has adopted a revolving-door policy regarding militants.
	   The December agreement was not implemented because Netanyahu
refused to approve it. The Israeli leader said at the time it was
not detailed enough to be effective.
	   The Maariv daily said Tuesday that the CIA station chief in Tel
Aviv has in recent months introduced new formulations in the
December document that were to be discussed in Tuesday's three-way
meeting.
	   The Palestinian negotiators told him if the United States wishes
to make amendments in the memorandum ``we will study them, but we
will not agree to the original document being canceled,'' a senior
Palestinian source told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier, Palestinian negotiators said they would not accept any
changes.
	   Ground-leveling began Tuesday for construction of a new
neighborhood at the West Bank Jewish settlement of Bet-El, Israel
radio and Army radio reported. The neighborhood is to be named
after two settlers, a mother and son, who were killed by
Palestinian guerrillas.
	   The Palestinians regard expansion of Jewish settlements as a
violation of the Oslo accords. The United States has also
criticized settlement building as an obstacle to the peace process.
	   The second issue for Ross will be the scope of an Israeli
pullback. After initially refusing to hand over 13 percent, Israel
accepted the U.S. demand, but said it wanted 3 percent of the land
set aside as a nature reserve, with Israel retaining full security
control and Palestinian land use restricted.
	   Netanyahu has said the Palestinians agreed to the proposal in
principle, only to backtrack later on. Arafat has said no agreement
was reached and that gaps remained wide.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said Tuesday the
Palestinians would not agree to changes in the U.S. initiative.
``We are waiting to see some U.S. pressure on the Israeli
government to accept this initiative,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   Netanyahu reportedly suspects that Arafat was prodded by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to withdraw concessions he had
already made to Israel.
	   Netanyahu was to send two senior aides, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and political adviser Uzi Arad, to Cairo on Wednesday to try
and soften Mubarak's position, the prime minister's office said.
	   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
conflicting Israeli and Palestinian assessments on whether progress
had been made were part of an attempt to stake out positions ahead
of Ross' arrival.
	   Ross, a veteran of several exhausting and unsuccessful Mideast
shuttles, would not have agreed to return to the region if he did
not believe progress was possible, the official said.
	   However, this does not mean an agreement on the scope of
withdrawal and security cooperation can be reached at the end of
this trip, the official said.

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ The separatist premier of the province of Quebec
said Tuesday he'll refuse on principle to meet with the head of la
Francophonie because the Canadian government has assumed total
control of the event.
	   Lucien Bouchard said he had hoped to meet with Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, secretary general of the French-speaking equivalent
of the Commonwealth, in Quebec City on Thursday _ but he angry that
the federal government is organizing all aspects the visit.
	   Thee premier said meeting Boutros-Ghali under such circumstances
would be ``embarrassing.''
	   ``I will not be part of it,'' he said. ``I can't.''
	   Bouchard said it has been tradition for Quebec to organize all
aspects of dignitaries' visits from member countries of la
Francophonie since 1970
	   ``I'm very sorry because it's very embarrassing, embarrassing
for our visitors, embarrassing for the (provincial) government,
embarrassing for the people of Quebec,'' Bouchard told a news
conference.
	   Boutros-Ghali, former secretary-general of the United Nations,
starts a 10-day visit to Canada Tuesday to organize next year's
francophone summit in Moncton, New Brunswick,
	   Bouchard said when he attended last year's francophone summit in
Hanoi, Vietnam he personally invited Boutros-Ghali to Quebec.
	   ``I will not see Mr. Boutros-Ghali, he knows why, it's not
personal of course,'' he said.
	   Bouchard heads the Parti Quebecois, which advocates secession of
the Francophone-majority province from Canada.

Signs of heat damage found on pieces from Flight 111 cockpit

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Investigators have detected signs of
heat damage on fragments of Swissair Flight 111's cockpit, evidence
that could help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots
before the jetliner crashed.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said Tuesday that
signs of heat stress have been found so far only on wreckage from
the cockpit, not from the passenger cabin.
	   ``There are some signs of heating on some of the small pieces of
the wreckage retrieved,'' Gerden said. ``The limited amount of
wreckage retrieved to date indicates this area of heat stress is in
the cockpit.''
	   He refused to speculate on the extent of the damage or the exact
cause of it.
	   Gerden also expressed hopes of gaining valuable data from the
plane's recovered flight-data recorder, even though it stopped
working during the final six minutes before the plane crashed into
the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on
board.
	   Flight 111 crashed more than an hour after taking off from New
York, bound for Geneva.
	   ``The most crucial area is not the last six minutes, as some may
think, but prior to those six minutes,'' Gerden said.
	   The recorder, retrieved by divers 190 feet (58 meters)
underwater, might show how systems aboard the plane failed between
the pilots' initial distress call 16 minutes before the crash and
when the machine shut off, he said.
	   Investigators hope to get further information from the plane's
cockpit-voice recorder, which is still on the sea bottom. A signal
from that recorder has been detected, but bad weather Tuesday
forced a one-day halt in diving operations.
	   The divers were expected to return to work Wednesday, supported
by a new arrival from the United States _ the Navy salvage and
rescue ship USS Grapple.
	   The Grapple helped with the undersea recovery of wreckage of TWA
Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996. It has a team of more than 30
divers on board, as well as equipment for lifting large wreckage
from the seabed.
	   Divers are trying to confirm if three large pieces of wreckage
found near the flight data recorder are sections of the plane's
fuselage.
	   Also on hand is a 16-member U.S. Navy team, which has brought
advanced sonar and imaging equipment to provide greater detail of
the ocean floor.
	   Gerden, a senior investigator with Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, also released a more complete version of the last
conversation between the Swissair pilots and an air traffic control
tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   Expanding on excerpts released earlier, the transcript showed
that the pilots reported putting their oxygen masks on and later
telling the controllers they would have to fly the plane manually
instead of by autopilot.
	   Gerden reiterated that he saw nothing in the conversation to
suggest unwise decisions or unprofessional conduct.
	   ``The crew conversation was done in a professional manner
throughout.'' he said, stressing that it would be premature to pass
judgment until after all evidence was examined, including the
cockpit voice recorder.
	   Some lawyers and relatives of victims have suggested that the
Swissair pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have made a direct, though
possibly risky, descent to the Halifax airport after reporting
smoke, instead of making turns in order to lose altitude and dump
fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair's chief pilot-designate, Rainer
Hiltebrand, rejected those suggestions as irresponsible.
	   Memorial services were planned later this week in Halifax and at
U.N. headquarters in New York for victims of the crash. Among those
attending the ceremony in Halifax will be Swiss President Flavio
Cotti. Several U.N. workers died in the crash.

were turned away from government hospitals when more than 10,000
doctors held a one-day strike Tuesday in the Dominican Republic.
	   Doctors in 49 hospitals are demanding raises from about dlrs 600
(10,000 pesos) per month to between dlrs 1,200 and dlrs 1,950
(20,000 to 30,000 pesos). They also want improvements to the
country's aging medical facilities.
	   Physicians only treated emergency cases, intensive care patients
and women in labor.
	   The Dominican Medical Association, to which most of the
country's physicians belong, held a similar work stoppage in 1997.
	   In early 1996, doctors struck for almost four months. Thousands
were fired, but most were hired back when the strike ended in April
1996.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said
Tuesday he will leave his post at the end of the week with one
major frustration: that the United States has failed to pay an
estimated dlrs 1.3 billion in dues to the United Nations.
	   In an hourlong chat with journalists at the U.S. mission,
Richardson said America's position in the Security Council and its
foreign policy initiatives were in jeopardy because of the debt.
	   But he insisted that Washington's objectives regarding weapons
inspections in Iraq were unchanged. His remarks countered recent
allegations that Washington had backed off its stated goal of
disarming Iraq in favor of merely maintaining sanctions against the
country.
	   Richardson pledged that the United States would take ``a more
aggressive posture'' against Baghdad if, among other things, U.N.
inspectors weren't allowed to visit suspected weapons sites. He
didn't elaborate.
	   Richardson was sworn in last month as Energy Secretary and has
since been trying to do both jobs in the past several weeks. He
will officially resign Friday.
	   He is expected to be replaced at the United Nations by Richard
C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton peace accords that ended
the Bosnian war. Confirmation hearings for Holbrooke haven't taken
place yet, however.
	   As energy secretary, Richardson plans to visit the Persian Gulf
later this year, stopping in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC states to
discuss nuclear-related issues.
	   He also plans to visit Israel, which is widely believed to have
several hundred nuclear weapons, but has never admitted to having
the bomb.
	   ``The idea is to curb countries' use of plutonium and uranium,''
he said.
	   Richardson's year-and-a-half tenure in New York has been clouded
by Congress' failure to pay what the United Nations estimates to be
dlrs 1.3 billion in dues _ a failure that threatens Washington's
vote in the General Assembly later this year.
	   Republican congressional leaders have in the past linked
abortion restrictions to money that has been proposed to pay the
arrears. U.S. President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto any
legislation with such restrictions.
	   ``I think it'll be a tremendous loss of prestige if the United
States lost its vote at the General Assembly because of
nonpayment,'' Richardson said. ``I think it would be a tragedy and
a public relations disaster.''
	   The United States' role in the Security Council, where it holds
veto power, wouldn't be directly affected. But Richardson said the
loss of leverage already was being felt.
	   ``It hurts me when I go into the Security Council to argue for a
strong Iraq policy,'' he said.
	   During his tenure as U.N. ambassador, Richardson _ a former
Democratic congressman from New Mexico _ traveled widely, visiting
Bosnia, Kazakstan, Congo and Afghanistan.
	   ``I think it's the best job in government, certainly in the U.S.
government,'' Richardson said.
	   Though it's a cabinet-level position, ``You're not in
Washington. You're involved in diplomacy, you're dealing with a lot
of very interesting and important issues.''
	   ``I leave this job with regret,'' he said.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A tanker truck flipped and exploded
Tuesday on a Brazilian highway, igniting two charter buses
returning from a religious festival, firefighters said. A total of
53 people burned to death at the site and dozens more were injured.
	   The accident happened just before 3 a.m. (0600 GMT) on the
Anhanguera Highway near Araras, about 110 miles (180 kilometers)
northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   Earlier in the day, the Araras fire department placed the death
toll at 57, but lowered it after receiving the final figure from
the city's morgue.
	   ``The tanker truck lost control and flipped,'' Wilson Lima of
the Araras fire department said by telephone. He said a liquor
truck rammed the tanker and the fuel it was carrying spilled on to
the highway.
	   The tanker was carrying 26,000 liters (6,750 gallons) of diesel
and 6,000 liters (1,550 gallons) of gasoline in its six
compartments, the fire department said.
	   The two buses drove by and were in the pool of flammable liquid
when it burst into flame, Lima said.
	   ``It was incredible bad luck,'' he said. ``They just happened to
be right on top when it exploded. The victims were carbonized.''
	   The four vehicles were reduced to a heap of twisted and charred
metal.
	   TV footage showed a long stretch of the highway's median strip
charred black, and a row of wooden coffins on the roadside.
	   The coffins were taken to the Araras morgue, where they filled
two rooms, and from there to better equipped facilities in the city
of Campinas, where a team of foresnsic experts and dentists will
try to identify the remains.
	   Many passengers escaped with minor injuries. Lima said 39 people
were hospitalized in Araras and Leme, but most were released.
	   He said the death toll could rise ``if some of the more
seriously injured die.'' He did not know how many were in serious
condition.
	   The buses were heading to the midwestern city of Anapolis with
pilgrims returning from Aparecida do Norte, a town 110 miles (175
kilometers) east of Sao Paulo that houses the basilica of Our Lady
Revealed, Brazil's patron saint.
	   Some 50,000 people attended a mass and protest rally in
Aparecida do Norte on Monday, Brazil's independence day. The rally
was part of a nationwide protest to call attention to poverty and
unemployment.

Signs of heat damage found on pieces from Flight 111 cockpit

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Investigators have detected signs of
heat damage on fragments of Swissair Flight 111's cockpit, evidence
that could help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots
before the jetliner crashed.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said Tuesday that
signs of heat stress have been found so far only on wreckage from
the cockpit, not from the passenger cabin.
	   ``There are some signs of heating on some of the small pieces of
the wreckage retrieved,'' Gerden said. ``The limited amount of
wreckage retrieved to date indicates this area of heat stress is in
the cockpit.''
	   He refused to speculate on the extent of the damage or the exact
cause of it.
	   Gerden also expressed hopes of gaining valuable data from the
plane's recovered flight-data recorder, even though it stopped
working during the final six minutes before the plane crashed into
the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on
board.
	   Flight 111 crashed more than an hour after taking off from New
York, bound for Geneva.
	   ``The most crucial area is not the last six minutes, as some may
think, but prior to those six minutes,'' Gerden said.
	   The recorder, retrieved by divers 190 feet (58 meters)
underwater, might show how systems aboard the plane failed between
the pilots' initial distress call 16 minutes before the crash and
when the machine shut off, he said.
	   Investigators hope to get further information from the plane's
cockpit-voice recorder, which is still on the sea bottom. A signal
from that recorder has been detected, but bad weather Tuesday
forced a one-day halt in diving operations.
	   The divers were expected to return to work Wednesday, supported
by a new arrival from the United States _ the Navy salvage and
rescue ship USS Grapple.
	   The Grapple helped with the undersea recovery of wreckage of TWA
Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996. It has a team of more than 30
divers on board, as well as equipment for lifting large wreckage
from the seabed.
	   Divers are trying to confirm if three large pieces of wreckage
found near the flight data recorder are sections of the plane's
fuselage.
	   Also on hand is a 16-member U.S. Navy team, which has brought
advanced sonar and imaging equipment to provide greater detail of
the ocean floor.
	   Gerden, a senior investigator with Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, also released a more complete version of the last
conversation between the Swissair pilots and an air traffic control
tower in Moncton, New Brunswick.
	   Expanding on excerpts released earlier, the transcript showed
that the pilots reported putting their oxygen masks on and later
telling the controllers they would have to fly the plane manually
instead of by autopilot.
	   Gerden reiterated that he saw nothing in the conversation to
suggest unwise decisions or unprofessional conduct.
	   ``The crew conversation was done in a professional manner
throughout.'' he said, stressing that it would be premature to pass
judgment until after all evidence was examined, including the
cockpit voice recorder.
	   Some lawyers and relatives of victims have suggested that the
Swissair pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have made a direct, though
possibly risky, descent to the Halifax airport after reporting
smoke, instead of making turns in order to lose altitude and dump
fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair's chief pilot-designate, Rainer
Hiltebrand, rejected those suggestions as irresponsible.
	   Memorial services were planned later this week in Halifax and at
U.N. headquarters in New York for victims of the crash. Among those
attending the ceremony in Halifax will be Swiss President Flavio
Cotti. Several U.N. workers died in the crash.
	   One of the most difficult aspects of the crash aftermath is the
process of identifying human remains. Only one mostly intact body
has been found.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said at a
briefing Tuesday that his teams _ six days after the crash _ had
just completed only their second identification. He declined to
give further details until the family was notified.
	   Butt said the body fragments are so difficult to identify
visually that DNA technology will be the main avenue for
identification. Samples taken from the retrieved body parts are
being sent to police laboratories across Canada to extract DNA that
will be matched with DNA provided by parents or children of the
victims, he said.
	   Jeff Modler, a DNA specialist from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, said the pace of further body retrievals from the seabed
was important because DNA becomes more difficult to extract the
longer a corpse is underwater.

More Israeli-Turkish maneuvers planned, unnerving some neighbors

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Turkey and Israel will conduct joint
military maneuvers in November, the Turkish prime minister
confirmed Tuesday, prompting jitters among Israel's neighbors.
	   Syria, Iran and Iraq have all expressed concern about Turkey's
cooperation with Israel, and Syrian state-run newspapers said the
two countries' military ties were increasing regional tensions.
	   Asked about that, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said
anyone talking about hostility in the region ``should focus on the
policies of the Syrian government (encouraging) separatist
terrorism in the region.''
	   Yilmaz did not elaborate, but in the past, Turkey has accused
Syria, as well as Iraq, Greece and Armenia, of supporting Kurdish
separatists in the country.
	   In Damascus, the Syrian government daily Tishrin urged Turkey in
an editorial Tuesday to improve its relations with the Arabs and
with fellow Muslim states instead of ``throwing itself into
Israel's arms (which) would bring it nothing but troubles.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month he
believed the growing Israeli-Turkish military ties could serve as
the ``axis'' of a future regional defense structure.
	   Turkey, however, has said it did not believe a regional defense
structure could be set up before Israel has negotiated peace
agreements with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   The Israeli daily Maariv said Tuesday the head of Jordanian
intelligence secretly visited Israel on Sunday to discuss the
possibility of Jordan joining an Israeli-Turkish alliance.
Jordanian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied the
report.
	   The Turkish prime minister would not comment on reports that
Egypt and Jordan had been invited to join in November's exercise.
	   Israeli military commentators said they doubted moderate Arab
states such as Egypt and Jordan would break ranks with the rest of
the Arab world, and warned against making too much of the joint
Israeli-Turkish maneuvers.
	   ``It would be far-fetched to say it is a defense strategic
pact,'' said Amikam Nahmani, a senior lecturer with the Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies. ``Nobody expects Turkish soldiers to
come and defend us, or us to go defend them.''
	   Israel and Turkey held their first joint exercise in January,
with the participation of more than 1,000 sailors and five
warships. Jordan sent an observer.

'Black boxes' in Ecuador crash to be sent to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The flight-data and voice recorders from a
Cuban airliner that crashed during takeoff at Quito's international
airport will be sent Wednesday to Russia for analysis, Ecuador's
civil aviation authorities said.
	   The Russian-made Tupolev-154 plane crashed and burst into flame
on a soccer field in a populated area at the end of the runway on
Aug. 29, killing 80 people and injuring 20. The plane was owned by
Cubana de Aviacion.
	   Before coming to a stop it clipped an auto mechanic's shop and
narrowly passed over a busy road. Ten people on the ground were
killed.
	   The cause of the crash has not been determined, but witnesses
said the pilot tried to start the engines and failed five times
before succeeding.
	   The results of the analysis of the flight and cockpit-voice
recorders could be released as early as Sept. 18, said Osvaldo
Dominguez, director of Ecuador's Civilian Aviation Office said
Tuesday.
	   A delegation made up of Ecuadorean accident investigators and
family members of the victims will accompany the recorders to
Russia, Dominguez said
	   Last week, President Jamil Mahuad rejected an air force report
on the accident as ``incomplete,'' saying he needed more
information.
	   Family members of an Ecuadorean man killed on the plane said
they planned to sue both Cubana de Aviacion and Ecuador's Civilian
Aviation Office for negligence in the crash.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The managing board of Manchester United has agreed
to sell the club, one of the biggest names in the soccer world, for
625 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion) to a satellite TV station owned
by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   The Times, which is also owned by Murdoch, said that the deal
between the club and BSkyB was the most lucrative acquisition of a
sports club in the world, and would be formally announced later
Wednesday at the opening of the London Stock Exchange.
	   Both BSkyB and Manchester United declined to comment on the
reported deal.
	   The Times said that a final price for the club was agreed
Tuesday afternoon when the price offered for it rose from 230 pence
(dlrs 3.70) per share to 240 pence (dlrs 3.85), valuing it at 50
million pounds (dlrs 80 million) more than expected.
	   Manchester United's chief executive, Martin Edwards, owns a 14
percent stake in the club and stands to earn 85 million pounds
(dlrs 135 million) from the BSkyB acquisition, the newspaper said.
	   BSkyB confirmed Monday that it was negotiating to buy the club.

	   The results of the analysis of the flight and cockpit-voice
recorders could be released as early as Sept. 18, said Osvaldo
Dominguez, director of Ecuador's Civilian Aviation Office said
Tuesday.
	   A delegation made up of Ecuadorean accident investigators and
family members of the victims will accompany the recorders to
Russia, Dominguez said
	   Last week, President Jamil Mahuad rejected an air force report
on the accident as ``incomplete,'' saying he needed more
information.
	   Family members of an Ecuadorean man killed on the plane said
they planned to sue both Cubana de Aviacion and Ecuador's Civilian
Aviation Office for negligence in the crash.

Mexican congressmen criticize interior secretary on Chiapas policy

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Opposition legislators lambasted Mexico's
interior secretary Tuesday for the government's failure to reach an
agreement with leftist rebels in the southern state of Chiapas and
for stepped-up military activity there.
	   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida, who is responsible for
domestic security, appeared before congress one week after
President Ernesto Zedillo failed to even mention the four-year-old
Chiapas conflict in his state of the nation address.
	   ``What can we say of the president's silence on the problems in
Chiapas? That attitude appears to be yet another chapter in the
(government's) wavering position,'' said congressman Felipe Urbiola
of the National Action Party.
	   Labastida defended Zedillo's silence on Chiapas, where
government troops still periodically clash with supporters of the
leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   ``President Ernesto Zedillo has repeatedly called on the
Zapatista Army to return to the negotiating table,'' he said.
	   ``The army is in Chiapas because of drug trafficking, because of
a declaration of war against the Mexican state by the Zapatistas,
and because of the strategic natural resources in the state,''
Labastida said.
	   But the opposition-dominated congress demanded the government
make greater efforts to end the conflict.
	   ``It is not with perverse silence, but with responsible acts,
that the problems of Chiapas can be solved,'' said Jose Espina Von
Roehrich, also of National Action.
	   Zedillo was widely criticized for having left the Chiapas issue
out of his 1997 state-of-the-nation speech, especially after 45
Tzotzil Indians were massacred by a pro-government paramilitary
group in the state three months later.
	   Zedillo did not mention that incident, known as the Acteal
massacre, in this year's address.
	   Labastida denied that there are any paramilitary groups in
Chiapas. But Gilberto Lopez y Rivas, a legislator for the
left-center Democratic Revolution Party, said the Federal Attorney
General had previously admitted the existence of at least 12
paramilitary groups in Chiapas.
	   ``Who knows what is really happening in Chiapas -- the Attorney
General or the Interior Secretary? Has the government disbanded any
of these paramilitary groups?'' he asked Labastida, who did not
reply.
	   In one of his more recent press releases, Zapatista leader
Subcomandante Marcos said the rebels' confidence in the Zedillo
administration had been ``blown to pieces'' after the government
failed to implement peace accords signed by federal negotiators in
1996.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January, 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.

Relaxed Novotna reaches Open semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED following Seles-Hingis night match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Meet the new Jana Novotna, relaxed and having
fun, hanging out at the U.S. Open, thoroughly enjoying watching
other tennis players worry about playing her.
	   Winning Wimbledon can do wonders for the psyche.
	   ``It gives you confidence,'' she said, ``not only for the next
couple of weeks, but it gives you confidence for life.
	   ``I mean not too many people can do something like that. I have
worked very hard over the years to win a Grand Slam tournament.''
	   Now the Czech native is reaping the benefits.
	   Novotna, seeded No. 3, moved into the semifinals of the Open on
Tuesday with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over No. 11 Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland, continuing her summer of success.
	   Wimbledon changed perceptions about Novotna, who had gone
through some painful Grand Slam losses before her breakthrough.
Now, other players fear her.
	   ``I feel that way, yes,'' she said. ``I feel like they are
afraid of me. When they are ahead of me, they are unsure they can
finish it off. It is a great achievement, a big step forward for
me.
	   ``When you respect somebody, it makes it harder to beat them.''
	   Novotna's confidence has soared but that doesn't mean she isn't
happy to have some help from the other players now and then. There
was, for example, Schnyder's straight-set elimination of Steffi
Graf a round earlier.
	   If Graf had won that match, she would have been across the net
from Novotna on Tuesday. And there is too much history there for
Novotna to forget, especially the fold at Wimbledon in 1993 when
she blew a big lead to lose to Graf in the finals.
	   ``I was pleased when I heard the news that she beat Steffi,''
Novotna said. ``There's no question about it. I mean playing Steffi
today in this (wind) condition, it would be really difficult
because she hits really hard and she's very overpowering. It would
be much harder to create my game.''
	   Playing Novotna proved more difficult for Schnyder, especially
because of the winds.
	   ``It was terrible to play in,'' she said. ``At the beginning, it
was not that bad. But it started to get really bad and she played
so deep, I couldn't really find my game. Then it got worse and
worse. It was horrible.
	   ``I just started very slow and then she played really good and
she didn't let me find my game.''
	   For Schnyder, just 18, it was a frustrating way to go out,
especially after beating Graf. Novotna, who will be 30 next month,
has no recollection of herself or her game when she was Schnyder's
age.
	   ``I don't even remember or want to remember,'' she said. ``I
wasted too much time. I'm so much more mature and confident. I feel
so much better about myself than I did when I was younger.''
	   Winning the quarterfinal was a case of turning the tables for
Novotna, who in 13 Grand Slam seasons has so often been victimized
in big matches.
	   That was the old Jana. This is a new, improved version, more
mature, her game better developed, her psyche in a comfortable
place.
	   ``This is the best year of my career, no question about it,''
she said. ``What is really important is that I'm enjoying myself.
The older I get, the more I enjoy it, which is rather unusual to
see. It doesn't happen too often. I'm glad it's happening to me
now. I want to take advantage.''

Two groups offer dlrs 1 million for 62nd home run
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Baseball-McGwire Mania &QL; 
 &UR; By JASON STRAIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The lucky fan who catches the 62nd baseball
that Mark McGwire smashes into the seats for a home run stands to
make a lot of money.
	   Two separate groups said Tuesday they are willing to pay dlrs 1
million for the ball that breaks the North American baseball home
run record.
	   ``This is our Picasso. This is the greatest piece of sports
memorabilia in the past 50 years,'' said Mark Lewis, among the
bidders.
	   Three sports memorabilia collectors are collaborating for one
offer, which would pay dlrs 100,000 a year for 10 years. The group
also is offering dlrs 1 million for the final home run that sets
the season record.
	   ``It's instant recognition ability to own this baseball,''
collector Steve Ryan said of No. 62.
	   The other bidder is an unidentified, self-titled ``passionate
baseball fan'' who says he would auction No. 62 and donate all
proceeds to a human rights group.
	   The memorabilia group says it would use the ball for promotional
purposes, but would loan the ball to major league baseball and the
Hall of Fame in certain situations.
	   The Hall of Fame could have the ball during the offseason and
during induction week in late July or early August. The ball also
would be available to any team wishing to display No. 62 during a
homestand. Both loans would be free of charge, the group said.
	   Mike Davidson, who caught No. 61 Monday, said he intends to give
the ball to McGwire in exchange for an autographed jersey and a
chance to meet the star.
	   Ryan says he doesn't see a fan giving up No. 62 without
compensation.
	   ``Do I think a million dollars will affect someone? Yeah, that
changes your life,'' said Ryan, president of North Shore Sports.
	   The anonymous bidder is trying to draw attention to the unsolved
rape and murder of four American church women in El Salvador. He
says the publicity would place greater pressure on the U.S. and
Salvadoran governments to bring the case to justice.

Annan expresses concern over violence in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Cambodia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. secretary-general expressed
``deep concern'' Tuesday over recent clashes in Cambodia, where
demonstrators have been protesting the outcome of recent national
elections.
	   Kofi Annan noted the recent grenade attack on the residence of
Cambodian strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen blamed the attack on
opposition leader Sam Rainsy, and ordered his arrest. Sam Rainsy
has taken refuge at U.N. offices in a hotel in the capital, Phnom
Penh.
	   Annan called ``on all Cambodian leaders to resolve their
differences through dialogue'' and reminded Hun Sen of his pledge
to guarantee the freedom of political leaders from arrest and
detention.
	   On Tuesday in Phnom Penh, riot police swung bamboo rods and
rifle butts at protesters and soldiers fired thousands of rounds
into the air as they scattered demonstrators from a protest camp in
front of Cambodia's National Assembly.
	   The two-week protest was aimed at alleged fraud in Cambodia's
July 26 national election. The crowd, which at times numbered
10,000, called for Hun Sen's resignation.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW _ Russia's political crisis whirled in a holding pattern
as the country waits for word from President Boris Yeltsin on
whether he will agree to accept a compromise candidate for prime
minister. The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexy II,
expressed fear of unrest, praying publicly before Russia's holiest
icon for divine protection against ``misfortunes, sorrows and
internecine war.'' Yeltsin, known for trampling over his political
opponents, has compromised before in the face of popular anger. The
president has one more chance to win parliamentary approval for his
prime ministerial pick. If the Duma refuses to confirm the
candidate, Yeltsin must dissolve the legislature and call
parliamentary elections within three months. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An independent counsel's report on President
Bill Clinton should reach Congress this week or next, said a Senate
Republican leader. Counsel Kenneth Starr told President Bill
Clinton's lawyer he opposed letting him see the report early.. The
report will give details of the president's relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and alleged attempts to
cover it up. What happens after the report arrives is murky. House
Republican leaders are still discussing procedural issues.
Clinton's attorneys are concerned Starr's report will be one-sided
and include extensive conclusions and legal analysis instead of
simply a listing of facts gathered in the seven-month
investigation. Democrats, meanwhile, are criticizing the president
as much as rival Republicans. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The State Department cast doubt on North
Korea's claim that the object it launched last week over Japan was
a satellite and not a missile. At the time of the Aug. 31 launch,
U.S. agencies concluded it was a missile. U.S. analysts have not
observed any object orbiting the Earth that correlates to the
orbital data the North Koreans have provided in their public
statements, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Tuesday.
He added that irrespective of whether it was a missile or a
satellite, the test demonstrated that North Korea has the
capability to deliver a payload at a very long range. At the
Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the military was still
looking into North Korea's assertion that it launched a satellite.
(US-NORTH KOREA)
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Investigators have detected signs of
heat damage on fragments of Swissair Flight 111's cockpit, evidence
that could help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots
before the jetliner crashed. Vic Gerden, the chief crash
investigator, said Tuesday that signs of heat stress have been
found so far only on wreckage from the cockpit, not from the
passenger cabin. He refused to speculate on the extent of the
damage or the exact cause of it. Gerden also expressed hopes of
gaining valuable data from the plane's recovered flight-data
recorder, even though it stopped working during the final six
minutes before the plane crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia
on Sept. 2, killing all 229 people on board. Flight 111 crashed
more than an hour after taking off from New York, bound for Geneva.
(CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH)
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ A rebel delegation stormed out of
peace talks to end the war in Congo, dashing plans for a cease-fire
agreement that was expected to be signed. A draft of a cease-fire
agreement that seven African presidents had been expected to sign
was withdrawn as the leaders bickered over the treatment of the
rebels, according to Zimbabwean officials hosting the summit. The
rebels left the meeting site at the Elephant Hills Hotel in this
resort town, saying they had not been allowed to attend the joint
talks. The rebels, excluded from two previous summits over the past
month, arrived Monday for the talks with the presidents of Congo,
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda.

Second national election after war seems confusing to voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Pouring over the 83
candidates, multiple parties and coalitions competing in Bosnia's
second national election since its war ended, Zehra Dizdarevic just
shook her head.
	   ``What in God's name is this?'' the 64-year-old pensioner
wondered aloud as she read a sample ballot distributed by
international election organizers ahead of this weekend's vote.
	   In a nation recovering from 3 1/2 years of war, the ballot
reflects the complex political system created in the tortuous
negotiations that halted Bosnia's fighting in 1995 and divided it
into two ethnic-based entities effectively run by the international
community.
	   On Saturday and Sunday, voters will choose a three-member
presidency _ one from each of the main ethnic groups of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims. They also will elect parliaments in each entity
_ the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation _ and a
national parliament with delegates from both sides. The Serb
republic also will choose its president.
	   International officials hope the election continues a trend
since the war ended, with nationalist parties and leaders who
plunged the former Yugoslav republic into warfare continuing to
lose support.
	   The Americans and Europeans have already sidelined hardline
nationalist leaders in the Serb republic. They have given millions
of dollars in aid to the moderate Serb republic government to help
pay salaries and pensions there to bolster the moderate cause.
	   ``Seize this opportunity by choosing responsible leaders who
will manage the country's affairs honestly and will pursue the
future you want for yourselves and your children,'' the European
Union said in an appeal to Bosnians issued Tuesday.
	   But many people trying to recover from a war that devastated the
economic and social fabric feel they are being asked to vote a
third time in three years _ one election was for local officials _
without really understanding where it all is heading.
	   ``I won't vote,'' spat Dizdarevic's husband Hasan, 67, after
reading the sample ballot through the pair of glasses he and his
wife share because they can't afford another.
	   Engineer Munevera Ljutovic believes the complicated ballot is
not the problem.
	   ``It's the country's set-up,'' he said. ``I didn't understand
from the very beginning how this (country) is composed and which
parliament is which.''
	   Christopher Bennett, head of the Bosnian branch of the
International Crisis Group, an independent group monitoring the
peace process, noted that progress toward implementing the 1995
Dayton peace plan has come through the absolute power wielded by
the Americans and Europeans and 35,000 NATO-led troops, rather than
through elections.
	   ``''Elections are needed only to ratify the new reality,''
Bennett said.
	   Other problems also hinder the election process. Tens of
thousands of the 2.75 million registered voters were displaced by
the war, often forced from their homes in attempts to drive off
rival ethnic groups.
	   Many registered to vote where they used to live, even though
they haven't returned to their homes due to intimidation by ethnic
rivals.
	   Bosnia's lack of a democratic tradition was evident in the
election campaign.
	   An attempt by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe to hold televised debates between the presidential
candidates of each ethnic group has faltered badly. The Muslim
debate was called off when likely winner, Alija Izetbegovic, didn't
show up. The probable Croat winner _ Ante Jelavic _ also failed to
appear at the Croat debate.
	   The non-appearances showed the leaders' ``incredible arrogance
and non-respect of the voting body,'' journalist Kristijan Ivelic
said during a discussion program after the Croat debate.

Russia awaits signal from president to break political deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's political crisis whirled in a holding
pattern as the country waited for word from President Boris Yeltsin
on whether he would agree to accept a compromise candidate for
prime minister.
	   The choice could resolve a deadlock between the president and
parliament that has paralyzed the political system even as the
country's economy descends deeper into crisis.
	   Ever since the lower chamber, the State Duma, resoundingly
rejected his unpopular choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday,
Yeltsin has kept counsel among his closest aides but had said
nothing publicly by Tuesday.
	   In previous situations, he has made a new nomination within
hours of a no vote, and the delay spurred speculation that he was
considering a change of heart.
	   Yeltsin has one more chance to propose a candidate _ either
Chernomyrdin or someone else. If the Duma rejects the third choice,
Yeltsin is required to disband the chamber and call new elections.
	   Opposition and religious leaders warned Tuesday that unless a
solution is found quickly, the political standoff could spark civil
war.
	   The nation's top clergyman, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II,
even prayed publicly before Russia's holiest icon, Our Lady of
Vladimir, seeking divine protection against ``misfortunes, sorrows
and internecine war.''
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said that if Yeltsin
continues to insist on Chernomyrdin, the crisis will deepen.
	   ``A mistake for the president and his team can cost the
country's civic peace. This is a very high price,'' Zyuganov said.
Disbanding the Duma, he added, could ``end in fighting throughout
Russia's expanses.''
	   Yeltsin's office has not named any other potential candidates
for the prime minister's job. Two names that have prompted the
greatest speculation among lawmakers are Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In a statement circulated Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry,
Primakov said he would not agree to take the prime minister's post.
Luzhkov, too, coyly denied he'd been negotiating for the job.
	   Noting that he was already ``prime minister of the Moscow
government,'' Luzhkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as
asking: ``Is that so little?''
	   Meanwhile, the economy continued its skid. The ruble, which
bought about 16 cents last month, is now worth around 5 cents.
	   Prices have been rising daily and shoppers are clearing out
store shelves in anticipation of even higher inflation. Long lines
also began forming at gas stations.
	   Apparently seeking to slow the deterioration, Chernomyrdin moved
late Tuesday to put at least some of his economic program into
motion.
	   He instructed tax police to start raids Thursday on firms
suspected of gouging, ordered a swift cut in oil excise taxes, and
directed the Central Bank to require exporters to sell half their
hard currency proceeds for rubles. He also announced that customs
officers can now collect duties in foreign currencies, Interfax
said.
	   He named Boris Fyodorov, the acting deputy premier and tax
chief, to be Russia's chief envoy to the International Monetary
Fund, Interfax reported.
	   In another step to increase tax collections, the acting
government decided to transfer the tax accounts of the country's 50
biggest companies to the Central Bank, the Federal Treasury and two
large, state-owned banks _ Sberbank, the Savings Bank, and
Vneshtorgbank, the Bank for Foreign Trade.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Each time Mark McGwire goes to work, millions of
Americans are watching.
	   Radio and television stations provide nearly instantaneous
updates on his every move. And each morning, his latest
accomplishments appear on front pages of newspapers across the
country.
	   It may be the most attention the country has ever given to a
professional baseball player.
	   McGwire, the gargantuan first baseman of the St. Louis
Cardinals, is poised to break the single-season home run record _
perhaps the most hallowed mark in American sports.
	   He hit his 61st home run _ tying the 37-year-old record _ on
Monday. And there were still 19 games left in the season.
	   McGwire's assault on the record has turned him into a celebrity
and injected new life into a troubled sport that prides itself as
being ``America's pastime.'' But the race for the record books has
had its price: McGwire has come under fire for using
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Few things in sports are as dramatic _ or difficult _ as hitting
a home run _ a connection that drives the ball out of the playing
field. Depending on the situation, a home run can drive in from one
to four points _ known as runs _ and instantly change the tone of a
game.
	   A player who hits 20 home runs _ out of more than 500 at bats
during the season _ is considered solid. One who hits 40 is a
superstar. Sixty? Before this season, only two men had ever done
it: The legendary Babe Ruth, who hit 60 in 1927, and Roger Maris,
who broke Ruth's record by hitting 61 in 1961.
	   McGwire has been spurred on by Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs,
who currently has 58 homers. Sosa is his own storybook tale, rising
out of poverty in the Dominican Republic to become a top player.
	   But McGwire has got the most attention, both because he has held
the lead most of the season and because of the sheer beauty of his
hits.
	   If a home run is baseball art, then McGwire is the sport's
Michelangelo. His home runs are hit so hard and fly so far _ some
have been measured at more than 500 feet (150 meters) _ that
commentators say he is baseball's most imposing figure since Ruth.
	   ``His sheer size and the incredible distance he hits so many of
his home runs make him on some levels larger than life,'' said Bill
McGill, a retired professor who edits the baseball literary
magazine ``Spitball.''
	   Although the Cardinals have been out of playoff contention for
most of the year, their games have taken on a rock concert
atmosphere _ with McGwire at center stage.
	   Wherever the Cardinals play, hundreds of fans flock to the
stadium hours before the game to watch the giant redhead take
batting practice.
	   During games, the atmosphere is electric when the 6-foot-5
(2-meter), 250-pound (110-kilo) McGwire steps up to bat. The crowd
rises to its feet. Hundreds of flashbulbs flicker in the stands.
And if McGwire swings and misses, there's a collective groan of
disappointment.
	   But when he connects, there's bedlam, even in opposing
ballparks. Crowds have even resorted to booing their own pitchers
if they do not throw McGwire a pitch to hit.
	   ``I wish everybody in baseball could feel the reception I'm
getting,'' McGwire said recently.
	   When McGwire hit his record-tying homer, many in the crowd in
St. Louis were moved to tears as he ran around the bases with a
fist thrust high.
	   McGwire's father, celebrating his 61st birthday, was on hand, as
was the player's 10-year-old son. Sosa, playing against McGwire
that night, clapped in appreciation.
	   Despite the fairy tale season, not all has gone smoothly.
McGwire has had to cope with intense media coverage and overzealous
fans. And last month, a reporter discovered McGwire was taking
androstenedione, a dietary supplement that builds lean muscle mass
and promotes recovery after injury.
	   Although legal in baseball, the drug is banned by the Olympics,
U.S. football and collegiate sports. While no one has questioned
McGwire's ability _ he has hit more than 50 homers for three
straight seasons _ some believe it has tarnished the season.
	   But the naysayers are clearly a minority. By most accounts,
McGwire has given new life to a sport troubled in recent years by a
strike, poor sportsmanship and the game's slow pace.
	   According to a poll conducted for The Associated Press last
month, nearly half of all Americans are paying more attention to
baseball because of the home run race.
	   ``I'm not a big baseball fan, but I'll be watching just to see
him break the record,'' said legal secretary Michelle Ruddle,
echoing the sentiments of many. ``It's breaking a record. It's
history.''

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A rebel delegation stormed out
of peace talks to end the war in Congo, dashing plans for a
cease-fire agreement that was expected to be signed.
	   The seven African presidents attending Tuesday's summit in this
northwest Zimbabwe resort left with grim expressions and curt
farewells that contrasted sharply with the optimism of the day
before.
	   The summit marked the third formal attempt at a peace deal since
the conflict began in early August, and the first time rebels were
invited.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila, who has steadfastly refused to
meet face-to-face with his opponents, snubbed them again, causing
the delegation to walk out in anger.
	   ``They will only know we exist when we start shooting,'' snapped
rebel leader Bizima Karaha. He said the rebels support a
cease-fire, but added that because they had been ``excluded from
this, we are not bound by it.''
	   After the rebels left, the seven heads of state said defense
ministers would meet at the Organization of African Unity
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Thursday to work out
details of a cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops and
political reform in Congo.
	   Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said he hoped the rebels
would honor any agreement, saying, ``People are dying and we must
stop these hostilities.''
	   The summit, headed by Chiluba, included the presidents of Congo,
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has stirred
ethnic hatred.
	   Kabila is backed by armies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
Uganda and Rwanda, who backed Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko, are now allegedly supporting his opponents.
	   Rwanda denies its troops are backing the rebels. Uganda admits
it has troops in Congo, but says they are only protecting its
borders.
	   Joseph Bideri, spokesman for Rwanda's President Pasteur
Bizimungu, said Rwanda and Uganda could not persuade the summit to
meet with the rebels.
	   ``You can't talk about a cease-fire without talking to fighters,
'' he said.

Scandinavia provides most opportunity for women

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Scandinavian women lead the world
in access to power and making decisions in government and industry,
U.N. researchers have found.
	   Women living in Sweden, Norway and Denmark hold the highest
percentage of seats in parliament and jobs in administrative,
managerial and technical fields, the United Nations Development
Program concludes in its annual report released Wednesday.
	   The Human Development Report ranked 102 countries on a ``gender
empowerment scale'' that examined women's participation in the
professional, economic and political domains.
	   Often, the report found gaps between the development of a
country and the opportunities available for women.
	   Although the highest-ranked countries on the gender empowerment
scale are among the most developed in the world, access to money,
education and health care was not always an indicator of power for
women, researchers discovered.
	   Several developing countries were ranked above highly
industrialized nations.
	   France, second only to Canada on a separate index that measured
overall human development, was 31 in terms of its opportunities for
women _ trailing behind countries such as Cuba (25), Poland (29),
Costa Rica (28) and the Bahamas (15).
	   Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 17 in terms of power for women, had
more opportunities for women than did the United Kingdom (20) and
Ireland (21).
	   Japan, which the UNDP ranked eighth in overall human
development, was just 38 on the gender empowerment scale, behind
far poorer China (33) and Mexico (37).
	   The United States ranked 11 on the women index even though it
was considered the fourth most-developed country in terms of
education, health care and life expectancy for men and women.
	   Women in the United States have less access to power than women
in Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where the report was
released.
	   Thailand was ranked 60, Brazil 68, and India 95. Rounding out
the bottom of the scale were Niger (102), Mauritania (101) and
Pakistan (100).
	   ``Progress in building women's capabilities has been
significant, but there is a serious delay in creating real
opportunities for women,'' the report said.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Consumption of goods and services
has skyrocketed globally, but lurking beneath the affluence is a
widening gap between the world's rich and poor, a new U.N. report
warns.
	   Highlighting ``gross inequalities,'' the Human Development
Report being released Wednesday detailed the plight of the more
than 1 billion people it said suffer ``human deprivation and
stunted lives marked by illiteracy, inadequate income and exclusion
from the social mainstream.''
	   ``Abundance of consumption is no crime,'' said United Nations
Development Program administrator James Gustave Speth. ``But it is
scandalous that the poor are unable to consume enough to meet even
their most basic needs.''
	   Runaway growth in consumption, which topped dlrs 24 trillion
globally this year, is also wreaking havoc on the environment and
the poor are bearing the brunt of environmental damage, the agency
warned.
	   ``All over the world, poor people generally live nearest to
dirty factories, busy roads and waste dumps,'' it said.
	   The report did not condemn affluence, but it called for ``more
sustainable'' patterns of consumption to spread the wealth and put
the brakes on environmental damage.
	   Although developing countries have experienced high growth rates
in consumption in recent years, they are still trailing the world's
richest nations, the report said.
	   Illustrating the yawning gap between rich and poor, it said the
20 percent of people living in high-income countries consume 86
percent of the world's goods and services. The poorest 20 percent,
by contrast, consume just 1.3 percent.
	   There was a glimmer of hope: Despite alarming setbacks in some
countries, every region of the world has made at least some gains
in human development over the past 30 years.
	   Since 1960, infant mortality rates in developing nations have
decreased by more than half, child malnutrition has declined by 25
percent and school enrollment has more than doubled, it said.
	   Even so, poverty is making steady inroads even among the
wealthiest nations, said researchers who described the number of
those barely getting by in industrialized countries as ``shockingly
high.''
	   The world's richest nations are home to more than 100 million
people who live below the poverty line, according to the report. At
least 37 million are unemployed, 100 million are homeless and
nearly 200 million have a life expectancy of less than 60 years.
	   The 228-page report examined industrialized nations in a new
``human poverty index'' measuring the extent to which the poor have
been left behind. Sweden ranked the best, with less than 7 percent
of Swedes living in poverty.
	   In the United States, by contrast, nearly 16.5 percent of
Americans live in poverty despite the country's immense material
wealth and generally high per-capita income.
	   This year's report again included the UNDP's ``human development
index'' ranking 174 countries according to their progress in
improving life expectancy, education and income.
	   ``Poverty is not just a matter of not having enough income, but
also of being robbed of opportunities to participate and contribute
to the life of a community,'' said Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, a UNDP
official.
	   For the fifth consecutive year, Canada topped the human
development index for enabling the ``average person'' to enjoy a
decent standard of living, followed by France, Norway, the United
States and Iceland.
	   Five African countries _ Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and
Sierra Leone _ rounded off the bottom of that list.

Journalist is first Argentine invited to visit Falklands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Falkland Islands Legislative
Council invited an Argentine journalist to visit, the first such
invitation since the 1982 war, the British Embassy said.
	   Mariano Grondona, columnist of the Buenos Aires daily La Nacion
and host of a television political talk show received the
invitation from British Ambassador William Marsden.
	   ``Grondona will be given ample opportunities to interview
council members as well as islanders from all sectors,'' the
embassy said Tuesday in a statement.
	   A Grondona spokesperson said the journalist would answer later
this week.
	   Argentina, which claims the islands as an inheritance from the
Spanish crown, attempted to recover them by force but was defeated
by Britain in a 74-day war in which nearly 1,000 servicemen, most
of them Argentine, died.
	   After the two countries renewed relations in 1990, small groups
of relatives of Argentine soldiers who died on the islands have
been allowed to visit their graves at an isolated cemetery.

Raid on tent city dashes Cambodia's flirtation with people power
</HEADLINE>
revolution

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Before hundreds of riot police
smashed their tent city and drove them from the park they had
dubbed Democracy Square, thousands of Cambodians dreamed for 16
days of launching a people power revolution like the Philippines or
Indonesia.
	   But strongman Hun Sen, enforcing an election victory his
opponents said was the result of massive fraud, refused to go the
way of Ferdinand Marcos or Suharto and bend to calls for his
ouster. Tuesday's raid dissipated, for now, a focus of popular
protest against him.
	   But just an hour before hundreds of police came in and dispersed
the protesters with clubs and rifle butts _ hitting one elderly
woman so hard the gun broke _ Lim Huy Lim was taking finger-printed
petition signatures from people demanding that Hun Sen resign.
	   He claimed to have 100,000, a lot in a city of 1 million and
evidence that Hun Sen's reasserted authority may not be well
accepted.
	   ``We don't want to see something go crazy and see people
killed,'' Lim Huy Lim, 47, said. ``But until now, Cambodia has
never had democracy. The first thing in a democracy is, if the
leader does something wrong, we can get rid of him.''
	   Whether Hun Sen stays or goes after 13 years in power, the
recent demonstrations at Democracy Square marked a sea change in
how some Cambodians _ who have suffered through more political
upheaval than most of mankind _ think about themselves and their
society. The protests were unprecedented in size and duration.
	   Sitting on a straw mat beneath a sheet of blue tarpaulin,
``home'' since he came to Phnom Penh from his town in Prey Veng
province Aug. 24, Sam Vuthy said he decided to join the sit-in even
though his village chief, a member of Hun Sen's ruling party,
warned residents against going.
	   The 25-year-old rice farmer said he went largely out of
frustration. Droughts this year destroyed his rice crop, leaving
him penniless, but the chief continued to ``pressure'' residents,
demanding money and rice to supplement tough times of his own.
	   Sam Vuthy said he tried not to think about what would happen if
he and other protesters failed to topple Hun Sen, or where he would
turn.
	   ``The demonstrators have to win,'' Sam Vuthy said. ``Because I
can't go back to my village if we lose.''
	   A few hours later, they lost. Hun Sen, angered by a grenade
attack against his home he blamed on opposition leader Sam Rainsy,
had warned the demonstrators Monday that they had until midnight to
clear out. Sam Rainsy's party called the grenade attack, which hurt
no one, a staged pretext allowing Hun Sen to smash the opposition.
	   Hun Sen relented before the deadline, giving protesters the
sense of a victory won by determination. But shortly after lunch
Tuesday, riot police stormed Democracy Square, chasing out the
protesters and looting their belongings. Several people were
hospitalized.
	   Many of the protesters were poor Cambodians: motorcycle taxi
drivers, laborers, street vendors _ people with little to lose in a
society where corruption and patronage politics are the easiest
ways to wealth.
	   What they did have to give was time. In exchange, they were fed
via donations from other supporters. Hun Sen called the protest
illegal, but the demonstrators took pride in their camp and worked
to keep out pickpockets and organized daily latrine and litter
details.
	   Their favorite form of entertainment were speeches denouncing
Hun Sen and taped broadcasts from Voice of America radio blared
over loudspeakers. In the wee hours before the assault, U.S. Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, was played over and over
again calling Hun Sen a ``war criminal.''
	   Each day that passed without incident emboldened them. A week
ago, 10 protesters smashed a statue depicting friendship between
Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers, a relic of the 10-year
Vietnamese occupation that brought Hun Sen to power. Many
Cambodians despise their larger, more powerful neighbor _ who
delivered them from the genocidal Khmer Rouge _ and anti-Vietnamese
and anti-communist slogans are frequently used against Hun Sen.
	   As their support increased, until at times more than 10,000
people crammed in the park to hear opposition leader Sam Rainsy
address the crowds, many started to believe that they could
possibly force Hun Sen from power.
	   They expressed faith that the international community, which
sponsored dlrs 3 billion U.N.-organized elections in 1993, would
save them. But international observers quickly _ critics said too
quickly _ endorsed the recent elections as credible enough.
	   ``I do not believe the results of the election and want Hun Sen
to step down,'' said Meas Prak, 45, a motorcycle taxi driver who
stopped working for two weeks to join the sit-in. ``We want a real
democrat to run the country.''

Boeing bounces back with big Brazilian jet order

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The Boeing Co. secured a big jet
deal with Brazilian airline Varig _ hoping it might help the
company bounce back from recent troubles that ruined its chances of
cashing in on a sales boom.
	   Boeing signed some dlrs 1.8 billion in firm orders for 24 jets
for Varig, bringing its total airplane orders at the Farnborough
International 98 air show to a list price of around dlrs 3 billion.
	   That outdid dlrs 2.7 billion in firm orders that archrival
Airbus Industrie announced on Tuesday _ through deals to the
Dubai-based carrier Emirates and the International Lease Finance
Corp., a big airplane leasing firm from Los Angeles.
	   Both companies said their actual business would be hundreds of
millions of dollars higher, because customers had also taken out
options to buy more airplanes.
	   Airbus seemed to have an early advantage at the show, which is
the industry's top event of the year and always turns into an
intense point-scoring rivalry between the world's top two airplane
manufacturers.
	   Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard had been boasting about a
big increase in market share and talked of boosting profits. Boeing
seemed stuck explaining efforts to recover from a series of costly
production-line snags and the recent firing of the head of its
commercial airplane group.
	   Boeing president Harry Stonecipher had arrived at the
Farnborough show with strong acknowledgments that his company had
become too arrogant and self-satisfied and now must focus on what
its disappointed customers want.
	   When it came time later to announce some good news, Stonecipher
seemed rejuvenated, pointing out to assembled aviation journalists
that his big customer, Varig boss Fernando Pinto, knows plenty
about airplanes and has even created his own glider.
	   ``We have not left the field of battle in terms of selling
airliners,'' Stonecipher said, his comments frequently drowned out
by the roar of combat jets flying on display just overhead.

Amnesty accuses Israel, Palestinians of rights violations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amnesty International has accused Israel and
the Palestinian Authority of extensive human rights violations in
the five years since the signing of the Oslo agreements with the
Palestinians, according to a report released Wednesday.
	   In a 40-page report, the London-based human rights group said
more than 10,000 Palestinians have been arrested by the Israeli
security forces and routinely subjected to torture under
interrogation.
	   Amnesty accused Israel's Supreme Court of legitimizing the use
of torture and detention without trial. The international human
rights group also criticized an Israeli commission's endorsement of
the right of Israeli security forces to kill suspected terrorists
anywhere in the world.
	   The Palestinian Authority has also committed rights violations,
Amnesty said. It said most of the 19 Palestinians who have died in
the custody of Palestinian security forces were accused of
``collaboration'' with Israel.
	   ``Those particularly liable to suffer torture ... are suspected
`collaborators' including those accused of selling land to Jews,''
the report says.
	   In the preamble to the report and the press release on it,
Amnesty said the Authority also had targeted Palestinians opposed
to the peace process, partially because of pressure from Israel and
the United States.
	   The report said Israel contributed to the suicide bombings
carried out by Palestinian Islamic militants in Israeli cities.
	   ``In a spiral of violence, killings of Palestinians by Israeli
security services or settlers have led to suicide bombings and the
deaths of Israeli civilians,'' the report said.
	   A senior Israeli official criticized the report.
	   David Bar-Illan, an advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
told The Associated Press the Palestinian Authority's worst human
rights violations were not against opponents of the peace process
but against those who favored cooperation with Israel.
	   ``They haven't killed a single Hamas terrorist,'' he said.
	   ``To blame the dictatorial, corrupt and arbitrary regime of the
Palestinian Authority, which has executed people without a trial
for selling land to Jews _ to blame this on Israeli and American
pressure is to insult history and plain common sense,'' he said.

Peru's shantytown inventors spurred by poverty, creativity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ When a fall down a flight of stairs left Jose
Juape's beloved grandmother unable to walk and the family couldn't
afford a wheelchair, he set out to build her a remote-control
robot.
	   As the 80-year-old matriarch sat motionless on a ragged sofa in
their home abutting a dusty street market in the Lima shantytown of
Comas, Juape, then 14, rooted through junk yards for parts.
	   He scrounged old air conditioner motors, pulleys, wires and an
ancient car battery to power the robot.
	   After more than a year of experimenting, Juape, who knows little
math or science, built ``The Condor,'' a man-size robot covered in
tin foil that can roll about the house on wheels, pick up objects
with pincer-like hands and turn its head. It is operated by a
hand-held control panel.
	   ``If you can't buy something in Peru, you make it yourself,''
said Juape, whose next project is to make an electricity generator
from scrounged magnets.
	   Of course, the results aren't always what's planned. Juape's
grandmother is afraid of the robot, calling it ``the dead soul.''
	   Peru's sprawling shantytowns are hot beds of creativity. Spurred
by desperate poverty, their inhabitants are inventing their own
machines and building everything from toys to car parts from junk.
	   A national inventors contest attracted hundreds of entries,
including a snail-shaped concert harp, acne cream made from tree
bark, socks that give a massage and a combination bed, chair and
urinal.
	   Many of the best inventions came from the poor, said Isaias
Flit, a lawyer with Peru's copyright office, Indecopi, which
organized the event.
	   ``There is a phenomenal creativity among Peruvians, especially
the poor, who trace their roots back to the rich Inca or pre-Inca
Indian cultures,'' said Luis Herrera, a psychoanalyst who studies
Peru's poor. ``This creativity emerges in times of crisis.''
	   Peru was the center for many of Latin America's great Indian
cultures.
	   Peruvian inventors last year won gold medals in two categories
at the International Exhibition of Inventions, New Techniques and
Products, an inventors contest held in Switzerland that attracted
participants from more than 50 countries. There were 22 categories.
	   Peru's performance was the best of any Latin American country,
Flit said.
	   One medal went to a man from the ancient Incan capital of Cuzco
in the Andes who invented an electronic pen that detects forged
signatures. Using seismic technology available in earthquake-prone
Peru, Luis Jimenez's pen measures the pressure and motion with
which a name is signed.
	   The second medal went to Carlos Passaro, an unemployed mural
painter who invented a multi-use life preserver-swimming aid. It is
a long, flexible foam tube and plastic clamp that can fold the tube
into 20 positions, including one that leaves the swimmer sitting in
the water as if in a chair.
	   Peruvians had to begin looking for creative ways to survive
following the collapse of their economy in the 1980s and early
1990s.
	   Conditions of the urban poor were worsened by the mass migration
of Indians from the countryside to the cities to get out of the
crossfire in the long war between leftist guerrillas and the army.
	   An estimated 600,000 people fled to urban areas. Many squatted
on unoccupied land, forming a vast ``misery belt'' on the desolate
desert sands around Lima in a social cataclysm that changed the
face of Peru.
	   Under the misgovernment of populist President Alan Garcia, the
economy collapsed and inflation soared to 7,000 percent in 1990.
	   By the early 1990s, 60 percent of Peruvians lived in poverty,
one in five lived in complete misery and the rural social
structures that had sustained migrants in their former communities
were in tatters.
	   The Andean migrants built their homes from straw, cardboard and
garbage on plots of sand without running water, electricity,
schools or roads. Almost overnight new shantytowns appeared. Hunger
loomed.
	   ``They lived in a wasteland one step away from starvation. Faced
with this adversity, they used their native creativity to come up
with ingenious ways to survive,'' said the Rev. Tom Burns, an
American Maryknoll priest who has worked among Peru's poor for 29
years.
	   The poor taught themselves to be electricians, plumbers,
mechanics, urban planners and repairmen, he said. Before Christmas,
self-taught toy makers visit shantytowns and rural villages holding
toy fairs.
	   During his studies of shantytown psychology, Herrera found
blocks of mechanics who had never read a manual but could rebuild
cars from scrap and street markets filled with rejigged appliances.
He also found forgers who could expertly fake everything from money
to medical degrees.
	   These self-taught skills and abilities have led to inventions,
few of which are patented, said inventor Passaro, who lives in a
tough part of downtown Lima.
	   Passaro has invented more than a dozen items, including special
mural-painting brushes and giant hand puppets operated by
piano-like keys.
	   He built the swimming aid to help his wife learn how to swim and
the hand puppets so that the school where his wife taught could put
on a show even though it had no money.
	   ``Everything I invent is a response to a need,'' he said. ``If I
sat on my hands and did nothing, we would have nothing.''

Mexico's oldest national park in battle to recover from fires
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DESIERTO DE LOS LEONES NATIONAL PARK, Mexico (AP) _ With its
centuries-old trees, lush vegetation and rich wildlife, Mexico's
oldest national park is a soothing contrast to the noise and
pollution of the nearby capital.
	   Just a 45-minute drive from downtown Mexico City, the park is a
popular escape from concrete high-rises and traffic jams, a place
where city dwellers can hike among pines, cedars and oaks and catch
a glimpse of deer, rabbits, raccoons and squirrels.
	   But a series of fires damaged about a third of the park's 3,780
acres (1,530 hectares) this spring, and park officials are worried
about its future. The park has long been plagued by a lack of
government support, and help promised for reforestation after the
fires has yet to arrive.
	   ``The park was totally abandoned by previous administrations,
and even now we have no budget,'' said the park's director, Gustavo
Loa Carbajal.
	   More than 12,600 fires raged through Mexican forests this
spring, blackening about 1 million acres (400,000 hectares) of
wildlands and creating a smoky haze that blanketed much of the
country and parts of the United States.
	   Hard hit along with the Desierto de los Leones was the
Chimalapas biological reserve in southern Mexico, among the most
important tropical rain forests in the Americas.
	   U.S. officials blamed the fires on severe drought caused by El
Nino and on the centuries-old Mexican practice of using fires to
clear land.
	   Desierto de los Leones was ceded as a park by the Spanish
monarchy in 1797 and has since been administered by the Mexico City
government. It became Mexico's first national park following a 1917
decree by President Venustiano Carranza.
	   The park is also home to one of Mexico's oldest historic
buildings _ a convent built after Spanish Viceroy Don Juan de
Mendoza y Luna laid the first stone in 1606.
	   Recovery efforts at the park present not only financial, but
major logistical challenges. Most of the burned areas are atop
steep hills that recent rainfall have turned to slippery slopes.
	   ``These are the worst forest fires I have ever seen,'' said
Francisco Merida Islas, a horse wrangler who has worked in the park
for 14 years renting his horses to weekend visitors and acting as a
guide.
	   When the blazes struck, Merida mounted his small brown horse and
joined other locals on horseback carrying buckets of water to
firemen handicapped by the rocky, unpaved roads leading into the
park.
	   Since then, thousands of volunteers from Mexico City have
pitched in to help with reforestation, joining soldiers, Boy and
Girl scouts and others planting pine seedlings to replace burned
trees.
	   ``Most people don't realize how important the park is for
Mexico,'' said Lizette Herrera, an 18-year-old Girl Scout who spent
two weekends helping plant new trees.
	   ``We must help keep the park from being destroyed by forest
fires,'' she said as her fellow scouts, dressed in shorts and
T-shirts, used shovels, machetes and pitchforks to prepare the
ground for planting.
	   Park officials say they are used to operating on a shoestring,
but have never been faced with a major reforestation effort.
	   Loa said a park of this size should have at least 350 employees,
but has only 120 workers, including 50 park rangers.
	   ``Our motto is: `If we're given the resources, we'll get it
done, and if not, we'll get it done, too','' Loa said.
	   Francisco Gonzalez, the park's director for cultural events,
said: ``Having a budget would help us a great deal. Our offices
have been without telephones for the last three years.''
	   By late August, the federal government's National Resources
Commission had shipped 3.35 million pesos (dlrs 350,000) worth of
seedlings to Desierto de Leones, but Loa said Aug. 29 that it would
not be enough to reforest the areas that were burned.
	   He also said recent torrential rains had caused considerable
erosion, which could make the reforestation effort more difficult.
	   If the trees are not planted by September, they will not
survive, said Muncio Castillo Rodriguez, a maintenance supervisor
who has worked at the park since 1943.
	   But, ``If things are done right, those new trees could last
hundreds of years,'' he said.

Security Council moves closer to suspending Iraq sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous and UPDATES with details of resolution,
Richardson comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has fine-tuned a
resolution that would punish Iraq for freezing cooperation with
U.N. inspectors by suspending periodic reviews of economic
sanctions.
	   The council is expected to vote on the measure later this week,
diplomats said.
	   France wants the resolution to call for the U.N. chief to report
to the council as soon as possible on the status of Iraq's overall
disarmament, diplomats said. Russia backed the French effort in
consultations Tuesday.
	   That report could set the stage for a comprehensive review of
sanctions, which the resolution's sponsors, the United States and
Britain, have agreed to as a concession to other permanent council
members Russia, France and China. The last three are generally more
sympathetic to Iraq.
	   A revised draft circulating Tuesday, however, said no such
comprehensive review would occur until after Iraq rescinds its Aug.
5 decision to freeze cooperation with U.N. inspectors. A
comprehensive review could result in the council acknowledging some
progress in the United Nations' 8-year-old effort to disarm Iraq.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, imposed after Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   Without the regular 60-day reviews, Iraq has no means to have
sanctions lifted.
	   While the scope and framework of the comprehensive review remain
unclear, some council members say it is vital to restore the
working relationship between Iraq and inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission.
	   ``We should assess the work of UNSCOM, what progress they made
in what kind of areas,'' said China's deputy ambassador Shen
Guofang. ``If they made some progress, then we should give some
response to the progress.''
	   The latest draft resolution includes softer language on
Baghdad's decision to end its cooperation with inspectors. Instead
of calling the move a ``clear and flagrant violation'' of Iraq's
obligations, the new draft speaks of a ``totally unacceptable
contravention.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson said Tuesday that if the
suspension of regular sanctions reviews failed to force Iraq to
comply, Secretary-General Kofi Annan should get personally involved
to break the impasse.
	   Annan in February brokered an accord that allowed inspectors to
visit presidential palaces which Iraq had declared off limits.
	   Because Iraq has repudiated Annan's accord, ``I believe that
sometime soon he should actively consider personal diplomacy: going
back to Baghdad and saying `you violated my agreement and this is
intolerable,''' Richardson said.
	   ``His prestige is on the line, too,'' Richardson said.

Kosovo Albanians surrender arms while villages leveled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZHUR, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With a ``please'' and a ``thank you,''
Serb police collected dozens of rifles, machine guns and hand
grenades from residents of this prosperous Kosovo Albanian village.
	   ``The police know now we have no guns,'' said Resat Gavazaj, a
53-year-old ethnic Albanian who helped organize the weekend weapons
collection. ``The fighting will never come here. We thank them
very, very much.''
	   Down the road, residents said the Serbs' ``polite'' requests for
their weapons are backed by implicit threats to bomb and burn farms
and villages where the inhabitants refuse to comply.
	   After driving the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army from most
of its strongholds, Serb forces have launched a two-pronged
campaign in an effort to wipe out the ethnic Albanian struggle for
independence.
	   Police have been encouraging Albanians to give up their arms and
return to their homes, saying those who remain loyal to the
government have nothing to fear. Serbian state television has aired
scenes of Albanian civilians walking peacefully home past police,
who help unload food and supplies for the refugees.
	   For villages that do not cooperate, there's another message.
While police were collecting arms from Zhur last weekend, hundred
of troops were leveling four nearby villages. Albanian sources said
the attack killed at least 17 people, injured others and left
thousands without homes, clothing or food.
	   Serbian authorities say they have collected thousands of weapons
from ethnic Albanian villages throughout Kosovo in recent weeks.
But Albanians interviewed this week near Zhur said the Serb
campaign will only drive more Albanians into rebel ranks.
	   ``If I die with a gun in my hands, I die singing,'' said one
bleary-eyed man who witnessed the destruction of his sister's
village within kilometers (miles) of Kosovo's border with Albania.
``I don't want to fight. But who can just watch this killing of
their people.''
	   That spirit was echoed in the mountainside farming village of
Jeskovo, seven kilometers (four miles) from Zhur.
	   ``I just farm,'' said one man who returned Tuesday to salvage
silverware and other possessions from his burned-out home. ``They
took my television. They burned my home. They burned my tractor.
Maybe I resist. What else can I do?''

Tokyo stock market reacts moderately to Wall Street rally, dollar
</HEADLINE>
falls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices edged higher early Wednesday
in a moderate reaction to an overnight rally on Wall Street. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 69.48 points, or 0.47
percent, to 14,982.97 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Tuesday, the average closed up 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar bought 130.80 yen in early morning, down 1.12 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 132.10 yen overnight.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,020.78,
up 380.53 points _ its biggest point gain ever _ after the Federal
Reserve Board signaled it might lower interest rates.
	   Speculation on a possible rate cut came after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicated Friday evening that the financial turmoil in
Asia and Russia may pose more of a threat than inflation.
	   U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for a national
holiday.
	   Until now, Fed officials have said that inflationary pressures
were too strong to fuel borrowing and spending with a cut in
interest rates.
	   Tokyo stocks, however, moved moderately in early trading, hurt
by continued concerns about Japan's faltering economy and
uncertainty in world financial markets.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.08 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,132.09. The
TOPIX closed down 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, on Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the growing expectation that the Fed will lower
interest rates is negatively affecting the dollar, dealers said.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.035 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.020 percent,
driving its price down to 112.82 yen from 112.93 yen.

Agassi wins psychological battle, but loses match to Kucera
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When it came down to pure tennis, and not the
mind games of the night before, Andre Agassi simply couldn't handle
the speed or power of an opponent who rallied from a big deficit in
the final set.
	   Karol Kucera slowly regained his confidence while winning five
straight games as he closed out a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-3
victory Tuesday that took two days to complete because of rain.
	   The win sent No. 9 Kucera, of Slovakia, toward a quarterfinal
match against top-seeded Pete Sampras, while No. 8 Agassi failed to
advance beyond the fourth round in any Grand Slam tournament this
year.
	   A day after the players glared and postured at each other across
the net, there was little emotion as an embattled Kucera saved two
break points that would have given Agassi a 3-0 lead in the final
set.
	   ``Last night it just got to the point where it was so
competitive we could have put on boxing gloves, thrown darts, we
could have done anything not to do with tennis,'' Agassi said.
``Today was all about tennis.''
	   Joining Sampras and Kucera in the quarterfinals was No. 3
Patrick Rafter, the defending champion, as well as Swedes Jonas
Bjorkman, Magnus Larsson and Thomas Johansson.
	   Rafter won 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 over No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic, who
was penalized a point in the final set for throwing his racket.
That match also was stopped by rain Monday night, with Rafter up a
set.
	   Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna reached the women's semifinals
with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Patty Schnyder, who ousted Steffi Graf on
Sunday. No. 3 Novotna will face the winner of Tuesday night's
quarterfinal between top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 6 Monica
Seles.
	   Kucera overpowered the mistake-ridden Agassi at the start of the
match Monday night, quickly taking a two-set advantage and a 4-2
lead in the third set. That's when Agassi turned the match around
by getting under Kucera's skin.
	   Kucera had struggled with his service toss throughout the first
three sets, repeatedly catching the ball instead of hitting it.
Agassi complained twice to umpire Norm Chryst, then took matters
into his own hands _ mocking his opponent by catching his own
tosses.
	   ``The guy's tossing it up and catching it. Is that the way it
should be played?'' Agassi complained. ``By the time we get 16, 17
times, I had a problem with it. At some stage, whether he meant it
or not, it's not acceptable. I think as he got nervous to close me
out in the third set, the worst part of his game started getting
worse.''
	   The players then engaged in long exchanges of moonballs,
punctuating their psychological battle with angry glares.
	   ``I didn't do it on purpose. My ball toss was not good
yesterday,'' Kucera said. ``Andre did a little show. In my eyes,
Andre turned around the match a little bit not fair.''
	   The ploy worked for Agassi, who rallied to win the third set and
was leading 3-0 in the fourth when rain wiped out play for the
night. Agassi kept the momentum when play resumed Tuesday,
finishing off the fourth set and taking the early lead in the
fifth.
	   Agassi got to set point in the fourth set with a brilliant
crosscourt shot on which he ran down a lob and snapped an overhead
past Kucera _ who applauded the shot as Agassi nodded his head in
pleasure.
	   With the crowd against him and his confidence sagging, Kucera
began his comeback by struggling to hold serve in the third game of
the final set.
	   ``He wasn't making mistakes at all and I just had to win a
couple of points to get confident again,'' he said. ``It was luck
for me that I could win my game when I was 2-0 down and 15-40.''
	   As Agassi hit a backhand long to end the match, Kucera looked to
the darkening sky in relief and Agassi dipped his head in despair.
	   Kucera, who had lost in the first round of the U.S. Open in each
of his four appearances before this year, became the first player
since Jim Courier in 1991 to defeat Sampras and Agassi in Grand
Slam matches in the same year. Kucera upset Sampras in the
quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open.
	   Though Agassi has returned to tennis' elite after being
relegated to satellite tournaments late last year, he remains far
from the form that led him to three Grand Slam titles _ including
the 1994 U.S. Open championship.
	   ``By my normal standards, it's certainly been a bad year,''
Agassi said. ``But I've got to keep it all in contest because of
how long it's been since I've even been competitive.''

Tanker truck explodes near two buses, killing 53
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with more color and quotes by survivors. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Temperatures reached 1,500 Celsius
(2,700 Fahrenheit) inside two Brazilian buses ignited by a tanker
truck that overturned, exploded and incinerated 53 people and
injuring dozens more, many on their way home from a religious
festival.
	   A tanker truck carrying 26,000 liters (6,750 gallons) of diesel
and 6,000 liters (1,550 gallons) of gasoline flipped over early
Tuesday morning on the Anhanguera Highway near Araras, about 110
miles (180 kilometers) northwest of Sao Paulo, the fire department
said.
	   A liquor truck rammed the tanker, spilling the fuel the tanker
was carrying. The two buses drove by and were in the pool of
flammable liquid when it burst into flame, said Wilson Lima of the
Araras fire department.
	   ``It was incredible bad luck,'' he said. ``They just happened to
be right on top when it exploded. The victims were carbonized.''
	   Images filmed by an amateur cameraman and aired by the Globo TV
network showed the vehicles completely engulfed by flames as high
as 10 meters (33 feet).
	   TV footage showed a long stretch of the highway's median strip
charred black, a row of wooden coffins on the roadside and firemen
carrying black plastic bags with body parts in them.
	   The coffins were taken to the Araras morgue, where they filled
two rooms, and from there to better equipped facilities in the city
of Campinas, where a team of forensic experts and dentists will try
to identify the remains.
	   Firemen quoted by the network said pieces of aluminum from the
buses had welded together, indicating temperatures were as high as
1,500 degrees Celsius, or 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
	   The four vehicles were reduced to a heap of twisted and charred
metal.
	   ``It was horrible. People were screaming _ their bodies on fire
_ and trying desperately to escape through the windows,'' Priscila
Cordeiro, one of the survivors told TV Globo. ``None of us could do
anything to help. We would have died if we tried.''
	   Joao Mesquita managed to save himself and his two-year-old son,
but his wife died in the flames.
	   ``It all happened very quickly,'' he said. ``The fire destroyed
everything within minutes.''
	   Many passengers escaped with minor injuries. Lima said 39 people
were hospitalized in Araras and Leme, but most were released.
	   The buses were heading to the midwestern city of Anapolis with
pilgrims returning from Aparecida do Norte, a town 110 miles (175
kilometers) east of Sao Paulo that houses the basilica of Our Lady
Revealed, Brazil's patron saint.
	   Some 50,000 people attended a mass and protest rally in
Aparecida do Norte on Monday, Brazil's independence day. The rally
was part of a nationwide protest against poverty and unemployment.
	   Earlier, the fire department had reported 57 fatalities, but
lowered the death toll based on reports from the city morgue.

Brazil's old-fashioned soccer clubs to go modern _ and profitable?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TANYA WEINBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Internazionale star Ronaldo was
returning to Italy, but his heart remained in Rio. His dream was to
play here for his first love, Flamengo.
	   But that won't happen any time soon, he said. Despite four World
Cup titles, Brazilian soccer is too big a mess.
	   ``I wouldn't return to Brazil now for any offer,'' said Ronaldo,
twice voted player of the year. ``It's a shame there's so much
disorganization, especially in Rio.''
	   The problem is the antiquated, amateurish management of
Brazilian clubs. Multi-million dollar enterprises, churning out
some of the world's best players, are run as adjuncts of
not-for-profit social clubs. Directors are die-hard fans, but not
always good businessmen.
	   The result for many of Brazil's 500-some clubs is slumping
attendance, bad contracts and growing debts.
	   While Spanish and Italian clubs play once a week to packed
stadiums and big TV audiences, top Brazilian teams suit up three
times a week or more just to pay the bills. The best players are
quickly snapped up by European and Asian clubs.
	   Ronaldo went that route in 1994, when PSV Eindhoven of the
Netherlands paid dlrs 6 million to acquire him from Cruzeiro. Three
years later, Inter of Milan had to shell out six times that much to
pry him away from Spain's Barcelona.
	   ``The foreign teams pay more, and in the end we can't keep them
here,'' said Alvaro Barcelos, who recently quit after a ruinous
stint as president of Rio's Fluminense.
	   But all that could be changing. A new law written by soccer
legend Pele, until recently Brazil's Minister of Sports, promises
to turn today's Mom-and-Pop outfits into efficient, modern
corporations.
	   Under the so-called Pele Law, soccer teams must become
companies, and private investors may hold majority control. By
2000, all teams must pay taxes and comply with financial disclosure
laws. Directors can be fired for incompetence and even prosecuted
for malfeasance.
	   For many investors, soccer suddenly looks like a good business
opportunity.
	   ``We already have market and product, quality and public,'' said
Marcos Rechtman, director of the investment bank Bozano, Simonsen,
which is discussing a partnership with Fluminense. ``All we need
now is good management.''
	   Argentina is reaching the same conclusion. Today, only two of 20
first-division teams are financially solid. Racing Club has a debt
of about dlrs 62 million, while popular River Plate owes dlrs 35
million.
	   Dismayed at rowdy fans and decaying, half-empty stadiums, the
government reportedly is pressuring soccer authorities to
professionalize team ownership and management.
	   But club directors are divided over the idea. Big, popular clubs
like Boca Juniors are in favor, mostly because they can muster the
corporate backing to thrive in the new climate. But smaller clubs
fear they won't survive.
	   Although a shakeout is likely, the potential still is enormous.
Brazil alone has 160 million people, and soccer is akin to a
religion _ the 13 largest clubs alone have an estimated 100 million
fans.
	   Yet in 1997, all Brazilian teams combined made just dlrs 100
million from TV contracts, barely more than the dlrs 90 million
earned by England's Manchester United alone.
	   The first step is to bring in top-flight, independent
management, says Elena Landau of fund manager Opportunity S.A.,
which is working on a deal with Flamengo.
	   Landau sees a potential goldmine in Flamengo, a club with 25
million fans and five national titles. But in the past five years,
Flamengo has been cited 372 times in lawsuits for late or
non-payment of taxes and salaries. Its debt is put at dlrs 60
million.
	   ``We want to go straight to the London market,'' said Landau,
who used to head the Brazilian government's privatization program.
Shares of English clubs already trade there, and she expects
investors in Flamengo stock to generate revenue to buy big-name
stars _ maybe even Ronaldo.
	   Opportunity broke ground when it paid dlrs 15 million for a 51
percent stake in Esporte Clube Bahia, S.A., a traditional club in
northeastern Brazil that had fallen on hard times.
	   The injection wiped out the club's dlrs 10 million debt, and
three months later Bahia was state champion. Now Opportunity is
renegotiating Bahia's contract with Korean automaker Hyundai,
asking for dlrs 13.5 million, up from dlrs 1.8 million last year.
	   ``The object of the professionalization of soccer management is
to have big companies use soccer to market their brands,'' says
Alceu Lisboa, an executive at Esporte Clube Bahia.
	   The biggest deal so far belongs to NationsBank Corp. of the
United States. The bank will invest dlrs 150 million in current
national champion Vasco da Gama of Rio to refurbish its stadium and
handle all marketing for the club for 10 years.
	   Across town, Fluminense hopes Bozano, Simonsen is the answer to
its problems. The century-old club of Rio's elite _ former FIFA
President Joao Havelange is a member _ is mired in the second
division, with salaries months behind and a debt of nearly dlrs 30
million.
	   But director Rechtman has certain conditions. The bank wants
Fluminense to be part of an independent league, beyond the politics
of the Rio Soccer Federation. And it wants to run soccer on a
strictly-business basis.
	   ``Mixing business with a national passion leads to
irrationality, which is everything the investor doesn't want,'' he
says.
	   Will that reduce Brazil's national passion to a cold bottom
line?
	   No, says Rio sociologist (and Flamengo fan) Ronaldo Helal.
``It's modernization that will save a tradition,'' he says.
``Anything that kills the passion is bad for business.''

Trophy named for King; Sanchez Vicario beats Jordan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The winning trophy at the Chase Championships
will be named after tennis great Billie Jean King.
	   King founded the WTA and became its first president in 1974, and
led the fight that gave women equal prize money with men at the
U.S. Open.
	   ``The trophy is a tribute to all of the women who paved the way
for the tour,'' King said. ``I truly hope it will be a bridge from
our generation to the future players of this great sport.''
	   King's win over Bobby Riggs in the ``Battle of the Sexes'' on
Sept. 20, 1973, was among the highlights of her career, attracting
the largest audience at the time for a single tennis match.
	   In all, she won 39 Grand Slam titles, including six Wimbledon
and four U.S. Open singles titles.
	   The season-ending Chase Championships brings together the top 16
singles players and the top eight double teams. This year's event
will be played Nov. 16-22 at Madison Square Garden.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; ARANTXA EDGES JORDAN BY 10: &LR;  Score it Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
1, Michael Jordan 0.
	   Sanchez Vicario, the 1994 U.S. Open champion and three-time
winner of the French Open, will receive Spain's prestigious
``Principe de Asturias'' award for her lifetime achievement in
tennis.
	   Sanchez Vicario was informed of the award by another Spaniard,
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic
Committee and a member of the voting panel.
	   ``This is a great honor,'' Sanchez Vicario said. ``I have been
nominated several times before and when I least expect it, I get
it.''
	   Sanchez Vicario also led Spain to the Fed Cup victory four times
since 1991.
	   The award is the Spanish equivalent of the Nobel Prize and
Sanchez Vicario is only the third female athlete to receive this
honor.
	   Sanchez Vicario edged Jordan by 10 votes.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOMER HO-HUM: &LR;  Not everyone is intrigued by Mark McGwire's
chase of the home run record.
	   ``In Europe nobody cares about baseball. It is just big here in
the States,'' Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic said. ``Probably for
American people, it's a great sport. For them, soccer is boring.
For us, baseball is boring.''
	   Ivanisevic said he couldn't avoid the news about McGwire's 61st.
	   ``I heard on TV, you know, But I don't follow baseball so
much,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   But Ivanisevic can easily tell you who came in third in soccer's
World Cup this past summer _ Croatia.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; PARENT-PLAYER CONNECTION EXAMINED: &LR;  More than 97 percent of
junior players said they feel self-imposed pressure to win, while
53 percent reported their parents put ``a little'' pressure on
them, according to a survey released Tuesday.
	   Rodney Harmon, director of the U.S. Tennis Association's
Multicultural Development program, pointed out the differences
between European countries and the United States in developing
players, with foreign tennis federations providing much more
support.
	   The survey, on the relationship between junior players and their
parents, also found little distinction between amateur and pro
abroad, which allows for a competitive advantage for foreign
players in the junior rankings.
	   And more than 90 percent of the players questioned believe that
foreign players are not more talented but give more priority to
tennis than to schoolwork.
	   Despite the number of personal coaches, tennis academies and
developmental programs, a majority of the families endorsed the
need for better guidance in dealing with the competitive system as
well as the pressure.

	   McGwire connected with two outs off Steve Trachsel, setting off
a wild celebration in Busch Stadium. He was so caught up in the
moment that he actually missed first base as he rounded the bag and
had to return to touch it.
	   From there, McGwire got handshakes from every Chicago infielder
and a hug from catcher Scott Servais. Cubs right fielder Sammy
Sosa, who had 58 home runs, ran in from right field to hug McGwire
and give his rival a high five.
	   McGwire was mobbed by his teammates at home plate, where he
hoisted his 10-year-old batboy son Matt into the air.
	   McGwire then ran into the seats to hug the family of Roger
Maris, whose 37-year-old record he had just broken.

Ivanisevic penalized for slamming racket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic's temper cost him at the U.S.
Open Tuesday in his fourth-round loss to defending champion Pat
Rafter.
	   In the fifth game of the fourth set, with Rafter serving and
leading 3-1, Ivanisevic wasted three break points. The third time,
a frustrated Ivanisevic slammed his racket to the court.
	   Referee Mike Morrissey gave Ivanisevic a code violation, and
since the Croatian player earlier had been called for ball abuse
after hitting the ball up in the stands after another outburst, the
second violation cost him a point penalty.
	   ``It was a chance to get me back in the match. And then I come
up with three bad returns, two miss-hits completely and one
backhand,'' Ivanisevic said. ``Then it's tough. He's pumped, then I
got a penalty point.''
	   Instead of being deuce, Rafter had the ad, and won the next
point for a 4-1 lead.
	   Ivanisevic dropped his serve in the next game and Rafter held to
win the match, 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
	   Ivanisevic also will be given a fine for his outbursts.

Baseball star bringing Americans back to American pastime

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with McGwire breaking the record
 &UR; AP Photos XRON101, STH102 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEF FEDERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Each time Mark McGwire goes to work, millions of
Americans are watching.
	   Radio and television stations provide nearly instantaneous
updates on his every move. And each morning, his latest
accomplishments appear on front pages of newspapers across the
country.
	   It may be the most attention the country has ever given to a
professional baseball player.
	   McGwire, the gargantuan first baseman of the St. Louis
Cardinals, has been on a season-long march to break the
single-season home run record _ perhaps the most hallowed mark in
American sports.
	   On Tuesday night, he broke the 37-year-old record with his 62nd
home run, a lined shot to left. And there were still 18 games left
in the season.
	   McGwire's assault on the record has turned him into a celebrity
and injected new life into a troubled sport that prides itself as
being ``America's pastime.'' But the race for the record books has
had its price: McGwire has come under fire for using
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Few things in sports are as dramatic _ or difficult _ as hitting
a home run _ a connection that drives the ball out of the playing
field. Depending on the situation, a home run can drive in from one
to four points _ known as runs _ and instantly change the tone of a
game.
	   A player who hits 20 home runs _ out of more than 500 at bats
during the season _ is considered solid. One who hits 40 is a
superstar. Sixty? Before this season, only two men had ever done
it: The legendary Babe Ruth, who hit 60 in 1927, and Roger Maris,
who broke Ruth's record by hitting 61 in 1961.
	   McGwire has been spurred on by Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs,
who currently has 58 homers. Sosa is his own storybook tale, rising
out of poverty in the Dominican Republic to become a top player.
	   But McGwire has got the most attention, both because he has held
the lead most of the season and because of the sheer beauty of his
hits.
	   If a home run is baseball art, then McGwire is the sport's
Michelangelo. His home runs are hit so hard and fly so far _ some
have been measured at more than 500 feet (150 meters) _ that
commentators say he is baseball's most imposing figure since Ruth.
	   ``His sheer size and the incredible distance he hits so many of
his home runs make him on some levels larger than life,'' said Bill
McGill, a retired professor who edits the baseball literary
magazine ``Spitball.''
	   Although the Cardinals have been out of playoff contention for
most of the year, their games have taken on a rock concert
atmosphere _ with McGwire at center stage.
	   Wherever the Cardinals play, hundreds of fans flock to the
stadium hours before the game to watch the giant redhead take
batting practice.
	   During games, the atmosphere is electric when the 6-foot-5
(2-meter), 250-pound (110-kilo) McGwire steps up to bat. The crowd
rises to its feet. Hundreds of flashbulbs flicker in the stands.
And if McGwire swings and misses, there's a collective groan of
disappointment.
	   But when he connects, there's bedlam, even in opposing
ballparks. Crowds have even resorted to booing their own pitchers
if they do not throw McGwire a pitch to hit.
	   ``I wish everybody in baseball could feel the reception I'm
getting,'' McGwire said recently.
	   When McGwire hit his record-tying 61st homer on Monday, many in
the crowd in St. Louis were moved to tears as he ran around the
bases with a fist thrust high.
	   McGwire's father, celebrating his 61st birthday, was on hand, as
was the player's 10-year-old son. Sosa, playing against McGwire
that night, clapped in appreciation.
	   Despite the fairy tale season, not all has gone smoothly.
McGwire has had to cope with intense media coverage and overzealous
fans. And last month, a reporter discovered McGwire was taking
androstenedione, a dietary supplement that builds lean muscle mass
and promotes recovery after injury.
	   Although legal in baseball, the drug is banned by the Olympics,
U.S. football and collegiate sports. While no one has questioned
McGwire's ability _ he has hit more than 50 homers for three
straight seasons _ some believe it has tarnished the season.
	   But the naysayers are clearly a minority. By most accounts,
McGwire has given new life to a sport troubled in recent years by a
strike, poor sportsmanship and the game's slow pace.
	   According to a poll conducted for The Associated Press last
month, nearly half of all Americans are paying more attention to
baseball because of the home run race.
	   ``I'm not a big baseball fan, but I'll be watching just to see
him break the record,'' said legal secretary Michelle Ruddle,
echoing the sentiments of many. ``It's breaking a record. It's
history.''

	   There was no scramble for the souvenir that could have been
worth up to dlrs 1 million.
	   The 341-foot home run was the shortest of the season for
McGwire, and landed in an area where no fan could get it just over
the left-field wall.
	   With the sellout crowd still standing and cheering, McGwire
grabbed a microphone to address the fans.
	   ``To all my family, my son, the Cubs, Sammy Sosa. It's
unbelievable,'' McGwire said. ``Thank you, St. Louis.''
	   McGwire, who grounded out on a 3-0 pitch in the first inning,
hit his solo shot on the first pitch at 8:18 p.m. (0118 GMT). It
triggered an 11-minute delay, baseball's biggest midgame
celebration since Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games
record in 1995.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hingis defeating Seles, Philippoussis winning;
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A child's voice plaintively called out
``Mon-ee-ka'' in the match's waning moments, but it had little more
effect than any of Monica Seles' shots did against the chilling
precision of Martina Hingis.
	   The top-seeded Hingis made just 16 unforced errors in a 6-4, 6-4
win over No. 6 Seles on a cool Tuesday night at the U.S. Open to
reach her ninth straight Grand Slam semifinal.
	   Hingis closed out the match with her second ace, then jumped for
joy and pumped her right arm in the air. The match included several
long, fascinating rallies in which both players made acrobatic
saves.
	   Seles had defeated Hingis in their only two previous matches
this year, including the semifinals of the French Open. But Hingis
was nearly perfect Tuesday night, losing just seven points on her
serve in the first set.
	   ``I was a little worried going into the match because I wasn't
playing my best and I lost two times to Monica before this,''
Hingis said. ``I was playing well tonight, my serve was very good
and I didn't make any mistakes. I was on a good wave.''
	   The temperature was just 66 during the match, and a 21 mph (34
kph) wind that swirled around the Arthur Ashe Stadium court made it
feel like 55 Fahrenheit (13 Celsius).
	   Hingis will face No. 3 Jana Novotna in the semifinals. Novotna,
the Wimbledon champion, advanced earlier Tuesday with a 6-2, 6-3
win over Patty Schnyder, who ousted Steffi Graf on Sunday.
	   When it came down to pure tennis, and not the mind games of the
night before, Andre Agassi simply couldn't handle the speed or
power of an opponent who rallied from a big deficit in the final
set.
	   Karol Kucera slowly regained his confidence while winning five
straight games as he closed out a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-3
victory that took two days to complete because of rain.
	   The win sent No. 9 Kucera toward a quarterfinal match against
top-seeded Pete Sampras, while No. 8 Agassi failed to advance
beyond the fourth round in any Grand Slam tournament this year.
	   A day after the players glared and postured at each other across
the net, there was little emotion as an embattled Kucera saved two
break points that would have given Agassi a 3-0 lead in the final
set.
	   ``Last night it just got to the point where it was so
competitive we could have put on boxing gloves, thrown darts, we
could have done anything not to do with tennis,'' Agassi said.
``Today was all about tennis.''
	   Joining Sampras and Kucera in the quarterfinals was No. 3
Patrick Rafter, the defending champion, as well as Mark
Philippoussis and Swedes Jonas Bjorkman, Magnus Larsson and Thomas
Johansson.
	   Rafter won 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 over No. 14 Goran Ivanisevic, who
was penalized a point in the final set for throwing his racket.
That match also was stopped by rain Monday night, with Rafter up a
set.
	   Philippoussis, an unseeded Australian, reached his second
straight Grand Slam quarterfinals with a 7-5, 0-6, 6-4, 6-1 win
over 13th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain.
	   Kucera overpowered the mistake-ridden Agassi at the start of the
match Monday night, quickly taking a two-set advantage and a 4-2
lead in the third set. That's when Agassi turned the match around
by getting under Kucera's skin.
	   Kucera had struggled with his service toss throughout the first
three sets, repeatedly catching the ball instead of hitting it.
Agassi complained twice to umpire Norm Chryst, then took matters
into his own hands _ mocking his opponent by catching his own
tosses.
	   The ploy worked for Agassi, who rallied to win the third set and
was leading 3-0 in the fourth when rain wiped out play for the
night. Agassi kept the momentum when play resumed Tuesday,
finishing off the fourth set and taking the early lead in the
fifth.
	   Agassi got to set point in the fourth set with a brilliant
crosscourt shot on which he ran down a lob and snapped an overhead
past Kucera _ who applauded the shot as Agassi nodded his head in
pleasure.
	   With the crowd against him and his confidence sagging, Kucera
began his comeback by struggling to hold serve in the third game of
the final set.
	   ``He wasn't making mistakes at all and I just had to win a
couple of points to get confident again,'' he said. ``It was luck
for me that I could win my game when I was 2-0 down and 15-40.''
	   As Agassi hit a backhand long to end the match, Kucera looked to
the darkening sky in relief and Agassi dipped his head in despair.
	   Kucera, who had lost in the first round of the U.S. Open in each
of his four appearances before this year, became the first player
since Jim Courier in 1991 to defeat Sampras and Agassi in Grand
Slam matches in the same year. Kucera upset Sampras in the
quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open.
	   Though Agassi has returned to tennis' elite after being
relegated to satellite tournaments late last year, he remains far
from the form that led him to three Grand Slam titles _ including
the 1994 U.S. Open championship.
	   ``By my normal standards, it's certainly been a bad year,''
Agassi said. ``But I've got to keep it all in contest because of
how long it's been since I've even been competitive.''

	   McGwire's race began on March 31 when he hit a grand slam on
opening day, but his chase to become 1998's North American Major
League home run champion is not finished.
	   With the Cardinals out of contention, McGwire may take off a few
days before the season ends Sept. 27. He is just four homers ahead
of Sosa, who figures to play every day down the stretch with the
Cubs still in the NL wild-card race.
	   Like Maris, McGwire broke the mark in an expansion season. But
consider this stat: This year, home runs are being hit at a rate of
2.05 per game; last year, the average was also 2.05.
	   McGwire accomplished his feat in the Cardinals' 145th game,
while Maris' Yankees played 163 in 1961. Before Maris set his
record, commissioner Ford Frick declared any record would carry a
``distinctive mark'' if it did not beat Babe Ruth's mark of 60 in
154 games. But that decision was reversed seven years ago.
	   McGwire picked on his share of young pitchers, hitting eight
home runs off rookies, but other victims included Orel Hershiser
and relief aces Robb Nen and Rod Beck. He connected twice against
World Series MVP Livan Hernandez, including a 545-foot monster
drive that was the longest in Busch history.
	   McGwire actually caused more problems for Arizona's stadium than
its first-year pitching staff. He hit a batting-practice drive that
resulted in dlrs 2,000 damage to the scoreboard at Bank One
Ballpark.

	   His slam off Ramon Martinez started a run in which he homered in
the first four games of the season, tying Willie Mays' record. In
April, he became the first Cardinals player to hit three homers in
a game at Busch.
	   McGwire hit his 400th career homer in May and hit his 37th home
run in June, tying the major league record for most homers before
the All-Star break.
	   In July, he set the mark for the fastest to reach 40 homers in a
season. In August, he came the first player to reach 50 home runs
in three straight years. And then came September and the most
memorable month of all.
	   McGwire's hair never fell out, as it did to Maris when he was
trying to overtake Babe Ruth's record of 60, even though the
expectations and pressure began building way before the Cardinals'
first workout in spring training.
	   At one point in mid-June, McGwire complained that he felt like a
``caged animal'' because of all the attention his batting practice
sessions were attracting. Later in the season, as the media hordes
started to increase, he was stung by a report that he used
androstenedione, an over-the-counter muscle booster that is legal
in major league baseball but banned by the NFL, NCAA and
International Olympic Committee.
	   Prior to McGwire's shot, the home run record had been the
exclusive domain of the New York Yankees since 1920. That was the
year Babe Ruth set the single-season record with 54, and he held
the mark until Maris beat him.
	   In taking the record from a team built on power, McGwire brought
it to one of baseball's most unlikely cities. The Cardinals were a
franchise famous for fastballs _ from Dizzy Dean to Bob Gibson _
and also fast feet _ from the Gashouse Gang.
	   Stan Musial was the most acclaimed slugger in St. Louis history
_ ``I've seen anyone like him, really,'' the Hall of Famer said of
McGwire _ but only two players had ever hit 40 homers for the
Cardinals before Big Mac arrived. Rogers Hornsby hit 42 in 1922 and
Johnny Mize hit 43 in 1940.
	   McGwire quickly destroyed Mize's team record, hitting No. 44 on
July 26 for his only home run of the season at hitter-friendly
Coors Field. In fact, McGwire's worst showing this year might have
been at the All-Star game in Denver, where he failed to advance
beyond the first round of home-run derby.

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Without a doubt or an asterisk, Mark McGwire
and his mighty swing broke Roger Maris' North American baseball
home run record Tuesday night with plenty of games to spare.
	   Historic No. 62 was a lined shot to left, punctuating a chase
that reinvigorated the sport and captivated the United States.
	   McGwire connected with two outs off Steve Trachsel, setting off
a wild celebration in Busch Stadium. He was so caught up in the
moment that he missed first base as he rounded the bag and had to
return to touch it.
	   From there, McGwire got handshakes from every Chicago infielder
and a hug from catcher Scott Servais. Cubs right fielder Sammy
Sosa, who had 58 home runs, ran in from right field to hug McGwire
and give his rival a high five.
	   McGwire was mobbed by his teammates at home plate, where he
hoisted his 10-year-old batboy son Matt into the air.
	   McGwire then ran into the seats to hug the family of Roger
Maris, whose 37-year-old record he had just broken.
	   There was no scramble for the souvenir. The 341-foot home run
was the shortest of the season for McGwire, and landed in an area
where no fan could get it just over the left-field wall.
	   Instead, the ball was picked up by a grounds crew worker, Tim
Forneris, who said he will give it to McGwire.
	   ``I knew it was going out, and it went right over the edge, and
I said, `That's going out,' '' he said. ``So I ran on to the field
and got it.''
	   With the sellout crowd still standing and cheering, McGwire
grabbed a microphone to address the fans.
	   ``To all my family, my son, the Cubs, Sammy Sosa. It's
unbelievable,'' McGwire said. ``Thank you, St. Louis.''
	   McGwire, who grounded out on a 3-0 pitch in the first inning,
hit his solo shot on the first pitch at 8:18 p.m. (0118 GMT). It
triggered an 11-minute delay, baseball's biggest midgame
celebration since Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games
record in 1995.
	   The home run, despite its short distance, surely will rank as
one of the biggest in North American Major League history.
	   The 34-year-old slugger also did it at home, just like he
wanted. McGwire wanted to share the moment with the fans and city
he has embraced.
	   McGwire's race began on March 31 when he hit a grand slam on
opening day, but his chase to become 1998's home run champion is
not finished.
	   With the Cardinals out of contention, McGwire may take off a few
days before the season ends Sept. 27. He is just four homers ahead
of Sosa, who figures to play every day down the stretch with the
Cubs still in the NL wild-card race.
	   McGwire accomplished his feat in the Cardinals' 145th game,
while Maris' Yankees played 163 in 1961. Before Maris set his
record, commissioner Ford Frick declared any record would carry a
``distinctive mark'' if it did not beat Babe Ruth's mark of 60 in
154 games. But that decision was reversed seven years ago.
	   McGwire picked on his share of young pitchers, hitting eight
home runs off rookies, but other victims included Orel Hershiser
and relief aces Robb Nen and Rod Beck. He connected twice against
World Series MVP Livan Hernandez, including a 545-foot monster
drive that was the longest in Busch history.
	   His slam off Ramon Martinez started a run in which he homered in
the first four games of the season, tying Willie Mays' record. In
April, he became the first Cardinals player to hit three homers in
a game at Busch.
	   McGwire hit his 400th career homer in May and hit his 37th home
run in June, tying the major league record for most before the
All-Star break.
	   In July, he set the mark for the fastest to reach 40 homers in a
season. In August, he came the first player to reach 50 home runs
in three straight years. And then came September and the most
memorable month of all.
	   McGwire's hair never fell out, as it did to Maris when he was
trying to overtake Babe Ruth's record of 60, even though the
expectations and pressure began building way before the Cardinals'
first workout in spring training.
	   At one point in mid-June, McGwire complained that he felt like a
``caged animal'' because of all the attention his batting practice
sessions were attracting.

Lindros and Flyers shake on deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Eric Lindros and the Philadelphia Flyers
reached a handshake agreement on a unique, one-year contract
extension arrangement that could keep the star center with the team
through the 1999-2000 season.
	   Carl Lindros, the player's father and agent, called a Tuesday
afternoon press conference to announce the deal. He said he had
reached terms with Flyers team chairman Ed Snider.
	   Neither Snider nor Flyers president Bob Clarke was available for
comment early Tuesday evening. No member of the Flyers organization
attended the press conference at a Philadelphia hotel.
	   The extension was left up to the Flyers' option at the end of
the 1998-99 season and will pay Lindros about the same salary _
dlrs 8.5 million plus bonuses _ that he was to receive under the
Flyers' five-year contract proposal.
	   Nothing was put into writing, according to Gordon Kirke, the
Lindros' legal advisor, because the North American National Hockey
League doesn't permit teams to do so.
	   Eric Lindros said he was satisfied with the arrangement because
it ends negotiations for the time being and will allow him to
concentrate on hockey for the season.
	   ``As you know, I've been very open about my desire to stay in
Philadelphia and play for the Flyers,'' Lindros said. ``We've given
the Flyers this option so that we can all work together this
season.''
	   One of the prime reasons for reaching the agreement was to
eliminate the possibility of Lindros playing out the final year of
his current contract and becoming a Group II restricted free agent
next July 1.
	   If the Flyers pick up the option, Lindros would sign the
extension to play the 1999-2000 season in Philadelphia.
	   Eric Lindros stressed that he ``wants to stay (in Philadelphia),
to play here and to win here.''

Swim stars to miss ceremony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion Michael Klim and
top ranked rival Ian Thorpe have been ordered to miss Friday's
Commonwealth Games opening ceremony to rest ahead of their
200-meter freestyle world record bid.
	   Klim and Thorpe have both indicated that the oldest men's
swimming record, Italian Georgio Lamberti's 1989 mark of one
minute, 46.69 seconds, could come under threat Saturday.
	   Australian swim coach Don Talbot said all swimmers competing
Saturday, including Klim and Thorpe, would be banned from marching
in the opening ceremony to allow them to conserve energy for the
start of competition the next day.
	   ``The normal procedure for us is that the swimmers who swim the
first day do not go to the opening ceremony,'' Talbot said.
``They're going to be standing out in the heat for a long, long
time and that's not conducive to good swimming the next day.''
	   Thorpe came within 0.55 seconds of Lamberti's record at the
Commonwealth Games trials in Melbourne in April where he clocked
the Commonwealth record of 1:47.24, a time that ranks him number
one in the world going into the KL Games.
	   Talbot's opening ceremony ban on swimmers competing on Saturday
also rules Olympic champion Susan O'Neill out of marching in her
third and final Commonwealth Games and West Australian Jennifer
Reilly out of her first.
	   Talbot attempted to play down high hopes on the team, which is
ranked to win 23 gold medals in KL.
	   ``The English team in the women are better than we are,'' Talbot
said. ``The Canadians girls are as good as we are. We're going to
have a tough time.
	   ``In the men's side of things the English team is also good.
We're probably a little ahead of them in most of the events. But in
some we're not. And New Zealand's Danyon Loader is a dual Olympic
gold medalist. You don't write those people off.''

New shooting in clashes between troops, anti-Hun Sen crowds

 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-People Powerless

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rock-throwing demonstrators clashed
with soldiers Wednesday, keeping alive demands for the ouster of
strongman Hun Sen a day after his forces destroyed a protest camp
outside the National Assembly.
	   Soldiers fired volleys of warning shots over the heads of
thousands of protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped at
intersections near the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of
opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Riot police with clubs and shields formed skirmish lines in the
narrow, pot-holed streets. The motorcyclists, who have been a core
of support for Ranariddh and opposition ally Sam Rainsy, taunted
them to come and fight.
	   Hun Sen had sought to stamp out mounting unrest over his
disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26 by sending
hundreds of riot police to scatter about 1,000 people camped in a
park they had dubbed Democracy Square.
	   The police beat women and children who had just finished their
mid-day meal with clubs, rifle butts and shock batons. Several
people were hospitalized, but there has been only one confirmed
death in three days of moves by Hun Sen to reassert his power.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the debris that remained of the tent
city, and a tractor scooped up what they left behind and dumped it
into a truck. Police armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.

Brazil's old-fashioned soccer clubs to go modern _ and profitable?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix category code, changes slug to conform to style &QL; 
 &UR; By TANYA WEINBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Internazionale star Ronaldo was
returning to Italy, but his heart remained in Rio. His dream was to
play here for his first love, Flamengo.
	   But that won't happen any time soon, he said. Despite four World
Cup titles, Brazilian soccer is too big a mess.
	   ``I wouldn't return to Brazil now for any offer,'' said Ronaldo,
twice voted player of the year. ``It's a shame there's so much
disorganization, especially in Rio.''
	   The problem is the antiquated, amateurish management of
Brazilian clubs. Multi-million dollar enterprises, churning out
some of the world's best players, are run as adjuncts of
not-for-profit social clubs. Directors are die-hard fans, but not
always good businessmen.
	   The result for many of Brazil's 500-some clubs is slumping
attendance, bad contracts and growing debts.
	   While Spanish and Italian clubs play once a week to packed
stadiums and big TV audiences, top Brazilian teams suit up three
times a week or more just to pay the bills. The best players are
quickly snapped up by European and Asian clubs.
	   Ronaldo went that route in 1994, when PSV Eindhoven of the
Netherlands paid dlrs 6 million to acquire him from Cruzeiro. Three
years later, Inter of Milan had to shell out six times that much to
pry him away from Spain's Barcelona.
	   ``The foreign teams pay more, and in the end we can't keep them
here,'' said Alvaro Barcelos, who recently quit after a ruinous
stint as president of Rio's Fluminense.
	   But all that could be changing. A new law written by soccer
legend Pele, until recently Brazil's Minister of Sports, promises
to turn today's Mom-and-Pop outfits into efficient, modern
corporations.
	   Under the so-called Pele Law, soccer teams must become
companies, and private investors may hold majority control. By
2000, all teams must pay taxes and comply with financial disclosure
laws. Directors can be fired for incompetence and even prosecuted
for malfeasance.
	   For many investors, soccer suddenly looks like a good business
opportunity.
	   ``We already have market and product, quality and public,'' said
Marcos Rechtman, director of the investment bank Bozano, Simonsen,
which is discussing a partnership with Fluminense. ``All we need
now is good management.''
	   Argentina is reaching the same conclusion. Today, only two of 20
first-division teams are financially solid. Racing Club has a debt
of about dlrs 62 million, while popular River Plate owes dlrs 35
million.
	   Dismayed at rowdy fans and decaying, half-empty stadiums, the
government reportedly is pressuring soccer authorities to
professionalize team ownership and management.
	   But club directors are divided over the idea. Big, popular clubs
like Boca Juniors are in favor, mostly because they can muster the
corporate backing to thrive in the new climate. But smaller clubs
fear they won't survive.
	   Although a shakeout is likely, the potential still is enormous.
Brazil alone has 160 million people, and soccer is akin to a
religion _ the 13 largest clubs alone have an estimated 100 million
fans.
	   Yet in 1997, all Brazilian teams combined made just dlrs 100
million from TV contracts, barely more than the dlrs 90 million
earned by England's Manchester United alone.
	   The first step is to bring in top-flight, independent
management, says Elena Landau of fund manager Opportunity S.A.,
which is working on a deal with Flamengo.
	   Landau sees a potential goldmine in Flamengo, a club with 25
million fans and five national titles. But in the past five years,
Flamengo has been cited 372 times in lawsuits for late or
non-payment of taxes and salaries. Its debt is put at dlrs 60
million.
	   ``We want to go straight to the London market,'' said Landau,
who used to head the Brazilian government's privatization program.
Shares of English clubs already trade there, and she expects
investors in Flamengo stock to generate revenue to buy big-name
stars _ maybe even Ronaldo.
	   Opportunity broke ground when it paid dlrs 15 million for a 51
percent stake in Esporte Clube Bahia, S.A., a traditional club in
northeastern Brazil that had fallen on hard times.
	   The injection wiped out the club's dlrs 10 million debt, and
three months later Bahia was state champion. Now Opportunity is
renegotiating Bahia's contract with Korean automaker Hyundai,
asking for dlrs 13.5 million, up from dlrs 1.8 million last year.
	   ``The object of the professionalization of soccer management is
to have big companies use soccer to market their brands,'' says
Alceu Lisboa, an executive at Esporte Clube Bahia.
	   The biggest deal so far belongs to NationsBank Corp. of the
United States. The bank will invest dlrs 150 million in current
national champion Vasco da Gama of Rio to refurbish its stadium and
handle all marketing for the club for 10 years.
	   Across town, Fluminense hopes Bozano, Simonsen is the answer to
its problems. The century-old club of Rio's elite _ former FIFA
President Joao Havelange is a member _ is mired in the second
division, with salaries months behind and a debt of nearly dlrs 30
million.
	   But director Rechtman has certain conditions. The bank wants
Fluminense to be part of an independent league, beyond the politics
of the Rio Soccer Federation. And it wants to run soccer on a
strictly-business basis.
	   ``Mixing business with a national passion leads to
irrationality, which is everything the investor doesn't want,'' he
says.
	   Will that reduce Brazil's national passion to a cold bottom
line?
	   No, says Rio sociologist (and Flamengo fan) Ronaldo Helal.
``It's modernization that will save a tradition,'' he says.
``Anything that kills the passion is bad for business.''

Kurosawa left a screenplay about feudal age courtesans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, the legendary Japanese filmmaker
who died Sunday of a stroke, had completed a final screenplay about
prostitutes in the feudal age, his production company said
Wednesday.
	   The script was entitled ``The Sea Was Watching'' and would have
been the basis for Kurosawa's 31st movie, said Hiroko Idetsu, a
spokesman for Kurosawa Productions.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper said that Kurosawa had
made significant progress on the project by the time he died and
that the script contained director's notes and sketches for
filming.
	   Had Kurosawa been able to finish the movie, it would have been
his first to focus entirely on women, the Yomiuri said. Most of the
director's films were centered around a strong male hero.
	   Kurosawa adapted the screenplay from short stories by the
Japanese author Shugoro Yamamoto. He had already asked a well-known
Japanese actress to play the lead role, the Yomiuri said.
	   Japanese cinema luminaries, close friends and relatives paid
tribute to the creator of ``Rashomon'' and the ``Seven Samurai'' at
a private funeral service Tuesday. Kurosawa died in Tokyo at the
age of 88.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rock-throwing demonstrators clashed
with security forces swinging clubs and firing guns Wednesday,
keeping alive demands for the ouster of strongman Hun Sen a day
after riot police destroyed a protest camp outside the National
Assembly.
	   Soldiers fired volleys of warning shots over the heads of
thousands of protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi drivers, grouped at
intersections near the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of
opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Riot police with clubs and shields formed skirmish lines in the
narrow, pot-holed streets, then charged the protesters and
journalists, clubbing people trapped against the walls to the
ground. APTV cameraman Jerry Harmer was smashed in the head and
rushed to a hospital.
	   Local radio reports also said a Buddhist monk was struck by a
bullet in the leg. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The motorcyclists, who have been a core of support for Ranariddh
and opposition ally Sam Rainsy, taunted the soldiers and police to
come and fight. Some unloaded bags of rocks they had collected into
piles for use as ammunition.
	   Sam Rainsy was still holed up under United Nations protection in
local U.N. offices of the Cambodia hotel. Hun Sen had ordered his
arrest Monday after grenades were thrown at his home, then
rescinded the order Tuesday. But Sam Rainsy's supporters doubted
Hun Sen's sincerity.
	   ``Now maybe there is no leader,'' said Meg Viasnar, 22, one of
several hundred students who joined the motorcyclists. ``Maybe now
students and monks will lead the movement. We don't want Hun Sen
anymore. The situation in Cambodia now is very dangerous.''
	   Hundreds of people crowded around the walls of the U.S. Embassy,
apparently seeking protection. Ranariddh's headquarters is across
the street. Supporters said the prince was not inside.
	   The clashes came a day after Hun Sen sought to stamp out
mounting unrest over his disputed victory in parliamentary
elections July 26 by sending hundreds of riot police to scatter
about 1,000 people camped in a park they had dubbed Democracy
Square.
	   The police beat women and children who had just finished their
mid-day meal. Several people were hospitalized, but there has been
only one confirmed death in three days of moves by Hun Sen to
reassert his power.
	   Scavengers picked through the bamboo poles, straw mats and
plastic sheeting Wednesday in the waste that remained of the tent
city, and a tractor scooped debris into a truck. Police armed with
Kalashnikov rifles stood guard.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy allege Hun Sen rigged the election to
ensure his Cambodian People's Party won. The election was an
attempt by Hun Sen to regain international legitimacy after he
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year.
	   The CPP won a narrow majority but fell short of the two-thirds
needed to form a government. Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC and the
Sam Rainsy Party threatened to boycott the assembly, scheduled to
meet Sept. 24 and stop a government from being formed.

Newspapers: Manchester United board agrees to sell to Murdoch-owned

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The board of one of the world's wealthiest soccer
clubs has accepted a buyout offer from a satellite television
company owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, newspapers reported
Wednesday.
	   Quoting unnamed market sources and sources close to the
negotiations, newspapers reported that the deal between BSkyB and
Manchester United was signed and sealed Tuesday night at a price of
625 million pounds (dlrs 1 billion).
	   The Times, which is also owned by Murdoch, said the deal was the
most lucrative acquisition of a sports club in the world, and would
be formally announced later Wednesday at the opening of the London
Stock Exchange.
	   Both BSkyB and Manchester United declined to comment on the
reported deal.
	   The Times said that the deal came together when the offering
price rose from 230 pence (dlrs 3.70) per share to 240 pence (dlrs
3.85), valuing it at 50 million pounds (dlrs 80 million) more than
expected.
	   The Financial Times reported Wednesday that after 36 hours of
meetings, Manchester United board's vote was unanimous, despite
concerns voiced by fans and politicians.
	   The takeover has to be approved by the club's shareholders and
the government, although BSkyB is confident its purchase does not
breach competition rules, the Financial Times said.
	   But fans, soccer officials and even government ministers have
lashed out at the proposal, fearing it would give the
Australian-born media baron a stranglehold on Premier League
soccer. BSkyB plans a campaign to win public support for the deal,
the Financial Times said.
	   Joe Ashton, chairman of the government's all-party Football
Committee, said there should be a non-partisan effort to stop the
deal.
	   ``We're not just concerned, we're trying to stop it. That
includes the Conservatives and Liberals in our group as well,''
Ashton, a member of Tony Blair's Labor Government, said Tuesday.
	   ``This isn't in the public interest,'' he told BBC radio.
``Murdoch wants to sit on one side of the table offering a price
for televised games then move round and sit on the other side for
Manchester United, accepting or rejecting it.
	   ``That can't be fair. That can't be a fair trading practice,''
he said, suggesting the deal should be scrutinized by the Office of
Fair Trading _ a regulatory body.
	   Fans were reportedly planning demonstrations at Old Trafford
stadium to protest against what they view as plans by chairman
Martin Edwards to ``sell out.''
	   The Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association has
publicly opposed the deal and had planned a meeting Tuesday night
to vote on what action to take.
	   David Mellor, chairman of the government's Football Task Force
and a former British Sports Minister, said Manchester United
directors should draw back from committing ``an act of cardinal
folly.''
	   Mellor, who said he was not speaking on behalf of the Task
Force, said he was concerned ``this proud club with all its
traditions'' could become ``just a pawn in a global media
power-play by Rupert Murdoch.''
	   Murdoch's offer values the club at 212 million pounds (dlrs 350
million) more than its closing price on the Stock Market on Friday
before news of the talks emerged.
	   Edwards, Manchester United's chief executive, owns a 14 percent
stake in the club and stands to earn 85 million pounds (dlrs 135
million) from the BSkyB acquisition, the Times said.

Development requires respect for rights, U.N. official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) - Economic development must be accompanied by
respect for human rights, U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson
said Wednesday.
	   Chinese leaders contend that economic development must take
precedence over social and political rights, but Robinson said the
two were interdependent.
	   ``We should never forget that respect for human rights requires
social justice as an essential prerequisite for sustainable
development,'' said Robinson, who is making the first ever official
mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner for human rights.
	   ``In this sense, the right to development expresses a
fundamental value predicated upon respect for all human rights.''
Robinson said in a speech marking the presentation of a U.N. report
on worldwide human development.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials have
indicated she would be unlikely to meet with government critics
during her 10-day stay, despite her stated desire to meet a ``wide
range'' of Chinese.
	   Minutes before Robinson arrived at a Beijing hotel to deliver
her speech, plainclothes security officers and hotel guards dragged
away Chu Hailan, who has been seeking the release on medical
grounds of her husband, veteran political prisoner Liu Nianchun.
	   Chu was standing quietly at the front door of the hotel, waiting
for Robinson to arrive, when security officers pulled her yelling
and struggling into the hotel lobby and led her away.
	   Asked about the incident, Robinson said, ``Obviously, I would be
concerned about any issue such as that, but I don't know anything
about it.''
	   Liu, one of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, has been
in detention for more than three years without trial. According to
Chu, he suffers from high blood pressure, stomach problems and
other ailments.
	   Robinson is treading a careful line. She hopes to promote human
rights and nurture a nascent dialogue with China's Communist Party
leaders without alienating them.
	   China has been leery of discussing human rights with the United
Nations. The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.

This year's anniversary of Pinochet's coup will be different
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES story from previous cycle with conclusion of Mass and
Pinochet's decision not to attend. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY91 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ It will be a legal holiday for the last
time. There will be no military parades. And Gen. Augusto Pinochet
is no longer the army's commander in chief.
	   The 25th anniversary of Pinochet's bloody military coup of Sept.
11, 1973 will not be just like the others. But there will be
similarities.
	   Authorities say privately that they expect the usual clashes, as
well as continuing protests over human rights abuses under
Pinochet.
	   In past years, military and right-wing anniversary celebrations
and the creation of the national holiday marking the coup have
infuriated the thousands of people who suffered under Pinochet's
repression.
	   This year, leftist groups said they would challenge a ban on
marching past the presidential palace on Friday by including the
building on their route to the General Cemetery for a tribute to
Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president overthrown
by Pinochet.
	   Pinochet, 82, ruled until March 1990. He retained the powerful
post of army commander until March, when he was made a senator for
life _ a job he gave himself in the constitution he wrote.
	   According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded
his, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons during his
dictatorship, including 1,102 who disappeared after Pinochet's
security agents detained them. Thousands more were tortured or
forced into exile, or both.
	   The coup anniversary has been a legal holiday since 1981. The
right-wing controlled Senate has blocked three attempts by
post-Pinochet civilian governments to drop it.
	   But last week, in a surprise move, Pinochet agreed to replace
the holiday with a ``day of national unity,'' to be observed on the
first Monday in September starting in 1999.
	   Pinochet said he acted ``for the sake of national unity and
reconciliation among Chileans.''
	   Senate President Andres Zaldivar and rightist senators promptly
approved the measure.
	   ``This will contribute to improved relations between civilians
and military,'' Zaldivar told The Associated Press. But, he said,
``it also shows that Pinochet retains a very decisive leadership on
the political right. His word still has a very strong power
there.''
	   The decision to eliminate the coup holiday was followed by other
surprises: The commanders of the armed forces and the national
police said that there will be no anniversary celebrations at the
barracks this year, a change the government called ``positive,
important, valuable.''
	   The top military commanders joined President Eduardo Frei and
other government officials in Tuesday night Mass for national
reconciliation in which Santiago Archbishop Francisco Errazuriz
urged ``a great national embrace'' of unity among Chileans.
	   Pinochet did not attend and the reasons for his absence were not
known.
	   Still, victims' relatives have angrily objected to establishing
a day of national unity, saying the military should first disclose
the whereabouts of their missing loved ones and show repentance.
	   In a rare interview with Radio Cooperativa of Santiago on
Thursday, Pinochet said dropping the holiday was a gesture in that
direction.
	   Leftists ``keep asking for gestures from us, but they do not
make any,'' he said. ``I don't think reconciliation may occur now
because a very deep hatred still exists.''
	   And in an interview published Sunday in the Santiago daily El
Mercurio, Pinochet claimed he has no information on the whereabouts
of the missing. ``I have asked some friends of mine, and no one
knows anything,'' he said.
	   Even some rightists admit that the issue of human rights
violations, especially the uncertainty over those who have
disappeared, is a big obstacle to reconciliation.
	   ``It is an open wound in our society that must be cured,'' said
Joaquin Lavin, the strongest right-wing presidential candidate for
next year's election and an avowed Pinochet supporter.

Tokyo stocks fall back at midday, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rumors that a major Japanese bank was in serious
financial trouble pushed Tokyo share prices lower by midday
Wednesday. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 81.67 points, or 0.55
percent, ending the morning session at 14,831.82. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 123.43 points, or 0.83 percent.
	   The dollar was trading at 131.68 yen midday, down 0.24 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo. It fell as low as 130.45 yen Wednesday
morning. The dollar bought 132.10 yen in late New York trading
overnight.
	   The Nikkei, which started out higher following overnight gains
in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, was later dragged
down by a fall in bank shares, traders said.
	   Speculation, later denied by the bank, that Fuji Bank Ltd. faces
huge losses overseas set off selling in the banking sector, they
said.
	   ``With lack of positive news for banks lately, the rumors hurt
market sentiment,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities.
	   Worries about Fuji Bank also helped the dollar recover earlier
losses. The dollar has been under selling pressure amid growing
speculation about a possible U.S. interest rate cut.
	   Speculation on a possible rate cut came after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicated Friday that the financial turmoil in Asia and
Russia may pose a greater threat than inflation.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 7.88 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,123.13.
The TOPIX closed down 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, on Tuesday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.035 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.020 percent,
driving its price down to 112.82 yen from 112.93 yen.

Murder-suicide theory on American divers' disappearance raised at
</HEADLINE>
inquest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Tempers flared Monday at an inquest
into the disappearance of two American scuba divers when lawyers
raised the possibility of a murder-suicide.
	   Graham Houston, lawyer for dive boat owner Jack Nairn, asked a
navy diver Brett Daniels how one diver would go about killing
another without access to weapons.
	   Before the witness could answer, lawyers for the missing
Americans' families and those assisting the coroner loudly objected
to the line of questioning.
	   ``This is really outrageous stuff. These are disgusting,
slanderous allegations about these people,'' Rob Davis, lawyer for
the families, said.
	   Coroner Noel Nunan is investigating the fate of Thomas Lonergan,
33, and his 28-year old wife Eileen, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
who were last seen on Jan. 25.
	   The couple went diving from Nairn's dive boat Outer Edge at St.
Crispin Reef, 45 miles (72 km) northeast of the tourist resort town
of Port Douglas.
	   In a preliminary finding, the coroner has already decided that
they did not fake their deaths or die in a murder-suicide, but were
left behind and drowned.
	   Houston said the murder-suicide theory had been raised in police
documents produced to the inquest which include excerpts from
Eileen Lonergan's diary.
	   ``It clearly reveals passages which refer to Mr. Lonergan having
a death wish and Mrs. Lonergan fearing that she will die with him
when he carries out this death wish,`` he said.
	   Nunan said there was no suggestion in the diaries that Lonergan
intended to murder his wife, although ``she feared she was going to
be led into a dangerous situation because of his outlook.''
	   John Bailey, the lawyer assisting Nunan, said police who
investigated the disappearance had discounted any murder-suicide
theory.
	   Nunan allowed limited questioning on the issue, and Daniels said
the easiest way to kill someone at sea would be to drown them by
turning off their air supply in deep rather than shallow water.

South Korea's foreign minister departs for U.S. visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean Foreign Minister Hong
Soon-young left for Washington Wednesday for talks with U.S.
officials on security threats posed by communist North Korea.
	   Hong's four-day visit comes as the United States, Japan and
South Korea are moving to take joint steps against North Korea's
recent firing of a multistage ballistic missile over Japan.
	   North Korea says its Aug. 31 rocket firing was the launch of a
satellite, but Washington cast doubt on the North's claim. U.S.
officials said Tuesday they were unable to find an object orbiting
the earth that matches Pyongyang's claim.
	   Hong said before leaving Seoul that South Korea, along with the
United States and Japan, will raise the issue at the U.N. Security
Council. He said that whether the North launched a missile or a
satellite, it's a grave security threat either way.
	   He said the missile North Korea is believed to have fired could
hit targets anywhere in South Korea and Japan with its estimated
range of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles).
	   South Korean officials said Hong and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will review the security situation on the Korean
peninsula and in Northeast Asia as a whole.
	   Their discussions also will include a recent series of
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea which
reportedly made some progress, the officials said.
	   The talks in New York which ended over the weekend were attended
by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan and Charles
Kartman, a U.S. ambassador at large.
	   South Korean media, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources,
reported that North Korea agreed to resume missile talks with the
United States and attend Korean peace talks with the United States,
China and rival South Korea in October.
	   Both talks have been suspended since early this year.
	   In return, the United States has agreed to ease economic
sanctions and provide up to 300,000 tons of wheat for North Korea,
the reports said.

Signs of heat damage found on pieces from Flight 111 cockpit

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Investigators have detected signs of
heat damage on fragments of Swissair Flight 111's cockpit, evidence
that could help determine why smoke billowed around the pilots
before the jetliner crashed.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said Tuesday that
signs of heat stress have been found so far only on wreckage from
the cockpit, not from the passenger cabin.
	   ``There are some signs of heating on some of the small pieces of
the wreckage retrieved,'' Gerden told a news conference. ``The
limited amount of wreckage retrieved to date indicates this area of
heat stress is in the cockpit.''
	   Gerden, a senior investigator with Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, also released a more complete version of the last
conversation between the Swissair pilots and an air traffic control
tower in Moncton, New Brunswick, in the moments before the plane
crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, killing all
229 people on board.
	   Expanding on excerpts released earlier, the transcript showed
that the pilots reported putting their oxygen masks on and later
telling the controllers they would have to fly the plane manually
instead of by autopilot.
	   A detailed transcript of the plane's last minutes of
conversations with air traffic controllers, released Tuesday, shows
typically laconic conversations, heavy in technical terminology.
	   The first sign of trouble heard by controllers is a ``Pan Pan''
call from the Swissair jet, a term used for urgent communications
when a flight is in trouble, but short of a ``mayday'' distress
call. The pilots report smoke in the cockpit.
	   The transcript later notes sounds consistent with the pilots
donning oxygen masks, and a conversation between the pilots which
they broadcast erroneously on the radio. In it, one asks the other,
in German, if he has the emergency checklist for solving problems
with smoke in the air conditioning system.
	   Controllers, preparing for an emergency landing, ask the crew
how much fuel and how many passengers they have on board. According
to the transcript, the crew responds with the total aircraft
weight, rather than the amount of fuel on board, and does not give
the number of passengers.
	   Most of the conversations involve directing the plane to an area
over water where it can dump fuel, and preparing for a landing at
Halifax.
	   Gerden also expressed hopes of gaining valuable data from the
plane's recovered flight-data recorder, even though it stopped
working during the final six minutes before the plane crashed.
	   Flight 111 crashed more than an hour after taking off from New
York, bound for Geneva.
	   ``The most crucial area is not the last six minutes, as some may
think, but prior to those six minutes,'' Gerden said.
	   The recorder, retrieved by divers 190 feet (57 meters)
underwater, might show how systems aboard the plane failed between
the pilots' initial distress call 16 minutes before the crash and
when the machine shut off, he said.
	   Investigators hope to get further information from the plane's
cockpit-voice recorder, which is still on the sea bottom. A signal
from that recorder has been detected, but bad weather Tuesday
forced a one-day halt in diving operations.
	   The divers were expected to return to work Wednesday, supported
by a new arrival from the United States _ the Navy salvage and
rescue ship USS Grapple.
	   The Grapple helped with the undersea recovery of wreckage of TWA
Flight 800 off New York's Long Island in 1996. It has a team of
more than 30 divers on board, as well as equipment for lifting
large wreckage from the seabed.
	   Divers are trying to confirm if three large pieces of wreckage
found near the flight data recorder are sections of the plane's
fuselage.
	   Also on hand is a 16-member U.S. Navy team from Panama City,
Florida, which has brought advanced sonar and imaging equipment to
provide greater detail of the ocean floor.
	   Gerden reiterated that he saw nothing in the conversation to
suggest unwise decisions or unprofessional conduct.
	   ``The crew conversation was done in a professional manner
throughout.'' he said, stressing that it would be premature to pass
judgment until after all evidence was examined, including the
cockpit voice recorder.
	   Some lawyers and relatives of victims have suggested that the
Swissair pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have made a direct, though
possibly risky, descent to the Halifax airport after reporting
smoke, instead of making turns in order to lose altitude and dump
fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair's chief pilot-designate, Rainer
Hiltebrand, rejected those suggestions as irresponsible.
	   Meanwhile, forensics experts continued the gruesome task of
identifying human remains. They identified a second victim on
Tuesday, said Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner.
He declined to give further details until the family was notified.
	   He said remains are so fragmented that DNA technology will be
the main avenue for identification. Samples from the body parts are
being sent to police laboratories across Canada, where the DNA will
be matched with samples provided by victims' families.
	   Jeff Modler, a DNA specialist from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, said the pace of the salvage operation is important because
DNA becomes more difficult to analyze the longer a corpse is
underwater.
	   Memorial services were planned later this week in Halifax and at
U.N. headquarters in New York for victims of the crash. Among those
attending the ceremony in Halifax will be Swiss President Flavio
Cotti. Several U.N. workers died in the crash.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ Swollen rivers churning
with mud after nearly a week of heavy rains has swept away houses,
bridges and huge trees in southern Mexico, killing total of 31
people.
	   At least 25,000 people in more than 50 towns and villages were
driven from their houses by rampaging rivers and creeks, Chiapas
Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said. He declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast.
	   ``There is a great deal of material damage and a lamentable loss
in lives,'' Albores Guillen said.
	   He said 25 people drowned in Chiapas state and at least as many
were listed as missing. Officials in other states said six more
people were confirmed dead from flash flooding in Veracruz and
Jalisco.
	   In Chiapas, television footage showed muddy torrents, some more
than 100 yards (meters) wide, ripping concrete slabs from houses,
pulling and twisting railroad bridges and dragging huge trees
downstream. Water reached the tops of windows on tin-roofed houses.
	   Barefoot villagers in rain slickers hauled away suitcases,
mattresses and even stoves amid the rain. A total of 10 inches (25
centimeters) of rain have fallen in coastal areas of Chiapas over
the last six days.
	   The mayor of one of the most affected areas, Pijijiapan, said
rescuers had pulled 18 bodies from the waters in his town alone.
	   ``The water is rising,'' the mayor, Gilberto de los Santos Cruz,
said in a telephone interview.
	   Three people drowned in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz after
the boat they were traveling capsized in the rain-swollen Vinazco
River.
	   Four other passengers in the boat managed to swim to safety,
rescue workers said. The Gulf coast states of Tamaulipas and
Veracruz are bracing for more rain as a tropical depression formed
Tuesday in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the western city of Guadalajara, police found the bodies of
three children who were swept away by flash flooding earlier in the
day. Two other people remain missing, local media reported.
	   In Chiapas, authorities said more than more than a dozen bridges
were destroyed and 57 villages were isolated after roads washed
out. Electricity, water and sewage services also were cut to 20
villages.
	   Santos Cruz, whose municipality of 53,000 people is 90 miles
(145 kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, said 70 percent of his
territory was flooded.
	   Heavy rains in the central states of Michoacan, Sinaloa and
Nayarit, blamed on the Pacific tropical storm Javier, also forced
some families from their homes.

Kawasaki Heavy agrees to develop jet engines with Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kawasaki Heavy Industries has reached an agreement
with Rolls-Royce PLC to jointly develop jet engines for commercial
airlines, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Under the agreement, expected to become formal by the end of
this year, the major Japanese heavy machinery maker will develop
and manufacture key components for the new engines _ Trent500 and
Trent8104 _ now being developed by Rolls-Royce, said Kawasaki
spokesman Hideki Motooka.
	   Several Kawasaki engineers will be sent to the Rolls-Royce plant
in Britain for the project, Motooka said.
	   The new engines will be used in early next-century in Airbus
Industrie and Boeing Co. aircraft, he said. The cost of the project
was not disclosed.
	   Kawasaki Heavy Industries has produced engines for Japanese
destroyers under an agreement with Rolls-Royce.
	   Kawasaki is among three Japanese companies that will begin to
develop a quiet, low-pollution supersonic jet engine next year with
Japanese government funding. The other two are Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ When homer No. 62 finally came, the whole
affair proved far easier than anybody thought.
	   The talk had flowed everywhere for weeks. Who'd catch it? Should
they keep it? Would the IRS come calling?
	   And the most pressing question: Give it back gratis or take Mark
McGwire and the Cardinals for as much cash and cool stuff as
possible?
	   Unlike so many of McGwire's home runs, this one didn't make it
into the left-field stands. Instead, the line drive shot over the
left field fence, where Tim Forneris ran it down and picked it up _
Tim Forneris, part of the Busch Stadium grounds crew.
	   He promptly returned the specially and secretly marked,
individually numbered ball to The Man Of The Hour.
	   ``It's not mine to begin with,'' the 22-year-old Forneris said,
though technically it was once he got his hands on it. ``McGwire
just lost it, and I brought it home. I'm just a regular Joe.''
	   When the ball flew off McGwire's bat, Forneris and his brother,
Tino, were working behind the outfield fence under, appropriately
enough, a sign for ``Target'' department stores. Both joined other
members of the grounds crew in a mad dash to where they thought it
would land, under a ``Konica Copiers and Printers'' sign.
	   ``I figure, if it's not gone, it's going to hit the wall. If it
is gone, it's mine,'' Forneris said.
	   He beat them all.
	   Forneris stuffed the ball into his shirt and ran onto the field
with dozens of other employees as McGwire rounded the bases. He
gave the prize to Cardinals equipment manager Buddy Bates.
	   ``It makes everybody happy,'' Cardinals spokesman Brian Bartow
said. ``Our employees love the game just like the fans do. I am not
surprised that an employee felt so strongly about it that he rushed
to give it to Mark.''
	   McGwire has said the ball belongs in Cooperstown, New York at
the Baseball Hall of Fame, home of 5,000 other significant
baseballs.
	   ``It's refreshing,'' said Don Marr, the hall's president,
carrying a case containing the bat Roger Maris used to hit No. 61.
``People short-change America. These baseball fans are showing
their true colors.''
	   McGwire's last six home-run balls have been returned to him.
	   The ball, which retails for dlrs 9, could have been worth more
than dlrs 1 million to anyone who caught it.
	   There was a brief flurry over the weekend when there were
reports that whoever caught the ball might be taxed heavily even if
they gave it away. But the IRS said Tuesday that wouldn't be the
case.
	   McGwire, who earns dlrs 9.5 million a year, had implored whoever
retrieved the ball to return it.
	   ``I just totally disagree with all this money talk about a
ball,'' he said over the weekend. ``It is outrageous. Why would
somebody hold the ball hostage when really, basically, they had
nothing to do with it?''
	   The ``magical one,'' he says, ``belongs in Cooperstown.''

Development requires respect for rights, U.N. official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with additional quotes by Robinson, detail
about detention of Chu Hailan, police and hotel refusing comment.
No pickup.
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) - Economic development must be accompanied by
respect for all human rights, U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson
said Wednesday.
	   Chinese leaders contend that economic development must take
precedence over social and political rights, but Robinson said the
two were interdependent.
	   ``We should never forget that respect for human rights requires
social justice as an essential prerequisite for sustainable
development,'' said Robinson, who is making the first ever official
mission to China by a U.N. high commissioner for human rights.
	   ``In this sense, the right to development expresses a
fundamental value predicated upon respect for all human rights _
whether civil, cultural, economic, political or social _ together,
as an integrated whole _ and none of these can be fully realized
without democratic governance and the rule of law,'' Robinson said.
	   Robinson made the comments in a speech marking the presentation
of a U.N. report on worldwide human development.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn pleas from dissidents to promote
tolerance and curb police powers.
	   But Chinese officials have indicated she would probably not be
meeting with government critics during her 10-day stay, despite her
stated desire to meet a ``wide range'' of Chinese.
	   Minutes before Robinson arrived at the Hilton Hotel in Beijing
to deliver her speech, plainclothes security officers and hotel
guards dragged away Chu Hailan.
	   Chu has been seeking the release on medical grounds of her
husband, veteran political prisoner Liu Nianchun.
	   Chu was standing quietly outside the front door of the hotel,
waiting for Robinson to arrive, when security officers pulled her
inside. Chu yelled and struggled as they dragged her through the
Hilton's lobby.
	   Asked about the incident as she arrived, Robinson said:
``Obviously, I would be concerned about any issue such as that, but
I don't know anything about it.''
	   Liu, one of China's most prominent jailed dissidents, has been
in detention for more than three years without trial. According to
Chu, he suffers from high blood pressure, stomach problems and
other ailments.
	   A spokesman for Beijing police, who gave only his surname, Liu,
said he knew nothing about Chu's detention and had no comment.
Janet Zhang, a spokeswoman for the Hilton in Beijing, also refused
to comment.
	   Robinson is treading a careful line. She hopes to promote human
rights and nurture a nascent dialogue with China's Communist Party
leaders without alienating them.
	   ``China can be commended for efforts to eliminate poverty and to
meet the basic needs of all,'' she said. ``But the full realization
of human rights, like development, is a process, not necessarily a
smooth or easy one, but a process I am pleased to undertake with
the government of China.''
	   China has been leery of discussing human rights with the United
Nations. The U.N. Human Rights Commission, which sets policies for
Robinson's office, has annually aired criticisms of China's
treatment of dissidents and pro-independence Tibetans.
