   Keeping a Stiff Upper Lip During the Barrage
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to win the presidency, really,'' Gov. George
W. Bush told a reporter on the day after a 6-point loss to Sen.
John McCain in the Michigan primary. Under the circumstances, he
sounded like one of the heroic optimists who got London through the
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   How to weather the insurgent barrage of McCain, whose clean
sweep Tuesday also included his home state of Arizona, was a matter
of growing concern for the Bush campaign, which has already spent
$60 million and has beaten McCain in only one fully engaged
head-to-head contest, South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won the open Michigan primary thanks to independents and
blue-collar voters, moderates and suburbanites. What he didn't get
was many Republicans: only 29 percent of Republican voters cast
ballots for McCain, which could spell trouble for him on Super
Tuesday, March 7, when primaries in crucial states like New York
and California will not allow crossover voting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a conservative record in Congress, McCain, because of
his unorthodox positions on issues like campaign finance reform, is
being viewed by voters as a progressive alternative to Bush,
alienating the party's conservative base. To win back support on
the right, McCain is proclaiming in a new commercial running in
California, ``I'm a proud Reagan Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is practically the label Bill Bradley tried to hang last
week on his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore. In a
feisty debate Monday at the Apollo Theater in New York City's
Harlem, Bradley all but shoved a copy of Gore's congressional
voting record in his face in an effort to show Democrats that the
vice president has been far more right-leaning on abortion and gun
control than they think.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's insurgent campaign, overshadowed by McCain's, is
making a stand in Washington state in anticipation of the primary
there Tuesday. His concentration in a state that is essentially
holding a beauty contest shows how critical it has become for
Bradley to win a primary somewhere, anywhere.

   But Will It Have Toll Booths? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll call it the Ho Chi Minh Highway. In a hopeful
lunge at development, Vietnam announced it would carve a
north-south road through its western mountains along the route of
the former Ho Chi Minh Trail.
</P>
<P>
   That trail _ really a shifting network of hidden supply routes
that snaked in and out of neighboring Laos and Cambodia _ was one
of the wonders of the Vietnam War, one more proof of the
persistence and ingenuity of North Vietnam's guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of the new plan is a little more difficult to
embrace. Vietnam already has a north-south route, Highway 1, that
runs along the coast through most of its major cities. The new
road, while presumably avoiding the old trail's detours into its
neighbors' territory, would still travel 1,000 miles through
remote, difficult mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   And it would tax Vietnam's treasury at an announced cost of some
$678.6 million in a country that lacks basic resources and is
struggling to pull itself up from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The very notion of building a jungle highway in three years
might seem unrealistic. But for Vietnamese officials, who are
struggling through a long, discouraging economic slump, the allure
of the trail's symbolism may be irresistible. Once again, they can
mobilize the masses and, with patriotic fervor, show the world what
they can do.

   Signals on Interest Rates Confuse the Stock Markets  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street went through a confusing week, with the Dow Jones
industrial average losing 3.5 percent and closing below 10,000 for
the first time in 10 months. Its performance contrasted with the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which is up 12.81
percent this year and which showed a small gain for the week. The
divergence seemed to reflect expectations that the Federal Reserve
will continue raising interest rates, and that this will hurt
traditional companies more than it will hurt new technology
companies, since the Old Economy organizations are more dependent
on bank loans for raising capital.
</P>
<P>
   A Finger Is Pointed At Milosevic
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has been making life
difficult for NATO peacekeepers in the troubled Kosovo city of
Kosovska-Mitrovica. NATO and Clinton administration officials
acknowledged they had intercepted radio transmissions between Serbs
in the northern part of Mitrovica and Milosevic's security police
in Serbia proper. As well, Milosevic has been sending plainclothes
police into the city to help train and encourage Serb militants who
want to expel the remaining Albanians in northern Mitrovica. NATO
commanders vowed they would ensure the return of Albanian residents
who fled their homes in the north. Whether that can happen seems
likely to be a fundamental test of the administration's Kosovo
policy.

in pursuit of the Russian mafia _ really, a collection of mafias _

Secretary Richard Riley proposed that teaching become a year-round
profession. He left to states and school districts the question of
whether to extend the school calendar for students as well, but
said teachers need more professional development in this era of
high-technology and high-stakes testing, ``The educational paradigm
of the factory age is no longer appropriate,'' the secretary said
at a high school in Durham, N.C., in his seventh annual address on
the state of American education.

   Psychiatric Drugs for Tots
</P>
<P>
   A study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association reported a ``troubling'' rise in the number of
preschool children being medicated with stimulants, antidepressants
and other psychiatric drugs. From 1991 to 1995, it found,
stimulants including methylphenidate, the generic form of Ritalin,
increased two to three times for children aged 2 to 4 in the
programs studied, while antidepressant use doubled and the use of
clonidine, a blood pressure drug, also jumped. It was the first
study to document an increase among children younger than 5.

   Following Moses
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt to follow in the steps of Moses, Pope John Paul II
began his long-awaited spiritual pilgrimage by also retracing
modern religious tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had long hoped to use his visits to biblical sites to
seek reconciliation between Christians, Muslims and Jews. He was
warmly received by Egypt's most authoritative Sunni Muslim leader,
Mohammad Tantawi, but he spent most of his time in Egypt seeking to
smooth relations within the Christian world and renew Vatican
dialogue with Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church, which rejects the
primacy of the pope.

   Curtains for `Cats'
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, musicals like ``Les Miserables'' and
``Phantom of the Opera'' have anchored the Broadway industry,
drawing millions of tourists to Times Square and keeping their
theaters lit during even the hardest of times. The specter of a
world without them is harrowing to many who make their living along
the Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   So an announcement that ``Cats,'' the longest-running show in
Broadway history, would close at the end of June set off a fervent
guessing game among amateur handicappers: which mega-musical might
be the next to shutter? In the meantime, ``Cats'' was enjoying a
renaissance. By week's end, the show had sold more than $1 million
in tickets, making it once again the hottest ticket on Broadway.

   Every parent faces the dilemma: Restrict a child too much and

trouble. That conundrum lies at the heart of an acrimonious dispute
in western Michigan over whether Internet access at public
libraries should be restricted to protect children from
pornography. Christian conservatives put the issue to a referendum
there and lost, as some local residents contended that software
filters restricted free speech and would inevitably block access to
some useful sites, too.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans bought an estimated $14 billion or more of recorded
music last year. And music, arguably even more than movies or
television, has been the vanguard of the post-World War II American
cultural onslaught that has swept through the world.
</P>
<P>
   So it's odd, in a way, that the annual Grammy Awards show, which
was broadcast last week to a domestic audience of over 27 million
people, is a kind of musical Land That Time Forgot, a place where,
as they used to say at the Holiday Inn, the best surprise is no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the music business tries to place its imprimatur
on the ungovernable energies of American pop culture. ``Old people
_ the Grammy voters _ like to be reminded that the young people
aren't taking over, which is ironic when you're talking about pop
music,'' notes Robert Wilonsky, popular culture critic for the
Dallas Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilonsky's observation, given that this is an organization that
awarded Petula Clark a Grammy over the Beatles, makes sense. ``You
can't assume that the Grammys take place in a universe similar to
our own,'' Wilonsky continues. ``The Grammys take place in the
Bizarro Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the Grammys probably won't play the
favorite tunes of a hip 15-year-old California skateboarder, or a
hip-hop crazy girl from East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Instead, you'll
get a snapshot of the sounds that have migrated from the cutting
edge to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with 52-year-old Carlos Santana lugging home eight of
the miniature gramophone statuettes for his album ``Supernatural''
_ one wondered if he was going to somehow pull off a Best New
Artist award _ we learned that age does come before beauty. Sting
walked off with two of the Grammys that Santana wasn't up for, and
Cher and Tony Bennett were also winners in the ceremony. (Best
Female Rock Performance winner Sheryl Crow had the good sense to
thank Santana for not mucking around in her category.)
</P>
<P>
   Santana. Sting. Cher. Will Smith _ the Artist Formerly Known as
the Fresh Prince. Madonna (who won for a collaboration with William
Orbit). Whitney Houston. With the exception of Best New Artist, and
the welcome new blood of the Latin movement, this year's ceremonies
could've taken place in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And thank God for that. There was apprehension in the music
business this year, that the kids who took all of the tension and
heat out of what Billboard magazine calls Black music _ funk, R &AMP; B
and rap _ and turned it into product, acts like Limp Bizkit and
former New Mouseketeers like Britney Spears, would dominate the
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Santana also represented another, more intriguing trend in this
year's Grammys, the interest in Latin music. Once solely the
province of musician/ethnographers like Ry Cooder, Latin pop now
has grown as a musically and commercially vibrant sector hospitable
to both the heat of youth culture and the grace of age.
</P>
<P>
   The growing acceptance of world music and an exploding Hispanic
demographic presence in much of the country were spurs to its
success, as were the return of salsa and meringue dance clubs. Kids
may go for the flash of party-people like Ricky Martin and Jennifer
Lopez, but they may also find themselves listening to well-regarded
crooners like Marc Anthony, all of whom reach mainstream audiences
by singing in English.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grown ups will find Ibrahim Ferrer, 72 years old and
a member of the gracefully aging Buena Vista Social Club, singing
and gesturing like he owns the world.
</P>

the snapshot of America this year's Grammy's provided show a

children are being told to grow up faster than ever. That's what

<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans bought an estimated $14 billion or more of recorded
music last year. And music, arguably even more than movies or
television, has been the vanguard of the post-World War II American
cultural onslaught that has swept through the world.
</P>
<P>
   So it's odd, in a way, that the annual Grammy Awards show, which
was broadcast last week to a domestic audience of over 27 million
people, is a kind of musical Land That Time Forgot, a place where,
as they used to say at the Holiday Inn, the best surprise is no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the music business tries to place its imprimatur
on the ungovernable energies of American pop culture. ``Old people
_ the Grammy voters _ like to be reminded that the young people
aren't taking over, which is ironic when you're talking about pop
music,'' notes Robert Wilonsky, popular culture critic for the
Dallas Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilonsky's observation, given that this is an organization that
awarded Petula Clark a Grammy over the Beatles, makes sense. ``You
can't assume that the Grammys take place in a universe similar to
our own,'' Wilonsky continues. ``The Grammys take place in the
Bizarro Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that the Grammys probably won't play the
favorite tunes of a hip 15-year-old California skateboarder, or a
hip-hop crazy girl from East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Instead, you'll
get a snapshot of the sounds that have migrated from the cutting
edge to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with 52-year-old Carlos Santana lugging home eight of
the miniature gramophone statuettes for his album ``Supernatural''
_ one wondered if he was going to somehow pull off a Best New
Artist award _ we learned that age does come before beauty. Sting
walked off with two of the Grammys that Santana wasn't up for, and
Cher and Tony Bennett were also winners in the ceremony. (Best
Female Rock Performance winner Sheryl Crow had the good sense to
thank Santana for not mucking around in her category.)
</P>
<P>
   Santana. Sting. Cher. Will Smith _ the Artist Formerly Known as
the Fresh Prince. Madonna (who won for a collaboration with William
Orbit). Whitney Houston. With the exception of Best New Artist, and
the welcome new blood of the Latin movement, this year's ceremonies
could've taken place in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And thank God for that. There was apprehension in the music
business this year, that the kids who took all of the tension and
heat out of what Billboard magazine calls Black music _ funk, R &AMP; B
and rap _ and turned it into product, acts like Limp Bizkit and
former New Mouseketeers like Britney Spears, would dominate the
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Santana also represented another, more intriguing trend in this
year's Grammys, the interest in Latin music. Once solely the
province of musician/ethnographers like Ry Cooder, Latin pop now
has grown as a musically and commercially vibrant sector hospitable
to both the heat of youth culture and the grace of age.
</P>
<P>
   The growing acceptance of world music and an exploding Hispanic
demographic presence in much of the country were spurs to its
success, as were the return of salsa and meringue dance clubs. Kids
may go for the flash of party-people like Ricky Martin and Jennifer
Lopez, but they may also find themselves listening to well-regarded
crooners like Marc Anthony, all of whom reach mainstream audiences
by singing in English.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grown ups will find Ibrahim Ferrer, 72 years old and
a member of the gracefully aging Buena Vista Social Club, singing
and gesturing like he owns the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista Social Club didn't just catch on because Wim
Wenders made an engrossing Oscar-nominated documentary film about
them. Instead, this warrior class of musicians, long ago discarded
by Cuban official culture as remnants of the nightclub era of
Batista, the pre-Castro dictator, performed as if they hadn't
missed a day. And their intensely emotional and melodic stew was
released just as Latin dance music was finally starting to catch on
in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Latin wave has grown so large that the Grammy
people have decided to run a Latin Grammy broadcast later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Best New Artist, Christina Aguilera, reflects the
Latin revolution, but she's also part of the jailbait-under-glass
syndrome that is somewhat less appealing.
</P>

   It's no longer very hard to enjoy the trappings of a financial
mogul or earn an aristocratic title conveying pomp and privilege.
Just visit the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is filled with outfits that cater to these desires. For
example, type in ``offshoresecrets.com'' and enter a world
promising ``fast, safe, private and affordable offshore services.''
</P>
<P>
   Those services include banking charters in such obscure locales
as Nauru and Vanuatu for a fee of about $20,000. ``Yes! I want to
order my own bank now!'' the site encourages visitors, noting that
such banks allow users to take deposits, give loans and ``operate
free of tax on profit,'' with no ``need to maintain a physical
presence'' in the host country.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the site can help you get a college degree or
even a legal title of nobility. ``With a Title in front of your
name you will experience a difference in people's attitudes,'' the
site notes. ``The moment they know you are a `Sir, Lady, Lord,
etc.' you'll be treated like some sort of royalty or famous film
star.''
</P>
<P>
   An individual identified as Eytan Gold, who operates
offshoresecrets.com from Israel, declined to be interviewed.
Neither he nor his site have ever been charged with wrongdoing. But
his site and others like it have drawn the attention of U.S.
regulators and legislators, who suspect they may be fronts for
money laundering and other financial shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole purpose of many of these banks is to provide havens
for criminals,'' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., in an
interview. ``Any criminal worth his salt knows that if you want to
avoid detection, you go offshore _ and with the Internet, you can
point, click and launder.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5 trillion to $6 trillion is sheltered in offshore
accounts, according to reports from the International Monetary
Fund, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the State Department. Schumer and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have introduced money-laundering
legislation that targets ``instant banks'' being peddled on the
Internet. The legislation would prevent those kinds of banks from
having transactions with U.S. financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at one site, offshoreprofit.com, operated from
Venezuela by an individual identified as Lord Antonio D. Gonzalez,
suggests how easy it is for just about anyone to shelter money
abroad. For $399, the site will establish an account in ``one of
Estonia's largest banks'' and throw in a free ``Maestro Card.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's ``Millennium Freedom Package,'' bargain-priced at
$2,299, offers an offshore trust account in Belize, an ``ID Free
Visa card,'' a mail-drop address and a ``full year of personalized
advice'' that includes information on where to get ``a second, or
even third diplomatic passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, privacyworld.com, also offers offshore trusts
and bank accounts, ``legal tax avoidance'' services, press or
travel agent identification and international driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   For the very ambitious, the site will establish ``anonymous,
bearer share'' corporations that will let owners bank abroad using
encrypted telephone, fax or e-mail connections.
</P>
<P>
   The site, operated from Switzerland by Third World Trading
Corp., says it allows clients to ``get rid of lawyers, spouses,
etc., forever.'' The operators of privacyworld.com could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some offshore operators scoff at the notion that they are
selling anything more than a sought-after luxury: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet makes it easy to protect our and our clients'
privacy,'' an individual calling himself Robert Smith said in an
e-mail response to questions about his site, offshoreprofit.com.
``We are located outside the U.S., our actual location being a
secret to avoid interference and sabotage attempts, which have
destroyed or are in the process of destroying other, more
high-profile offshore operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also observed that most illegal activities occur in
onshore banks. In fact, the biggest money-laundering investigation
in history is underway at the Bank of New York, where $7 billion in
suspect funds from Russia are being examined. The bank has not been
charged with wrongdoing and is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some offshore banks and services are used by those who
want to break the law,'' he said. ``However the same thing is true
for onshore banks. In fact, the vast majority of international
money laundering doesn't take place in the Caribbean or in Austria,
but in New York and London. That's where the truly powerful people
launder their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you aren't interested in stashing away money, the sites
point out that many of their products make great gifts. For just
$495 ($795 for couples), offshoresecrets.com will make you a laird,
knecht, viscount or marchioness. And the cachet that comes with
that title, you'll discover, is just priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines will often upgrade you,'' the site promises. ``Bank
managers just can't help you enough. It says more about you than a
Gold or Platinum credit card. For personal confidence and
self-esteem a title will change your life for the better.''

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the money and fury being invested in the
parallel primary campaigns of the two major parties, there is
another presidential war game going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Sooner or later, however, the winners of the
Democratic and Republican fights will have to pay attention. For,
barring direct intrusion by Ross Perot himself, the current
expectation among political professionals is that the Reform line
could very well be resurrected this fall by none other than Pat
Buchanan, the turncoat Republican and chronic presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five months, Buchanan has been quietly laboring to
build his own Reform machine and get a lock on the nomination. No
small attraction in his quest is the $12.6 million federal election
subsidy that is the Reform nominee's entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan's waiting in the weeds for the primaries to end,''
said Jim Jordan, a Democratic campaign strategist who anticipates
serious tri-corner mischief if Buchanan manages to seize the third
line. ``Pat knows how to use a political wedge better than anybody
in the business,'' Jordan added, wondering, for example, whether
the GOP's right-wing Christian bloc might become miffed enough in
the current Republican fray to be tempted by a Buchanan alternative
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Following Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's angry departure from
the party, speculation is growing that Perot might try to dictate a
nominee. But Buchanan, deep into Reform politics by now, insists he
is ready for any eventuality, including recent speculation that
Perot might seek to give his party's blessing to Sen. John McCain,
or that Perot might decide to run again himself.
</P>
<P>
   More an impulse than an organization, the party that Perot built
is out of season right now, shards of ill-managed klatches in 21
states, each hoping for someone to unite it into a once more
fearsome vehicle. The Bush family remembers well that fearsomeness;
President George Bush saw his potential margin of re-election
siphoned off in 1992 when Perot drew 19 percent of the vote to the
Reform line and Bill Clinton was elected as a plurality President.
Now the son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is suffering a healthy
dose of insurgency from McCain and neither can afford to focus on
the Perot reformers conspiring on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   As he retreated, Ventura described the Reform Party as
``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' But actually he was quitting
preemptively, having failed to win the national party leadership.
In a way, the party proved quite functional, for the Perot
loyalists reclaimed the party gavel in Nashville at a raucous
convention shoving match worthy of the Moscow Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Reform party enthusiasts heart-stricken at the spectacle should
remember that big money has a way of focusing the attention of even
the most obstreperous politician. And the early teasing about this
prize is ending.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, as self-fantasized a politician as ever trod the
tabloid runway, instantly withdrew his pompadour from the ring when
his sole patron, Ventura, was pinned by the Perot forces. And
political specialists point to election laws and impenetrable
Reform procedures that would make a McCain endorsement difficult,
if not impossible. More to the point, the idea of being the Reform
Party nominee has been rejected outright by McCain, who cites the
Bull Moose folly of his hero, Theodore Roosevelt, and says he would
welcome all sorts of endorsements, Reformers included, once he wins
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Reform Party is in its familiar Godot mode, waiting
for Perot. Associates who claim to know his mind say that Perot may
try something new. He ran a second time in 1996 with some
embarrassing results. His popular support was halved at the polls
as critics judged him less of a reformer and more of a
laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is watching more intently for the hand of Perot
than Buchanan. He jumped to the Reformers when his serial campaign
for the GOP nomination lagged into single-digit polling doldrums.
Since his conversion, Buchanan has been laboring to build his own
personal Reform machine, state by state. With Ventura now gone,
Buchanan counts one fewer dragon to slay on the road to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm that troll still waiting out there under the bridge,''
Buchanan likes to laughingly announce.
</P>
<P>
   His core strategy is to win the $12.6 million and use it as a
credential with which he could not be fairly denied entry into the
real prize for him, next fall's televised debates. There, he likes
his chances as the quick-witted populist who delights in contrarian
polemics.
</P>
<P>
   But first Buchanan must hack his new side-door path to the
political arena where he last stunned the Republican establishment
by defeating Bob Dole in the 1996 New Hampshire primary. Buchanan
is spending $2 million organizing petition drives and field workers
in the 29 states that do not now have Reform ballot lines. In the
other 21 states, he has been courting disparate gatherings of
uncertain Reformers, right down to a bowling alley caucus one night
in Fleetwoods, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   When he opportunistically jumped his life-long Republican
traces, Buchanan predicted, ``Ross Perot will be a benign
neutral.'' Now he admits he has to wonder what might happen as the
quixotic Texan silently weighs McCain's success in tapping voter
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about footsteps,'' Buchanan insisted of
Perot as he claimed his first Reform victory of sorts in Ventura's
quitting the party. ``I always said this would be like running an
Iroquois gantlet,'' Buchanan said, beginning to savor and so far
master the wayward politics of his new party. ``It's a volatile
situation in America,'' the newly minted Reformer said, smiling at
the possibilities.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the money and fury being invested in the
parallel primary campaigns of the two major parties, there is
another presidential war game going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Sooner or later, however, the winners of the
Democratic and Republican fights will have to pay attention. For,
barring direct intrusion by Ross Perot himself, the current
expectation among political professionals is that the Reform line
could very well be resurrected this fall by none other than Pat
Buchanan, the turncoat Republican and chronic presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five months, Buchanan has been quietly laboring to
build his own Reform machine and get a lock on the nomination. No
small attraction in his quest is the $12.6 million federal election
subsidy that is the Reform nominee's entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan's waiting in the weeds for the primaries to end,''
said Jim Jordan, a Democratic campaign strategist who anticipates
serious tri-corner mischief if Buchanan manages to seize the third
line. ``Pat knows how to use a political wedge better than anybody
in the business,'' Jordan added, wondering, for example, whether
the GOP's right-wing Christian bloc might become miffed enough in
the current Republican fray to be tempted by a Buchanan alternative
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Following Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's angry departure from
the party, speculation is growing that Perot might try to dictate a
nominee. But Buchanan, deep into Reform politics by now, insists he
is ready for any eventuality, including recent speculation that
Perot might seek to give his party's blessing to Sen. John McCain,
or that Perot might decide to run again himself.
</P>
<P>
   More an impulse than an organization, the party that Perot built
is out of season right now, shards of ill-managed klatches in 21
states, each hoping for someone to unite it into a once more
fearsome vehicle. The Bush family remembers well that fearsomeness;
President George Bush saw his potential margin of re-election
siphoned off in 1992 when Perot drew 19 percent of the vote to the
Reform line and Bill Clinton was elected as a plurality President.
Now the son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is suffering a healthy
dose of insurgency from McCain and neither can afford to focus on
the Perot reformers conspiring on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   As he retreated, Ventura described the Reform Party as
``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' But actually he was quitting
preemptively, having failed to win the national party leadership.
In a way, the party proved quite functional, for the Perot
loyalists reclaimed the party gavel in Nashville at a raucous
convention shoving match worthy of the Moscow Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Reform party enthusiasts heart-stricken at the spectacle should
remember that big money has a way of focusing the attention of even
the most obstreperous politician. And the early teasing about this
prize is ending.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, as self-fantasized a politician as ever trod the
tabloid runway, instantly withdrew his pompadour from the ring when
his sole patron, Ventura, was pinned by the Perot forces. And
political specialists point to election laws and impenetrable
Reform procedures that would make a McCain endorsement difficult,
if not impossible. More to the point, the idea of being the Reform
Party nominee has been rejected outright by McCain, who cites the
Bull Moose folly of his hero, Theodore Roosevelt, and says he would
welcome all sorts of endorsements, Reformers included, once he wins
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Reform Party is in its familiar Godot mode, waiting
for Perot. Associates who claim to know his mind say that Perot may
try something new. He ran a second time in 1996 with some
embarrassing results. His popular support was halved at the polls
as critics judged him less of a reformer and more of a
laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is watching more intently for the hand of Perot
than Buchanan. He jumped to the Reformers when his serial campaign
for the GOP nomination lagged into single-digit polling doldrums.
Since his conversion, Buchanan has been laboring to build his own
personal Reform machine, state by state. With Ventura now gone,
Buchanan counts one fewer dragon to slay on the road to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm that troll still waiting out there under the bridge,''
Buchanan likes to laughingly announce.
</P>
<P>
   His core strategy is to win the $12.6 million and use it as a
credential with which he could not be fairly denied entry into the
real prize for him, next fall's televised debates. There, he likes
his chances as the quick-witted populist who delights in contrarian
polemics.
</P>
<P>
   But first Buchanan must hack his new side-door path to the
political arena where he last stunned the Republican establishment
by defeating Bob Dole in the 1996 New Hampshire primary. Buchanan
is spending $2 million organizing petition drives and field workers
in the 29 states that do not now have Reform ballot lines. In the
other 21 states, he has been courting disparate gatherings of
uncertain Reformers, right down to a bowling alley caucus one night
in Fleetwoods, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   When he opportunistically jumped his life-long Republican
traces, Buchanan predicted, ``Ross Perot will be a benign
neutral.'' Now he admits he has to wonder what might happen as the
quixotic Texan silently weighs McCain's success in tapping voter
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about footsteps,'' Buchanan insisted of
Perot as he claimed his first Reform victory of sorts in Ventura's
quitting the party. ``I always said this would be like running an
Iroquois gantlet,'' Buchanan said, beginning to savor and so far
master the wayward politics of his new party. ``It's a volatile
situation in America,'' the newly minted Reformer said, smiling at
the possibilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 22 years as a science writer, I recently retired to cut
firewood in Vermont and enjoy the memories of an exciting life, in
which I covered a half-dozen wars before discovering the deeper
satisfaction of observing and reporting the achievements of
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   I relished my 17 years as a foreign correspondent, but believe
it or not, even the high drama of disaster, violence and political
upheaval that dominates front pages can lose its luster for
journalists seeking new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, a news writer may begin to sense a kind of
sameness in most of the events that pass as news. When that happens
a lucky few of us discover that in science, almost alone among
human endeavors, there is always something new under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, weary of the sameness of war and politics, I returned
to the United States to become a science writer _ a transition that
almost overwhelmed me at first. Although I had earned my living in
a chemical laboratory in the 1950s, I had almost forgotten how
speedily science booms along.
</P>
<P>
   As a trivial example, in the last quarter century alone the
American Chemical Society has added more than 10 million chemical
substances to its list of known molecules, most of them man-made.
Stupendous strides in chemical synthesis have given the world a
wealth of new materials and drugs, and have created entirely new
classes of molecules, including hollow molecules shaped like cages
that contain even smaller molecules. Perhaps most intriguing of
all, chemists are turning up more and more hints of how life may
have originated from the carbon spawned in the explosions of
supernova stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s and '70s were a time of great ferment in all the
sciences, and the momentum of those years has carried to the
present. Among the major achievements in physics I was privileged
to report were the discovery of the top quark at Fermilab _ the
last of six quarks predicted by theory _ and the discovery in Japan
that the elusive neutrino particle probably has some mass, a
finding with profound implications for the fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes science writers watching the accelerating deluge of
discoveries in physics, chemistry, molecular biology and
astrophysics have actually outpaced the thinking of the scientists
themselves, and science writing has bloomed as a major component of
general journalism.
</P>
<P>
   At The New York Times, for example, the science editor, Walter
Sullivan, had been steeping himself in astrophysics for decades
when in 1965 two scientists at Bell Labs, Dr. Arno A. Penzias and
Dr. Robert W. Wilson, accidentally discovered a faint microwave
radio signal coming from all directions in the sky. It was the
first hard evidence that the universe had begun with a ``Big
Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Penzias later paid Sullivan one of the warmest compliments ever
given a science writer, after reading an article expanding on the
implications of the discovery: ``Only after reading Sullivan's
story in The New York Times,'' Penzias said, ``did we fully
understand what we had done.'' In 1978 Penzias and Wilson, their
discovery having radically changed man's view of the cosmos, were
awarded a Nobel prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's cosmic microwave article was based on a lifetime of
study _ a requisite for every successful science writer. The raw
material used in news coverage of important discoveries is often
rather skimpy: a press release from some university, a telephone
message from a scientist friend or a brief paper in a professional
journal. It is up to the science writer to judge the significance
of the findings and place them in context.
</P>
<P>
   This means that a science writer must be a perpetual student.
</P>
<P>
   News stories about astronomy frequently have to do with black
holes, for example, and for many astronomy fans it is enough to
know that black holes suck in everything near them and won't let
anything _ even light _ escape. But to understand black holes at a
deeper level requires familiarity with Einstein's general theory of
relativity, and some of the greatest minds in physics are still
puzzling over some of relativity's implications.
</P>
<P>
   The presumably lesser mind of the science writer has an even
harder row to hoe than that of the scientist. But try, he or she
must. Slogging through the dense technical thickets (and perhaps
equations) that envelope some scientific event is not only
important for rounding out an article; it is tremendously
satisfying to the journalist involved, whether he is boning up on
nuclear shell theory, mitochondrial DNA, quantum chromodynamics,
the origin of birds, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that conscientious science writers come to know more
things than do other journalists. That is the greatest pleasure of
our calling.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, as science floods the world with discoveries of
variable quality _ unhappily, the overwhelming majority of
scientific papers fall into the category of junk science _ the task
of the writer seems to grow easier in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   The science itself gets harder all the time, of course. The
professional journals on which scientists (and writers) heavily
depend are not easy to read, and they seem more difficult each
year. To give some idea: several years ago the editor of a
prestigious journal, Physical Review Letters, found it necessary to
decree that at least the first couple of paragraphs of each
published paper should be intelligible to an average Ph.D physicist
not specializing in the subject of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But no discovery occurs in a vacuum, a fact that has helped many
science writers find their way through the fog. Newton, the
discoverer of much that is essential to modern physics and
mathematics, wrote that he could not have seen so far without
having stood on the shoulders of giants. In a small way, the
science writer can also stand on the shoulders of giants. Most
discoveries are incremental steps, and if a writer comes to terms
with the earlier steps, new findings generally slide into an
intelligible context.

   The science writer also lives in dread of losing readers'
interest, which happens all too often. For instance, it's hard to
persuade a reader (or editor) to take seriously some gigantic
experiment that produced only a null result. So the writer is
obliged to point out that null results can have far-reaching
scientific importance.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of an experiment by Dr. Albert Michelson and Dr.
Edward Morley a century ago to detect the earth's passage through a
hypothetical universal ``ether'' lent powerful support to
relativity theory. Scientists will soon begin a quest for gravity
waves in a strikingly similar experiment, and any writer unfamiliar
with Michelson and Morley's work will have trouble reporting the
story.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it takes a prepared mind to appreciate the value
of a subtle experiment that may have a null result, and a science
writer must impart this appreciation to readers, even at the cost
of glazing a few eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One trick of the trade is the use of analogy to convey the
flavor of an idea, discovery or equation. But effective though
analogies may be, they are never exactly appropriate and sometimes
are downright wrong. It's probably OK to call a proton a
``beanbag'' containing three quarks, but to call a proton
accelerator an ``atom smasher'' makes physicists squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Practice may not make perfect, but a science writer who stays in
the game long enough is bound to get better. Unfortunately, it can
happen that both the writer and reader may miss the significance of
a scientific development; it is like being knocked down by a strong
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallico, a renowned sports writer in the 1930s, relished
such encounters. Before writing about one of the boxing matches he
covered, Gallico went into the ring with Jack Dempsey, who knocked
him down. This, Gallico said, taught him all he needed to know
about being hit, and that rich experience helped flavor his
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Science writers and their readers sometimes get knocked down by
hard ideas rather than by hard gloves. But the experience of
grappling with such things as the fiendish mathematics of
superstring theory or the complicated tactics of the AIDS virus is
its own reward, even at the cost of some bumps.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The book is closed on this case,'' the judge said
Friday, moments after an Albany County jury acquitted four New York
City police officers of all charges in the killing of Amadou Diallo
a year ago. That is true only as far as Justice Joseph C. Teresi's
courtroom goes. It may take a while before the book closes, if it
ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and,
perhaps, other corners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, died in a hail
of 41 police bullets on the doorstep of his Bronx apartment
building, there has been no shortage of shock, anger, sadness and
raw pain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to disappear just because a jury has
spoken, and far from the scene where this awful incident unfolded.
A young man is needlessly dead _ ``an innocent man and a decent
man,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after the verdict. And while
lives have been shattered, including those of the officers, no one
has been held accountable. That reality will not be easy for many
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say justice was not done. For those who have faith
in the U.S. jury system, it was. As best as anyone could tell, this
multiracial panel of eight whites and four blacks concluded that
the white officers had diligently gone about their job and fired at
this black man because they honestly, though mistakenly, believed
they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the jurors were less concerned with why the
officers fired a mind-numbing 41 times than with whether they were
justified in shooting bullet No. 1. Their answer was implicitly
yes, which was why they acquitted the officers not only of murder,
but of all the lesser charges, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would a Bronx jury have come to a different decision? More than
likely. The Bronx population is largely black and Hispanic. Albany
County, 160 miles north of New York City, is predominantly white.
Race may not automatically determine destiny, but it comes awfully
close in this country. The trial was moved to Albany by a panel of
appellate judges who ruled that an avalanche of publicity,
including mass demonstrations and the arrests of celebrities and
leading political figures, had rendered a fair hearing impossible
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But while an acquittal was made more probable by the shift to
Albany, it was not necessarily assured, though critics are bound to

affair with other notorious trials in which juries freed whites who
killed blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But absent evidence of intellectual or moral bankruptcy on the
part of the jurors, there is no reason to reflexively evoke
memories of Simi Valley, Calif., let alone Neshoba County, Miss.,
in the dark days of civil rights murders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was hard for many New Yorkers to shake the sense that
this had all come out wrong. Aren't Americans taught from childhood
that actions have consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only one who bore the consequences in this dreadful
affair was Amadou Diallo, who did nothing wrong, except maybe make
the fatal error of pulling out a wallet the officers said they
mistook for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks were especially angry, nowhere more so than in the
Soundview section of the Bronx where Diallo lived. Some people held
black wallets aloft and mockingly cried, ``Gun!'' On the tense
streets, it was hard to gainsay those who muttered that a wallet
has a way of looking like nothing more than a wallet when held by a
white man but somehow morphs into a gun in the hands of a black
man.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge's observation notwithstanding, the book is not at
all closed, even in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family will surely pursue civil charges. President
Clinton's Justice Department is thinking about whether to
intervene, a decision that may well become entangled in the Senate
race between Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. If nothing else,
the officers' jobs are on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, can count on
being subjected to his share of post-mortems, starting with his
decision to charge the four officers with second-degree murder, a
charge that even many of the New York Police Department's most
severe critics thought from the start was unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Police Department off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, the central question was not the actions
of these four officers. It was whether the hard-nosed and largely
successful anti-crime strategies championed by Giuliani, which
included the stopping and frisking of thousands upon thousands of
black men on the street, had imbued officers with such a sense of
entitlement and aggression that something like the Diallo killing
was a disaster waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It did.

   NEW YORK _ ``The book is closed on this case,'' the judge said
Friday, moments after an Albany County jury acquitted four New York
City police officers of all charges in the killing of Amadou Diallo
a year ago. That is true only as far as Justice Joseph C. Teresi's
courtroom goes. It may take a while before the book closes, if it
ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and,
perhaps, other corners of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, died in a hail
of 41 police bullets on the doorstep of his Bronx apartment
building, there has been no shortage of shock, anger, sadness and
raw pain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to disappear just because a jury has
spoken, and far from the scene where this awful incident unfolded.
A young man is needlessly dead _ ``an innocent man and a decent
man,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after the verdict. And while
lives have been shattered, including those of the officers, no one
has been held accountable. That reality will not be easy for many
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say justice was not done. For those who have faith
in the U.S. jury system, it was. As best as anyone could tell, this
multiracial panel of eight whites and four blacks concluded that
the white officers had diligently gone about their job and fired at
this black man because they honestly, though mistakenly, believed
they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the jurors were less concerned with why the
officers fired a mind-numbing 41 times than with whether they were
justified in shooting bullet No. 1. Their answer was implicitly
yes, which was why they acquitted the officers not only of murder,
but of all the lesser charges, too.
</P>
<P>
   Would a Bronx jury have come to a different decision? More than
likely. The Bronx population is largely black and Hispanic. Albany
County, 160 miles north of New York City, is predominantly white.
Race may not automatically determine destiny, but it comes awfully
close in this country. The trial was moved to Albany by a panel of
appellate judges who ruled that an avalanche of publicity,
including mass demonstrations and the arrests of celebrities and
leading political figures, had rendered a fair hearing impossible
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But while an acquittal was made more probable by the shift to
Albany, it was not necessarily assured, though critics are bound to
disagree. The dissenters can be expected to compare the Diallo
affair with other notorious trials in which juries freed whites who
killed blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But absent evidence of intellectual or moral bankruptcy on the
part of the jurors, there is no reason to reflexively evoke
memories of Simi Valley, Calif., let alone Neshoba County, Miss.,
in the dark days of civil rights murders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DISCORD (Kosovska Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ As a first
gesture _ largely dismissed here as cosmetic _ the U.N. authorities
and NATO's peacekeepers are building a pedestrian bridge across the
Ibar as part of a new plan for an ``open city.'' The plan is a
response to intense pressure from shocked NATO capitals at the
violence in Mitrovica and its symbolism of the failure thus far of
the Western effort here to bring any real measure of security,
justice or freedom of movement to minorities in Kosovo. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-MOVIES-EXTORTION (Bombay, India) _ In India, the men who
make movies find themselves caught in a Catch-22: If their films
bomb _ as most do _ they lose their shirts. But in the unlikely
event that they produce a blockbuster, they become targets for
underworld extortionists. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   SENEGAL-ELECTION (Dakar, Senegal) _ The presidential election on
Sunday in Senegal has one critical difference that sets it apart
from past votes and that offers a snapshot of the evolution of
democracy in sub-Saharan Africa: No one knows who will win. By
Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-FLOODS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Several weeks of
torrential rains and floods, made worse when a deadly storm lashed
Southern Africa this week, have killed more than 150 people and
swept away the homes and livelihoods of more than 1 million in
three countries, relief agencies and government officials say. By
Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-EGYPT (Mount Sinai, Egypt) _ Saying he felt ``great joy and
deep emotion,'' Pope John Paul II prayed Saturday at the spot where
tradition says Moses once stood, and called himself a pilgrim ``in
the footsteps of God.'' By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PEACE-ASSESS (Abu Dis, West Bank) _ The
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, which U.S. envoys have been busy
trying to revive this week, is deadlocked over the fate of this
unprepossessing Arab town on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem. By
Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-WOMEN (Prague, Czech Republic) _ After almost two years of
total exclusion from the government, some Czech women feel the time
has come to break into the old boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-CHINA (Washington) _ U.S. policy toward China. By Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WESLEYAN-ADMISSIONS (Middletown, Conn.) _ Raphael Figueroa, an
admissions officer, is an anxious sentry at Wesleyan's front gate
these days, and like those doing similar work at dozens of other
selective colleges and universities, his job has never been harder.
Fueled by an increase in the number of high school graduates and a
growing perception that top educational credentials create the best
job opportunities, this college admissions season is on track to
break many of last year's records. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   TEN-COMMANDMENTS (Chicago) _ Trying to make the Ten Commandments
part of public school life in ways that could survive
constitutional challenges, Indiana has passed a bill that permits
schools to post the religious edicts as historical documents, and
nine other states are pondering similar measures. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-SOUTH-BEACH (Miami Beach, Fla.) _ Vaulting into celebrity as
the backdrop of ``Miami Vice,'' the hit television series in the
1980s, this oceanside gem of Art Deco whimsy has joined the company
of the nation's most impudent and indulgent trend-setting
societies, like Greenwich Village or Berkeley or Venice, Calif. But
South Beach has also inspired precarious excesses, especially among
the young who frequent night clubs and the after-hours clubs. By
Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-ILLEGAL-IMMIG (Harsens Island, Mich.) _ Illegal immigration
is picking up in this rural Michigan area because of an unusual
cross-cultural criminal alliance. According to federal court papers
filed in Detroit, a ring of Canadian Indians from Walpole Island,
just across the river from here, have linked up with Chinese
smugglers to bring Asian immigrants into this rural region 35 miles
northeast of Detroit. By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Port St. Lucie, Fla.) _ As Congress wrestles
with the white-hot political issue of Medicare drug benefits, many
Republicans find themselves on the hot seat at home. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-DISCOMFORT (Comfort, Texas) _ When the Civil War broke out
in 1861, a group of nearly 100 immigrant German intellectuals now
known as ``freethinkers,'' opposed to slavery and secession, fled
south from here toward the Mexican border to join the Union forces
or wait out the war in Mexico. Caught en route by Confederate
militiamen, 36 were killed in two battles. But recent efforts to
build a memorial to them has set off yet another battle. In
addition to their outspoken support for equal rights and free
speech, many freethinkers were atheists or agnostics, a fact that
some of their descendants in this highly religious community find
distasteful. By Ross E. Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   TENN-LYNCH-REVISITED (Chattanooga, Tenn.) _ In 1906, a young
black man named Ed Johnson was lynched. Just before he was hung by
the neck to die, he had said to the crowd of white men, women and
children who were watching with a kind of collective glee, ``God
bless you all. I am innocent.'' Almost 100 years later, in a
downtown courtroom here packed with a sober crowd of black and
white men, women and children, and with television news cameras
faithfully recording every moment, Johnson's last words to the mob
that brutally murdered him were vindicated. Criminal Court Judge
Douglas A. Meyers set aside Johnson's conviction of raping a white
woman. By Emily Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD-DIALLO (New York) _ The death of Amadou Diallo last year
became a defining event for the New York Police Department. The
shooting of the unarmed African immigrant by four white officers
prompted various examinations of the department's admittedly
aggressive tactics, and attracted so much attention that police
officials blamed the media for a sudden timidity among the
rank-and-file. Today, the Street Crime Unit _ once a jewel in the
administration's law-enforcement efforts _ bears only a trace
resemblance to what it was when four of its members killed Diallo
that infamous night in the Bronx. By Dan Barry.
</P>
<P>
   HOWDY-DISPUTE (New York) _ In a splashy ceremony at Rockefeller
Center earlier this month, an adoring throng applauded as a humble
puppet ascended into the television pantheon. Surviving cast
members, writers and producers of ``The Howdy Doody Show'' gathered
to see a bronze star uncovered for the redheaded, freckle-faced
marionette on NBC-TV's ``Walk of Fame.'' But Howdy wasn't there. He
was locked in a trunk in a bank vault in New London, Conn., where
he has been for the last year, and it may take a judge's order to
get him out. By Corey Kilgannon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-BACKGROUND (Washington) _ The past is central to Sen.
John McCain's campaign, yet paradoxically his most remarkable
metamorphosis, from a battered ex-pilot on crutches to a new
congressman, is among the least-known chapters of his life. By
Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-PHONE-CALLS (Cleveland) _ It was a handful of political
amateurs _ Michigan volunteers for Sen. John McCain _ who began the
telephone campaign that helped change the complexion of the
Republican presidential contest last week. Five days before the
Michigan primary, they began calling friends and neighbors who
belonged to Catholic parishes in Michigan, telling them that
McCain's opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, had given a speech
at Bob Jones University, a bastion of the Christian right whose
leaders have espoused harshly anti-Catholic views. By David
Barstow.
</P>
<P>
   WASH-PRIMARIES (Seattle) _ When the Election 2000 presidential
campaign began, the Republican and Democratic primaries that will
be held in Washington state on Tuesday were hardly more than blips
on the political horizon. But because the early months of the
campaign have been so unexpectedly topsy-turvy, suddenly the
Washington primaries, with their quirky rules and oft-quirky
voters, loom large, and candidates have been forced to change plans
and divert scarce resources and time to compete. By B. Drummond
Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-REPUBS (Detroit) _ Gov. George W. Bush's unexpected loss in
Michigan's primary last Tuesday, despite strong support from
virtually all of the Republican establishment here, has left the
state's Republican leaders divided over what went wrong. By Keith
Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-DELEGATES (Washington) _ Eventually, the quest for
presidential nominations comes down to delegates. Numbers start
counting for more than buzz, bump and momentum. For Sen. John
McCain, eventually is just around the corner. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers who shot an
unarmed African immigrant last year were acquitted of murder
charges Friday. Nevertheless, their testimony was particularly
instructive in one aspect of police-community relations: How police
officers expect you to behave when they confront you.
</P>
<P>
   Speak when asked to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Stop when ordered to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Keep hands in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   And never _ ever _ make any sudden move.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recounting that fateful February night in the Bronx
last year, the four white officers still seem baffled by Amadou
Diallo's behavior when they approached the black man outside his
building after midnight. His response, which began when he turned
away and ended when he reached for what they thought was a gun,
sealed his fate _ no matter that he was reaching for his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers were members of the Street Crime Unit; their
mission was to anticipate crime and, most of all, remove illegal
guns from the street. The plainclothes assignment carried both
considerable power and a measure of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Edward McMellon, one of the defendants, said he
approached Diallo by holding out his badge and asking to have a
word with him. Instead, he said, Diallo, who worked as a street
vendor, turned away and began digging into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policemen's response say Diallo was probably
frightened by the four strangers, and may have been trying to find
his keys to open the building's door. But Officer Sean Carroll said
he saw it this way: ``I believed he was possibly carrying a firearm
and trying to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, `Police, police, show me your hands,'' Carroll
said. ``He just didn't want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McMellon said he shouted, ``What are you
doing?''
</P>
<P>
   A slight move here, the appearance of a black object there, and
Diallo was dead, struck by 19 of 41 bullets fired. Bennett Epstein,
Carroll's lawyer, summed it up by saying, ``If he had stopped, this
whole thing would have ended peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any institutional training of the public, such
police expectations seem based on the assumption that law-abiding
residents _ including Diallo _ have street smarts. Americans, such
expectations infer, have learned how to respond to law enforcement
officers from television programs like ``Law and Order'' and ``NYPD
Blue.'' (Of course, the police on these shows are often heroic, the
residents usually suspicious.)
</P>
<P>
   But such expectations have long played havoc with the minds, if
not the lives, of black and Hispanic residents. Parents routinely
instruct their children to obey every police command _ a lesson
less commonly taught in mostly white suburbs. Several years ago,
the NAACP, Allstate Insurance Co. and the National Organization of
Black Law Enforcement Executives published a brochure on
``guidelines for interacting with law enforcement officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Perkins, a New York city councilman whose district includes
a part of Harlem, said he has directed his 18-year-old son to be
extremely careful when dealing with police _ a perversion, he says,
of the traditional view that a police officer is a friend and
protector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might think, `Let me get my ID out right away,''' Perkins
said, ``and that could lead to him getting shot. That's dangerous.
And I'm not talking about criminal kids. I'm talking about average
kids. Like Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, a state senator from Harlem, said the police
officers' expectations in the Diallo incident were in full play
even before they left their car. In addition to a preconceived
notion that Diallo was armed, he said, ``the police had an
expectation in street clothes that they should be treated as if
they had their uniforms on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Paterson said, ``Everything that he did, every
motion that he took, was taken by them to be antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Louden, a former New York police officer and the
director of the Criminal Justice Center at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, said law enforcement is based on the basic
premise that society gives the police certain powers over the rest
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who are put into positions of authority,'' he
said, ``and the rest of us are supposed to heed them and seek
resolution in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the potential for abuse or accidents, police officers
are trained in how to talk to people _ how to approach, for
example, the driver of a car pulled over for speeding. But Louden
acknowledged that people are not trained in how to be stopped by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach police what we want them to do and in a way we expect
citizens to do what the police tell them,'' Louden said.
``Sometimes it is implied in the law and often it is explicit in
the law. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers who shot an
unarmed African immigrant last year were acquitted of murder
charges Friday. Nevertheless, their testimony was particularly
instructive in one aspect of police-community relations: How police
officers expect you to behave when they confront you.
</P>
<P>
   Speak when asked to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Stop when ordered to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Keep hands in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   And never _ ever _ make any sudden move.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recounting that fateful February night in the Bronx
last year, the four white officers still seem baffled by Amadou
Diallo's behavior when they approached the black man outside his
building after midnight. His response, which began when he turned
away and ended when he reached for what they thought was a gun,
sealed his fate _ no matter that he was reaching for his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers were members of the Street Crime Unit; their
mission was to anticipate crime and, most of all, remove illegal
guns from the street. The plainclothes assignment carried both
considerable power and a measure of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Edward McMellon, one of the defendants, said he
approached Diallo by holding out his badge and asking to have a
word with him. Instead, he said, Diallo, who worked as a street
vendor, turned away and began digging into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policemen's response say Diallo was probably

said. ``He just didn't want to listen.''
</P>

   In the meantime, McMellon said he shouted, ``What are you

GEORGE BUSH, BOB JONES AND WHY CERTAIN POLITICAL SYMBOLS STICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's advisers now say it was the
single most ill-considered decision of his presidential campaign.
Struggling for political redemption after his defeat in the New
Hampshire primary, Bush raced to Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the pilgrimage seemed logical. Bob Jones is an
evangelical institution that has long been a must stop on the
court-the-conservatives circuit. Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Dan
Quayle, Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan all stumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tompkins, a seasoned strategist who ran Bush's operation
in South Carolina, said the visit was not impulsive; it had been
planned for nearly a week. ``We've always done it,'' Tompkins said
in an interview in which he took the credit _ or blame _ for the
decision. ``To ignore that block of voters would be like running on
a Democratic ticket and ignoring African-Americans or labor
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than three weeks later, Bush is still scrambling to
tamp down a furor among Republicans, Democrats, Catholics, blacks,
Jews and the dreaded pundits _ even from many of his own supporters
_ over why he dared kick off his South Carolina campaign at a
university that prohibits interracial dating and promotes
anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, who
has had his own share of stumbles, had no sympathy. ``I'd have
advised him not to go,'' he said. ``Bob Jones has been known as a
rather extreme place. Those people are really far out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides concede that this is not another mere bump on
Bush's path to the Republican presidential nomination. By the
weekend, they were huddling in Austin to come up with a way for the
governor to publicly admit the visit was a mistake _ without
stirring up more bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion is the latest instance this year in which the
Republican candidates have found themselves stranded in the thicket
of religion in politics _ and have not quite figured out how to get
out. First, Bush and other candidates were pilloried for expressing
their reverence for Jesus Christ; critics found their comments
off-putting and divisive. Now Catholics are being pitted against
the Christian right as Bush and his rival, Sen. John McCain, make
aggressive plays to both constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the Bob Jones debacle is a telling
case study of the importance of symbolic politics. Candidates who
are not sufficiently sensitive to symbols can cause themselves
irreparable damage in one fleeting utterance or, in the case of
Bush, one 45-minute appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Bush committed another symbolic blunder when
he popped up at a rally in New Hampshire flanked by his parents. It
fueled an image that he would be nowhere without his kin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones visit took on an outsized importance because Bush
has still been a relative blank slate ideologically. Since many
voters do not have a fixed image of him, the appearance allowed his
more moderate foes to depict him as dangerously conservative. When
Dole visited the university, he had a more centrist history, so
people who objected to the school's policies were willing to give
him a pass, saying that his trip was something he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's foray to Bob Jones, where he addressed 5,000 students
on a red-carpeted stage and delivered a speech trumpeting his
conservative credentials, has _ at least for now _ undermined his
months-long appeal to moderates who rallied to his ``compassionate
conservative'' message. Now, in the shorthand of a snippet of
videotape, Bush can be depicted by his rivals as a negative,
intolerant, hard-edged conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast was what was so jarring to people,'' said Michael
K. Deaver, who was Reagan's image consultant. ``George W. had gone
out of his way to tell us he was a new kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has left Bush struggling to put forth a positive
message about his agenda because McCain has refused to stop talking
about the visit. In fact, the matter may not have become an issue
had McCain not been in the picture _ and had his campaign not paid
for automated calls to voters in Michigan (where the population is
more than one-quarter Catholic) that lash Bush for failing to
denounce Bob Jones' ``anti-Catholic bigotry.'' Bob Jones Jr., the
son of the school's namesake, once called the Catholic Church a
``Satanic cult''.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip has been especially helpful to McCain, because the
senator is hardly considered a progressive. He, like Bush, had
refused to weigh in on whether a confederate flag should fly over
the state Capitol. But the visit gave Bush's detractors an opening
to accuse him of something that McCain was insulated against.
McCain's aides insist that they never got an invitation for the
senator to speak at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the candidate himself, the visit did not play well
because many Republicans have moved toward the center and have
grown impatient with religious conservatives. Bush's appearance has
bothered Republicans who are still haunted by Pat Buchanan's
vitriol at the 1992 Republican convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may simply not have adjusted to the reality
that candidates cannot make a pitch to one narrow group, or region,
these days without drawing national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in the South in the civil rights era, I know plenty
of politicians who would go to one side of town and say one thing
and the other side of town and say something else,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic strategist. ``You can't say things in South
Carolina that voters in Michigan aren't going to hear. It just
doesn't happen in modern politics any- more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, politicians get away with potentially risky
alliances. When Reagan took his 1980 presidential campaign to the
Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., near the dirt road
where civil rights workers were killed in the 1960s, he made no
mention of the racial murder there. There was no subsequent outcry.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet harpooned Bill Bradley for meeting recently with
the often divisive Rev. Al Sharpton. Vice President Al Gore also
met with Sharpton, but took pains to do it behind closed doors.
(Perhaps he learned his lesson from his much-ridiculed appearance
at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, symbols often work to a candidate's advantage. For
example, Bill Clinton stunned the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1992 by
appearing before his organization and assailing the race-baiting
rap singer Sister Souljah _ a move that cemented his willingness to
challenge core Democratic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said he pressed for the Bob Jones visit because he
thought it would help assure a high turnout from religious
conservatives. He was probably right: Bush won the primary by 11
points, buoyed by a huge showing from voters who consider
themselves religious conservatives.

single most ill-considered decision of his presidential campaign.
Struggling for political redemption after his defeat in the New
Hampshire primary, Bush raced to Bob Jones University in
Greenville, S.C., the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the pilgrimage seemed logical. Bob Jones is an
evangelical institution that has long been a must stop on the
court-the-conservatives circuit. Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Dan
Quayle, Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan all stumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tompkins, a seasoned strategist who ran Bush's operation
in South Carolina, said the visit was not impulsive; it had been
planned for nearly a week. ``We've always done it,'' Tompkins said
in an interview in which he took the credit _ or blame _ for the
decision. ``To ignore that block of voters would be like running on
a Democratic ticket and ignoring African-Americans or labor
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than three weeks later, Bush is still scrambling to
tamp down a furor among Republicans, Democrats, Catholics, blacks,
Jews and the dreaded pundits _ even from many of his own supporters
_ over why he dared kick off his South Carolina campaign at a
university that prohibits interracial dating and promotes
anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, who
has had his own share of stumbles, had no sympathy. ``I'd have
advised him not to go,'' he said. ``Bob Jones has been known as a
rather extreme place. Those people are really far out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides concede that this is not another mere bump on
Bush's path to the Republican presidential nomination. By the
weekend, they were huddling in Austin to come up with a way for the
governor to publicly admit the visit was a mistake _ without
stirring up more bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion is the latest instance this year in which the
Republican candidates have found themselves stranded in the thicket
of religion in politics _ and have not quite figured out how to get
out. First, Bush and other candidates were pilloried for expressing
their reverence for Jesus Christ; critics found their comments
off-putting and divisive. Now Catholics are being pitted against
the Christian right as Bush and his rival, Sen. John McCain, make
aggressive plays to both constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the Bob Jones debacle is a telling
case study of the importance of symbolic politics. Candidates who
are not sufficiently sensitive to symbols can cause themselves
irreparable damage in one fleeting utterance or, in the case of
Bush, one 45-minute appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Bush committed another symbolic blunder when
he popped up at a rally in New Hampshire flanked by his parents. It
fueled an image that he would be nowhere without his kin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones visit took on an outsized importance because Bush
has still been a relative blank slate ideologically. Since many
voters do not have a fixed image of him, the appearance allowed his
more moderate foes to depict him as dangerously conservative. When
Dole visited the university, he had a more centrist history, so
people who objected to the school's policies were willing to give
him a pass, saying that his trip was something he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's foray to Bob Jones, where he addressed 5,000 students
on a red-carpeted stage and delivered a speech trumpeting his
conservative credentials, has _ at least for now _ undermined his
months-long appeal to moderates who rallied to his ``compassionate
conservative'' message. Now, in the shorthand of a snippet of
videotape, Bush can be depicted by his rivals as a negative,
intolerant, hard-edged conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast was what was so jarring to people,'' said Michael
K. Deaver, who was Reagan's image consultant. ``George W. had gone
out of his way to tell us he was a new kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has left Bush struggling to put forth a positive
message about his agenda because McCain has refused to stop talking
about the visit. In fact, the matter may not have become an issue
had McCain not been in the picture _ and had his campaign not paid
for automated calls to voters in Michigan (where the population is
more than one-quarter Catholic) that lash Bush for failing to
denounce Bob Jones' ``anti-Catholic bigotry.'' Bob Jones Jr., the
son of the school's namesake, once called the Catholic Church a
``Satanic cult''.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip has been especially helpful to McCain, because the
senator is hardly considered a progressive. He, like Bush, had
refused to weigh in on whether a confederate flag should fly over
the state Capitol. But the visit gave Bush's detractors an opening
to accuse him of something that McCain was insulated against.
McCain's aides insist that they never got an invitation for the
senator to speak at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the candidate himself, the visit did not play well
because many Republicans have moved toward the center and have
grown impatient with religious conservatives. Bush's appearance has
bothered Republicans who are still haunted by Pat Buchanan's
vitriol at the 1992 Republican convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may simply not have adjusted to the reality
that candidates cannot make a pitch to one narrow group, or region,
these days without drawing national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in the South in the civil rights era, I know plenty
of politicians who would go to one side of town and say one thing
and the other side of town and say something else,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic strategist. ``You can't say things in South
Carolina that voters in Michigan aren't going to hear. It just
doesn't happen in modern politics any- more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, politicians get away with potentially risky
alliances. When Reagan took his 1980 presidential campaign to the
Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss., near the dirt road
where civil rights workers were killed in the 1960s, he made no
mention of the racial murder there. There was no subsequent outcry.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet harpooned Bill Bradley for meeting recently with
the often divisive Rev. Al Sharpton. Vice President Al Gore also
met with Sharpton, but took pains to do it behind closed doors.
(Perhaps he learned his lesson from his much-ridiculed appearance
at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, symbols often work to a candidate's advantage. For
example, Bill Clinton stunned the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1992 by
appearing before his organization and assailing the race-baiting
rap singer Sister Souljah _ a move that cemented his willingness to
challenge core Democratic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said he pressed for the Bob Jones visit because he
thought it would help assure a high turnout from religious
conservatives. He was probably right: Bush won the primary by 11
points, buoyed by a huge showing from voters who consider
themselves religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The journey took on even more significance because it was Bush's
first stop after New Hampshire. ``That was pure accident; it was
not done by design,'' Tompkins said, explaining that it was the
only time slot that worked for the governor and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   The content of Bush's speech at the university is of no
consequence (though the after-the-fact kibitzers say he could have
diffused the whole thing by telling the audience that he took issue
with some of the school's policies). Bush waited until a news
conference after the speech to say he disagreed with the school's
racial policy and rejected any anti-Catholic sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   On a fundamental level, the visit may simply point to poor staff
work in the Bush campaign. Tompkins said he sent the campaign's top
officials a ``very detailed briefing paper on questions that came
up'' at Bob Jones in the past, notably on interracial dating and
Catholic matters. (The university began admitting black students
after losing its tax-exempt status in the 1970s for refusing to do
so.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any discussions with those officials about
the possible perils of the visit, Tompkins said none that he was
involved in. Tompkins acknowledges that the campaign needs to
address the matter quickly, particularly as the campaign turns to
states where the Catholic vote is crucial. ``They're going to have
to deal with the anti-Catholic stuff straight up,'' he said. ``I'd
argue to be very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, who advises both Bush and McCain, said the
problem was not Bush's initial appearance, but his subsequent
failure to more aggressively denounce Bob Jones' policies. ``It
seemed somewhat half-hearted,'' he said. ``Governor Bush needs to
be very firm here, and very direct. That opportunity was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the second-guessing, Bush's fateful appearance may have
occurred because his aides in Austin did not abide by the first
rule of presidential politics: Don't trust what your local advisers
tell you. They don't want you to lose in their state. After that,
you're on your own.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Oh, what a lovely war. Or so the Kremlin would like its
citizens to believe.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, seven months of Chechen conflict seems a
bloodbath to rival any of the ethnic knifings that have scarred the
planet since the Cold War ended and nationalism slipped its leash.
Chechnya is a wasteland; its capital Grozny, once home to 400,000,
obliterated. Tales of atrocities are rife. Three hundred thousand
refugees have fled. By the reckoning of experts, 10,000 people may
have perished _ and the fight isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, though, almost no one sees it that way. As the
Kremlin presents it _ and so far, Russians buy it _ Chechnya
remains what it was at its start last August: a noble crusade
against terrorists and bandits, waged by an army intent on
liberating innocents, not executing or raping them. And it is a
crusade on the verge of victory, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is obvious between the view Russians have of
Chechnya and the one most Westerners adopted toward last year's
NATO war against Yugoslavia. Which is no accident: Chechnya is the
first Russian war in history in which leaders have had to factor
public support into their military equations. In many ways, Kosovo
is the template with which they began.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not where they wound up. The modern Western view of
war, forged in Vietnam and honed to a fare-thee-well in the Persian
Gulf and Kosovo, is that no conflict can long survive the absence
of public support _ and that public support moves in inverse
proportion to the number of troops lost.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, monitored almost bomb-by-bomb, kept an
indisputably tight rein last year on NATO's military strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has turned the lesson of the Persian Gulf and Kosovo
inside out: With public support, a war can thrive. And so in
Russia's first real democratic war, the Kremlin has shaped national
opinion with a campaign redolent of the old Soviet Union's most
xenophobic propaganda. And the military, liberated rather than
restrained by popular feeling, has pursued victory with
disturbingly vicious abandon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, success has begotten success. ``In the
beginning, there was an attempt to depict it as a no-casualty war,
like Kosovo,'' Pavel Felgengauer, a military analyst and former
journalist, said last week. ``You could notice that now this theme
has virtually disappeared from Russian propaganda. Now the theme
is, `We've won, and the enemy is defeated, and everything's
fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is another indicator, as if another were needed, that Russia
views Western concepts like democratic rule and consent of the
governed through the opposite end of the telescope. And it is
another spadeful of dirt on the notion, naive in retrospect, that
either smart bombs or representative government would transform war
into something more humane.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say, of course, that either Russians or their
government are inured to body counts or television footage of
coffins coming home. The Soviet Union quit its long war in
Afghanistan 12 years ago in no small part because the sheer number
of combat deaths had elevated the conflict to an unavoidable
political issue, even before the advent of democracy. Russia's
botched effort to subdue Chechnya four years ago, and the
casualties that stemmed from it, were pillars of the public's
overwhelming support for impeaching President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Chechen war, military leaders have sought to
emulate NATO's own careful strategy of relentless bombing from afar
_ a strategy that allowed the West to win the war without a ground
offensive or even a single combat death among its own forces.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent observers believe _ and according to polls, so
does the Russian public _ that the government has lowballed its
tally of combat deaths. Officially the toll is more than 1,500, but
it is widely suspected to be twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the option of keeping war politically palatable by
limiting the body count has never been a serious one here.
Chechnya's Islamic guerrillas could not be bombed out of existence
without leveling the entire region _ something the Russian military
has come perilously close to achieving. Even so, the Russians have
not been able to avoid a ground war, house-to-house firefights and
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big differences between Kosovo and Chechnya.
The West relied on an arsenal of smart bombs to limit civilian
deaths and high-tech aircraft and equipment to keep its troops out
of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military has neither, and its troops, a mix of
conscripts, soldiers of fortune and career officers, is woefully
short of discipline. The result has been a civilian death toll and
a record of apparent atrocities that is internationally mortifying
_ and that would trigger a political revolt in most societies.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, it has not. Indeed, after six months of war, 7 in 10
Russians favor continuing the Chechen war to the bitter end,
according to a survey by the Public Opinion Foundation, a respected
Moscow polling organization.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is surely because Russians truly see Chechnya's
rebels, with a long list of kidnappings and grisly executions to
their credit, as entirely deserving of extermination. In part, it
is because terrorist bombings that killed more than 300 people last
year galvanized the country behind the extermination of the Islamic
radicals who are blamed for _ if not yet charged with _ the
killings. In part, it is simple racism: dark-skinned Caucasians
remain doormats in a nation that has a long way to go to achieve
any measure of tolerance.

   But as much as anything, perhaps, it is because of the way this
war has been cast by its Kremlin authors: as a test of Russian
manhood, if not of the nation's very existence. Senior Russian
officials and their political allies more and more equate criticism
of the Chechen war with treason. Western complaints about human
rights issues are branded as anti-Russian agitprop.

   Last week a German video tape was released showing Russian
troops doing a mass burial of bound Chechen soldiers. Such things
are dismissed not just as lies, but as malicious interference in
Russia's affairs.

<P>
   All this harkens to Kosovo, a war that is still seen in the
Kremlin and among ordinary Russians as poaching on Russian turf. No
doubt the theme of Russia reasserting its sphere of influence is an
effective way to marshal Russian support for the Chechen war _ and,
maybe, to score electoral points in the process. The xenophobic
image of Fortress Russia, beleaguered and under assault by enemies
near and far, is a popular theme in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a theme at loggerheads with the Kremlin's stated
intention of hauling Russia out of its Soviet-era trance and
propelling it into the international community. That goal would be
especially poorly served if the price for sustaining the war's
popularity turns out to be a return to Soviet-style manipulation of
opinionand truth, however much Fortress Russia is reinvigorated.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 27, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BOBJONES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's
advisers say his speech at Bob Jones University was the single most
ill-considered decision of his presidential campaign. It was
clearly not just another mere bump on Bush's path to the GOP
nomination. By this weekend, Bush's aides were huddling to come up
with a way for him to publicly admit the visit was a mistake _
without stirring up more bad publicity. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ From the outside, seven months
of Chechen conflict seems a bloodbath to rival anything since World
War II. Chechnya is a wasteland; its capital, Grozny, obliterated.
Tales of atrocities are rife, and 300,000 refugees have fled. But
inside Russia, almost no one sees it that way. The Kremlin's
official line, which so far has been accepted by the Russian
public, is that Chechnya was a noble crusade against terrorists and
bandits, waged by an army intent on liberating innocents, not
executing or raping them. By Michael Wines. (Moved in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-IMPACT-REVIEW (New York) _ After an Albany jury acquitted
four New York City police officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo,
the judge declared the book closed. That is true as far as the
courtroom goes. But it may take a while before the book closes, if
it ever does, on the troubled collective conscience of New York and
perhaps elsewhere in America. It was hard for many New Yorkers to
shake the sense that this had all come out wrong. Even if heads
said the jury had done its job, hearts ached. By Clyde Haberman.
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-POLICE-REVIEW (New York) _ Although the officers who
killed Amadou Diallo were found innocent of all charges, their
trial testimony was instructive in how police expect you to behave
when they confront you. Speak when asked to speak. Stop when
ordered to stop. Keep your hands in plain view. And never _ EVER _
make a sudden move. By Dan Barry.
</P>
<P>
   DIALLO-SONGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ An innocent man slain by police
is remembered in songs. Some excerpted lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-JOURNALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even the high drama of
disaster, violence and political upheaval that dominates the news
can lose its luster for many journalists who entered their
profession mainly to seek new experiences. After a time, a news
writer may begin to sense a kind of sameness in most of the events
that pass as news. But a lucky few discover that in science, almost
alone of all human endeavors, there is always something new under
the sun. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN-TREATMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at trends in relieving
pain in cancer patients and others in severe discomfort.
Comprehending the magnitude of pain that accompanies some medical
conditions is very difficult for those who have not themselves
suffered. Among the several difficulties inherent in the
misapprehensions about the treatment of pain is the troublesome
fact that there has never been any accurate way to measure its
severity. But this may be changing. By Sherwin B. Nuland.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM-PARTY-REVIEW (Washington) _ For all the money and fury
involved in the primary campaigns of the two major parties, there
is another contest going on under the radar, among the
mud-spattered troops of the Reform Party slogging through their own
wilderness campaign. Eventually, the Democratic and Republican
victors will have to pay attention. For, barring intrusion by Ross
Perot, the expectation among political professionals is that the
Reform line could be resurrected this fall by Patrick Buchanan. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MONEYLAUNDER-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's no longer hard to
become the financial mogul _ replete with an aristocratic title
conveying pomp and privilege _ that you've always dreamed of
becoming. Just visit the Internet. There are throngs of outfits on
the Web that cater to these desires. For example, just type in
``offshoresecrets.com'' and enter a world promising ``fast, safe,
private, and affordable off-shore services.'' Those services
include providing customers with banking charters in such obscure
locales as Nevis and Vanuatu for a fee of about $20,000. By Timothy
L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Grammy Awards can be seen as a
sort of musical Land That Time Forgot, a place where the best
surprise is no surprise. This is where the music business tries to
place its imprimatur on the ungovernable energies of American pop
culture. ``Old people _ the Grammy voters _ like to be reminded
that the young people aren't taking over, which is ironic when
you're talking about pop music,'' notes popular culture critic
Robert Wilonsky. For instance, the organization once awarded Petula
Clark a Grammy over the Beatles. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TAIWAN-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Who lost Taiwan? Even the
possibility that this question may some day be asked must be
horrifying for China's leaders. For in China's history-laden
politics, almost nothing matters more than the idea of Taiwan's
eventual return to the motherland, especially now that Hong Kong
and Macau are back. And this emotional truth may aid the
interpretation of the White Paper they issued last week, warning
more explicitly than before that Taiwan's foot-dragging in
negotiations, let alone a declaration of independence, could force
China into ``drastic measures.'' By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REFORM-REVIEW (Tehran, Iran) _ United by little more than
antagonism toward the insular clerics who have tried desperately to
maintain their monopoly on ideas, the self-styled reformers have
now gained the upper hand following their victory in the first
round of parliamentary elections Feb. 18. The reform movement is
partly a backlash against a conservative clerical cartel that fears
change and has tried to stifle it with arrests and violence. It is
also a natural by-product of the theocratic regime that has ruled
Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. By Susan Sachs.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his tiny cubicle in the Russell Senate Office
Building, in the lowest foothills of political power, a frustrated
Navy officer wrestled with friends over what to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979, and it was becoming clear that he would never make
admiral like his father and grandfather. He had always dreamed of
doing something great, of imprinting his name on the history books,
but at age 42 he found himself with a stuttering military career
and no base from which to go into politics.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, his personal life was a mess: Although he was
still living with his wife, he was aggressively courting a
25-year-old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich.
</P>
<P>
   That troubled period was perhaps the crucial turning point in
John McCain's life, and the decisions that he made then started him
on the course that he hopes will take him to the White House in
January. In just a few years from those times of soul-searching in
his office as Navy liaison to the Senate, McCain would have a new
wife, a new home state and a bright new political star as president
of the class of newly elected Republican members of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate running on character and biography, it is also
an awkward time to remember: McCain abandoned his wife, who had
reared their three children alone while he was in Vietnamese
prisons, and he then began his political career with the resources
of his new wife's family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although McCain's children and some friends were angry and
disappointed with him at the time, they rally around him today. No
candidate could be luckier in his choice of an ex-wife than McCain,
and he must be the only politician around who could cheat on his
wife and divorce her and still get her support and her campaign
contributions today. Even her friends rave about him.
</P>
<P>
   The past is central to McCain's campaign, yet paradoxically his
most remarkable metamorphosis, from a battered ex-pilot on crutches
to a new congressman, is among the least-known chapters of his
storybook life. McCain's best-selling autobiography ends with his
release from Vietnam prisons, omitting everything afterward. McCain
and his present wife, Cindy, both declined to be interviewed about
that period for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is that phase of McCain's life that underscores his
contradictions and complexities, and that reflects most clearly the
dogged, clenched-jaw determination that seems central to his
personality. McCain may come across as carefree, but friends and
family members say his relaxed style camouflages a braiding of
drive and ambition that enabled McCain to turn his life around
after Vietnam and that, today, explains his campaign for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The story began when Vietnam released McCain and other prisoners
of war in March 1973. He stepped off a military transport plane on
crutches, an instant war hero, and he quickly had a painful shock.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carol, a tall, slim woman who had once been a model,
had nearly died in a horrific car wreck in 1969. Ross Perot, the
businessman and advocate of prisoners of war, had paid for her
medical care, but the injuries left her 4 inches shorter and on
crutches, and she had gained a good deal of weight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was no great shakes to look at himself. He was still
troubled by two broken arms, a broken leg, a shattered knee and
bayonet wounds. Few thought that he could ever fly again, but
McCain was desperate to try.
</P>
<P>
   So he signed up for an excruciating therapy. Twice a week, for
two hours at a time, he would lie in a whirlpool bath with water as
hot as he could stand, and then the physical therapist (he called
her his physical terrorist) would force his knee to bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In physical therapy, you measure pain on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 10 being maximum, off the wall,'' recalled the therapist,
Diane Lawrence. ``Many times we got close to 10, and he would just
put a hand over his face, and say, `Honey, that's it.' And we would
stop for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with his dream of flying again, McCain embraced the
pain and never missed a therapy session, Lawrence said. And he lit
up the clinic with his jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient at the time was Ann Jones, then a 12-year-old
girl struggling to understand the implications of the words ``brain
tumor'' that were whispered around her. Others at the clinic
remember that McCain used to arrive early to cheer up Ann and later
dropped by her home when she was dying.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Sylvia, has not seen McCain since, but she
chokes as she recalls her daughter's radiance at the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, and I'm not trying to promote John McCain
politically,'' Jones said. ``But it tells you something about the
character of this man. There was nothing in it for him to do this.
It was only kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine months of therapy, McCain took his flight physical
and somehow passed. He could be a pilot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in to see me, and he said, `Honey, I made it,'''
Lawrence recalled. ``He had tears in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain won a coveted assignment as commanding officer of the
Navy's largest squadron, the Replacement Air Group in Jacksonville,
Fla. This was McCain's first chance to command men (and a very few
women), but the squadron had a mediocre record, and parts shortages
meant that only half the planes were flyable at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inertia had set in,'' recalled Carl Smith, then an instructor
pilot in the squadron. ``We had some crusty old guys running
maintenance, and they were masters at saying, `no, no, no.' But
then McCain came in and changed them overnight and brought in new
people.''
</P>
<P>
   All this raised eyebrows and hackles, and some senior officers
grumbled about favoritism for the admiral's son. When McCain failed
in his initial efforts to qualify to land an A-7 aircraft on a
carrier, a failure that would have blocked his career, some senior
officers were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John M. Johnson, then a junior officer helping people qualify
for the A-7, remembers two senior officers taking him and a
co-worker aside and ordering them to make sure that McCain did not
make it. But the junior officers were mesmerized by ``the
Skipper,'' as McCain was called, because of both his record in
Vietnam and his glow of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson and the other young officers coached the Skipper
tirelessly for his second try on the A-7, training him on the
simulator and prepping him every moment they could. And when he
qualified, they held a huge party, celebrating him for a version of
the inspiration and iconoclasm that he now lays claim to in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally joined the Navy to avoid being drafted in the
Army,'' Johnson recalled, but he added that he stayed partly
because he had been so inspired by the Skipper. Johnson has done
fine for himself since then: He made his comments in an e-mail
interview from the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, where he is
the admiral in charge of the carrier battle group.
</P>
<P>
   This loyalty to the Skipper was widespread. As one tracks down
and talks to the men he once commanded, it is striking how often
their voices light up as they describe something magical about him.
</P>
<P>
   Officers recall that he would hurtle into the maintenance shops
and start kidding the officers, peppering them with rapid-fire
questions and jokes, urging them, scolding them and leaving them
fired up. McCain learned the names of all the enlisted men so that
he could tease them as vociferously as the officers, a mild breach
of protocol that won their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   They responded, and by the time he left the squadron in 1977,
every single aircraft had left the disabled list _ the last one,
which had been out for two years, was restored on his next-to-last
day.
</P>
<P>
   Although plagued by fatal accidents in the past, the squadron
had no fatalities under his command (a turkey buzzard that
shattered the windshield of a student pilot's plane almost changed
that, but officers talked the pilot down safely), and won its first
meritorious unit citation. McCain's success attracted notice among
the admirals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important to McCain's future, the Florida years
gave him a chance to hone his speaking skills and think about
politics. Hailed as a war hero, he was invited to address Rotary
Clubs and high schools, and he perfected his off-the-cuff speaking
style, scrawling a few notes on the back of an envelope and then
giving patriotic speeches laced with humor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, some local Republicans urged McCain to run for Congress
against the longtime Democratic incumbent, Charles E. Bennett.
McCain toyed with the idea and called up an old classmate, Charles
R. Larson, who remembers urging him to stay in the Navy for at
least another couple of years to get the pension and medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was not an entirely new idea, for McCain had always
been far more ambitious than he liked to let on. Connie Bookbinder,
Carol McCain's college roommate and close friend, realized early on
that this young Navy man had plenty of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were dating,'' Bookbinder recalled, ``I asked Carol:
`What does John want to do with his life? Does he want to be an
admiral like his dad?' She said, `He wants to do something
important, so he'll be in the history books.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain let the scope of his ambitions slip out again in the fall
of 1970, when he was in Vietnam and four of the prisoners of war
were put together in a cell. They spent a couple of weeks talking
nonstop, and the conversation soon touched on their dreams: One
wanted to have command of his own squadron, another wanted to be an
academic, the third yearned to be a military attache in an embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked John what he wanted to be _ chief of naval
operations?'' recalled Richard A. Stratton, one of those present.
``He said, no, the best job in the Navy is commander in chief of
Pacific forces, because then you're chief warrior. But he said that
what he really wanted to be was president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him, it's no flash in the pan, no sudden dream,''
Stratton said. ``He's been thinking of this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain decided not to run for Congress in 1976, but
after Jacksonville he got an assignment that put him in the center
of the political world anyway: He was appointed Navy liaison to the
Senate. Normally, the liaison officers are glorified travel agents
for senators making overseas trips _ ``baggage carriers,'' they are
snidely called _ but McCain's personality and renown as a war hero
made his cramped office a magnet for key senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fascinating character,'' recalled Gary Hart, then a
liberal young senator who often dropped by McCain's office. ``He
was current on the issues and could engage on every level. And he
was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractions for some liberals was that McCain held no
grudge against the antiwar movement. William B. Bader, then a
Senate committee staff member, remembers sitting next to McCain on
an airplane as they accompanied a delegation of senators on an
overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``One senator after another came back to talk to John,'' Bader
said. ``The senators who came back were the biggest doves, and I
think psychologically they wanted to make their peace with the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain became particularly close to William Cohen, then a
senator from Maine, John Tower, then a senator from Texas, and
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to show respect for senators while at the same time
teasing them. He cemented his friendships on foreign trips when he
took senators bar-hopping in Athens, Greece, or to a meeting with
the sultan of Oman in a tent in the desert (the Americans were
supposed to cross their legs, and when McCain's injuries prevented
him from doing this, Tower teased him mercilessly for creating an
international incident).
</P>
<P>
   Early on, McCain showed his maverick streak. President Carter
was then trying to replace large aircraft carriers with smaller
ones, a policy that McCain and some others in the military thought
was catastrophic and would reduce America's ability to project
power around the world. So McCain conspired with several senators
and staff members to win financing for a large carrier over the
objections of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very strongly about it, but we were out of whack with
the commander in chief and the secretary of the Navy,'' said James
McGovern, who then worked under McCain in the liaison office. ``You
can't control John. He's very much his own man. He stands on
principle, and he's not your classic compromiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Although quietly backed by some senior Navy officers, this was
an exceptionally delicate operation to subvert White House and
Pentagon policy. And it worked: The Senate financed a new large
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as if he was a rogue elephant working on his own,''
said Rhett Dawson, then staff director on the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``But could he have been fired for it if he'd been
caught? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   These political battles thrilled McCain, and he came to feel
increasingly restless. He told friends that he was looking for
something new because he would never make admiral, and they mostly
agreed. His physical injuries were the biggest problem, but his
outspokenness could be self-destructive as well as charming.
</P>
<P>
   His office-mates would cringe when he would get a telephone call
from some admiral's secretary, asking him to hold for the man
himself. As McGovern recalls it, McCain would slam the phone down,
and when it would ring a moment later, they would hear McCain's
voice, angrily: ``No, we weren't cut off. I hung up. You can
presume that I'm as busy as you are. If you really want to talk to
me, pick up the phone yourself and call me!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's angst about his career, family members and friends say,
arose partly because he felt that he had been spared death for
something larger, but, at midlife, he could not see what it was.
McCain had repeatedly survived catastrophic accidents, beginning in
flight school when the plane he was flying crashed into the sea (he
was knocked unconscious but came to as the plane landed on the
bottom, and he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam to the
surface).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he sensed that life held something bigger for him, but
he didn't know what it was yet,'' said Doug McCain, his eldest son.
The younger McCain remembers once going with his parents to France
and visiting Napoleon's tomb _ Napoleon had been a childhood hero
of John McCain's _ and sensing that his father was searching for
any lessons history might hold about how he himself might best
serve his country.
</P>
<P>
   As John McCain puzzled over his career, he also found himself
sorting out his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Navy, many considered it appropriate for a swashbuckling
pilot to pick up a girlfriend here or there, and stories began to
spread about McCain and young women. But McCain was discreet in his
indiscretions: He did not carouse with young women on Capitol Hill
or take dates to the Monocle, a bar near the Senate that he often
went to, and he did not drink himself silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in politics need a drink to loosen up,'' said
Hart, noting that he had never seen McCain even close to drunk.
``John's loose all the time. He never needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has acknowledged running around with women and accepted
responsibility for the breakup of the marriage, without going into
details. But his supporters and his biographer, Robert Timberg, all
suggest that the marriage had already effectively ended and that
the couple had separated by the time he met Cindy, his present
wife.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the most soothing way of explaining a politician's
divorce from a crippled wife and his remarriage to a wealthy
heiress, but it does not jibe with accounts of family members and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   John and Carol McCain had separated once briefly after they
moved to Washington, when he moved his gear into his mother's house
on Connecticut Avenue. That was the first hint that Joe McCain,
John's younger brother, had of any marital problems, for neither
John nor Carol confided much about personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking him one time,'' Joe McCain recalled. ``I
said: `You don't look so happy. You want to talk about it?' And he
said, `No, pal.'''
</P>
<P>
   That separation lasted about two weeks and was not repeated
until the final split, said their son Andy, and even close family
friends never knew about it. To outsiders, who often visited the
McCain household, the marriage seemed as close as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely living together as man and wife when I
was there,'' recalled Smith, the former instructor pilot, who moved
to Washington and lived with the McCains in their home from about
February through May 1979. ``And there were no signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody to say that they were separated or at each
other's throats is just nonsense,'' Smith said. ``Complete
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at precisely the time that Smith was a guest in what
appeared to be a happy household, in April 1979, McCain accompanied
a group of senators on a trip to China. The Navy threw a big
cocktail party for the group during a stopover in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I were talking, and then somebody tapped me on the
shoulder and I turned around and exchanged a few words,'' said
Albert A. Lakeland, then a Senate staff member. ``When I turned
around, John was gone. I looked around, and he was making a beeline
for this very attractive blond woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent the whole party talking to her, and he kept avoiding
me when I approached,'' Lakeland said. After the reception, McCain
and the young woman, Cindy Hensley, went out to dinner, and the
romance blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to pursue Hensley, telephoning her to keep in
touch. When she thanked him for sending flowers that had just
arrived (signed ``John''), he modestly said it was nothing. In
fact, as she discovered years later, they were from another man
named John.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, McCain pursued Hensley aggressively,
flying around the country to see her, and he began to push to end
his marriage. Friends say that Carol McCain was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Late that year, the McCains finally separated, and Mrs. McCain
accepted a divorce the next February. McCain promptly married
Hensley, his present wife.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first Mrs. McCain never seems to have said a harsh word
about McCain (nor he about her), and she was discreet even with
friends. Bookbinder, her old roommate, says that her first inkling
came when Mrs. McCain met her one day and abruptly said, ``I'm
getting a divorce.'' When Bookbinder, who was stunned, asked what
had gone wrong, Mrs. McCain answered, ``It's just one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's three children in the first marriage were less
forgiving at first, and none of them was in attendance when he
married Cindy. No one blamed Cindy, however, for she seemed shy,
and it was clear that it was McCain who had been the pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly disappointed and mad at Dad,'' remembered
Andy, who said it took almost four years for his anger to
evaporate. He added: ``I hold him responsible. I don't hold Cindy
responsible a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old friends believe that McCain was as restless in the
marriage as in the Navy, and that he was actively looking for a new
wife when he met Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it was that the marriage had come unglued,'' said
George Day, an old friend who represented McCain as a lawyer in the
divorce. ``Then what happened with meeting Cindy, was that he had
already made the decision to get divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family friends were appalled that a man who seemed so
decent, so full of compassion for anyone who needed help, could
treat his own wife in a manner they regarded as brutal. But McCain
gradually won everyone around again, with the same traits he now
displays after making a mistake: a combination of charm and
penitence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ticked,'' said Nancy Reynolds, an old family friend.
``I'd glare at him, and he'd say, `Nance!''' Reynolds paused and
laughed and added: ``If you meet him, you're under his spell. He's
irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that McCain always accepted blame _ embraced it _
rather than making excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always felt very guilty about it,'' McGovern said. ``I
have never talked with him for more than 40 minutes when he didn't
bring it up, saying he felt badly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So John and Carol McCain managed to remain friends, and she has
backed him in all his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy about John McCain and I love him to pieces,'' Carol
McCain said, ``but I'm just not going to do any interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, his children have all gotten over their anger, to the
point that their son Doug chose his father to be best man at his
wedding. And four years ago, after a family conference to make sure
there would be no hard feelings, son Andy decided to go to work in
Arizona for the beer distributorship owned by Cindy McCain's
family. All the children, including those from his second marriage,
are enthusiastically backing their father's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   While the remarriage caused turmoil in his family, it also made
for some new political opportunities for McCain. No one who knows
him thinks that he remarried for political reasons, but it helped
solve one of his basic obstacles if he wished to pursue politics:
Where to run for office?
</P>
<P>
   McCain had grown up as a Navy child, born abroad in the Canal
Zone and constantly moving. But his new wife had firm roots in
Phoenix, where her father was a wealthy beer magnate, so McCain
began to think about running for Congress from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1981, Cohen called J. Brian Smith, a Washington
political consultant who knew Arizona well, and asked him to meet
McCain. Smith said he let the matter slide, because, ``I thought it
was far-fetched that this guy was going to move to Arizona and run
for Congress a year later.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen called again, though, and Smith and McCain finally met for
lunch. As they ate, McCain excitedly explained how he could win a
race for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking him, `What district?''' Smith remembered. ``And
he didn't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they agreed to work together. In March 1981, McCain moved
to Phoenix, where his father-in-law gave him a public relations job
that amounted to an excuse to go around the state giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain expressed interest in elective office, some people
encouraged him to run for the state Legislature. But the state
Legislature had residency requirements that he would not be able to
meet; if he was to run, it would have to be for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January 1982, 10 months after the McCains had moved to
Arizona, the congressman in the neighboring district, John Rhodes,
called a press conference. On the assumption that Rhodes might
declare that he would not run again, McCain hurriedly sent his wife
out to look for a house they could buy in Rhodes' district.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes did retire. And, as Smith describes it, Cindy McCain
returned moments after the press conference ended, having already
found a house in the district. They bought it and moved in right
away, and two months later McCain announced his candidacy for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized it was a long shot,'' recalled William Ball, an
old friend. ``He was not the establishment candidate _ just like
today.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Muhamat Uflla, 57, ran for his
life on the tempestuous night of Feb. 3, when Serbs rampaged in
their enclave of northern Mitrovica after a grenade attack on a
Serbian cafe. At least eight Albanians died that night, but
Saturday Uflla was registering with the U.N. police to try to
return to his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be solved; it's now or never,'' he said on the
south side of the Ibar River, the Albanian side, where he fled with
his family. But does he expect to go back soon? ``Well, only when
security improves,'' he finally said. ``But we have to go back to
our homes,'' he said, crying. ``No one should stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from NATO capitals shocked at the
violence in Mitrovica and keenly aware that it symbolizes the
West's failure so far to bring any real measure of security,
justice or freedom of movement to minorities in Kosovo, the
province's international authorities have hastily drawn up a plan
intended to improve the town's precarious state.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica has encapsulated many of the West's problems, fully
eight months after peacekeepers entered Kosovo. There are not
nearly enough international police officers to patrol even this
part of Kosovo adequately, while interethnic violence and
intimidation continue undiminished all over the province; there is
not a functioning judicial system to try those who are arrested, so
many killers walk free; NATO soldiers are forced to do more
policing, something for which they have not been equipped or
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disheartening to international officials here, NATO
governments are evidently weary of the commitment of men and money,
with officials from the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright complaining bitterly that
other countries are not keeping their commitments to supply
personnel, police officers and funds. At the same time, other
nations complain that U.S. troops are so nervous about any
soldier's getting hurt that they have been unwilling to take real
risks, and that U.S. officials are too willing to blame every
problem on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As a first gesture _ largely dismissed here as cosmetic _ the
U.N. authorities and NATO's peacekeepers are building a pedestrian
bridge across the Ibar that will lead almost directly to the three
apartment blocks where Uflla and other Albanians lived. Many of the
apartments themselves have already been looted in a three-hour
period when peacekeepers were called away to another incident, said
U.N. police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But both the few international police here and officials from
the U.N. high commissioner for refugees are concerned about too
early a return, even a symbolic one for the television cameras.
``It won't solve the real problem, which takes time and a lot of
effort,'' a senior official said. ``They were killing each other 10
days ago. One little protected zone is no answer to the problem of
the Serbs in the north or the impunity of violence everywhere in
Kosovo. KFOR just needs to sit on it for a while,'' the official
said, using the common abbreviation for the NATO-led peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. official here, Mitrovica's
troubles are a chance to prove to Western governments that the
``status quo'' they have been supporting in Kosovo will not hold,
he said, and that there needs to be a new dose of commitment: of
money, soldiers and especially police officers.
</P>
<P>
   He has been promised 4,000 international policemen and wants
6,000, but so far only about 2,000 have arrived, meaning that only
1,800 are on the beat at any given moment. Kouchner, a Frenchman,
is in a running battle with his own government over France's
failure to provide the promised police.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the police patrolling Mitrovica, like an American from
Atlanta, who has been here six months and himself lives in one of
the three Albanian apartment buildings, are scathing about the lack
of support. ``We don't have normal backup or any real justice
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman from Northern Ireland said: ``If we had enough
police we'd certainly go for a more proactive policy, clamping down
on arms and violence. But with no judicial system, we can arrest
people all day, and they're let out _ there's just no deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   A policeman from Canada said: ``Sure we can bash heads all day.
But then don't ask us to walk a beat and have people's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   All the police officers interviewed agreed that there is not
enough security or safety to send Albanians back to the north.
``It's much worse than Northern Ireland,'' the second policeman
said. ``The hatred is so intense, and it can flare any time, and we
haven't got the resources. For now, we just need to keep them
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In early September, when refugee officials tried to bring a
small number of Albanians back to northern Mitrovica, Serbs fired
on them, and on the U.N. officials. No one wants a repeat of that,
and officials worry along with Ardian Ibishi, a young Albanian in
southern Mitrovica, that under the current conditions of tension,
any new returnees ``can go back, but they'll only be able to stay
one night.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner and the peacekeepers' commander, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt,
have taken some action here: replacing the U.N. police chief,
putting the new police chief's office in the town's NATO
peacekeeping headquarters, to improve coordination; putting in more
police officers and troops and a few international judges and
prosecutors; and changing a press spokeswoman perceived by some
townspeople as pro-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   They are working hard now to sell their plan for more
investment, jobs, services and security to local leaders of both
sides in Mitrovica, especially to the traumatized Serbs who see the
town as their last stand in Kosovo, let alone to Washington and
London, which ``want Mitrovica suddenly solved yesterday,'' as one
senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the effort is simply to get Albanians who fled the most
recent violence back into their apartments, before they are
completely looted or occupied by others. The three apartment blocks
are very heavily guarded these days, though some apartments on the
lower floors are still gaping open, their doors smashed down or
ripped from the hinges, their furniture overturned and closets
ransacked. One apartment of an Albanian family still has
half-packed suitcases on the beds; evidently they had to flee
sooner than they had thought.
</P>
<P>
   The new footbridge that the peacekeepers hope to build _ and
that Serbs vow not to allow _ seems ludicrous, given that there is
another only 200 yards away. But that bridge is the flash point of
everything in Mitrovica, guarded by an increasingly large
complement of troops, armor and coils of razor wire, to prevent
large crowds of Albanians from crossing over into the north. Tough
young Serbs with Motorola walkie-talkies and dressed in bright blue
overalls liberated from a gas station guard their end of the
bridge, keeping watch from the Dolce Vita cafe, past which any
Albanian returnees would have to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that scene, senior Western officials concede that
Mitrovica is not Kosovo's only problem, nor even its biggest. The
central issue now, these officials readily concede, is not the
majority Albanians, who suffered through a decade of Serbian rule
before thousands of them died and hundreds of thousands were driven
from home in the Serbian rampage that accompanied NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia last spring. It is the rights and safety of the
remaining Serbs and Gypsies in Kosovo, most of whom already live in
protected enclaves or ghettolike areas surrounded by troops and
wire.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking down the de facto ethnic separation that has been
allowed or even encouraged to develop will be an enormous task. It
is hard enough, officials say, keeping Albanian firebrands and
shadowy, organized armed Albanian groups _ some of them connected
to the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army, the Albanian
guerrilla force that battled Serb domination of Kosovo _ from
succeeding in their efforts to drive the rest of the Serbs and
Gypsies out of Kosovo altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems are also deep within the peacekeeping
structure. Senior U.N. officials and NATO officers say that
Reinhardt, understanding the dangers of effective partition of
Kosovo that the Mitrovica border represents, pushed in November for
a policy that would bring troops of different nationalities to
Mitrovica as part of a tougher stance.
</P>
<P>
   French forces, who control the sector, have a reputation for
favoring Serbs, which French officials reject. Still, like the
Americans in their sector, their patrolling has been too static,
with not enough foot patrols. The French have not been active
enough in looking for arms in either the north or the south. NATO
forces in general, officials say, have been too reluctant to
challenge the Albanian majority by clamping down on Albanian
troublemakers anywhere in Kosovo, let alone in southern Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.N. official said bluntly: ``The unwillingness of the
West and KFOR to read the riot act to the KLA remains a central
problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NATO forces commander cannot tell the
commanders of the various armies what to do. U.S. generals report
to Washington, Germans to Berlin, French to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt not only found the French reluctant to act more
decisively or share the responsibility. He also found that many
countries, including the United States, were reluctant to become
involved in Mitrovica because of the potential danger posed to
their troops.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration on Mitrovica now is pulling troops and the
police, already overstretched, from areas of Kosovo where the crime
rates are considerably higher _ western Kosovo in particular, but
also the intermittently tense U.S. sector in eastern Kosovo. There,
officials talk of a new offshoot of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
supposedly dismantled, that wants to take adjacent land currently
in Serbia that has large Albanian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the European backbones of the NATO forces, the British, are
eager to pull out of Kosovo before too long, as the Canadians are
doing. The British have reduced their troops to fewer than 4,000,
and in general, national armies have been pulling out more troops
than NATO forces had planned, producing hollow units.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable concern about what will happen when even
this command structure is replaced this spring by the Eurocorps,
the defense arm of the European Union, under a Spanish general.
U.S. troops will remain, but the British, citing commitments
elsewhere for their small army, are expected to try to leave in the
next six months and to pull out all their officers of general rank,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the three apartment buildings here, the last Albanian
resident is a 23-year-old who translates for the police. She is
trying to protect her family's apartment and to control her fear.
``I only feel safe at night, when I'm locked inside and the
soldiers are here'' guarding the door, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On another landing, Anka Bascarevic, a Serb, said she moved into
an empty apartment with her husband after being pushed out of
southern Mitrovica by Albanians. ``There is no life here, this
isn't life,'' she said, her voice shaking. ``We have nothing, and
we have nowhere else to go.''

CHINA'S WARNING TO TAIWAN POSES CHALLENGE TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China's abrupt shift to a more aggressive stance on
Taiwan left the Clinton administration scrambling last week for a
response and struggling to temper increased pressure for new sales
of sophisticated arms to Taiwan, congressional and administration
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they were given no hint of the
shift by the Chinese, who made their announcement just days after
one of the highest-ranking U.S. delegations ever to visit China
spent two days in Beijing in talks that focused on urging restraint
over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped that relations with China were on
the road to improvement, but they now appear to be entering an
extraordinarily delicate phase, and a series of approaching events
_ including elections in Taiwan _ threatens to make things
dramatically worse.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chinese policy, announced suddenly in an 11,000-word
paper that had apparently been in preparation for many months, said
in essence that China would not wait indefinitely for Taiwan, which
Beijing considers a renegade province, to reunite with the mainland
and would consider a military attack if negotiations dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   In immediate response, the undersecretary of defense for policy,
Walter Slocombe, made the firmest of warnings to Beijing, saying in
the middle of last week that China would face ``incalculable
consequences'' if it followed through on its stiffer policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the document set off intense debate within the
administration over a further reply throughout the week. On Friday,
a senior Pentagon official said the Chinese statement was
``unfortunate and very, very unhelpful,'' particularly from the
``point of view of arms sales'' to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   There is now ``incalculable pressure to sell more, do more,''
for Taiwan, another administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bolstering support for legislation in the Senate that
seeks to expand military ties between Washington and Taiwan, the
new Chinese stance threatens to help unravel the administration's
effort in Congress to usher China into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation in the Senate, known as the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, is strongly opposed by the White House. But the
administration remains divided over the long-term effects of
China's policy statement, known as a white paper, a senior
administration official said. Some believed that it would
significantly heighten the potential for the use of force in the
Taiwan Strait. Others thought it would end up being a ``blip'' on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as delicate a moment in U.S.-China relations as ever
before, and never have so many factors been involved,'' said Chris
Williams, the senior foreign policy adviser to the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who is a strong supporter of
Taiwan. ``The potential for a significant crisis in the Taiwan
Strait is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the very way the policy shift was announced by
China was taken as a slap by the administration, which has been
working toward what it calls ``constructive strategic partnership''
with China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had sent a deliberately high-powered
delegation to Beijing on Feb. 17 and 18, intended to impress upon
the Chinese the importance of a range of topics, but specifically
restraint on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation consisted of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott; the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Joseph W. Ralston; Slocombe; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
Kurt M. Campbell; and the deputy national security adviser, James
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   The group suffered its first setback when the Chinese did not
include a military official of equivalent rank to Ralston in the
talks, but sent a more junior officer.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting included ``lectures'' on Taiwan from Chinese
officials, administration officials recounted, although the tone
was not significantly different from past discussions of the
subject, which Beijing considers its most vital.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the delegation did not receive any
hint that a major policy change affecting the relationship between
China and the United States was about to be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, members of the U.S. delegation learned of
the change of policy through the news media. ``There was no `by the
way,''' said an official familiar with the Beijing meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said that the record of the
talks had been scoured last week to see if the Chinese had tried to
foreshadow the policy paper in such an oblique way that the
delegation had missed the signal. There was no such signal,
administration officials concluded last week.
</P>
<P>
   The shift came at a particularly fragile moment. Taiwan holds
presidential elections next month, and the warning by Beijing that
it would not wait indefinitely for the island to reunite with the
mainland was clearly intended to warn candidates off further steps
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration is well into its annual review
of arms sales requests from Taiwan and is contemplating a much more
robust sale of weapons than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the weapons the Pentagon is considering selling to Taiwan
are four Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers equipped
with Aegis air defense radars that would help Taiwan toward
creating a missile defense system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said Friday that the destroyers were
``under consideration.'' Two would be built in Mississippi, the
home state of Lott, and two in Maine, the home state of Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has warned Washington that providing the destroyers
could be ``the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' said Rear Adm.
Eric McVadon, retired, who was the U.S. defense and naval attache
in China from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said they will react harshly if we do it,'' he said.
``They have said they will not allow Taiwan to have them, and the
concern is they will destroy it before it became operational. That
then starts a conflict that could bring in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating the atmosphere was the release on Friday of a
human rights report by the State Department that was highly
critical of China, and the intention of the administration to
gather European support to censure Beijing for its human rights
record at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva in April.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said the administration had to consider two
factors when deciding what to sell Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The first, he said, are the ``objective'' conditions, called for
under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, of Taiwan's ability to
defend itself. Second is the ``broader, overall'' context, meaning
the state of relations among China, Taiwan and the United States
and the internal political situations in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing its policy statement a month before the Taiwanese
election on March 18 and in the midst of a presidential primary
campaign in the United States, Beijing is playing with U.S.
domestic politics in a way that will backfire on China, the
official suggested.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Yu Shuning, the counselor,
said that the policy statement was intended to ``let the
international community, including the United States government,
know China's principled issue on Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the policy remained ``peaceful unification with one
country, two systems.'' He added, ``This paper will make the United
States government better understand the settlement of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, both Democrats and Republicans said the document
had heightened broad dissatisfaction with the administration's
China policy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, support of the administration's
legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations had
waned significantly, Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to China's entry to the World Trade Organization, the
measure had already been complicated by Vice President Al Gore's
apparent coolness and by the opposition of the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   But China's policy paper adds another strong obstacle, making it
possible that the measure will fail, even in the face of a
concerted lobbying campaign by the White House, an aide to a
Democratic senator said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, an aide to a Republican
senator said there was growing enthusiasm among Republicans to
bring the legislation to the Senate floor for debate. Such a debate
would encompass the broad range of U.S.-China policy and could take
place as early as this week, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pent-up frustration about the
administration's policy approach to China,'' the aide said.
``Either that gets vented in terms of the World Trade Organization
and permanent normal trade relations or on the Security Enhancement
Act.''

DIALLO CASE HAS PROFOUND IMPACT ON NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT

 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of Amadou Diallo last year became a
defining event for the New York Police Department. The shooting of
the unarmed West African immigrant by four white officers spurred
protests, prompted various examinations of the department's
admittedly aggressive tactics, and attracted so much attention that
police officials blamed the news media for a sudden timidity among
the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a jury in Albany, N.Y., capped a riveting and often
tense trial by finding the four officers not guilty of murder and
several lesser charges. But the shooting and its aftermath continue
to reverberate.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family, dismayed by the verdict, is expected to file
a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the city. The state attorney
general's office is critically examining the department's
``stop-and-frisk'' policy. The officers may still face internal
misconduct charges. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York will review the evidence to determine whether the shooting
violated federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   And the Street Crime Unit _ once a jewel in the Giuliani
administration's law-enforcement efforts and now Exhibit A in
critics' charges that aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics violate
basic rights _ today bears only a trace resemblance to what it was
when four of its members killed Diallo that infamous night in the
Bronx. The days of an elite corps of plainclothes officers roaming
the city to prevent crime and seize guns are over.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the administration has altogether
forsaken the police tactics that helped to lower crime and, it
maintains, lay the foundation for the city's resurgence. As if to
signal that aggressive policing is back, last month the Police
Department began Operation Condor, a crackdown on street-level drug
trafficking that has already cost millions of dollars in overtime
and led to the arrests of thousands of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir shut the Street Crime Unit's
base on Randalls Island four months ago and divided its 350 members
into eight units reporting to regional commanders. Although he
denied that the Diallo shooting had played a role in his decision,
several criminologists said no other conclusion could be reached:
The connection between Diallo and the Street Crime Unit is now
inextricable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totality of the tragedy is such that I think a responsible
official would err on the side of being cautious,'' said Dr. Robert
J. Louden, a former New York police officer and a criminologist at
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. ``If there
is a perception by some people that A, B and C seriously
contributed to this event, maybe we should temporarily change A, B
and C.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Louden said, ``policing is not static.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts suggest that despite the verdict, there are
serious questions still to be answered about how street crime units
should operate.
</P>
<P>
   When four officers from the Street Crime Unit headed for the
Bronx in a maroon Ford in February last year, they belonged to a
squad that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Safir had repeatedly praised,
particularly for its success in seizing illegal guns and restraint
in shooting its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit was already displaying symptoms of dysfunction, its
critics say. It was heavily relying on the stop-and-frisk
technique: the temporary but lawful detention, questioning and
occasional searching of civilians on the street. Although the
method had significantly contributed to the increase in gun
seizures, many blacks and Hispanics argued that they were being
harassed by an abuse of the technique.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's civil rights bureau later
reported that 62.7 percent of all people stopped by the unit were
black, and that for every 16 blacks stopped, one was arrested,
compared with 10 whites stopped for every one arrested. In
defending the unit last year, Safir said that the ``unfortunate
truth is that communities of color are disproportionately
victimized by violent street crime.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other problems. The unit had counted only nine black
officers among its 380-odd members. Members muttered about
maintaining quotas on gun seizures and arrests. And the unit's
veterans were still furious with Safir's decision in 1997 to triple
its numbers, which they said had diluted the intensity of its
specialized training.
</P>
<P>
   The training and experience of the four officers cruising the
Bronx that night would later come into question. In testifying
before the City Council last April, Safir said that at the time of
the shooting, the unit's members had undergone 12.5 days of extra
training that addressed everything from ``search and seizure'' to
``gun disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   But a person involved in mounting the officers' defense said
that the four officers had received virtually no specialized
training beyond what they had learned in the Police Academy. In
addition, three had been in the unit less than four months; the
fourth, Sean Carroll, had been in for a year, a period that
included several months of desk duty.
</P>
<P>
   The officers testified that while they drove down Wheeler Avenue
one night last February, Carroll spotted Diallo acting suspiciously
in front of a building that turned out to be his home. Officer
Kenneth Boss, the driver, shifted the car into reverse, and
Officers Carroll and Edward McMellon stepped out to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea,
quickly unnerved the officers, they said. He did not acknowledge
McMellon's prominently held badge or requests to have a word.
Instead, he turned and darted into the small vestibule, they said,
but he was unable to open the building door. When they demanded
that he stop and show his hands, the officers said, he reached into
his pocket and turned in a manner that led them to believe he was
possibly pulling a gun.
</P>
<P>
   And when Carroll mistook the black wallet in Diallo's hand for a
weapon, he shouted ``Gun!'' and fired. In a few seconds of
confusion, the four officers fired a total of 41 bullets, striking
Diallo 19 times. It was left to the prosecution to suggest that
Diallo might have acted the way he did because he feared the four
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James J. Fyfe, a criminologist at Temple University in
Philadelphia and a former New York City police officer who often
testifies against police departments, this time testified in the
four officers' defense. He said that the defendants had broken no
departmental guidelines and had found themselves making
split-second decisions in what was a police officer's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fyfe said in an interview last week that the
Diallo case raised several questions about the Street Crime Unit
and its tactics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the shooting highlights the need for
better ways for police officers in street clothes to approach the
public. Although they need such clothing for surveillance, he said,
perhaps they could don some identifying garb _ a sweater with the
NYPD logo, for example _ before approaching people they simply want
to question.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the Police Department seems to have
flirted with trouble by tripling the size of the specialized unit.
``They should have a healthy culture, with new members schooled
into the culture and mentored,'' he said. ``But when you increase
it by that magnitude, there's no opportunity for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fyfe said, a team of four officers who have not worked
much with one another is less desirable than a team of two or three
officers who know one another's habits and strengths.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Police Department's most important challenge,
several critics say, is to address the assumptions of white
officers in minority neighborhoods. ``White guys have to understand
this: You get out of a car and approach a black man in a black
neighborhood, do not assume he knows that you're a cop,'' one
former police supervisor said. ``Because it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, a state senator from Harlem, was one of many
black leaders who found the testimony of the officers to be
unbelievable, to be more reminiscent of the old television show
``Adam 12'' than of reality. He also said that their testimony
reflected a preconceived notion that Diallo was armed, and that
they responded to those assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single thing he did was considered antagonistic,''
Paterson said of Diallo. ``The unit certainly did encourage that
type of thinking, if not promote it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Diallo shooting, the Giuliani
administration and the Police Department instituted changes that
some considered to be progressive and others found to be pandering.
They issued palm cards to officers that reminded them to be
respectful to the public; they created a Board of Visitors to
review the department's training and recruitment practices.
</P>
<P>
   At times they were defensive, blaming the news media for a small
rise in homicides and a sudden drop in the number of guns seized.
The anti-police sentiment fomented by coverage of the Diallo
shooting had cowed officers from doing their duty, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir gradually redefined the Street Crime Unit. In March, he
ordered the unit's members to wear uniforms (a decision he later
modified, on the grounds that it had contributed to the plummeting
of gun seizures). He also appointed a black commander and assigned
dozens of black officers to the unit's ranks. And in October, he
decentralized the unit and dispatched its members to various
commands throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Louden of John Jay College said that, the verdicts in the murder
trial notwithstanding, the Police Department would learn from the
Diallo shooting and incorporate change. He said that other
tragedies in the past have led to major reforms, from ending the
practice of firing at moving cars to changing the way that officers
approach the emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NYPD is very self-critical,'' he said, and added, ``When
they see that's not what they want to do anymore, they change it.''

<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. _ The two applications on the card table in
front of Raphael Figueroa were for admission to Wesleyan
University, sifted from 6,849 requests for 715 seats in the Class
of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One 17-year-old was a standout, an Asian-American from
California whose score in the high 1400's on the College Board
exam, out of a possible 1,600, earned her a coveted berth as a
National Merit Semifinalist.
</P>
<P>
   The other, a Dominican from New York City, had struggled, her
score in the 900s on the College Boards and ``D'' in English hardly
representative of the private school she was attending on
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on a folding metal chair on the porch of his home here,
the heat off to keep him awake, Figueroa, an admissions officer,
spent 11 hours contemplating whether either of them _ along with 20
others under review that snowy February day _ merited entrance to
Wesleyan, a liberal arts college that is among the most selective
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season when such hard choices are made _ indeed,
they have never been harder _ and like many in college admissions,
Figueroa's was personal and even idiosyncratic, reflecting not only
shifting views of academic merit but Figueroa's own background.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Californian's SAT scores exceeded the median of those
applying to Wesleyan (1,350), and her race and West Coast origin
were in high demand, Figueroa finally circled the preliminary
recommendation ``deny.'' Among his concerns, he said, was that she
had not selected very challenging courses.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker, despite scores that ranked her among the bottom
of this year's applicants, got a tentative ``admit.'' Figueroa
liked the portrait of a scrapper and born leader that emerged from
her essay and teacher recommendations. But he conceded that he also
saw a grainy reflection of himself _ he is the sixth of seven
children raised by Mexican-born parents in California _ staring
back from her manila folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an academic risk,'' he said. ``It's one I'm willing to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa is an anxious sentry at Wesleyan's front gate these
days, and like those doing similar work at dozens of other
selective colleges and universities, his job is tougher than ever .
</P>
<P>
   By every measure, last year was the most competitive on record
for students seeking admission to the nation's top colleges.
Harvard rejected more than nine of every 10 students who applied.
Columbia spurned suitors at a similar rate. Wesleyan rebuffed seven
out of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by an increase in the number of high school graduates and
a growing perception that top educational credentials create the
best job opportunities in an information-based economy, this
admissions season is already on track to break many of last year's
records _ applications to Harvard and Columbia are up 3 percent;
those to Middlebury are up 6 percent; Wesleyan, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while admissions officers are having a hard enough time
swimming in such deep applicant pools, they are also fighting a
fierce current, one being churned by the rewriting of decades-old
affirmative action policies at state universities in California,
Texas, Florida and Washington, where critics have put deans on
notice that they believe whites have been treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   By the last week of March, when Wesleyan and most other colleges
mail their decisions, Figueroa and his eight colleagues here will
have read enough applications to fill the freshman class 10 times
over.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of those admitted will decide to go elsewhere,
about 1,900 students, or 28 percent, will be invited to take one of
the 715 spots in Wesleyan's freshman class next fall; 4,949 others,
or 72 percent, will not.
</P>
<P>
   AN ART, NOT A SCIENCE
</P>
<P>
   The daunting task of determining who makes the cut and who does
not is anything but scientific.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, 35, and his colleagues will consider an applicant's
grades, class rank and test scores, of course, and an SAT score
below 1,400 would immediately be considered a negative. But it
would hardly be a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the officers will also weigh a student's race,
ethnicity and hometown, as well as course selections, athletic
prowess, alumni connections, artistic skill, musical talent,
writing ability, community service and the quality of the school.
(A student's means to pay Wesleyan's annual tuition, room and board
_ $31,600 _ is not to be considered by the admissions officers.)
</P>
<P>
   The officers will assign the applicant a rating of 1 to 9, with
9 highest, in a half-dozen broad categories like ``intellectual
curiosity'' and ``personal.'' Applicants be warned: letters of
recommendation from members of Congress or Gen. Colin L. Powell;
boxes of fresh-baked cookies sent by priority mail; and essays
about discovering yourself at summer camp have, this year as in
others, provided little added traction.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the officers will often rely as much on their gut
feelings as on numbers, balancing an applicant's chances for
academic excellence at Wesleyan against the broader contribution
the applicant might make to the college community and, ultimately,
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, echoing colleagues at Wesleyan and elsewhere, sees
himself as a social engineer, one charged with making sure that the
Class of 2004 is not only academically sound and ethnically and
racially diverse, but also well-stocked with poets, running backs,
activists, politicians, painters, journalists and cellists. That
philosophy trickles from the very top of the university, from
Douglas J. Bennet, Wesleyan's president since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to hold out that total fairness is the only
objective,'' said Bennet, who graduated from Wesleyan in 1959,
though he wondered if he would be admitted today. ``It's intuitive.
It's a guess, to some degree, about where an individual at 16 or 17
will end up at 18 or 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa's first word in the process will not necessarily be the
last, though it often foreshadows an applicant's fate.
</P>
<P>
   From January to early March, each application will be read by at
least two officers _ the first selected at random, the second
because he or she covers the particular region from which the
student is applying. If the readers concur, the director or dean of
admissions, who will review the recommendations, will probably
endorse them.
</P>
<P>
   But often the officers' verdicts are at odds. And the fate of
hundreds of applicants will be left unresolved until late March,
when the officers will convene for several days of fiery committee
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ROLE OF GATEKEEPERS' PASTS
</P>
<P>
   The Wesleyan admissions officers are encouraged to bring their
own life experiences to the deliberations. For it is their own
diversity, both of race and of interests, that the university hopes
to replicate in Wesleyan's next class.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nine, for example, is a white, former Philadelphia
high school teacher, age 39. Another, who is 25, grew up in Hawaii.
A third, 53, was director of a community halfway house before he
came to Wesleyan more than 20 years ago. A fourth graduated from
Wesleyan last year with a double major in English and
African-American studies.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa grew up in Southern California. His mother's father, a
miner in Mexico, did not attend college but took engineering
courses by mail. Figueroa still keeps his grandfather's worn
correspondence books in his office.
</P>
<P>
   And his grandfather's mantra _ ``I'd give anything to have
worked with my head, and not my hands'' _ served as a prod to
Figueroa's father, who became a lawyer, and his mother, who
obtained a master's in bilingual education. Figueroa and his six
siblings all graduated from college, and most also received
graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a College Board score of 1,400, Figueroa believes his
own application to Stanford University would have been considered
anything but unique, had he not been of Mexican descent. The
experience of attending and graduating from Stanford, as well as
the University of California Los Angeles Law School, has made him a
passionate defender of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are students who have overcome hardship,'' he says.
``And these are students who, the evidence shows, are much more
likely to go back to their communities as leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his gratitude for the gifts of affirmative action, he
said, and his high regard for his mother's work as a college
counselor to Mexican children, that persuaded him to bypass a legal
career for admissions.
</P>
<P>
   PICKING AND CHOOSING
</P>
<P>
   This year's admissions season, at Wesleyan and elsewhere, began
in November, when the officers began considering applicants who
sought early admission, on the promise that they would attend
Wesleyan if accepted. Some 40 percent of the new freshman class was
taken up by those accepted early.
</P>
<P>
   But Figueroa and his colleagues have read the bulk of the
applications, including personal statements, high school
transcripts and references, over the last few months, from 9 a.m.
until 11 at night, six days a week, mostly from home. Of the 22
applications Figueroa read one recent day, he tentatively
recommended admitting nine candidates _ which, he worried, was too
many. Accepting no more than six of every 22, given the size of the
pool, is more of a goal, he suggested. He says he is always telling
himself, ``Read faster, say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the applicants who made strong impressions on Figueroa
that day were a young woman who had competed in the U.S. National
Chemistry Olympiad and a young man who wrote about saving someone's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects were less clear for a young Connecticut man who
devoted his personal statement to the rules of his Italian family _
``If you're wise to your grandmother, it's a slap upside your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the applications of the California merit scholar and
the struggling Dominican from New York that ate up much of
Figueroa's time, nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed that the merit scholar had taken few
advanced placement courses at her top-notch public school and had
several C's.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa recommended denying the woman admission _ but he added
the designation ``plus,'' which meant that if another reader
strongly disagreed with him, the committee should discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican woman from New York was a harder call. Her grades
were worse than the Californian's, as well as several others whom
Figueroa had recommended rejecting that day.
</P>
<P>
   But Figueroa liked that she had gotten herself a scholarship to
private school, that she had taken leadership positions there and
that, like his own parents, she had already exceeded the education
level of her parents. He marked her application ``admit minus''
meaning he wanted it discussed by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish is her first language,'' he said of the New Yorker,
reading to a visitor from her application. ``Her parents didn't go
to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from the Southwest,'' he said, ``I know that one in
four high school dropouts is a Latina female.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Wesleyan _ where this year's freshman class is 9 percent
black and 7 percent Latino _ has no quotas for minorities, the
officers are encouraged to admit as many as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said that such cases often kept him up at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but thinking, `Those kids are out there
somewhere. They don't even realize we're sitting here and agonizing
about them and spending time really worried about their lives and
what's happening to them,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a moment later, his mind drifting to the sheer number of
applicants for so few slots, he added: ``They're going to end up in
good places. They're going to have good lives. I don't have the
ability to bring them all to Wesleyan.''

Governors opens its annual meeting Sunday, topic A will be what to
do about taxing sales on goods sold over the Internet. Most
governors fear that the growth of e-commerce will rob them of the
money to hire cops and firefighers or build roads. At the same
time, governors desperately want to appear friendly to tech
companies so they can attract New Economy jobs. Their dilemma
deepens as sales boom in cyberspace and complaints increase on Main

   TRACKER _ At first glance Dwight McCarter doesn't look like an

socks and black dress shoes. But as soon as he enters the woods,
McCarter, 55, comes to life with his deep voice explaining the
medicinal uses of several plants along our path. Before his
retirement, McCarter spent 25 years with the park service and
estimates that he has been on about 100 searches. ``He's the best
tracker I've ever known,'' says John Houck, chief ranger of the
Smoky Mountain park. He sees things that normal people don't see.
They call it 'cutting sign.' I still can't get it.'' (Harmon,

   LEBANON-HEZBOLLAH _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ How can a guerrilla

part-timers consistently rack up battlefield successes against the
Israeli army? Hezbollah can do it because it is fighting on its own
turf, with grass roots support and cunning adaptability. A military
expert at the National War College in Washington says Hezbollah is
one of the world's best guerrilla armies. Meanwhile, Israel, like
the U.S. in Vietnam, still doesn't seem to have the hang of
guerrilla warfare. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-ELECTION _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Who exactly is the
man considered the favorite in the Russian elections? He has
declared the election is about morals and character, but he is
secretive and close-mouthed about his own history. He won't talk to
the press, so what do school friends, former bosses and neighbors
say about his personality? Where did he used to live and study?
What characteristics have struck such a resounding chord in the
Russian electorate? (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS

   STOCK-TRACKING _ Tracking stocks, whose values are tied to the
performance of designated segments of corporate operations, are
gaining popularity and are now being used or contemplated by
familiar names like General Motors and AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, and
local companies like BellSouth. Trackers give companies a chance to
highlight product lines or services that stand out from the rest of
the company wares, and also create a new currency useful in
acquisitions. But do the stocks serve a real purpose, and what are
investors to make of them? Do they detract from the the older
company shares? We discuss tracker basics, and also provide some
outlook. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

SAY, KIDS, WHAT TIME IS IT? HOWDY DOODY CUSTODY TIME!  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.C., Calif., Mich.)  By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a splashy ceremony at Rockefeller Center earlier
this month, cameras rolled and an adoring throng applauded as a
redheaded, freckle-faced puppet was elevated into the television
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving cast members, writers and producers of ``The Howdy
Doody Show'' _ most in their 80s and scattered around the country _
gathered once more to see a bronze star uncovered for the beloved
cowboy marionette on NBC-TV's ``Walk of Fame,'' beside those of two
flesh-and-blood giants of TV's golden age, Sid Caesar and Milton
Berle.
</P>
<P>
   But Howdy wasn't there. He was locked in a trunk in a bank vault
in New London, Conn., where he has been for the last year, and it
may take a judge's order to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, boys and girls, it's a lawsuit and custody battle over a
puppet. But not just any puppet: the actual Howdy Doody marionette
used on the show, which ran for 2,543 episodes from 1947 to 1960.
In short, the eBay artifact of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has summoned the cast and characters of ``The Howdy
Doody Show,'' people and puppets alike, from the pastures of
television nostalgia and into the land of legalese.
</P>
<P>
   The combatants are the family of the late Rufus Rose, Howdy's
puppeteer for most of the show's run, and the Detroit Institute of
Arts. The museum, which has one of the country's largest puppet
collections, maintains that NBC gave Rose custody of the puppet
with the understanding that he would eventually donate it to the
museum. The family of Rose, who died in 1975, insists that there
was no such deal, and they have a contract with Leland's, the
Manhattan auction house, to sell the puppet and others from the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in federal court in Hartford, Conn., the museum sued
the Rose estate for possession of the marionette, identified in
legal papers as ``Original Howdy,'' to distinguish it from several
copies made as stand-ins but rarely used on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, both sides will submit their cases in writing. The judge
could deliver a decision in weeks, or call a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of this off-screen TV drama have been decidedly
strange. Lawyers have taken testimony from the show's elderly
graduates, now scattered across the country. They even deposed the
last Clarabell the Clown _ Lew Anderson, 77, now a band leader who
lives in Westchester. Court records include desperate letters from
Buffalo Bob Smith, the host of the show, pleading with the Rose
family to let him have Howdy, for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At a reunion of the 53-year-old Howdy with his ``Mom,'' an
86-year-old puppet maker named Velma Dawson, she immediately
identified him as her creation, though she had not held him in half
a century.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   With collectors predicting auction prices in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, the dispute is not likely to be resolved by
Clarabell's squirting Buffalo Bob with seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose knowledge of TV cowboy dolls stuck in storage
begins and ends with ``Toy Story 2,'' a primer may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   From December 1947 to September 1960, in Studio 3-K in the NBC
studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Buffalo Bob would open the show by
asking the Peanut Gallery, a live audience of 40 children, ``Say
kids, what time is it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time,'' they would scream, and then launch
into the show's theme song, set to the ``Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay''
melody. The hourlong afternoon program was first televised at a
time when only 20,000 homes in the country had television sets. It
was the first network weekday children's show, the first to
broadcast more than 1,000 continuous episodes, and, when color came
to television, it was NBC's first show in color.
</P>
<P>
   After the show ended, all the puppets, including Original Howdy,
stayed with Rose. While the 1950s was a whirlwind of shows and
public appearances for Howdy, in the 1960s he went from Doodyville
to Dullsville, tucked away in obscurity along with his marionette
colleagues _ Phineas T. Bluster, Flub-a-Dub and Dilly Dally _ in
the attic of Rose's home in Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1970, Original Howdy was lured out of retirement by
Buffalo Bob Smith, who persuaded Rose to lend him the original
puppet for public appearances at colleges and shopping centers
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith usually preferred to use a stringless replica he could
easily rest on his lap _ often known as Photo Doody _ and Original
Howdy has whiled away most of the last two decades in a glass case
in Smith's home in Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith's death in 1998, Original Howdy was returned to the
Rose family. When the Detroit Institute sued, the family put him
into the bank vault for safekeeping, along with two replicas Rose
made for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Legal ownership of the puppet, however, is not so
straightforward. In 1970, Rose sent Smith a letter with the puppet
confirming it as the ``one and only original Howdy.'' Rose also
pointed out that NBC had ``conveyed ownership'' of the show's
puppets to him with the provisions ``that I not use them in a
commercial manner as the characters from `The Howdy Doody Show' and
that Howdy himself eventually be placed in the care of the Detroit
Institute of Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after Rose died, Smith, claiming financial
hardship, asked both the museum and the Rose family whether he
could keep the puppet. Both said no.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith turned over the puppet in 1998 to Christopher Rose,
one of the puppeteer's sons and the trustee of his parents' estate,
he and Smith agreed in writing to sell the puppet and split the
profits between them.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith died a few months later, before Howdy was sold. The
puppet remained in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's three sons, James, Rufus and Christopher, insist that
their father changed his mind about giving the puppet to the
museum. What could have led the father to change his mind? Perhaps
the likelihood of making a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose collection is as good as it gets,'' said Joshua
Leland Evans, chairman of Leland's auction house, which sold
memorabilia belonging to several of the show's former members for
about $350,000 in 1998. Photo Doody sold for $123,000. ``It's a
monster. It's in the pantheon with Dorothy's red shoes, the piano
from `Casablanca' and Vivien Leigh's Oscar from `Gone With the
Wind.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen stuff like this go for $50,000, and others go for a
million,'' Evans said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already, the search for Howdy's legal guardian has corrected the
widely held misconception that the father created Original Howdy.
In fact, Rose joined the show in 1954, six years after Original
Howdy was made.
</P>
<P>
   The very first Howdy Doody marionette was made by a puppeteer
named Frank Paris. But after a contract dispute several months into
the show, Paris left and took with him his rather crude-looking
puppet, later referred to as ``Ugly Howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantic for a replacement, the show's producers asked Velma
Dawson, a well-known puppetmaker living in Hollywood, to reinvent
Howdy. She modeled the puppet's head in Plasticine, made a mold,
and then cast the head in Plastic Wood. Her finished puppet was a
27-inch-tall boy with prominent ears. He wore jeans, a bandanna and
a checked shirt, and had 48 freckles, one for each state.
</P>
<P>
   It took her two weeks to make, and she was paid $300. After
sending the puppet to New York in 1948, she never saw him again,
until last December. That was when the museum's lawyers arranged
for her to come from her home in Palm Desert, Calif., to verify
Original Howdy. Three puppets were taken out of the vault and
placed on a large boardroom table in an office building in Groton,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, 86, had not seen Howdy in 52 years, but she instantly
recognized it as her creation. ``I'm the real mother of Howdy,''
Dawson said. ``I knew him when he was nobody.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will begin with widespread low clouds and patchy drizzle
in the Northeast from the crest of the Appalachians to the coast.
During the day, winds from the south will begin to mix drier air
from aloft causing clouds to break in most areas although some
clouds will linger near the east slopes of the Appalachians as the
moist winds ascend the sloping terrain. Where the sun breaks
through the clouds, temperatures will surge into the 60s and 70s,
while overcast areas stay mainly in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   A band of showers and some thunderstorms will precede a
slow-moving cold front from the eastern Great Lakes to the interior
Southeast. Locally heavy rain will occur in parts of the Southeast
where high-level winds from the south will cause thunderstorms to
move repeatedly across the same locations. In the wake of the
front, it will be noticeably cooler, but temperatures will still be
several degrees above the seasonal average in the Ohio Valley and
Great Lakes States. Some showers of wet snow area expected near
eastern Lake Superior as colder air arrives on breezes from the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Plains will be bathed in plentiful sunshine as a
ridge of high pressure crosses the region. Increasing winds from
the south will renew unseasonably mild conditions particularly over
central and southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   A tandem of low pressure zones will keep unsettled weather in
much of the West. Coastal rain, mountain snow will be common from
the West Coast to the western slopes of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Night Blindness
</P>
<P>
   Each night from late February until early April meteorologists
are blinded when, for two hours, the satellites that serve North
America lose power. During that time, from the point of view of the
satellites, there is a solar eclipse. The solar-powered satellites
are in geostationary orbit 22,500 miles over the equator. Each year
around the spring and fall equinoxes, the earth passes between the
satellite and the sun. This limited data loss is usually not a
major problem over the land masses, since radar and other weather
observations from ground-based instruments help fill the void.

GANGS PREY ON BOMBAY'S FILMMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ India's hottest new movie star _ a young man
with a smile like Elvis and a body like Hercules _ was doing bicep
curls in a friend's private gym when his mobile phone trilled one
evening late last month. It was his movie producer father,
hysterical with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't move!'' cried Rakesh Roshan, whose frothy, newly
released film, starring his son Hrithik (pronounced Ri-tick), had
become India's biggest hit in over a year. ``I've just gotten
shot!''
</P>
<P>
   Here in India's movie capital, a dream factory both seedy and
glamorous, the men who make movies find themselves caught in a
Catch-22: If their films bomb _ as most do _ they lose their
shirts. In the unlikely event that they produce a blockbuster, they
become targets for underworld extortionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have enough tension, worrying if your movie will
flop,'' said 26-year-old Hrithik Roshan, in his first interview
since the attack on his father. ``But now you have another worry.
What if you have a hit movie and get killed?''
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-nowhere ambush of Rakesh Roshan was eerily similar to
the celluloid shooting of Hrithik in their new movie, ``Say You
Love Me.'' The police suspect it may have been ordered by a
notorious gangster, Abu Salem, who once lived in Bombay but is now
believed to live as a fugitive somewhere in the Middle East and
preys on the movie industry through flunkies here. He generally
makes his threats over untraceable satellite phones.
</P>
<P>
   Roshan survived a bullet that pierced his arm and lodged in his
chest, but the hit job has created what people here in Bollywood
call a ``fear psychosis.'' The underworld's message to the movie
industry came through loud and clear: Pay up or we'll kill you.
</P>
<P>
   The Roshans are now among more than 50 movie people getting
round-the-clock protection from the Bombay police. Plainclothes
officers toting machine guns sit outside stars' opulent homes and
in movie company lobbies festooned with posters of bosomy starlets
and lovers embracing in sunny, flowering fields.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the underworld has deeply penetrated the movie
industry, and some in the industry say the police are in league
with gangsters _ and therein lies a bigger issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not just endemic to film,'' said Fareed Kazmi,
a professor of political science at the University of Allahabad and
author of ``The Politics of India's Conventional Cinema'' (Sage
Publications, 1999). ``This is a societal problem. The underworld
is present in politics, in cinema or in any other field.''
</P>
<P>
   The film industry is a particularly juicy target. People making
piles of money are vulnerable to extortion. And those making flops
can be tempted to take dirty money to dig themselves out of debt
and finance new films.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole lot of shady types trying to whitewash their money are
investing in the industry or trying to extort money from it,''
Kazmi said.
</P>
<P>
   And here in greater Bombay, where a population of more than 14
million lives surrounded by stark extremes of wealth and poverty,
an army of alienated youths make ready recruits for the gangs.
``Millions of youngsters are unemployed,'' said D. Sivanandhan, the
joint commissioner of police for crime. ``Give them 5,000 rupees''
_ about $120 _ ``and they will pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrithik Roshan said his father had described his two assailants
as boys so young and thin that ``if you just blew, they might fly
away.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine a young man further from the slums
than Hrithik. At 26, he still lives at home with his parents (he
has his own car and DVD player), but his movie career, promoted by
his father, has just begun. Overnight, Hrithik has become a
superstar heartthrob who is mobbed by teen-age girls, even on
visits to his father in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the shooting, Hrithik sat down in the family's
plush living room to talk about the trauma. Dressed in a tight
apple green T-shirt that showed off his bulging biceps and
occasionally flashing the crooked smile that makes his fans swoon,
he detailed the series of threats and demands that preceded the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws were not just after cash, he said. These days, the
17 million Indians living abroad, as well as millions of other fans
all over the world, have become one of the most lucrative markets
for Hindi films _ and the criminals demanded overseas film rights
to ``Say You Love Me.'' They called four or five months ago,
claiming to be from the Abu Salem gang, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not in a very good financial situation,'' Hrithik
said. ``My father's previous film had flopped at the box office.
Now he was making a film with newcomers. He had to hype it up,
spend a lot of money. The film was over budget. He didn't have
money and he didn't want to start talking to these people, so he
banged the phone down.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hrithik finished his account, his father, home from the
hospital that day, hobbled into the room, his chest still bandaged,
and offered a somewhat different version.
</P>
<P>
   He said the threatening calls came on his mobile phone eight or
nine months ago, then again two months ago. He, too, said the men
claimed to be from Abu Salem's gang. But Roshan said he hung up, or
passed the phone to a friend _ and never found out what the men
wanted. He is an honest man who wanted nothing to do with
criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take the calls seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the police think Roshan knows more than he is letting on.
They note that he did not ask for their protection until after he
was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless he comes and tells us the truth, we will not solve the
mystery,'' said Sivanandhan, the joint police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the movie people and the police are prickly,
to put it mildly. Police officers are often depicted as buffoons or
crooks in Bollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   In Rakesh Roshan's latest film, ``Kaho Na Pyaar Hai'' in Hindi,
one police officer hammily squeezes his legs together and winds up
urinating on himself, then smiles in comic relief. Two others are
errand boys and hit men for a big-time smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hindi movies are basically rubbish,'' Sivanandhan said
contemptuously. ``Such cheap violence and sex. They portray the
police as clowns.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the police have provided guards for all the movie
people who have asked for them _ and no one under the official
shield has yet been injured, Sivanandhan said, asking that one
thing be made clear: ``If they come to us, we are willing to give
them 100 percent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   S. Chopra, a well-known movie producer whose 28-year-old
director son, Yash, is one of Hrithik's best friends, has been
under guard for months and lives in a barely suppressed state of
terror. ``This is not life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue and white striped button-down shirt and pressed
blue jeans, Chopra, 68, started a conversation with a date that is
seared in his memory: Aug. 12, 1997, when his friend, the music
cassette mogul Gulshan Kumar, was killed by gangsters believed to
have been working for the infamous Salem.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Salem denied any part in the killing in an
interview from Dubai with the magazine India Today. ``No, no,'' he
was quoted as saying. ``We have excellent relations with many
filmwallahs. If we want to kill, we kill. We've done that many
times. But Gulshan was among our good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kumar's killing, the complaints about extortion calmed
down _ and some in the industry say that is because terrorized
movie people paid up.
</P>
<P>
   But the nasty calls have started up in the last six months or
so. Chopra said it is Salem himself who phones. ``You pay income
tax, right?'' Salem tells him calmly. ``This is my tax. If you
don't pay, I'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chopra says he has not given him any money. ``There are a
lot of gangs,'' he said. ``You pay one, there's no end to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manmohan Shetty, whose company, AdLabs Films, processes more
than half the Hindi movies made in Bombay, has been getting the
same calls from Salem. So far, on advice from the police, he has
strung him along without outright refusing to pay. On Dec. 29, a
gunman tried to kill Shetty as he was leaving his office, but the
weapon misfired and the assailant fled.
</P>
<P>
   Shetty's life has become a claustrophobic shuttling from work to
home and back. He has stopped going to parties. He no longer takes
his nightly walk on the beach along the Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In his rundown office, with its water-stained window shades and
grubby walls, a closed circuit black-and-white television gives him
a view of who is in his lobby and who is at the building's
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grim circumstances, a portrait of Groucho Marx gives
a clue to Shetty's ironic style. He described running into a man in
the movie business who was surrounded by four armed guards. The
next time he saw the same man, the guards were gone. ``You don't
need a large intelligence to know what happened,'' Shetty said.
</P>
<P>
   And with a wry grin he said, ``The next time you see me without
security, assume I've paid up.''

WITH AFRICA WATCHING, SENEGAL CASTS VOTES THAT COUNT  
(DW)

<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal _ The presidential election on Sunday in Senegal
has one critical difference that sets it apart from past votes and
that offers a snapshot of the evolution of democracy in sub-Saharan
Africa: no one knows who will win.
</P>
<P>
   The race offers Senegalese the choice among four credible
candidates. President Abdou Diouf, who is seeking a fourth
consecutive term, could become what was once the rarity of rarities
in Africa: a sitting leader who loses power, not in a coup, but
through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   He would not be the first. But because he is the head of the
party that has governed Senegal since independence from France in
1960, his loss would be significant on a continent that has become
increasingly impatient with democracies that offer no real choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of the election in Senegal is extremely important
for all of Africa,'' said Chris Fomunyoh, who follows Africa for
the National Democratic Institute, an American organization that
promotes democracy and monitors elections. ``Given the political
history of Africa, events in one country have had contagious
effects elsewhere. After Ghana gained independence, everyone else
wanted it. Then military coups came into fashion in the 1970s, the
single party state in the 1980s, and the beginning of
democratization in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of people are watching the elections in Senegal,
which are the first competitive elections in Africa in the year
2000, to see what trends might emerge,'' Fomunyoh added.
</P>
<P>
   If the election runs relatively smoothly, it would also lengthen
the list of African countries that have recently undergone change,
more or less peacefully and fairly, through elections _ positive
developments in Africa that have been overshadowed by the chaos
swirling around the war in Congo and the December coup in the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, sub-Saharan Africa's two giants, Nigeria and
South Africa, held elections, and their new presidents have been
pressing for more democracy in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Namibia and Mozambique in southern Africa held
elections that international observers judged free and fair. In
West Africa, Niger and Guinea Bissau _ two countries whose former
leaders had been removed by force _ successfully chose new
presidents in elections that included runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the power of the ballot box asserted itself
unexpectedly in Zimbabwe. Voters there rejected a proposal by
President Robert Mugabe, whose government has been ruining the
economy while plundering the Congo, to seize lands without
compensation and place still more power in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the end of the Cold War brought multiparty
systems across Africa, 32 out of its current 54 heads of states
have been chosen in elections against rivals. A quarter of a
century ago, the figure was only 3. What is more, the pressure
toward democratization has grown inside and outside the continent.
</P>
<P>
   What once left people with mouths agape _ a leader voluntarily
giving up power _ is no longer so surprising. Mali's president,
Alpha Oumar Konare, has said he would not follow the urging of some
of his backers to change the constitution to allow for a third
term, instead pledging to retire in two years.
</P>
<P>
   This December, Ghana is scheduled to have a presidential
election without President Jerry J. Rawlings. A former flight
lieutenant who seized power in 1981, Rawlings said he would also
respect the constitution, which limits presidents to two terms, and
step down.
</P>
<P>
   In French-speaking Africa, recent events are being interpreted
to mean that France will no longer unconditionally support loyal
but corrupt leaders in its former colonies and that it may be
shifting toward demanding more accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, France did not intervene to save Ivory Coast's
president, Henri Konan Bedie, whose party cheated in the 1995
presidential elections and who in recent years arbitrarily changed
the constitution to thwart his main rival.
</P>
<P>
   After mutinous soldiers cast Bedie out of power in December, the
only thing the French government offered him was exile in Paris.
The new ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, has pledged to hold elections,
though he has yet to announce a date.
</P>
<P>
   If the French did not intervene in the Ivory Coast, their most
important economic partner in Africa, Africa experts say it is
unlikely that they would do so to support President Omar Bongo of
Gabon or President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have succeeded in remaining in power for three decades
with French support but are increasingly regarded as
embarrassments. Under pressure, Eyadema, who has led the tiny
country of Togo for 33 years and is Africa's longest-ruling leader,
has agreed to hold legislative elections this year and has
announced that he will not run for re-election in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   These events have intensified the campaign here in Senegal. This
country of nine million, which has never experienced military rule,
has long been considered one of the more politically open in
Africa, especially since its first president, the politician and
poet Leopold Senghor, introduced multiparty politics in 1976 and
resigned voluntarily in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Elections here, which international observers say have become
fairer over the years, have often been followed by violence. The
risks that that would happen again have grown as the opposition
warned that it would automatically consider a first-round victory
by Diouf as proof that the voting was rigged. In recent days,
violence has increased at campaign stops, as well as in Casamance,
the southern region that harbors a separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Diouf, 65, who had served for 11 years as
Senghor's prime minister, said that he wanted to continue
democratizing Senegal by decentralizing power. Should he be
re-elected, he said he would create a constitutional commission to
re-examine the country's balance of powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that democracy is adequately rooted in this
country,'' Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
   But Diouf's critics say that his Socialist Party has cynically
curtailed freedoms inside the party and the country. Like Bedie in
the Ivory Coast, the Socialist Party has amended the Constitution
to suit its needs, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that in the last year, the National Assembly,
which is controlled by the Socialist Party, changed the
Constitution to eliminate term limits for the presidency. Diouf has
defended the change and pledged not to run again in 2007 if he wins
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is democracy?'' Diouf said. ``It's the choice of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Assembly in a majority judged that it was not
natural, if the country has a good president and wants to keep him,
that it should be prevented from keeping him. It is democracy if
the people have the possibility to express an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's main rivals in this election, Djibo Ka,
disagreed. He said he favored a limit of two five-year terms for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country with a fully functioning democracy, where there
is a culture of democracy and credible institutions, there is no
problem with having no term limits,'' Ka said. ``But in a poor
country like this one, where the same party has been in power for
40 years and where power has corrupted its members, it's not a bad
idea to have term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ka, 52, a former foreign minister, left the Socialist Party two
years ago arguing for greater democracy. Another candidate,
Moustapha Niasse, 61, also a former heavyweight in the Socialist
Party, defected for similar reasons. The third, and perhaps
strongest rival to Diouf, is the longtime opposition figure,
Abdoulaye Wade, 74.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Diouf is facing such formidable
competition. Because of Niasse and Ka, political analysts here say
that it is unlikely that Diouf can garner the 50 percent of the
votes necessary to win in the first round. His party has been
losing support with each election, most recently in the 1998
legislative election in which Diou's party won just over 50 percent
of the seats. If the opposition can unite after the first round,
Diouf might lose in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Although the choice of four credible candidates represents
progress, political analysts here say the candidates are simply
interested in acquiring power. None, they say, have focused on
issues during the campaign or presented a particular vision for
Senegal's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition talks of the need to alternate power,'' said
Abdourahmane Camara, director of publication of Walfadjri, an
independent newspaper that is often critical of President Diouf.
``But the opposition has not presented a political alternative in
terms of ideas or ideology. We're hoping that as our democracy
deepens, we will have real political alternatives in the next
election.''

HIGH HURDLES AWAIT MCCAIN IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT RACE FOR GOP
DELEGATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eventually, the quest for presidential nominations
comes down to delegates. Numbers start counting for more than buzz,
bump and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   For Sen. John McCain, eventually is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Through this weekend, including the 12 chosen Saturday in Guam,
the Virgin Islands and American Samoa, 214 of 2,066 delegates to
the Republican national convention have been chosen _ 10 percent of
the total. By March 14, a little more than two weeks from now,
1,374 will have been chosen _ 67 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The four biggest states will choose the four biggest convention
delegations in March, with California and New York voting on March
7, Texas and Florida on March 14. And McCain of Arizona, who has
staged such an astonishing insurgent campaign for the nomination,
faces built-in barricades in each one.
</P>
<P>
   At this crucial moment, McCain will be ceding the home field
edge, and then some, to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his main
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Texas. It alone will elect 124 delegates, 12 percent
of the 1,034 needed for the nomination. A juicy plum, indeed, but
McCain is highly unlikely to make a big effort in Bush's home
state; when Bush tried to embarrass McCain this week in Arizona,
all he got to show for $2 million in television spending was a
24-percentage-point drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is well liked in Texas, even by many Democrats, which
should narrow the only apparent opening for McCain in the state's
election laws, which permit crossover voting of the kind that
helped McCain in New Hampshire and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan might win a delegate or two anyway. Complex
Republican rules in Texas allot 34 delegates to the statewide
victor on a winner-take-all basis, unless no candidate polls 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In that case they are allotted proportionally, but even with
Alan Keyes, the former State Department official, in the race,
political pros in the state expect Bush to get a majority pretty
easily, and hence all the at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain might conceivably hold Bush under 50 percent in
a few of the 30 congressional districts. Each of those gets three
delegates, all allotted to the winner if he gets a majority; if no
one gets a majority and the runner-up exceeds 20 percent, a very
modest threshold, the winner gets two and the runner-up one.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which chooses 80 delegates, is structurally more
difficult for McCain. Only registered Republicans can vote in the
Republican primary, and runners-up get nothing: 11 delegates go to
the statewide winner, three to the winner in each of 23
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb is, of course, the governor of Florida and
will presumably go all-out for him. But the failure of Sen. Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire and Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan to blunt
McCain's drive in their states has raised questions about the clout
of office-holders.
</P>
<P>
   That question also hangs over the head of Gov. George Pataki of
New York, another keen Bush booster, who tried until the very last
minute, with an adverse court judgment looming, to use the state's
arcane election laws to keep McCain off the ballot in as many
districts as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will no doubt try to turn the widespread resentment
engendered by the effort to exclude him to his own advantage in the
fight for New York's 93 elected delegates (eight others are chosen
by the Republican state committee).
</P>
<P>
   Votes are cast in New York directly for delegates, not for
presidential hopefuls, whose names appear in tiny type on the
ballots. Bush's delegate candidates are party wheel horses, by and
large, whose names are at least locally well known, while McCain's
candidates are by and large political neophytes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, New York's primary is a Republicans-only affair.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's Republicans are more moderate than those in any
of the states that have voted so far, particularly on social
issues, and there are large numbers of Roman Catholics among them.
The McCain camp, there as elsewhere, intends to remind those
Catholics of the anti-Catholic statements of leaders of Bob Jones
University, an ultra-conservative evangelical institution in
Greenville, S.C., which Bush visited.
</P>
<P>
   The senator will hope to draw many Republicans to the polls who
have not often participated in primaries, which are not common in
their party in New York. The excitement he has brought to the
campaign has helped to spur big turnouts everywhere _ double the
size of four years ago in both South Carolina and Michigan _ and
hope the newcomers are mostly moderates friendly to him, not
conservatives loyal to Bush, as in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, McCain faces an uphill battle in New York, one he can
win only if sheer voter exuberance batters down the defensive walls
built by Pataki and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar could be said of California, whose huge block
of 162 delegates constitutes more than 15 percent of the total
needed to win the nomination. There, too, only the votes of
registered Republicans will count in allocating Republican
delegates, though there is also a ``beauty contest'' in which all
candidates from all parties are listed on one ballot, and voters of
any party can choose any candidate they like, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   All 156 of the district delegates and all six of the at-large
delegates go to the statewide winner, with nothing allocated for
the loser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been identifying himself as a Ronald Reagan
conservative with increasing frequency since his Michigan victory,
obviously hoping to inherit some of Reagan's undying popularity in
California. His iconoclastic stand on campaign financing and his
image as a maverick ought to play well in the state, and the
endorsement of Bush by state Republican leaders could backfire;
they do not have much credibility left after six years of losses in
major races.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, McCain trails by about 2-to-1 in recent
polls. But at least he should have no trouble capturing the
attention of the electorate, a vital element in any insurgency.
Reporting on a recent survey by the nonpartisan Public Policy
Institute of California, its survey director, Mark Baldassare, said
that ``voters are engaged in a way they haven't been for years.''
If the candidates speak to their concerns, he added, ``they'll find
the voters all ears.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has often rallied from far back, of course, but he has
not previously faced difficulties of the dimensions now confronting
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, McCain is the underdog in each of the four big
states. He almost certainly could not survive losses in all of
them, which would give Bush so many delegates that not even a
highly improbable sweep by McCain in such states as Ohio, Illinois,
Massachusetts, Georgia, Missouri and Colorado, all of which vote by
March 21, could stop the Texan.

150 KILLED AS FOUR NATIONS IN AFRICA ARE HIT BY FLOODS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Several weeks of torrential rains
and floods, made worse when a deadly storm lashed the heel of
Africa last week, have killed more than 150 people and swept away
the homes and livelihoods of more than one million in four
countries, relief agencies and government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest storm, which hit the region beginning Tuesday, has so
far killed more than 60 people and left thousands homeless as
fierce winds downed power lines and swollen rivers swallowed roads,
houses and bridges in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, the rain was still falling Saturday as rescue
helicopters tried to deliver food, tents and blankets and pluck
stranded people from rooftops, trees and farms that had become tiny
snake-infested islands.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's storm was particularly destructive because it
followed several weeks of rains that had already battered the three
countries and Botswana. Doctors and government officials fear the
situation will only further deteriorate in coming days with
increasing outbreaks of cholera, malaria and typhoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is going from bad to worse,'' said Kenny
Mathiva, a spokesman for the local government in the Northern
Province, which borders Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and is
the South African province most severely affected by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-three people were dead by midday yesterday, and it's
still raining,'' said Mathiva, who flew in a military helicopter
Saturday to assess the damage. ``The housing is collapsing. The
main routes are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people affected are some of the poorest of the poor,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the U.S. Defense Department announced that it would
send emergency supplies to South Africa and Mozambique. The
supplies, which will begin arriving on Monday, will include 140
tents, 6,900 blankets, 6,000 water cans and 160 rolls of plastic
sheeting for emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program is delivering food to more than
100,000 people in Mozambique, which has borne the brunt of this
month's flooding. An estimated 300,000 Mozambicans have lost their
homes, farms and cattle to the floods. Earlier last week, the
United Nations and the Mozambican government issued an urgent
appeal for $65 million for relief work in the storm-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are immediate needs for food, shelter and medicine,''
Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations' special adviser for Southern
Africa, said of Mozambique in a radio interview that was broadcast
Saturday. ``But at the same time, the international community has
to pay attention to the tremendous damage to infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique, which turned its back on decades of war to build one
of the world's fastest-growing economies, has nearly 200,000 acres
of farmland under water, 141 schools destroyed and already
short-staffed hospitals and clinics struggling to cope with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health services in the affected areas are overwhelmed by the
number of patients and are working beyond capacity,'' the United
Nations said in its appeal for emergency assistance. ``Drug stocks
are running out, and there is a serious shortage of health
workers.'' Rescue efforts in the region have been hampered by power
outages and flooded roads, which have made it difficult for
government officials and relief workers to reach stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, Mathiva said the towns of Messina, Louis
Trichardt and Thohoyandou were accessible only by helicopter. The
bad weather forced two helicopters, one carrying corn meal,
blankets and tents, to turn back without delivering the desperately
needed supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, government officials told the United Nations that
many people had been marooned by flood waters. Earlier last week, a
bus was swept off a bridge into the Mudzi River, killing all its
passengers. The storm, has killed at least 29 people in Zimbabwe
and exacerbated its fuel shortage as rough seas have kept an oil
tanker from docking in Mozambique's port city, Beira.

POPE VISITS MOUNT SINAI AND ITS RELICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOUNT SINAI, Egypt _ Saying he felt ``great joy and deep
emotion,'' Pope John Paul II prayed Saturday at the spot where
tradition says Moses once stood, and called himself a pilgrim ``in
the footsteps of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was a personal triumph for the 79-year-old pope who had
long dreamed of visiting the Holy Lands. But it was shadowed by
some disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who spoke at St. Catherine's, the monastery at the
foothills of Mount Sinai that is one of the most revered in the
Greek Orthodox Church, had once hoped to gather there Christian,
Muslim and Jewish leaders to symbolize religious reconciliation in
the new millennium. Objections by the Greek Orthodox monks, among
others, dashed that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Poignantly, the pope alluded to his unfulfilled dream.
Describing the wind from Mount Sinai as a sign from God, the pope
said, ``It carries an insistent invitation to dialogue between the
followers of the great monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope spoke to several hundred cheering believers who were
crammed in an olive grove on the monastery grounds. He was seated
underneath a tent beside a pink-budded almond tree, Mount Sinai's
jagged, rusty peaks at his back.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd shouted, ``John Paul II, we love you!'' so often that
the pope at one point replied, ``John Paul II loves you too.'' When
the crowd waved olive branches as he left, the pope waved back with
his cane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prayer service, the pope toured the sixth century
monastery, asking questions about its icons and collection of
illuminated manuscripts _ the world's second largest after the
Vatican's.
</P>
<P>
   When Archbishop Damianos, abbot of the monastery, took him to
the chapel, which tradition says was built on top of the roots of
Moses' burning bush, the pope fell to his knees and prayed alone
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the relics of St. Catherine, a fourth century
Christian martyr, the pope, in an ancient ritual, took a ring,
placed it on the bones of her finger and skull and then kissed the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was the emotional high point of John Paul three-day
trip _ the first papal visit to Egypt ever. The pope, who looked
tired and weak during much of the journey, Saturday delivered his
speech in a clear, forceful voice.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Orthodox monks helped him down the steps to the podium,
but his spokesman said he needed no assistance to kneel at the site
of the burning bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Church does not recognize the authority of
the pope, and its leaders are wary of ecumenical rapprochement.
Damianos embraced the pope as he arrived, but he did not pray with
him. ``It is impossible, it is against our canon law,'' the
archbishop explained later. He said that, for his faith, unity
between Roman Catholics and Orthodox was ``possible, but it would
take a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Theological differences got in the way of the desired ceremony
with Muslims and Jews. Greek Orthodox Christians are wary of
suggesting that all these religions are equal. Damianos also cited
political realities of the Middle East. ``Perhaps such dialogue
could be possible, but not in an Islamic country,'' he said. ``It
is very difficult because of the mentality of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican repeatedly described the pope's visit as a purely
personal pilgrimage, but inevitably political tensions surfaced
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope left Rome, the Vatican signed an agreement with
the Palestine Liberation Organization that guarantees Christian
property and legal rights in a future Palestinian state. It also
declared that any unilateral decision on the status of Jerusalem is
illegal and immoral.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement angered Israel, and while the pope was in Cairo,
Israeli religious leaders said they opposed his plan to hold a
Catholic service on a Saturday in Nazareth when he visits Israel
next month, suggesting that the necessary security arrangements
would violate the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, however, the pope focused intently on the Old
Testament, and savored his solemn private moments in the Sinai
Desert. There were a few distractions. As the pope's Mercedes drove
through the desolate desert canyon toward the monastery, a group of
young pilgrims from his native Poland waited on a rock on the other
side of the canyon, shouting and waving in his direction. The pope
waved at them as he drove by.

<P>
   ABU DIS, West Bank _ The Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, which
U.S. envoys were busy trying to revive last week, is deadlocked
over the fate of this unprepossessing Arab town on the eastern
outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing this dusty hillside suburb to become a monthlong
stumbling block bodes ill for the conclusion of a peace deal by
mid-September, and hints at the skepticism of both Israelis and
Palestinians about finding a way to divide the disputed territory
that is at the heart of the bargain. If they were more confident,
it is doubtful that they would have fought to a bitter draw over a
town that is far from the most intractable issue dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis has become important partly by accident, as each side
waits for Hafez Assad, the Syrian president. Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks were adversely affected by the revival of talks between
the Israelis and Syrians in December. Now that Israeli-Syrian talks
are suspended but still may be resuscitated, the Israelis and the
Palestinians are in something of a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Abu Dis has bought them some time. But it has
also turned Abu Dis, which was supposed to be a symbol of
compromise, into a symbol of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate also illustrates how Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, are both now
reluctant to teach their people to swallow the compromises that
would be inevitable under a final peace plan. And they are both
hesitant to make concessions now that would upset their domestic
critics _ as if they expect it to get easier later, when a final
deal is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike nearby villages, Abu Dis was not annexed by Israel as it
expanded Jerusalem. As a West Bank town, it existed under full
Israeli control from 1967 to 1996, when the Palestinians gained
partial control as one of the steps toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   The 22,000 residents of Abu Dis have a Palestinian governor and
civil administration and see little evidence of an Israeli
presence. But the Israelis retain security control of the town,
which means they have the right to enter for the purpose of
preventing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In an unofficial Israeli-Palestinian plan drafted four years
ago, Abu Dis, with its hillside view of the Mount of Olives and the
Dome of the Rock, was proposed as an alternate capital of the
future Palestinian state. Together with other Palestinian towns
outside Jerusalem, it would be packaged as a kind of alternative to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A fancy office building under construction here is widely
believed to be a potential future home for the Palestinian
parliament-to-be. But Arafat does not publicly accept the idea of
Abu Dis as the Palestinian capital, since that would imply giving
up the fight on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   If such a compromise is on the horizon, Palestinians have not
been prepared for it by their leader, and it would come as a shock.
Even the town's residents say that no one could ever mistake Abu
Dis for the real thing _ Jerusalem _ which is called Al-Quds in
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arafat asked that the Israelis hand over full control of
Abu Dis, and other villages, in the transfer of West Bank land that
was supposed to take place on Jan. 20. As a gesture from the
Israelis and a tangible gain to show his people, he wanted a
populated Arab town as close to disputed Jerusalem as possible. But
Barak refused, and continued to refuse even as his refusal caused a
total breakdown in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the American Middle East peace envoy, was shuttling
last week between Israelis and Palestinians, trying to find a
formula to break the deadlock. Palestinian officials said on Friday
that they would tell him by Sunday where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   But if Abu Dis remains a condition, it will be difficult to end
the stalemate. Barak has made such a public point of his refusal to
concede it that it would be difficult for him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Barak objects to turning over Abu Dis, because he does not want
to decide the fate of the greater Jerusalem area in a piecemeal
fashion, but rather to negotiate it all at once. He also does not
want to relinquish territory adjacent to Jerusalem too soon _ given
the possibility that the negotiations could disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak does not talk much to the Israeli public about his
reasoning. And into this vacuum the right wing has come charging.
They are trying to equate the concession of Abu Dis with the
concession of Jerusalem itself, and to raise concerns about Barak's
rumored willingness to eventually transfer civil administration of
some Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Barak's cabinet have urged him to reconsider
and to transfer Abu Dis or another village near Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control. Abu Dis will eventually be transferred, they
say. Why wait, they ask, if this is so important to Arafat? Some
have said Barak is humiliating the Palestinians and making it
harder for Arafat to back down, and even to accept a promise that
Abu Dis will be delivered in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli experts believe that Arafat, with his
faith in Barak wavering, is now pushing hard to obtain whatever
land he can, especially the areas close to Jerusalem. Then, if
negotiations break down or never resume, he will declare what he
possesses to be a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis gained a special status in the Palestinian world when
Ahmed Qurei, now the speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
returned here from exile in 1994. It was his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, gave the
Palestinians partial control over Abu Dis two years later, some saw
it as a personal gesture to Qurei, who is known as Abu Ala. They
had both negotiated the Oslo interim peace agreement that laid the
groundwork for the final peace now being sought.

CZECH WOMEN TAKE CHISEL TO STONE WALL OF POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ After almost two years of total
exclusion from the government, some Czech women feel the time has
come to break into the old boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   When Prime Minister Milos Zeman formed a cabinet composed
entirely of men in the summer of 1998, women in politics complained
for a while, but still hoped their time would come. But their
frustration has deepened in recent weeks with Zeman's announcement
that he will replace five ministers with another set of men because
``male candidates appear to be better experts than women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was `I'm going to kill this man,''' said
Jana Volfova, a member of Parliament for Zeman's Social Democratic
Party. On second thought, she opted for a different form of
retaliation: She announced that she would form her own shadow
cabinet _ composed entirely of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove that there are enough top-quality female
experts to fill every single government chair,'' she said. ``Of
course they exist, and they are good. Their only problem is a lack
of media exposure. That's the role the shadow cabinet should play _
to make these women visible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Czech government, led by the minority Social Democrats, is
the only all-male cabinet in Central Europe. Although Zeman's party
has a 25 percent quota for women, most of them never rise above
their positions in local government.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of women in top positions runs across the Czech
political spectrum. There are only 39 women among the 281
Parliament members from five parties.
</P>
<P>
   Petra Buzkova, who is vice chairwoman of the House of
Representatives and who says she will soon resign as vice
chairwoman of Zeman's party, has fought a long, frustrating battle
with her boss. She, too, rejects the notion that women lack
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it very mildly, the prime minister did not look for any
female candidates,'' she said in a recent interview. ``That's all I
have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a shadow cabinet received mixed reactions. While
many politicians dismissed it as silly, many women, partisans as
well as independents, have declared an interest in filling the
posts. Volfova said the selection process should take about two
weeks. She plans to inaugurate her shadow government at the
beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good way to push women into the spotlight,'' said
Jirina Siklova, the head of the Association for Equal Status of
Women, a nongovernmental group based in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Czech women aren't assertive enough,'' she said. ``Many of
them don't realize they are being kept in a subordinate position,
so they don't protest. If a prime minister of any Western country
said something like this, it would be a total scandal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Women have been reluctant to enter politics, Siklova said,
because the profession was discredited during the communist era.
Women tried to avoid any public engagements that would require them
to join the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The communist
women's faction, like the rest of the party, was the subject of
jokes, scorn and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Since communism's fall in 1989, women's rise to power has been
slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women are successful in business, but the political
sphere has been traditionally occupied by men, and women find it
hard to get in,'' said Petr Mateju, a representative of the
right-wing opposition Freedom Union Party. ``That social model is
still firmly in place. The whole political and social elite is
strongly male-dominated, and our government is just a logical
outcome of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was quick to add, the shadow cabinet was ``a stupid
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will do women more harm than good,'' he said. ``It will be
interpreted as a joke, while we are dealing with a serious
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Volfova admits that her project was conceived partly with
humor. But she believes it can ultimately propel women into top
political positions. ``Female politicians have long been in the
shadow of their male colleagues,'' she said. ``So why not take
advantage of it and create a shadow government?''

MIAMI BEACH CLUBGOERS CREATING NEW, UNWANTED IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ It is just past 9 o'clock on a Sunday
morning and the Kit Kat lounge in South Beach has closed. A boy and
a girl stand motionless on the sidewalk, clinging like mortared
bricks. Three shirtless boys in black pants mill around them, and a
girl in a white T-shirt gyrates and claps, lost to a beat that
still hammers her head. She is a ``roller,'' high on the drug
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Mari, in a red tube top and a clinging black miniskirt, is 20
but has a fake driver's license that gets her into the clubs here
every weekend night and has for years, she said. ``When I leave
South Beach and see the sun coming out,'' she said, ``I know it's
been a good night.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not use drugs, she said, but she says many kids she
knows do.
</P>
<P>
   Vaulting into celebrity as the backdrop of ``Miami Vice,'' the
hit television series in the 1980s, this oceanside gem of Art Deco
whimsy and former resort of retirees has joined the company of the
nation's most impudent and indulgent trend-setting societies, like
Greenwich Village or Berkeley or Venice, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But South Beach has also inspired precarious excesses,
especially among the young who frequent night clubs and the
after-hours clubs, which first appeared three or four years ago and
open at 4 a.m. ``Eighty percent of the people going to the
after-hours clubs use drugs,'' said Chief Richard Barreto of the
Miami Beach Police.
</P>
<P>
   So cautiously, the authorities have begun to crack down. So far
this year, the police have corralled nearly 400 teen-agers for
curfew violations in the proximity of the clubs, compared with
about 30 a month in the last half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Mayor Neisen O. Kasdin and the city commission
moved the after-hours clubs' closing hour to 9 a.m. from as late as
noon, and prohibited admission to people under 21. Last month, the
commissioners voted to ask the state Legislature to raise the
admission age to 21 for all night clubs. Now they can admit
18-year-olds but not serve them liquor.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has rebuffed Barreto's appeals to shut down the
after-hours clubs. The commissioners reached a ``balanced
decision,'' he said. They took account of the views that the clubs
buttress the economy and burnish the community's image as a
cauldron of creative vigor and its adult culture, as Kasdin put it,
``of beautiful people.''
</P>
<P>
   South Beach stretches along the 17 southernmost blocks of Miami
Beach, and the beach itself faces the Atlantic. With the nation's
prosperity helping to fuel the nonstop creation of new businesses
in modeling, new media, broadcasting and electronic commerce,
Kasdin said, ``South Beach is roaring.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum is such, said Kevin Crowder, the city's development
specialist, that business will need 700,000 square feet of new
office space within three years (about several city blocks) _
110,000 more than it already occupies.
</P>
<P>
   The new business and the relentless growth of tourism have set
off something close to anarchy on weekends along Collins Avenue and
Ocean Drive _ a ``controlled reverie,'' as City Commissioner Luis
R. Garcia Jr. put it. ``The chaos you see,'' Garcia said, ``is
because of different perceived values.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural mix brings together races, diverse sexual
orientations, languages and incomes. The average age of all Miami
Beach plunged to 43 from 65 in the 1980s, with little change in the
total number of people, just under 100,000. Crowder said the
average age probably dropped another three or four years in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fashions whip through South Beach. Against backdrops of
ear-splitting music, shops display clothes that ignore any
practical use. But people do wear them, in the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A trend among young men is a close-cropped, yellow-bronze mat of
hair that glows in the strobe lights of the clubs. This look is
hardest for men with black hair to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine used to be green,'' said Michael Escamilla, 16, newly
blond and with black fingernails, who was lingering with friends on
South Beach's open Lincoln Road Mall. He tackled his dark hair
first with a bleach. Then he applied yellow Manic Panic, a brand of
hair dye. ``The trouble is,'' he said, ``it washes away after about
20 washes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tattooing is flourishing, with a parlor on nearly every block,
and has evolved far beyond the World War II sailor's rite of
passage. Brazilian-born Luiz Segatto said the popular variations
are geometric or Chinese-character bands around the upper arm, all
in black. He charges from $60 for a little tattoo, up to $10,000
for a ``full body suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ruiz, 20, a Cuban-American, stops in. A large red and
yellow sunburst on his upper left arm is inscribed ``Sunshine of my
life. Betty.'' Betty is his mother. Tattooing hurts, he said. ``It
hurts enough so you say you won't get another,'' he said. ``But I'm
here to get another.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pyrotechnic scene inside the clubs, fashion turns
lunatic. At the Bar Room and the Living Room, two prominent night
clubs, and Kit Kat, one of the after-hours clubs, young women
arrive in feather boas, stretch black miniskirts and bulky black
platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   At Level, one of the newest clubs, with 45,000-square-feet of
laser-illuminated dance floors, Fridays is gay men's night. On a
recent Friday, most men had doffed their shirts, and some, in boxer
shorts and boxing gloves, pumped their fists to hip-hop music.
Waiters circulated selling bubble-gum filled lollipops. Dancing
patrons waved neon-green glow sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The glow sticks and lollipops, said Barreto, suggest that the
patrons are buying Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer also known as
Special K, gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, a muscle relaxer, and
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is dehydrating and causes users to grind their teeth, so
lollipops and pacifiers offset the effects, Barreto said, and glow
sticks stimulate the senses. Another device, menthol inhalers,
enhance the effect of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unusual,'' Barreto said, ``to walk into a club and
see some individual zonked out in a trancelike state with one or
two inhalers hanging out of their nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire department, he said, has been rescuing overdosed
patrons at a rate of about three a month.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes have been jarring for both South Beach's image and
its economy. In the early 1990s, Kasdin said, ``beautiful people
came to town, and people wanted to be around them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole night life grew up around this culture of beautiful
people,'' he said. They were affluent people who stoked the economy
with their spending in the shops, hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then the night life began to evolve,'' Kasdin said, ``with
more and more low-rent clubs catering to people who came from
across the bay. A handful of clubs would let them in even if they
were under age.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants complain that the young patrons simply come for the
clubs, especially the after-hours clubs, ignore the stores and are
tarnishing South Beach's glamorous image.
</P>
<P>
   So the mayor and the commission have begun to crack down on the
clubs. In addition to restricting their hours, officials have
limited their operation to weekend and holiday nights and have
barred any new after-hour clubs from opening.
</P>
<P>
   That is an unfair assault on the clubgoers, said Leo Mena, the
owner of Kit Kat. ``There has not been one overdose or death in any
of the after-hours clubs,'' he said. ``It's not entirely true,'' he
said, that some patrons use drugs. He said he throws out any one
with drug paraphernalia. His patrons, he said, ``just want to sweat
and dance.''

COMMENTARY: HEY, BIG SPENDER ...  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Lear jets are parked wing-to-wing at the Austin
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers descended on the governor's mansion this weekend
for an emergency top-secret meeting to go over the books of the
cash-starved Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers, the very wealthy and usually jovial Bush bagmen,
are dyspeptic over the Prodigal Son. They don't understand how
their Boy could have gone through $60 million of the nest egg they
built. It was supposed to buy the White House, not one measly
caucus and one lousy primary. How on earth did Junior hemorrhage
more than a million dollars per delegate? Did he think it was a
trust fund?
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers are worried that they will join John Connally in
the record books. In 1980, he spent $12 million for a single
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   W. is in his room, curled up with his feather pillow and video
golf game.
</P>
<P>
   All the acting he's been doing, trying to seem insouciant while
his campaign is careening, has been exhausting. His finance
chairman, Don Evans, tries to lure him downstairs to charm the
fuming Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   No way is he going. He doesn't have a dang notion where that $60
million got off to. ``Donnie,'' he groans, ``you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, an affable Texas oilman, heads down to face the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are like the oil bidness,'' he tells his mutinous
team. ``You have to drill a lot of dry holes. You don't hit a
gusher every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers look hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Evans tries another tack: ``It's like a prizefighter using a lot
of energy to knock out an opponent in round one or two, so he
doesn't have to fight in round three, four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers look more hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Evans drops the metaphors and calls for the martinis.
</P>
<P>
   The Money Guys and Dollar Dolls are in pain. The record-breaking
kitty they raised for Junior was supposed to last to the convention
and pay to put big dents in Al Gore. Now they are supposed to raise
more to keep W. afloat after New York and California and to trash
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Before they will scare up another red cent, they demand a
reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Evans fishes some receipts out of his pocket:
</P>
<P>
   _ $500,000 to endow the Lee Atwater Chair in Compassionate
Conservatism at Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500,000 for Catholic bishops' hospitality suite in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 million to develop a media strategy on how to attract free
media like McCain.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 million to get creamed in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.2 million for doughnuts with sprinkles to bribe press.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1 million to switch the yard signs from Compassionate
Conservative to Reformer With Results.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1 million to trade balloons for confetti as McCain has.
</P>
<P>
   _ $25 million for ad campaign to create impression W. has the
knowledge and experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   _ $25 million for ad campaign to create the impression that the
spendthrift is a fiscal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   _ $800,000 for private detectives to hunt for McCain bimbo
eruptions and to stake out casinos to catch him shooting craps.
</P>
<P>
   _ $89.99 for foreign-country flash cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ $20,000 for de-smirking.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500,000 donation to 700 Club to get Pat Robertson to record
message knocking McCain.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1 million donation to get him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ $200,000 for little Confederate flags to hand out in Pickens
County.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500 for line of leggy showgirls from Myrtle Beach Crazy Horse
nightclub as a thank-you gift to Strom.
</P>
<P>
   The appalled Pioneers realize that no amount of money can make
up for what a candidate is missing. They are angry that Junior will
not come down to talk about the future terms of his allowance. They
resent that he assumes the Pioneers will bail him out, as previous
business partners did.
</P>
<P>
   Knocking back martinis, they agree to hang in until March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is relieved, but he knows the Pioneer networks of $1,000
check-writers are almost tapped out. He has secretly drawn up a
plan for a new group of fund-raisers: the Wagoneers.
</P>
<P>
   He is also dispatching a testy Bar and a stressed-out Poppy for
double shifts on the free-range rubber chicken circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pioneers try to drown their sorrows, soft moans drift
down from a corner room upstairs.

COMMENTARY: DOW WOW, DOW OW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in his forthcoming book, ``Irrational Exuberance,'' Robert
Shiller _ who has done more than any other economist of his
generation to document the less rational aspects of financial
markets _ describes the full-page advertisement that Merrill Lynch
ran a year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed
10,000. ``Even those with a disciplined long-term approach like
ours have to sit back and say `wow,''' the ad declared. The
accompanying stock market chart bore the caption ``HUMAN
ACHIEVEMENT.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year to date, however, blue-chip investors, battered by
interest rate fears, have experienced more ow than wow. On Friday
the Dow zipped through 10,000 again, this time heading the other
way. Will we soon see another chart, with the caption ``HUMAN
FAILURE''?
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, the Dow is still more than 50 percent higher than it was
in December 1996, when Alan Greenspan tried unsuccessfully to
dampen our exuberance. Other stock indices have not felt the Dow's
pain: the broader S&AMP;P 500 index is still well above its level of a
year ago, while the Nasdaq _ whose heavy weighting of tech stocks
has made it the unofficial bellwether of the ``new economy'' _
keeps setting new records.
</P>
<P>
   But that divergence of fortunes is very much to the point:
although the chatter is all about Greenspan's next move, the
question this market really poses is, Who will own the future?
</P>
<P>
   The very fame of the Dow tends to make us forget that this is
even a question. In Steve Bodow's hilarious 1997 Slate article
``Dow te ching,'' one of the koans reads: ``The Dow does not exist,
yet all things exist within it / OK, only 30 stocks exist within it
/ But it seems like a much bigger deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is common practice to speak loosely of ``the Dow'' when we
really mean ``stock prices in general'' _ I've done it myself _ and
many people compound that looseness by talking as if the Dow stocks
represented a claim on the future earnings of corporate America.
But they don't: If you buy the Dow, you only buy a claim on the
future earnings of the companies currently in the index.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a trivial distinction: to be bullish on the Dow you
must believe not just that American capitalism will prosper, but
that today's corporate giants will share proportionately in that
prosperity _ not just for the next couple of years, but far into
the future. I mean far. To take an extreme example, the calculation
that underlies last year's best seller ``Dow 36,000'' assumes that
the earnings of today's Dow companies will grow as fast as overall
corporate profits forever; and half of what the authors believe to
be fair value comes from projected earnings after the year 2070.
(Actually, even then you don't get 36K _ more like 20 _ but never
mind.)
</P>
<P>
   So do you believe that 70 years from now the Dow companies _ not
the companies that will be in the Dow then, but the companies that
are in it right now _ will capture the same share of corporate
profits that they do today? The investors bidding up the Nasdaq,
not to mention those buying into IPOs, clearly don't. They believe
that whatsit.com has a good chance of being tomorrow's Microsoft,
and correspondingly that today's General Electric _ or even today's
Microsoft _ may be tomorrow's Sears, Roebuck. To be a serious Dow
bull, you must believe that the new economy will belong to old
companies; to justify the price of tech stocks, you must believe
that the future belongs to the upstarts. Both beliefs can't be
right.
</P>
<P>
   Both could, on the other hand, be wrong. Shiller believes that
the whole stock market, not just the Dow, is inflated by a
speculative bubble. I'm sympathetic but not entirely convinced. The
social and psychological hallmarks of a bubble _ like the fact that
the TV in my local greasy pizza place is now tuned to CNBC, not
ESPN _ are plain to see, but so is the spectacular pace of
technological progress. I'm not sure that the current value of the
Nasdaq is justified, but I'm not sure that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the fall in the Dow is not a verdict on the economy
as a whole. As long as we have full employment and low inflation, I
say let the blue chips fall where they may.

BUSH'S LOSS IN MICHIGAN FORCES DEBATE ON OPEN PRIMARIES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. George W. Bush's unexpected loss in Michigan's
primary last Tuesday, despite strong support from virtually all of
the Republican establishment here, has left the state's Republican
leaders divided over what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, who has dominated Michigan's Republican Party
for 17 years, mounted an enormous effort to get out the vote on
Bush's behalf. But his candidate lost to Sen. John McCain's tiny
and relatively disorganized campaign here, which claimed 51 percent
of the vote to Bush's 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans here try to figure out how to make sure such an
embarrassment never happens again, the main split lies in whether
to end the practice of allowing Democrats and independents to vote
in the party's open primary. Exit polls found that 40 to 51 percent
of the voters in the Republican primary were actually crossovers,
compared with about 30 percent in most years. Democrats and
independents favored McCain overwhelmingly while Bush prevailed
among Republicans alone.
</P>
<P>
   Several state senators and one of the state's members of the
Republican National Committee, Chuck Yob, have called publicly for
the party to abandon open primaries unless Democrats resume holding
open primaries on the same day, which might reduce the number of
crossover voters. ``We can't let this happen again, and I'm not
talking about Bush losing, I'm talking about Democrats' voting in
huge numbers,'' Yob said. ``It's not fair that they determine who
we put up against them in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Democrats plan to hold closed caucuses on March 11.
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley pulled their
names off last Tuesday's primary ballot to comply with a Democratic
National Committee rule limiting the use of open primaries to
allocate delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Engler helped ignite support for a closed primary on Tuesday
evening, when he accused McCain of having borrowed Democrats to use
in the open primary. ``We probably ought to conclude that's not a
very good way to hold a primary,'' Engler said then.
</P>
<P>
   But he said at a news conference on Thursday that an open
primary remained the best option, because it could lure
independents and Democrats to the Republican Party. A telephone
poll by The Detroit Free Press, published Thursday, found that 60
percent of the Democrats and 63 percent of the independents who
voted for McCain were very or somewhat certain that they would vote
for him again in November.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, a Republican seeking re-election this
year, wants to keep the primary open to independents and Democrats,
but also wants the party to study whether Michigan should resume
holding its election late in the primary season. Early primaries
should be held in states where only Republicans are allowed to
vote, which might make the contests less bruising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have derived some solace from the fact that
Bush beat McCain here by 2-to-1 among Republicans. Rusty Hills, a
longtime political lieutenant of Engler's, estimated that 300,000
of the 548,000 votes that Bush received were the direct result of
efforts by Engler and his political organization to get out the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what the final result would have been without Engler
going to the mat for him,'' Hills said.

LYNCHING VICTIM IS VINDICATED _ AFTER 94 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ In 1906, the lynching of a young black man
named Ed Johnson was a public spectacle in the heart of this Smoky
Mountain city. Just before he was hanged by the neck to die, he
said to the crowd of white men, women and children who were
watching: ``God bless you all. I am innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, almost 100 years later, in a downtown courtroom
packed with a somber crowd of black and white men, women and
children, and with television news cameras recording every moment,
Johnson was vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Douglas A. Meyers set aside Johnson's conviction of raping
a white woman, saying: ``Something I don't believe the white
community really understands is that, especially at that time, the
object was to bring in a black body, not necessarily the person who
had committed the crime. And I think that's what happened in this
case. There was a rush to find somebody to convict and blame for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's conviction was highly suspect. The all-white jury in
the trial never heard the victim definitively identify her
attacker. In addition, a member of the jury physically threatened
Johnson and was not admonished by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   After the guilty verdict, Johnson was sentenced to death. But
the U.S. Supreme Court agreed at the time to hear an appeal of the
case on the grounds that Johnson's right to a fair trial had been
violated. The court issued a stay of his execution. That ruling,
seen as unwanted federal interference, did not sit well with the
white community in Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   So on the night after the Supreme Court stay of execution, a mob
of white men broke into the jail, took Johnson from his cell,
paraded him through the streets and dragged him to a downtown
bridge that spanned the Tennessee River. With a hangman's noose
dangling from a metal girder above the Walnut Street Bridge, they
hoisted Johnson up by his neck.
</P>
<P>
   As he was swinging in the air, a few men began to riddle
Johnson's body with rounds and rounds of bullets. A stray bullet
severed the rope, and Johnson's body fell onto the bridge. Then one
of the men put the barrel of his gun to Johnson's head and fired
five times.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court responded to the town's defiance of its
authority by holding a criminal trial of Joseph F. Shipp, the
Chattanooga sheriff at the time, along with a number of other local
law-enforcement officers and members of the group who had
participated in the lynching.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first and only time the Supreme Court has held a
criminal trial. The court found the sheriff and some of the other
defendants guilty of contempt of court for violating the court
order that Johnson was to be kept safe, and thereby aiding and
abetting his lynching.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes issued one of the strongest
rebukes of the Chattanooga criminal justice system at the time.
Holmes described Johnson's trial as ``a shameful attempt at
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the judge and jury in the state trial to the lynch
mob, he told reporters, ``This was not merely a case of a defendant
claiming he did not receive a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood,'' Holmes said, ``this was a case of an
innocent man improperly branded a guilty brute and condemned to die
from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the proceedings on Friday, the Chattanooga district attorney,
Bill Cox, who offered no resistance to the motion to clear
Johnson's name, said, ``I have no doubt that the criminal justice
system in place at that time failed Johnson, and failed us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has no known descendants, so a local black minister and
former county commissioner, the Rev. Paul McDaniel, brought the
request to clear Johnson's name before the court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two white lawyers, LeRoy Phillips Jr., with a longtime
Chattanooga practice, and Mark Curriden, a legal affairs reporter
for The Dallas Morning News and former Chattanooga Times editor,
argued Johnson's case in court. The lawyers have written a book
about the case called ``Contempt of Court,'' which has brought the
case into this city's consciousness again and spurred Friday's
court action.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has received additional attention because of an
exhibition of photographs of lynchings that had been on display at
the Roth Horowitz gallery in New York. Curriden pointed out in
Friday's proceedings that Johnson's was just one of the 4,708
lynchings that occurred in this country from 1882 to 1944,
according to an archive at Tuskegee University in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of racial problems still left in this country,''
said Phillips, ``and we have to look at those problems and look at
our history, not through rose-colored glasses, but in a truthful
manner. The truth in this case is brutal, sickening. It is terrible
how we treated black people, and we owe them an apology. But today
we sent a message that we care, that we care about justice, that
racism does not have a place in the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Walnut Street Bridge, a popular and manicured pedestrian
park and walkway, people were out enjoying springlike weather on
Friday afternoon. As Tina Harr, 52, who is white, jogged under the
very beam from which Johnson was hanged, she stopped to talk about
the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bridge is a symbol of a sad part of our history,'' Harr
said. ``And if we can change that history by clearing his name,
then I think we have made a small step, another step, in working
for better racial harmony.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the 2000 presidential campaign began, the
Republican and Democratic primaries that will be held in Washington
state on Tuesday were hardly more than blips on the political
horizon, arcane little contests lying somewhere out on the trail
between the first-in-the nation Iowa caucuses and the
could-end-it-all mass of 13 primaries scheduled for Titanic
Tuesday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But because the early months of the campaign have been so
unexpectedly topsy-turvy, the Washington primaries, with their
quirky rules and oft-quirky voters, suddenly loom large, and the
candidates have been forced to change plans and divert scarce
resources and time to compete.
</P>
<P>
   There is opportunity, and danger, for all candidates in these
contests, but especially for Sen. John McCain of Arizona, still
trying to forge ahead of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on the
Republican side, and for former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
still badly trailing Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no party registration and voters may choose on
primary day to vote in either contest. Both McCain and Bradley have
been going after party switchers and independent voters, McCain
particularly, while their opponents have been concentrating mainly
on the hard-core base within their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Given that an unusually large number of Washington voters, 50
percent or more, claim to be independents (many maintain that
ideology is a private matter), there has often been a lot of voting
flux in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a very tricky state when it comes to politics and
voting,'' said David Brine, the communications director for the
office of the secretary of state, which regulates state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is fixed in stone here,'' Brine said. ``There's a long
tradition of switching around in parties and on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are chasing after independents and party
switchers so hard that they find themselves in competition for some
of the same votes, particularly when they are talking up one of
their favorite issues, government reform. In fact, Bradley has
concluded that Washington not only offers him a big chance to go
after independent voters but also offers what may be his last
chance, with the help of independent votes, to post a victory over
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Such a victory would come in a race that under party rules is
essentially a beauty contest, with no convention delegations to be
won. But Bradley nevertheless is committing huge amounts of time
and money to what amounts to a bet-it-all gamble _ win a contest,
any contest, anywhere, of whatever nature.
</P>
<P>
   The actual choosing of the state's allotment of 75 delegates to
the Democratic National Convention will take place in a March 7
round of caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, comfortably ahead in most recent Washington polls, has
been forced to match the Bradley effort to protect his flank,
something he had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also committing significant resources to the contest
here and, much to Bradley's frustration, seems to be dominating the
chase after independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Gore, is responding in kind with money and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest is part beauty contest, part real primary
and, like the Democratic contest, will be followed by a round of
caucuses on March 7. Twelve of the party's allotment of 37
delegates to the Republican National Convention will be chosen on
Tuesday, the rest on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the Bush-McCain competition too close to call,
just as it was too close to call on the eve of voting in several
earlier contests.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, coming off his surprise victory on Tuesday in
Michigan, a Washington victory would add to the momentum he has
been building as he seeks to overcome Bush's huge earlier lead over
most of the country. This would be especially true if he were to
win both the beauty contest and the 12-delegates contest, though he
and Bush very well might end up splitting those contests because of
the complex rules that govern them.
</P>
<P>
   But if a McCain victory here is to have truly significant
meaning, the senator must not only beat Bush but demonstrate in
beating him that he can pull large numbers of conservative
Republican votes _ the ultimate key to the party's nomination _ not
just the votes of Republican moderates, dissident Democrats and
independents, his victory mix so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been very successful in doing that in other states,
no matter how hard he has tried. But now that he has retooled his
pitch _ ``I am a Reagan Republican,'' became his mantra after
Michigan _ he may have a better shot at it, particularly here in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Republicans tend to be more moderate than Republicans
in many other states, though there are plenty of conservatives
here. Certainly Washington Republicans are likely to be more
receptive to the new McCain pitch than Republicans in Virginia, a
conservative bastion and Bush stronghold that also will hold a
primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a McCain kind of state,'' said Kris Wilder, the
director of the McCain effort here. ``More than in most states, the
Washington state voter has a mind of his own, of her own, just like
John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, needs to regain momentum in Tuesday's
voting. He badly needs a success here to twin with a presumed
victory in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a tough one but we feel good about the
outcome,'' said Mike McKay, a chairman of the Bush effort here.
``We feel we have the support and we're confident we have the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are filling the airwaves with a round of
last-minute television and radio advertisements, mailing out
thousands and thousands of campaign fliers and inundating voters
with telephone calls. The senator flew here for a day of
campaigning just hours after his Michigan triumph and will return
for another visit just a few hours before the polls open. The
governor will visit over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the Democratic contest here could be his last
hurrah, because a loss in Washington would lengthen Gore's string
of victories over him to four in a row. So unlike the other
candidates, who are dipping in and out of the state so that they
can also work the other states in the March 7 primaries, Bradley is
remaining here almost the entire week leading up to Tuesday's vote.
His main pitch: Gore is a conservative whereas he is the true
liberal and Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win this primary or have a very strong showing,'' Mo
Elleithee, Bradley's spokesman, said the other day, ``it will be a
signal to the rest of the country that Bill Bradley is viable and
this thing is not wrapped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, confident momentum on his side, plans to visit the state
briefly over the weekend but otherwise is leaving his campaign
effort here up to surrogates, many of them top labor leaders and
members of the state's Democratic establishment, like Paul Berendt,
the Democratic state chairman. They have kept up a drumbeat of
charges that Bradley is engaging in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking the low road,'' Berendt said, ``and what he's
going to find is that Washington voters are going to punish him for
it.''

MCCAIN ALLIES REMINDED VOTERS OF BUSH SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the past week, the Republican presidential race
was stirred by a telephone campaign in Michigan criticizing Gov.
George W. Bush for speaking at a college whose leaders have
espoused harshly anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for Sen. John McCain, who have acknowledged making the
calls, Saturday said the inspiration for them came from a handful
of political amateurs, and McCain acknowledged that he had
personally approved of the phone bank operation.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the Michigan primary, a group of McCain
volunteers began calling Catholic friends and neighbors, the aides
said, telling them that Bush had given a speech at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the Christian right whose leaders have
called the pope the anti-Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, immediately after Bush had defeated McCain in a
bitter South Carolina primary with the help of Christian Coalition
and antiabortion phone banks, the McCain campaign recognized the
effectiveness of the Michigan phone calls and decided to expand on
the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Aides drafted a telephone script, purchased lists of Catholic
voters and contracted with a telemarketing company that on Monday,
the day before the primary, called between 15,000 and 20,000 Roman
Catholic households in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   While all of McCain's television commercials and print materials
clearly state that they are paid for by the McCain campaign, the
taped telephone messages did not reveal that the McCain campaign
was behind them.. But Bush quickly caught wind of them, and as he
was falling to defeat on primary day, he bitterly accused McCain's
campaign of orchestrating the calls, which he said unfairly implied
that he shares the anti-Catholic views of Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, a McCain spokesman denied that the campaign
had anything to do with the calls, but later in the day a top aide
acknowledged that they had been made by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, responding to frequent questions about them from both
reporters and voters, has tried to use the issue to lump Bush with
the forces of the far right. Though conceding that Bush ``is not a
bigot,'' McCain has repeatedly asked how Bush could have spoken at
the university without repudiating its anti-Catholic teachings or
its ban on interracial dating. Had he been invited to speak at the
university, he told a crowd in Sacramento, ``I'd have told them,
`Get out of the 16th Century and into the 21st Century.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now some of Bush's own supporters, such as New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, are saying the visit to Bob Jones University was
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush has countered by saying the calls reveal
the hypocrisy behind two of McCain's signature pledges _ his
promises to suspend all negative advertising and to always tell the
truth to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, senior strategist for McCain, suggested it was a
matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between 20,000 advocacy phones calls and $8
million in negative TV advertising is the difference between a
grain of sand and the Rock of Gibraltar,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has lately been vigorously denouncing what he says are
McCain's deceptive campaign tactics, and he has said he is a victim
of ``guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running against a man,'' Bush said Friday on a swing
through Virginia, ``who on the one hand says he's going to run a
clean campaign and on the other hand makes phone calls in Michigan
that talk about anti-Catholic bias.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff refused to rule out more such phone calls
in the coming primaries and have even expressed glee that Bush's
criticism of the calls draws more attention to Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they squealed about it, the more an issue it
became,'' McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, borough president of Staten Island, the
co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign, has promised to
highlight Bush's visit to Bob Jones University with the state's
Republican voters, almost half of whom are Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after a rally in San Diego, McCain expressed
irritation when a reporter pressed him on how his campaign's
telephone calls were any different from the telephone calls that
Pat Robertson made, in which Robertson referred indirectly to a
McCain adviser, Warren Rudman, and called him ``a vicious bigot''
because of statements he had made about the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that you don't get the difference,'' McCain said
tartly. ``The calls that Pat Robertson made called Warren Rudman a
bigot. That's entirely different from factual phone calls that
describe exactly what the facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script from the Bush campaign, the McCain calls
stated: ``Gov. George Bush has campaigned against Sen. John McCain
by seeking the support of Southern fundamentalists who have
expressed anti-Catholic views. Bob Jones has made strong
anti-Catholic statements, including calling the pope anti-Christ,
the Catholic Church a satanic cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has stayed silent,'' the script read.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day of the primary, as voters were still going
to the polls, Opinsky denied the campaign had been behind the
calls. Later in the day, other aides said they may have been made
by over-exuberant volunteers. After the polls closed, with McCain's
victory assured, the campaign manager, Rick Davis, acknowledged the
phone calls had been paid for by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, in defense of Bush's appearance, noted that a
string of Republican leaders have given speeches at Bob Jones
University, including Rep. Lindsey Graham, McCain's most prominent
supporter in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey Graham isn't running for president of the United
States,'' McCain said in an interview Friday night on a flight from
California to Ohio.

ELDERLY PAY DEARLY FOR CONGRESSIONAL INACTION ON DRUG COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ When the last health maintenance
organization in this working-class town pulled out two months ago,
it cut a vital lifeline to prescription drugs for hundreds of
retirees like Mary Elizabeth Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 83, has Medicare, but the federal program does not
cover drug costs for people outside the hospital. So Johnson, whose
HMO partly offset the cost of her drugs, must now pay nearly $84 a
month from her $850-a-month Social Security check for medications
to lower her blood pressure and treat a thyroid condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not poor, but I'm not rich,'' Johnson told her
congressman, Rep. Mark A. Foley, who met with two dozen retirees at
a senior center here. ``When the HMO was here, I paid a $10
co-payment for each prescription. That was OK. Now, one day, I
won't be able to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress wrestles with the white-hot political issue of
Medicare drug benefits, Republicans like Foley, a popular
three-term centrist with a strong health care record, are in the
hot seat at home.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed expanding Medicare to give
prescription drug benefits to all of the program's 39 million
beneficiaries. Currently, one-third of Medicare recipients have no
drug coverage, and the remainder often face inadequate coverage or
must make expensive co-payments. The cost of drugs in recent years
has skyrocketed, outstripping the ability of many retirees to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has riveted the attention of voters here in south
Florida, as well as across the country, and it is not hard to see
why. People 65 or older make up nearly one-quarter of Foley's
district, which has the seventh-largest number of retirees of any
congressional district in the country. And while they make up 12
percent of the nation's population, they use one-third of all drugs
prescribed each year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill agree that Medicare recipients need
legislative relief this year, but they have stumbled in their
response to Clinton's initiative, which would cost more than $160
billion over 10 years. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert last month
appointed a task force to draft a House Republican alternative, but
the effort has yet to get off the ground. Republican senators are
also working on their own version.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meantime, sense a political winner and are turning up
the heat on Republicans. House Democrats are using a parliamentary
tactic to try to force a vote on drug coverage for all Medicare
beneficiaries. Democratic candidates in border states are taking
busloads of retirees to Canada and Mexico, where having a
prescription filled costs one-third to one-half of what it costs in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have engaged earlier,'' conceded Foley, a member of
the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over
Medicare. ``But the Democrats, rather than being constructive, are
trying to box us in.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day of meetings with retirees, doctors and health care
providers throughout his district, Foley accused Clinton and his
supporters in Congress of pandering to older voters. At the risk of
being the skunk at the garden party, Foley said he was trying to
inject some badly needed common sense in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a drug benefit for those who desperately need
it and can't afford it, and for those with life-threatening illness
like cancer or diabetes,'' said Foley, 45, who speaks fluently on
complex health issues. ``But I'm upset that we're talking about
creating a new entitlement for the guy who lives in a
million-dollar ocean front condo, drives a Mercedes, and has a
$50,000 membership at the golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to certain limits. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 a year and would rise
gradually to $2,500 in 2008. Beyond that basic benefit, Clinton is
also asking Congress to set aside $35 billion to help protect
Medicare beneficiaries with extremely high drug costs in the years
2006 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's concern struck a chord with many in this disparate
district, whose demographics range from the super rich in Palm
Beach to transplanted New Yorkers at the Century Village retirement
complex in West Palm Beach to citrus growers and cattle ranchers in
the rural western reaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with the Clinton program: It's one size
fits all,'' said Dr. Peter Dayton, an obstetrician in Stuart, Fla.,
who along with several other doctors and nurses met with Foley
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than expanding Medicare, several doctors and health-care
providers said they prefer an approach favored by many Republicans
to use private health plans or block grants to states to provide
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputed that Congress and the White House need to
act quickly. Indeed, doctors poured out heart-rending stories of
uninsured elderly patients who cannot afford the drugs to keep them
alive or manage their pain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas O. Iannotti, a cancer specialist whose thriving
practice is made up of 90 percent Medicare recipients, said the
program covers the cost of drugs given to patients in hospitals or
his office, but not prescriptions they buy on their own. Many
patients do not buy the drugs they need, and end up back in the
hospital, which Iannotti said ``costs a fortune compared to a $15
pill they could have taken. It's wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his terminally ill Medicare patients have given up
treating their cancer altogether and are turning to hospice care,
which will provide pain-killing medication at no cost. ``They'll
die sooner, but at least they will be out of pain,'' Iannotti told
Foley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chris Lundstrom, who operates a 21-person assisted-living center
in Fort Pierce, said his residents were increasingly having to
choose between spending their fixed incomes on food or prescription
drugs. He urged Foley to fight for price controls on drugs, a step
Foley is wary of taking. ``Some are foregoing their meds to pay for
food,'' said Lundstrom. ``We need some controls in the medications.
The prices are outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Even retirees who buy supplemental policies to plug the gap in
their Medicare benefits worry that caps on annual drug spending _
for seniors here, $750 to $1,000 a year _ ultimately mean they will
have to pay more out-of-pocket costs for their medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to pay our share, but we still need some help,''
said Mary Vorees, an 85-year-old former school teacher from
Otisville, N.Y., who retired here and has a $221-a-month
prescription drug bill.
</P>
<P>
   Foley takes in all the comments, nodding, occasionally jotting
himself a note. When the give-and-take starts getting a bit too
heated, he injects a little humor: ``The good news is, you live
longer. The bad news is, you die broke.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the issue is not lost on him. ``Why waste money
on a kidney transplant if you're not going to pay for the
anti-rejection drug?'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed confidence that Congress would set aside
partisanship to pass a remedy. ``Things are achievable,'' he said.
``We're not going to be trapped into saying no.''

RISING TAX BILLS FUEL ANGER IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In a hotel restaurant here, Jordan switched her cell
phone to voice mail, nibbled on a slice of cold salmon, and then
spun a libertarian view of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work strictly on a cash basis, so I don't get bit on the
tax,'' said the 28-year-old college graduate, who prefers to go by
her first name when talking about her ``escort'' work, a business
that is growing rapidly in Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific Coast, marijuana growers have propelled their
illicit exports to the United States into a $1 billion-a-year
business, making it one of British Columbia's top exports. And for
Toronto's button-down professionals, Caribbean tax havens have
become such popular winter vacation spots that Revenue Canada has
increased its international auditors by sixfold, reaching 300 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A tax bite is transforming the Great White North. Long seen by
Americans as law-abiding Dudley Do-Rights, Canadians today
increasingly dodge taxes in ways more commonly associated with
Brazilians, Italians or even Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians are not in the same league as the Italians or
Brazilians,'' said David Giles, a University of Victoria economist,
who estimates that Canada's under-the-table economy now approaches
20 percent of gross domestic product. ``Canadians are clumsy. But
they are blushing less and less. In fact, they are becoming brazen
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more cautious Canadians, who once sniffed that
their unruly neighbor to the south was born of a tax revolt, are
now undergoing a very un-Canadian experience: a tax revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, payroll taxes increased by an average
of 26 percent and the government's total take of personal and
corporate income jumped by almost 40 percent. Here in Quebec, home
to North America's highest income tax rates, 51.7 percent, the tax
bite means that the average resident works for the government until
July 6. Shoppers in Canada also pay a sales tax that averages about
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, when the federal government's new budget is
introduced, the governing Liberal Party promises to offer a modest
tax cut, probably around $32 billion spread over five years. Much
of Canada's tax load, government officials say, comes from paying
interest on debts inherited from past Conservative and Liberal
governments. The Liberals add that taxes pay for benefits _
Canada's health care and inexpensive college education. Finally,
they argue, Canada's tax load is about average for the 29 countries
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at only one aspect of life, maybe you would prefer
living elsewhere. There is nothing forcing you to stay here,''
Prime Minister Jean Chretien told a reporter last year, drawing
political sustenance from public opinion polls that indicated
Canadians cared more about improving health care than about cutting
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But public sentiment appears to be changing. A new national
anti-tax coalition is gaining ground, and leaders of the tax revolt
contend that Canadians do not compare themselves with Swedes and
Finns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look across the border at New Hampshire, where there is
no sales tax, no state income tax and a low federal rate _ and
people become pretty envious,'' said Martin Solberg, tax critic for
the Reform Party, the largest opposition party and a leader of the
new tax-cutting movement. Speaking from his home in Alberta, in the
west, he said: ``When we do 85 percent of your trade with the U.S.,
it is really important that we are competitive with the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Tax Foundation, a Toronto-based research group, has
calculated that during the 1990s, partly because of the tax load,
average disposable income for Canadians declined 12 percent, while
average American disposable income expanded about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '90s will go down in history as the worst decade since the
Great Depression in terms of GDP per capita,'' Joe Martin, chairman
of the National History Society, wrote recently in Canada's leading
history magazine, The Beaver.
</P>
<P>
   Smelling blood, the Reform Party moved out of its western
stronghold in February and started forming a nationwide
conservative political coalition. First, it adopted a radical
central plank: the reduction of top federal income tax rates to 17
percent from 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This new coalition, the Canadian Alliance, is growing on bases
in Ontario and Alberta, two voter-rich provinces already ruled by
tax-cutting conservatives. In Ontario, Mike Harris easily won
re-election last May, after he cut provincial taxes 30 percent
during his first term. In Alberta, Stockwell Day, the provincial
treasurer, plans to carry out by next January Canada's first
provincial flat tax, a top rate of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of this coalition, Canada's finance minister,
Paul Martin, ended a self-imposed silence during the pre-budget
season to criticize the opposition's flat tax idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 17 percent proposal would clearly either put our health
care system or our education system into jeopardy, or it would put
us back into deficit,'' Martin told reporters. ``We're simply not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said: ``We are going to reduce taxes, and we believe that
we must reduce taxes. However, we believe that it must be done in a
fair and balanced way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, news leaks about impending tax cuts reflect a political
recognition that many Canadians want tax cuts. In mid-January, the
Liberal government proposed a government subsidy to keep National
Hockey League teams in Canada. Public anger was so intense that the
proposal was dropped in three days. No sooner had that uproar died
away when the government became tangled in one of the most
embarrassing political crises of its seven-year rule. An audit
showed sloppy or nonexistent accounting for $2.2 billion in ``job
creation'' grants doled out by the government's biggest department,
Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   In moving public opinion, tax cutters have found a powerful new
ally in The National Post, a 16-month-old newspaper edited by
imported British journalists who seem intent on conquering Canada
with Margaret Thatcher's ideology.
</P>
<P>
   In a typically scathing essay, Conrad Black, the
British-Canadian owner of The Post, recently belittled Ottawa's
success in erasing an inherited deficit of $29 billion, writing
that ``70 percent of the progress has just been piggybacking on
American prosperity.'' Black and other critics say that much of
Ottawa's budget balancing has come by cutting health and education
transfer payments to provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of urging Canadians to compare themselves with
Scandinavia, The Post suggests Ireland. Twenty years ago, a Post
columnist noted recently, Ireland had half of Canada's per-capita
income. After embarking on radical tax cuts, Irish per capita
income is now 15 percent higher than Canada's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tax resistance seems to cross the economic spectrum here.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders stress that among the top industrialized
countries, Canada's average corporate income tax, 43 percent, is
only topped by Japan's rate of 48 percent. Canada's maximum capital
gains rate of 37.7 percent is almost double the top American rate
of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Internet entrepreneurs bridle under this country's
system of taxing stock options when they are granted, as against
the American approach of taxing them when they are exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trigger a tax without having the money to pay for it,''
said David B. Perry, a senior research associate at the Canadian
Tax Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For personal income taxes, Canada's top federal rate, 29
percent, affects income over $40,834. By comparison, the 28 percent
tax bracket in the United States affects income over $43,850 for
married couples and the maximum rate of 39.6 percent kicks in at
$288,350. Largely because Canada uncoupled tax rates from inflation
a decade ago, more taxpayers have shifted into higher brackets. And
in contrast to the United States, there is no deduction for
interest paid on home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   High taxes also contribute to Canada's century-old problem of a
brain drain to the United States. With higher salaries and wider
opportunities contributing to the American lure, a poll taken in
December found that about a third of Canadian Internet users
surveyed said they expected a family member to move to the United
States in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   A separate survey of Canadian MBA graduates of the Harvard
Business School found that the portion returning to Canada had
plummeted to 25 percent of the class of 1998 from 58 percent in the
late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians earn less and pay higher taxes for generally
inferior public services than Americans,'' The Globe and Mail, a
newspaper that generally backs the Liberal government, said in a
recent editorial.
</P>
<P>
   With tax evasion increasingly mainstream here, few eyebrows were
raised when Statistics Canada reported in January that spending on
house renovation had dropped by almost 40 percent during the 1990s.
Canadians are not letting their houses fall down. They are cutting
cash deals with contractors.

SCHOOLS SEEK WAYS TO DISPLAY TEN COMMANDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ill., S.D., Colo., Fla., Ga., Miss., Mo., Okla.,
Ky.)  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Trying to make the Ten Commandments part of public
school life in ways that could survive constitutional challenges,
Indiana has passed a bill that permits schools to post the
religious edicts as historical documents, and a number of other
states are pondering similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   Many school boards around the nation, spurred largely by horror
over several highly publicized school shootings, have been
considering posting the commandments as a way to encourage moral
behavior among students.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the posting of the
commandments in public schools two decades ago, lawmakers in many
states believe they can survive legal challenges if the
commandments are posted in a display with other historical
documents, like the Magna Carta and the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Measures to permit the posting of the Ten Commandments in such a
context are pending in Illinois, South Dakota, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma. A Georgia measure
would cut off money to a school that did not post the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When school shootings become part of dinner table
conversation, people stop and say, `Whoa!''' said Janet Parshall, a
spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, a conservative group
that has distributed about 750,000 copies of the Ten Commandments
on book covers for students to use.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that there is no hard evidence that exposure to
the Ten Commandments would inspire students to be good people, she
said, ``It certainly can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have watched the moves with wariness, saying
that the key question is whether schools are trying to impose a
certain religious doctrine in a public setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the message that is being received by students is
religious, then the Constitution has been violated,'' said Steven
Shapiro, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives last year passed the Ten
Commandments Defense Bill, asserting that public schools and
courthouses have a right to post the commandments. The measure has
not come to a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU in Kentucky recently filed a lawsuit against the Harlan
County school district for posting the commandments, and also sued
Pulaski and McCreary Counties, Ky., for posting them in
courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   David Musselman, the superintendent of schools in Harlan County,
defended the posting of the commandments, saying that politicians
had been passing laws for thousands of years, ``and nobody has
really improved on the Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many schools had been posting the commandments for
years, with little notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of schools around here that have had the Ten
Commandments up for 20 or 25 years,'' he said, ``and nobody
bothered about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts have found ways to promote the meaning of
the Ten Commandments without defying the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Scottsburg, Ind., have posted what they call common
precepts, many of which sound a lot like the tablet delivered to
Moses. They excised references to God in the precepts after the
ACLU in Indiana threatened a lawsuit. Instead, each precept is
marked with a photograph of a penny, stamped with the message ``In
God We Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hooker, the superintendent of schools in Scottsburg, said
the code was posted ``to remind our students how a virtuous and
civil school community ought to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana law requires the public schools to teach ``morals
instruction,'' including honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to
the law and respect for the American flag. The state also requires
schools to teach students to save sex for marriage and to avoid
alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no common code anymore,'' Hooker said. ``You look at
what's on TV and it's all about lying and stealing and cheating.
What do kids have to look to?''
</P>
<P>
   But Shapiro said schools should be careful not to ``attempt to
indoctrinate the religious ideas that the Ten Commandments
embody.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since the Supreme Court banned the posting of
the Ten Commandments in public schools, he said, student bodies
have become more diverse. ``We have increasing numbers of students
for whom this is not a sacred text,'' he said.

<P>
   HARSENS ISLAND, Mich. _ In the winter, the frozen river here
creaks and moans as if lost souls were being swept along by the
relentless current underneath the ice. It is this unlikely spot,
where the St. Clair River separates this rural Michigan region from
Canada, that has lately become a passageway for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Those who walk across at night, with Indian guides tapping a
steel pole on the sparkling, groaning ice, are usually relieved to
hit solid land.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent immigrant caught here was a Tunisian man who
walked across one night this month. ``He was telling me he was
scared to death and the ice was cracking around him and he didn't
know if he was going to make it to the other side,'' said Richard
H. Nemitz, the agent in charge of the U.S. Border Patrol station in
nearby Marysville, who questioned the Tunisian. The two Indian
guides tried to reassure him. ``They said it is no problem if you
drink,'' Nemitz said. ``But he was a Muslim, so he didn't want to
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, illegal immigration in this region ``has gone
from nothing or close to nothing detected to 100 people,'' said
Mark W. Osler, assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of
Michigan. ``You'd have to assume the majority of them we don't
catch,'' he said, but just since December, a Detroit grand jury has
indicted 15 people on charges related to smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration is picking up here because of an unusual
cross-cultural criminal alliance. According to federal court papers
filed in Detroit, a ring of Canadian Indians from Walpole Island,
just across the river from here, has linked up with Chinese
smugglers to bring Asian immigrants into this rural region 35 miles
northeast of Detroit. Others cross here, too _ a man from the
Bahamas walked across the ice on Jan. 25, for instance _ but most
of the illegal immigrants caught here are Chinese or Korean.
</P>
<P>
   They come by boat in warmer weather or on foot on the coldest
nights. Others run through a train tunnel that goes under the river
and surfaces in Port Huron, 20 miles up the coast from here.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol has caught 22 people since the beginning of
December, and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in
the Detroit office have caught an additional 20, said Brian G.
Slonac, supervisory special agent in charge of the Detroit
anti-smuggling unit. Since early January, Canadian authorities have
caught 19 Chinese on their way to the United States, including 10
teen-age girls in a van headed for Walpole Island.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the immigrants arrive here, they have neared the end
of what can be a grueling journey. Most are on their way to New
York, by way of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver and then Michigan.
About 80 percent of those caught were Chinese from Fujian province
in southeastern China, across from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Most have bought fake passports and fly into Canada. But some of
those caught told of their wretched journeys by freighter from
China to the coast of British Columbia, according to documents
filed in the December indictment. They were locked in dark ship
compartments so small that there was no room to lie down during the
monthlong journey.
</P>
<P>
   None of the immigrants are now in custody, and the Border Patrol
would not release their names.
</P>
<P>
   Most immigrants agreed to pay smugglers $20,000 to $50,000 to
get from their home countries to New York City. The going price for
river crossings here was $1,000 to $1,500. Most pay for the passage
by pledging to work in low-paying jobs in the United States, Slonac
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many get through. The local border patrol office, with four
officers patrolling roughly 140 miles of the U.S.-Canada coastline,
has been struggling to keep up with the flow. Even if they catch
illegal immigrants, the border patrol office here has no budget to
put them in jail. So they are let go, with orders to appear at a
hearing. Most do not show up.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration office in Detroit typically releases illegal
immigrants on a $5,000 bond and orders them to attend a hearing.
Those who believe they have a good case for political asylum
usually attend the hearings, Slonac said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration experts said that this policy is a peculiarity of
the border area here. In other parts of the country, ``What usually
happens is, they are going to put you in jail if you don't have a
visa, until the immigration people start the process of deporting
you,''said Liga E. Mutia, a lawyer with the Immigration National
Center, a nonprofit organization that provides legal services to
immigrants.

<P>
   Even many of the smugglers who have been caught may end up
getting away. Most of those indicted are Indians from Walpole
Island, a Canadian Indian reservation, and they are not in custody.
The United States could decide to seek their extradition, but that
raises sovereignty issues in Canada, Osler said. The Canadian
government may be reluctant to get involved for fear of sparking
further domestic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent increase in human smuggling through this
area, many more immigrants enter at other border hot spots. Nearly
1.6 million people were caught last fiscal year, with all but
42,000 caught on the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   On this quiet island, where visitors easily draw gossip,
longtime residents said the smuggling is not new. Lou M. Harvey,
47, a lifelong resident who owns the Sans Souci market here, said,
``I don't think that there are any more now today than there were
five years ago.'' Immigrants who have been dropped off on the shore
often make their way to the pay phone outside her convenience
store, calling in vain for a taxi, since there are none on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   But then the river separating the United States from Canada has
been a highway for contraband for more than a century. Rum runners
used it during prohibition to move liquor from Canada through
canals in Detroit neighborhoods into houses with secret tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   And people desperate for freedom have risked their lives walking
across the frozen river in the past _ though in the reverse
direction. Detroit was a terminus on the Underground Railroad, and
slaves escaping to Canada were taken across in boats until the
river froze each winter, and then braved the walk across the ice.

<P>
   COMFORT, Texas _ When the Civil War broke out in 1861, military
authorities in Texas issued an ultimatum to the citizens: take
oaths of allegiance to the Confederacy or suffer the consequences.
A group of nearly 100 immigrant German intellectuals now known as
``freethinkers,'' opposed to slavery and secession, fled south from
here toward the Mexican border to join the Union forces or wait out
the war in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Caught en route by Confederate militiamen, 36 of the
freethinkers were killed in two separate battles, and their remains
were returned to this small farming community for burial. A marker
was erected that read ``Treue der Union'' (``Loyalty to the
Union'') and for more than a century the freethinkers have rested
under the branches of a giant live oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   But recent efforts to build a memorial to them has set off yet
another battle, this one tinged with the very issues that cost them
their lives. In addition to their outspoken support for equal
rights and free speech, many freethinkers were atheists or
agnostics, a fact that some of their descendants in this highly
religious community with six churches find distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   When proponents of the memorial wanted wording on a historical
marker to note that the freethinkers followed no religious dogma
and built no churches, more than 700 people opposed the wording
with a petition headlined ``No Monument to Atheism in Comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Historical Commission, trapped in a cross-fire
over the project, turned to five outside scholars to resolve the
matter, and the revised text they suggested said the freethinkers
``strongly supported secular education and generally did not adhere
to any formal religious doctrines.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, as with the Civil War, the debate over the marker's
wording has divided families here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of discomfort in Comfort over this project right
now,'' said Gregory Krauter, 49, one of the initiators of the
memorial, whose family has lived here for seven generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, a lot of local people had a problem with the word
`dogma,' so we agreed to drop that. But scholars say the fact that
they built no churches is a singular characteristic because most
other communities built churches before they even built schools. So
now we have people trying to change history, and to me, that's
`verboten,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy O. Perkins, Krauter's cousin, opposes the project because
his branch of the freethinkers were Lutherans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of our heritage, but we want that heritage to be
historically correct,'' Perkins said. ``This is just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Manitzas, a 65-year-old lawyer related to the original
settlers by marriage, believes proponents of the memorial are
trying to hijack the history of the freethinkers to serve their own
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of atheism ascribed by the atheist community and the
modern revisionists to those immigrants as `freethinkers' has been
grossly distorted and exaggerated,'' Manitzas said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree on one thing: Whatever role religion may have
had in their lives, the original German immigrants should be
honored. Among their ranks were barons and noted scientists,
musicians and scholars, all of whom entered Texas in the late 1840s
fleeing religious and political repression in Germany. Some of
their settlements became known as ``Latin colonies'' because of
their practice of conducting political and philosophical debates in
Latin, and that legacy of intellectual combativeness lingers today
in Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials originally paid little attention to plans to
erect the monument. Edwin Scharf, a real estate agent and history
buff from nearby Helotes, got approvals from various historical
societies and the Comfort Chamber of Commerce to put up a
13-foot-tall limestone obelisk, and scheduled a dedication ceremony
for affixing a historical plaque.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the dedication, Manitzas and Perkins say, they
learned that the Atheist Community of Austin had contributed $500
for the monolith and planned annual demonstrations at the site to
celebrate freedom from religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just stealing the history of our ancestors for their
own purposes,'' Manitzas said. ``We have Bibles, ship logs,
diaries, all sorts of things that prove some of these people
believed in God.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not have adhered to a specific religion, Manitzas
admitted, ``but to call them all atheists is to completely rewrite
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputes about the wording of the plaque, and now, the 32-ton
monolith itself (described by Manitzas as ``offensive'') have put
the entire project at risk. The local chamber of commerce has
withdrawn its support and asked that the obelisk be removed, which
Scharf said, ``I'll get around to eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   To those residents not directly involved with the conflict, the
subject has become wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Jan Smith, 63, says he believes the whole project should
be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been misrepresented from the beginning and now
everybody in town is bent out of shape about it,'' Smith said.
``They should just call it off.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Smith, who has lived here 38 years, summed up his attitude in a
cantankerous display of irreverence that might even have made the
fiercely iconoclastic freethinkers proud: ``I don't see what we
need a monument for in the first place. Those people were turncoats
and got massacred, which was just what they deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at its first meeting of the new century, the Texas
Historical Commission granted final approval for the new historical
marker's text as suggested by the outside scholars and deleting any
reference to churches. The text was approved by a subcommittee and
recommended by the commission's staff, John Nau, the chairman,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to note that the commission thought
the staff went above and beyond the call of duty by bringing in
outside scholars to make certain that the final text itself was
historically accurate,'' Nau said.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission met in Dallas, the flag flew as always at
half-staff at the current memorial, one of only six sites with
congressional approval to do so perpetually, including Arlington
National Cemetery, the battleship Arizona at Pearl Harbor, and the
Civil War Memorial at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   And directly across the street, at Immanual Lutheran, a sign out
front boldly proclaimed that church's mission: ``Building God's
Kingdom for the 21st Century.''

EDITORIAL   OBSERVER: THE PRECARIOUS NATURE OF LATIN DEMOCRACIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, February 27:
</P>
<P>
   In August 1962, the National Observer newspaper carried a report
from South America with the headline ``Democracy Dies in Peru, but
Few Seem to Mourn Its Passing.''
</P>
<P>
   The story described the indifference of Peruvians to a military
coup that had just installed a junta in power. The young reporter
was Hunter Thompson, who later became famous for a different style
of journalism. As for Peru, much the same article could be
published today.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy swells and recedes in Latin America. In recent
decades, the trend was favorable _ military rulers fell, leaving
Cuba as the only outright dictatorship. But as in the 1960s and
early 1970s, democratic rule is now being nibbled away in several
countries, among them Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The threat today is not from classic military dictatorship, but
more subtle forms of autocracy _ often endorsed by a public angry
at the corruption and ineptitude of its democratic political
system. In Peru, President Alberto Fujimori will stand for a third
term in April. He could do so only after sacking judges who ruled
that a third term was unconstitutional, and he has rigged the
campaign in his favor. In Ecuador last month, soldiers claiming to
represent ordinary citizens against the political elite toppled the
president and installed the vice president. In Venezuela, voters
have granted sweeping powers to President Hugo Chavez, an army
colonel who in 1992 attempted a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   The history of democracy in Latin America is one of advances and
setbacks. In 1960, for example, virtually every nation in South
America had an elected civilian leader. By 1976, all but a few
countries in Central and South America were dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   The climate for democracy in Latin America today is in many ways
the best it has ever been, largely due to the end of the Cold War.
Washington is no longer helping to overthrow elected left-wing
governments. The end of the Cold War has also led to the
abandonment of armed struggle by Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador,
Guatemala and other nations. Peace is good for democracy. In those
two countries, it has allowed civilians to assert greater control
over the military, and peace agreements have helped make shallow
democracies deeper and more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American nations are under political and economic pressure
_ including from one another _ to keep the dictators out. In Chile,
for example, when the nation's civilian leaders have attempted to
prosecute military officers for Pinochet-era offenses, soldiers
have responded with shows of insubordination. But this has not led
Chile's upper class, the military's traditional backer, to call for
a coup, in part because Chile's wealthy fear a reaction from the
country's trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   But the world is not as willing to focus critical attention on
political systems that fall short of outright dictatorship. More
important, voters will grant their leaders autocratic powers when
they do not believe democracy has helped them. Democratic
governments are currently unable to contain a crime wave in several
nations that is persuading some Latin Americans to support
undemocratic measures or strongman rule.
</P>
<P>
   As has often been the case, people in Venezuela, Ecuador and
Peru have turned against the traditional party system because they
see it as protecting the privileged. Globalization has increased
inequality in much of Latin America and made the poor feel more
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Dictatorship is no solution. Alongside their brutality, the
continent's strongmen have brought even more theft and
mismanagement _ which is usually why they have fallen. Although
Gen. Augusto Pinochet gained worldwide praise for his economic
reforms in Chile, he is an exception among Latin dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Once in office, autocratic presidents can use their powers to
grab far more than the usual advantages of incumbency. Peru used to
have relatively clean elections, but few believe that Fujimori's
electoral test in April will be a fair one. He has shut down
virtually all critical television news and effectively controls the
agencies that will oversee the election. Opposition politicians
have been harassed, their campaign events are often sabotaged, and
their paid commercials have been rejected by Lima's television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Elected autocrats like Fujimori deserve scrutiny, just as
outright dictators do. While the Clinton administration has been a
consistent critic of rights violations in Peru, it must speak out
more forcefully on flaws in the upcoming election. The most
important lesson from the past, however, is for Latin America's
democrats. If they cannot control corruption and make government
work for the poor, they risk not only their hold on power but
democracy itself.

THE WOMAN WHO ALIGNED THE NFC 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the phone rang at her desk, she would answer it in her slow
and distinctive voice, ``Mis-ter Ro-zelle's off-ice.''
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, Thelma Elkjer, who died recently at age 77,
was the late Pete Rozelle's executive assistant, but in and outside
the National Football League headquarters, she was much more. Tall
and slender, usually in a dark dress, she was the commissioner's
feared office sentry who screened his calls and his visitors, the
guardian of his time. On weekends she often took the divorced
Rozelle's daughter, Anne Marie, to museums, the opera and ballet.
</P>
<P>
   And in a little known moment Elkjer (pronounced ELK-yer) drew an
envelope out of a glass bowl that set the course of NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered why the Giants are in the Eastern
Division of the National Football Conference with the Cowboys, the
Redskins, the Eagles and the Cardinals, the answer goes back to
when the club owners were merging the NFL and the American Football
League into two conferences for the 1970 season, each with 13
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers, the Colts and the Browns agreed to join the AFL
teams in the American Football Conference, which quickly realigned.
But the NFC owners couldn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each owner,'' Rozelle often said of that realignment meeting,
``wanted his team to be in a division with at least one
warm-weather site or a domed stadium, with teams with large
season-ticket sales and with teams that are pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after several hours of wrangling, the NFC owners
agreed to put five different divisional alignments in five sealed
envelopes into a glass bowl. But who would reach into the glass
bowl and pull out the deciding envelope?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get Thelma,'' the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Elkjer pulled out the envelope with the slip of paper
marked ``Plan 3,'' which had the Giants, the Cowboys, the Redskins,
the Eagles and the Cardinals in the East; the Bears, the Packers,
the Lions and the Vikings in the Central; the 49ers, the Rams, the
Falcons and the Saints in the West _ the NFC's basic structure ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Had she picked any of the other envelopes, the
Giants-Redskins-Eagles axis would have endured in the East, but
some rivalries would never have developed.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the other four alignments, the Cowboys were slotted
either in the Central or West divisions; had Elkjer pulled out any
of the other envelopes the Cowboys would have only occasionally
played the Redskins, who turned out to be their fiercest rival, or
the Giants. In each of the other four alignments, the Vikings were
slotted in the East Division.
</P>
<P>
   That was Elkjer's only public moment, but those in the NFL
office remember other moments. Like the time a small smoky fire
occurred in the office kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma just closed the kitchen, just locked it up,'' recalled
Don Weiss, once the NFL's executive director. ``She kept it closed
for four or five years. We'd ask Pete to tell her to open the
kitchen. `You're her boss,' we'd say and he'd say, `Next week, I'll
tell her next week.' But next week never came. I don't think he
ever told her, but one day she decided to open the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkjer, who never married, had been Rozelle's secretary in Los
Angeles when he was the Rams' general manager, then moved to New
York to work for him when he was elected commissioner in 1960. She
lived in an apartment on East 63rd Street, about 10 blocks from the
NFL office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the NFL people were scared of Thelma, even my
father,'' said Anne Marie Bratton, the late commissioner's
daughter, from her Fort Worth home. ``But she was like a mother to
me. If my father was away on a weekend, I'd go over to her
apartment and she'd take me places or I'd play with all her cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all her cats and occasionally a stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   After Rozelle retired as commissioner in 1989 and settled in
Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., with his wife Carrie, he opened an office
there with Thelma in charge. But when her move (with all her cats)
was delayed by the illness of an elderly dog, she remained in the
NFL office for a while as Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's sentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, I don't think Thelma liked Jim Finks,''
Weiss said, referring to the late general manager of the New
Orleans Saints. ``Whenever Jim called after Pete retired, instead
of putting Jim through to Paul, she would just transfer him to me
and I'd hear Jim say, `I guess that dog's still alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Pete Rozelle's death in 1996, Thelma Elkjer answered
the phone as she had for four decades, slowly saying ``Mis-ter
Ro-zelle's off-ice.''
</P>
<P>
   And when people reminded her that her boss had died, that maybe
she should answer the phone differently now, she would say, ``It's
still his office.''

EDITORIAL: MAKING SUMMER SCHOOL SUCCEED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, February 27:
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, Harold Levy, the interim schools
chancellor, faces the challenge of organizing a summer school
program for an estimated 320,000 students in New York City. Among
his duties are notifying students who need to show up for summer
session, hiring 17,000 teachers, providing transportation and
helping district superintendents develop programs that will allow
the lowest-achieving students to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Whether prepared or not, there is no turning back now. The Board
of Education's policy to end social promotion in grades 3 to 12
means that all students with very low test scores will have to
attend summer school and pass an exam at the end of the summer in
order to enter the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Levy clearly will have to improve on last summer's dismal
experience. Last year, in the first phase of ending social
promotion, only 35,000 third, sixth and eighth graders were
required to attend summer school (about 190,000 students attended
summer school voluntarily). Yet of the mandatory attendance group,
14,000 students did not show up. About 21,000 students in just
those three grades had to repeat a grade because they missed summer
session, or missed or failed the exam.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the mandatory attendance number will be many times
higher. If the summer school programs are ineffective, tens of
thousands of failing students will return to the same classrooms
that failed to educate them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, district superintendents and central
administrators will be putting together educational plans for the
summer sessions. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pushed to have 20
percent of the summer programs run by private educational firms.
The school board has put out requests for private sector
involvement, but there may not be that level of interest in the
private sector. Even with private management, it will still be up
to the school board to recruit qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Finding 17,000 teachers for summer school, up from 11,000 last
year, will be hard. Making sure that they are experienced,
certified teachers will be even more of a challenge. Drawing more
qualified teachers may mean offering incentives, including perhaps
higher pay. Another potential problem is a lack of adequate summer
school busing, which would lower student attendance. Both needs
require more money than is now in the mayor's proposed budget,
which provides $160 million for summer school instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Additional state funds may be available eventually. But
``eventually'' will not be soon enough, since the schools must make
crucial recruitment and transportation decisions in the coming
weeks. The mayor and the school board therefore need to resolve
these issues quickly so that the huge summer school project can
proceed on a sound footing.

EDITORIAL: ON TO WASHINGTON STATE   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, February 27:
</P>
<P>
   Now that the presidential race is reaching full throttle, each
new election barrels down on the candidates before they can even
catch their breath from the one just past. The three states voting
Tuesday _ Washington, Virginia and North Dakota _ pose the toughest
challenges for former Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since New Hampshire, they will now be
scrambling with each other for crossover votes from all parties.
But since Bradley has not won a primary yet, he is fighting hardest
to hang on. Washington is the place he has chosen for a showdown
with Vice President Al Gore. With the state's prosperous
high-tech-oriented voters likely to be receptive to his appeal,
Bradley needs to do well, or risk falling back even further.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is known as a place for free-thinking independents
with a soft spot for thoughtful interlopers. To appeal to them,
Bradley is taking a major risk of campaigning there for five days,
a step that will invite political pundits and professionals to
question the viability of his candidacy if he fails to produce a
big turnout.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six weeks, Bradley has had the misfortune of seeing
McCain usurp what he hoped would be his role as outsider and
reformer. Now in Washington, his main problem is that McCain could
pull away the independents and crossover Democrats that Bradley
needs to offset Gore's strength among core Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the Washington vote is strictly a
``beauty contest,'' with actual delegates to be selected later. But
it is still of vital importance to the former senator, and in
response, Vice President Gore has stepped up his own campaigning in
the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for his part, is looking for real-Republican credentials
in the West. He has put up a new television ad in Washington and
several other states invoking Ronald Reagan's name. With its
Western setting and references to the former president, the ad is
designed to build McCain up for the important California primary on
March 7. On that date, he also faces Gov. George W. Bush in 11
other primary states, including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is considered the favorite in North Dakota and Virginia
because he is once again counting on the local Republican
establishment. But Virginia, which combines an open primary and
very conservative regular Republicans, could offer some surprises.
McCain is trying hard at the last minute to convince traditional
Republicans that he has a better chance of winning in November than
Bush. A Bush defeat _ or even a narrower-than-expected win _ could
harm the Texan among GOP elders already grumbling about his
tactical blunders and underwhelming vote totals. A weak Bush
showing would also suggest that even establishment Republicans are
disenchanted by his sudden transmutation from compassionate
conservative to expedient right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to advance an argument for the symbolic or numerical
importance of the caucus in North Dakota on Tuesday. The state's
Republicans will pick 19 of the 1,034 delegates needed for the
nomination. The selection process has long been wired for Bush. But
even out in the plains, the excitement of this year's race is being
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Curly Haugland, the state Republican chairman, told a reporter
with some degree of incredulity, ``We could have somewhat of an
impact, much more than we maybe thought earlier.'' It has been that
kind of year. Everyone wants a part of the action, and everyone is
having a great time _ except, perhaps, for the candidates who face
harrowing tests every time a Tuesday rolls around. &QL;

FOOTBALL COLUMN: BRUCE SMITH KNOWS THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day last week Bruce Smith sat in his new office in Norfolk,
Va., signing payroll checks. Smith has a new team. Actually, he has
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Nighthawks of the Arena Football League II _ not to
be confused with the original Arena Football League, which
suspended its 2000 season on Friday _ make their debut in early
April. Smith, along with his partner Kenny Easley, a former Seattle
Seahawks safety, own the Nighthawks. Smith's debut as a Washington
Redskins defensive end will come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we fought and struck for as players a few years ago _
free agency _ we never realized would haunt us in this fashion,''
said Smith, the sack leader among all active National Football
League players, who gained all 173.5 of those sacks in 15 seasons
with the Buffalo Bills. ``In some ways, this situation has left a
bad taste in my mouth. I am not mad and bitter, but when you have
built a home and long-term relationships and then your time is cut
short in a place because of salary-cap issues, it is unfortunate.
This situation is doing some bad things around the league with guys
like myself and Dan Marino and Deion Sanders. I still look back in
disbelief. Buffalo was a place imbedded in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But free agency and salary-cap-minded moves continue to roll
forward and create drastic change in today's NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway is out of Seattle and in Dallas. Jeff Blake left
Cincinnati for New Orleans. Hardy Nickerson, no longer in Tampa
Bay, is in Jacksonville. Shannon Sharpe fled Denver for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Do fans really care? Of course they do. Do players want to move?
Many do.
</P>
<P>
   When free agency was introduced to the NFL as part of the
collective-bargaining agreement with players for the 1993 season,
two vital questions were pondered.
</P>
<P>
   Would players move to smaller markets like Green Bay and
Cincinnati or would all players want to jump to larger cities like
New York and Miami? ``We've seen the answer to that one,'' Smith
said. ``A large market is anywhere Super Bowls and the George
Washingtons make their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question: Since free agency was instituted with a salary
cap for each team attached, would players in the twilight of their
careers be cut so that teams could spend less on younger players
and make their annual cap fit more amenable?
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo answered that question in the most astonishing statement
in the six-year history of free agency. It released Smith, running
back Thurman Thomas and receiver Andre Reed _ the remnants of its
four 1990's Super Bowl teams _ because, it said, of cap reasons. A
major identity of the Bills, in many ways their soul, vanished in
one swipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the opportunity to play in front of our fans one
more time knowing that it was my last time,'' Smith said. ``After
15 years in one place, the fans deserved better. I never got a
chance to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days before the Bills had to be under the cap, they
asked me to take a pay cut for this season from $4.68 million to
$2.2 million. A lot of times players are asked to restructure their
deals, but this was a pure and simple cut. We were $11 million over
the cap a year ago so they knew this situation would come to a head
when it was time to get it down. Maybe if they had talked to me a
year ago I could have warmed up to the idea; I would have given it
some thought. But, doing it that way, it took me all of a second to
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning he was released _ Feb. 11 _ Smith and his agent,
Leigh Steinberg, said that 11 other teams were interested. Later
that night, Smith signed a five-year, $24 million contract with
Washington that included a $4.25 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was searching for a team that had a chance to win it all,''
Smith said. ``I wanted to play on grass. I wanted to play closer to
my hometown, Virginia Beach. I wanted to be a missing piece, and
the Redskins were second in offense and 30th in defense last year.
The Redskins had everything I was looking for even though other
teams offered more money. This turned out to be a blessing in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a combination of a lot of things going on in
Buffalo. It was poor planning. It was a perfect time for them to
install the new age they wanted to get in there, anyway. That is
fine and so be it. I'm a grown man able to handle being told the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agency and the salary cap ruin opportunities. They create
new ones. It is a push and pull, a shove and tug. The key in this
system for NFL teams is not just whom they lose, but whom they
gain. Making it work means finding answers and replacements,
whether old or new. The key in this system for players is embracing
new opportunities whether with old teams or with new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Smith plans to make it work in Washington, where he is expected
to be used on early and late downs, stopping the run and chasing
the quarterback. He turns 37 on June 18. Will the knees last? Will
the power persist? He has played 237 games and 11 Pro Bowls. He is
6 feet 4 inches and weighs 273 pounds. Still massive, still
impressive, still churning for more greatness, say the Redskins. He
and his wife, Carmen, have already bought a new home in Washington.
They are selling their Buffalo home. Sunday is special _ their son,
Alston, turns 6.
</P>
<P>
   Things happen for a reason, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years ago the doctors told me my father could die any
day,'' Smith said. ``He is 78 now and from the neck up is as sharp
as any politician. I went to visit Derrick Thomas when he was in
the hospital, and when I walked into the room it was chilling. I
started to cry. I walked over and sat in a chair and he saw me
emotional. He started joking. And you know what he told me? `Things
happen for a reason, Bruce.' His death shook me. At his funeral and
since then, when I think about my changes, I've thought about what
he said. All things do happen for a reason.''

O'NEILL AND BROSIUS: COMING TO TERMS WITH THE SILENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., Fla.)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Maury Brosius lived just a couple of minutes from
his son's family in the hamlet of McMinnville, Ore., and it was
habit to include him in the smallest snippets of life. If one of
Scott Brosius' young children said something funny, well, you
picked up the phone and called Dad. If you went somewhere, you
called Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius has felt a need to reach for the phone in recent
months, and then he would realize, again, that his father was not
there to be called, and grief would pass through him.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius and Paul O'Neill, whose fathers died last year in the
last days of the Yankees' season, are not sure if the grieving ever
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was harder for me because I've never gone through anything
like that,'' O'Neill said. ``I really never knew my grandparents,
so this was the first death of anyone that I really loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Their fathers were sick throughout last season. Maury Brosius
had a prolonged battle with cancer. Charles O'Neill was ailing with
heart trouble. There were several times when each man took a turn
for the worse, and their sons were left to stand on a baseball
field and play a game and wonder if they would ever speak to their
fathers again.
</P>
<P>
   Neither O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, nor Brosius, the
third baseman, played up to their usual standards last year, and
Manager Joe Torre is certain that their concern and grief over
their fathers weighed on them heavily as they tried to do their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius mostly went about his business as if he were OK, Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to be lighthearted; he made jokes, like always,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually Brosius asked to leave the team on several
occasions, and missed perhaps 12 to 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill tends to internalize, his manager said, and as the
player struggled _ with his feelings and subsequently, his batting
average _ he tried harder and harder, sometimes to his professional
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of spring training, after O'Neill's father had become
ill, doctors told Torre he had prostate cancer and he called
O'Neill in to tell him. O'Neill, overwhelmed, asked, ``Where does
all this come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Maury Brosius died in September, and the night before the final
game of the World Series, Charles O'Neill died.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves' Keith Lockhart popped to left field for the
final out, and Paul O'Neill was overcome by his emotion as he
hugged teammates and raced off the field, covering his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius followed shortly thereafter, his own emotions jumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're proud and you're excited about what we accomplished,''
Brosius said. ``Then you look over at Paul and you're hit right
square in the face again, as if I needed it, that this isn't the
most important thing in your life. By the time I got in the
clubhouse I was pretty numb. I didn't know what to feel: happy,
sad, both.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, their teammate, had arranged for a restaurant in
White Plains to stay open, and he and O'Neill and Brosius and their
families went to dinner well after midnight. Brosius was glad that
O'Neill had family around.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius felt relief that the season was over, and that he could
go back to his family, go back to Oregon, to ``decompress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to slow down,'' he said, ``try to come to
terms with everything that's happened and everything I still had to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised by how exhausted he was. Brosius, the oldest of
three children, was the executor of his father's estate, and there
were details to tend to. But mostly, he and his wife, Jennifer
Brosius, worked on projects around the house. Thoughts of his
father came in waves, one of his senses triggering a memory.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius felt fortunate because as his father's health
ebbed, Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman gave him permission
to leave the team for a week, and he and his father had spent those
days together in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't replace that time I had with him,'' Brosius
said. ``I could certainly make the case for looking at last year
and having some sort of bitterness about the game, keeping me away
from home at a time like that. But because they allowed me to go
back, look at last year with no regrets. I felt I maximized my time
with him as much as I could, and did the things I felt I needed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never trade the time I had with him. But you always
want more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius' children _ 8-year-old Allison, 6-year-old Megan
and David, who is 3 _ called their grandfather the Boogie Man,
because Maury Brosius liked to sneak up on them. He would sit in
the brown recliner in his son's house and play with his
grandchildren. The recliner was empty at the holidays last year,
the house seemed empty, and there was a silence, Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move on,'' he said, ``and you have a good time, but you
just know that there's a piece missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to get yourself through it, but at the same
time, you're trying to get your kids through it. You're trying to
help them understand, while you're trying to understand yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said: ``You just try to live the life that he taught
you. He had six children, their children. His deposit on the world
is still here, is the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and his siblings have tried to keep in touch a little
more, he said, and spent more time talking with his mother,
Virginia. She came to Florida for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill arrived in camp last week, typically in great shape,
typically fretting about his swing, eager to hit. Brosius arrived,
too, looking forward to a new season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a point of being as fresh as I could in the off-season,
to come back with a clear mind,'' he said, ``to just come back and
play baseball again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brosius family moved the brown recliner into the bedroom of
David, and on those nights he wakes up, Jennifer Brosius is using
the Boogie Man's chair to comfort her son, the grandson of Maury
Brosius. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days, Kobe Bryant would have been a college senior.
</P>
<P>
   In these new days, he is a co-owner of a basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant recently spent a few of Jerry Buss' lire to buy half of
Olimpia Milano, his father's old team when the Bryant family was
based in Italy. He may be the first active player to own a major
piece of another team, albeit in another country.
</P>
<P>
   Although he insisted his purchase of Olimpia was ``mostly
business,'' Bryant talks of living in Italy again some day. It will
not be any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   With the National Basketball Association rooting for the next
generation of marketable stars to coalesce, Bryant shows signs of
becoming positively Pippenesque.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 21, he is already an explosive star with glorious
moves, linked, as Scottie Pippen once was, to a superstar who makes
him all the more lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the big brother and he's the little brother,'' said
Shaquille O'Neal, who may be playing the role of Michael Jordan in
this West Coast performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant may not love that viewpoint, but with the big man
clogging up the middle, Bryant has become a significant offensive
and defensive force.
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons with the Lakers, his average has risen from 7.6
to 15.4 to 19.9 and now to 22 after Friday night's game with the
Celtics, as the Lakers won at home for their 10th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   With his long arms, Bryant has also become a defensive power.
Last Sunday in Philadelphia _ another of his homes _ Bryant stuck
his willowy 6-foot-7 frame in the way of Allen Iverson, helping to
hold the league's leading scorer without a point in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant never claimed to have personally shut down Iverson, but
that's how it came across in the accounts of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job of staying in front of Iverson and bringing
him to me,'' O'Neal said last week in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On coaching instructions, Bryant had planted himself to
Iverson's side, denying him the middle-range shot, and forcing him
to move in toward O'Neal, who is more than a full foot taller than
the 6-0 Sixer guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do was put myself in his shoes,'' Bryant said.
``In the past when I've had games where I'm struggling, any moment
I could go off. I'm sure he was thinking the same way, so I just
played him.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson shot 0 for 11 in the second half, and later he gave some
credit to Bryant, saying: ``It's always tough playing against
somebody quick and tall because they can kind of back up off you
and get a hand in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is a joy to watch, with his quick steals, his pogo-stick
jump shots and electric drives, and an instinct for jamming home
rebounds from far above the basket. He missed the first 15 games
this season with a broken right hand, but is fourth on his team in
total assists and tied for fourth in rebounds _ and also was second
on the team in turnovers with an average of nearly three a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has his moments when he tries to penetrate too much,''
Coach Phil Jackson said the other night. ``I'd say it's two steps
forward and half a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal acknowledged that Bryant, who passed up college, is
learning more all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran rap artist and the aspiring young rapper, about to
release his first CD, may not be close, but they put it together on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and coach have a good relationship,'' O'Neal said. ``Coach
gives him a plan and he executes it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his exotic name _ which stems from an obviously
unforgettable Japanese steak dinner his parents enjoyed during the
gestation period _ Kobe Bryant is a fixture with the Lakers. He is
currently in the second year of a six-year contract extension,
believed to be worth nearly $71 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is in the very top of the line of players who went
directly from high school to the NBA: Kevin Garnett, Shawn Kemp,
Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins. Dozens of others have come out way
too young, and never adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Kobe Bryant was not the normal teen-ager even when
he was a senior at Lower Merion High outside Philadelphia. He had
observed basketball up close in the friendly environment of Italy,
where his father, Joe (Jelly Bean) Bryant, played for eight seasons
after an eight-year career in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, the kids in America, they don't do the work that Kobe
did,'' Magic Johnson once said. ``That's the problem with the young
people now. They don't have the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant absorbed the game in Italy, going to practice with
his dad, getting on the court, listening to his father talk about
the game on the leisurely afternoons off.
</P>
<P>
   The family went home when it was time for Kobe to play high
school ball, but he still speaks Italian, and talks with reverence
about the three imported Dutch stars, Marco Von Basten, Ruud Gullit
and Frank Rijkaard, who made AC Milan the soccer powerhouse when he
was living there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother wouldn't let me go to the games,'' he said with a
sigh. ``She said it was too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He could surely go back now and watch from the sedate tribuna
d'onore, the VIP box, but he has his own sport during the Italian
soccer season. Milan may have a hold on Kobe Bryant, but there are
championships to be pursued in Los Angeles.

THE KNICKS, FOR A CHANGE, WEAR THEIR RALLYING CAPS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Usually it is the New York Knicks who experience a
second-half freeze, turning a game they once had in control into a
nip-and-tuck affair and sometimes even a loss. It happened as
recently as Wednesday, when Vince Carter and the Toronto Raptors
made a 10-point third-quarter lead vanish in a matter of minutes en
route to winning at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, with the fire-hot Phoenix Suns appearing on
their way to certain victory, the Knicks reversed their trend and
became the ones to rally. A nearly flawless seven-minute stretch at
the end of the game gave the Knicks an 84-79 victory over a Phoenix
team that had won its previous eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Knicks, who have lost five games this season in
which they led by double figures, was a defense that advanced from
solid to outstanding near the midway point of the fourth quarter.
Trailing by 11 points three minutes into the fourth, and by 74-65
with 7 minutes 11 seconds remaining, the Knicks' stoppers held the
Suns to only five points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Ewing becoming a ferocious defensive rebounder and
the rest of the club aggressively challenging shots and passes, the
Knicks held the Suns scoreless on nine straight possessions and to
just two free throws on 11 possessions. And with Chris Childs
scoring seven of his 11 points and Ewing four of his game-high 25,
the Knicks outscored Phoenix by 19-5, including a 13-0 run, over
the second half of the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that when you play hard and play with the type of
intensity that we are able to bring that we can pretty much hold
great teams down,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who recorded 21 points
and a career-high tying 11 rebounds. ``A big part of our defense at
the end was the crowd. The crowd really got into the game once we
got close and it helped us get over the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   A clear sign of the Knicks' increased resolve down the stretch
was their rebounding. The third-worst rebounding team in the
league, they had been manhandled on the backboard all night, being
outrebounded by 33-23 through three quarters. But in the fourth,
the Knicks outrebounded Phoenix by 13-9. Ewing grabbed five of his
10 rebounds in the fourth and Sprewell secured three.
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing and Sprewell carried the Knicks through the first 3
1-2 quarters, keeping them within range of victory, it was Childs
who became the hero in the end. Outplaying the heralded Jason Kidd,
Childs gave the Knicks their first lead since the first quarter by
burying a 3-pointer that made it 76-74 with 2:26 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty seconds later, after Kidd missed a 3-pointer, Childs hit
a 21-footer to put the Knicks up by four points and give them the
momentum. With the Suns sending them to the foul line in hopes of
salvaging a game they led by as many as 11 points in the fourth
quarter, the Knicks made six of six free throws in the final 20
seconds to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just waited my turn,'' Childs said. ``I haven't had the type
of year that I wanted, but I'm not going to stop shooting.
Eventually, when you keep your confidence and keep shooting,
they're going to go in. I was ready to shoot it and you have to be
ready with these guys, because they will get you the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs' late-game heroics gave Ewing and Sprewell the support
they needed. Playing on a left knee that had been bumped badly in
Wednesday's loss to Toronto, Ewing and Sprewell lifted the Knicks
on a night when Allan Houston (14 points, 5-of-14 shooting) did
little.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning, whirling, dipping and fading away, the 37-year-old
Ewing looked like the star of old. He scored 10 of the Knicks' 21
points in the third quarter. His dominant performance continued a
surge that has seen him play at an All-Star level over the past 10
games, a stretch in which he has averaged 18.2 points and 10.7
rebounds. ``We just need him to keep carrying us,'' Kurt Thomas
said of Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from his Achilles' injury earlier this season,
Ewing has refused to give credence to the argument that his
offensive ability has declined, and he used Friday night's
performance as more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age has nothing to do with this,'' said Ewing, who said his
knee did not bother him against Phoenix. ``It's all mental.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy was pleased with the Knicks' play,
particularly a defense that held the Suns to 68 points over the
final 45:20 of play. After falling behind by 11-2 early on, the
Knicks' defense, except for a few short-lived lapses, was stifling.
Phoenix, which entered the game averaging 98.5 points, scored only
17 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we showed a lot of resilience there in the fourth
quarter, particularly being down 9 or 11,'' Van Gundy said. ``This
is as good as any other win we have had this year.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A VOICELESS FAN LONGS FOR MESSIER'S RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I want Mark Messier and I want him now. Don't tell me
about salary caps, dunce caps, capped teeth. Just go buy Mark
Messier and stuff him back in a Ranger uniform and push him out on
the prime line with Adam Graves. Do it before baseball melts the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Who listens to a fan? We scamper along the sides of the eternal
triangle _ athlete, agent, owner _ and sometimes get hung on the
points. Who cares about us? The week began with news that Mariano
Rivera had lost his arbitration case and would get only $7.25
million to pitch this season instead of the $9.25 million he asked
for. Mariano kept smiling. A good sport. Maybe the Yankees could
use the spared $2 million to hire a team of psychiatrists to work
with their minor leaguers; too late for poor Darryl Strawberry, but
then it was the Mets who brought him up too soon and with too
little counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marvin Miller's biographer is beating a drum to have
rules so interpreted that the retired labor leader can be inducted
into baseball's Hall of Fame. C'mon. A co-op in Cooperstown for one
of the guys who made sure you can't afford to go to games? And they
are keeping Pete Rose out? At least Pete gave me pleasure. I say,
Marvin and Pete go in together or leave 'em both on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Who listens to a fan? Am I scandalized that Erick Barkley's life
was improved by switching cars? St. John's gave him a platinum
athletic scholarship so he could get them television gigs. I don't
watch the Red Storm to see Erick read or drive. People have been
giving Erick stuff ever since he picked up a basketball. It looks
as though Riverside Church, where he once played, helped him with
his prep school tuition. God helps those who have game.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the National Collegiate Athletic Association so picky?
Does it feel it's losing ground? The Amateur Athletic Union, once
the power in American sports, but moribund the past few decades, is
making a comeback with sneaker company money, running teams often
coached by street agents, who, truth be told, probably do more for
more young athletes than college coaches do.
</P>
<P>
   Should I, Fan, care?
</P>
<P>
   Ask Dennis Perrin, who is my new role model as a funny, smart
and mean-spirited fan. His new book, ``American Fan: Sports Mania
and the Culture That Feeds It'' (Spike/Avon), is hilariously
vicious at the expense of Spike Lee, George Will, sportswriters,
Michael Jordan, Nike and Jack Tatum. (``Were Tatum really great he
would have crippled some fans as well.'') Every fan should read it
for moral support, then send it to Erick. If he can pass a test on
it, he should get a brand new car.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jay Weiner, who is my new role model as a thoughtful,
precise and idealistic fan. (I inadvertently maligned Weiner, a
Minneapolis journalist, here several weeks ago when I had him
jailed in the Patty Hearst case for harboring fugitives; he was
jailed for refusing to testify against his friends.) Weiner's new
book, ``Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush
League Boondoggle'' (University of Minnesota), is a lesson in
politics and economics by a writer who believes that a city may
well need a major league team to be major league. But Weiner goes
on with pragmatic suggestions on how fans can make this all work in
their own best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Ask me.
</P>
<P>
   If I were writing a book for fans, I'd call it ``SkyBoxer: In
the Arena but Above the Fray.'' That should be our goal, to watch
all games over television, while eating and drinking in bed, with
company, in a luxury box. This is the future of fandom. Who wants
to get close to those brutes? If Reggie Miller isn't talking dirty,
you might get hurt the next time a Marty McSorley forgets that the
violence he gets paid for has certain boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But to be suspended for the rest of the season just for
concussing a guy he has been fighting for years? I think McSorley
should be replaced by Tonya Harding, the prototype skating goon,
arrested last week for whacking her boyfriend with a hubcap.
</P>
<P>
   What would bring me downstairs?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Messier. I want Captain Dad back in town. I want to reclaim
my inner puck, to see again that scream of a face floating over the
Garden ice. Wiser heads say I'm wrong, that Messier is 39 and his
$6 million contract (not even as much as the marked down Rivera!)
and his powerful personality will upset the Rangers. I want them
upset! I am a fan! The Rangers stink!
</P>
<P>
   And Cablevision can afford Messier; it was ready to buy the
Jets. Actually, if Marvin Miller wants my vote for the Hall of
Fame, he should explain how Cablevision can be allowed to own the
venue (Madison Square Garden), the teams (Knicks, Rangers) and the
television channels, and still not satisfy my needs.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, I want Coach Mike Keenan and I want him
now.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a splashy ceremony at Rockefeller Center earlier
this month, cameras rolled and an adoring throng applauded as a
redheaded, freckle-faced puppet was elevated into the television
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving cast members, writers and producers of ``The Howdy
Doody Show'' _ most in their 80s and scattered around the country _
gathered once more to see a bronze star uncovered for the beloved
cowboy marionette on NBC-TV's ``Walk of Fame,'' beside those of two
flesh-and-blood giants of TV's golden age, Sid Caesar and Milton
Berle.
</P>
<P>
   But Howdy wasn't there. He was locked in a trunk in a bank vault
in New London, Conn., where he has been for the last year, and it
may take a judge's order to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, boys and girls, it's a lawsuit and custody battle over a
puppet. But not just any puppet: the actual Howdy Doody marionette
used on the show, which ran for 2,543 episodes from 1947 to 1960.
In short, the eBay artifact of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has summoned the cast and characters of ``The Howdy
Doody Show,'' people and puppets alike, from the pastures of
television nostalgia and into the land of legalese.
</P>
<P>
   The combatants are the family of the late Rufus Rose, Howdy's
puppeteer for most of the show's run, and the Detroit Institute of
Arts. The museum, which has one of the country's largest puppet
collections, maintains that NBC gave Rose custody of the puppet
with the understanding that he would eventually donate it to the
museum. The family of Rose, who died in 1975, insists that there
was no such deal, and they have a contract with Leland's, the
Manhattan auction house, to sell the puppet and others from the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in federal court in Hartford, Conn., the museum sued
the Rose estate for possession of the marionette, identified in
legal papers as ``Original Howdy,'' to distinguish it from several
copies made as stand-ins but rarely used on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, both sides will submit their cases in writing. The judge
could deliver a decision in weeks, or call a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of this off-screen TV drama have been decidedly
strange. Lawyers have taken testimony from the show's elderly
graduates, now scattered across the country. They even deposed the
last Clarabell the Clown _ Lew Anderson, 77, now a band leader who
lives in Westchester. Court records include desperate letters from
Buffalo Bob Smith, the host of the show, pleading with the Rose
family to let him have Howdy, for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At a reunion of the 53-year-old Howdy with his ``Mom,'' an
86-year-old puppet maker named Velma Dawson, she immediately
identified him as her creation, though she had not held him in half
a century.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   With collectors predicting auction prices in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, the dispute is not likely to be resolved by
Clarabell's squirting Buffalo Bob with seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose knowledge of TV cowboy dolls stuck in storage
begins and ends with ``Toy Story 2,'' a primer may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   From December 1947 to September 1960, in Studio 3-K in the NBC
studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Buffalo Bob would open the show by
asking the Peanut Gallery, a live audience of 40 children, ``Say
kids, what time is it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Howdy Doody time,'' they would scream, and then launch
into the show's theme song, set to the ``Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay''
melody. The hourlong afternoon program was first televised at a
time when only 20,000 homes in the country had television sets. It
was the first network weekday children's show, the first to
broadcast more than 1,000 continuous episodes, and, when color came
to television, it was NBC's first show in color.
</P>
<P>
   After the show ended, all the puppets, including Original Howdy,
stayed with Rose. While the 1950s was a whirlwind of shows and
public appearances for Howdy, in the 1960s he went from Doodyville
to Dullsville, tucked away in obscurity along with his marionette
colleagues _ Phineas T. Bluster, Flub-a-Dub and Dilly Dally _ in
the attic of Rose's home in Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1970, Original Howdy was lured out of retirement by
Buffalo Bob Smith, who persuaded Rose to lend him the original
puppet for public appearances at colleges and shopping centers
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith usually preferred to use a stringless replica he could
easily rest on his lap _ often known as Photo Doody _ and Original
Howdy has whiled away most of the last two decades in a glass case
in Smith's home in Flat Rock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith's death in 1998, Original Howdy was returned to the
Rose family. When the Detroit Institute sued, the family put him
into the bank vault for safekeeping, along with two replicas Rose
made for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Legal ownership of the puppet, however, is not so
straightforward. In 1970, Rose sent Smith a letter with the puppet
confirming it as the ``one and only original Howdy.'' Rose also
pointed out that NBC had ``conveyed ownership'' of the show's
puppets to him with the provisions ``that I not use them in a
commercial manner as the characters from `The Howdy Doody Show' and
that Howdy himself eventually be placed in the care of the Detroit
Institute of Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after Rose died, Smith, claiming financial
hardship, asked both the museum and the Rose family whether he
could keep the puppet. Both said no.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith turned over the puppet in 1998 to Christopher Rose,
one of the puppeteer's sons and the trustee of his parents' estate,
he and Smith agreed in writing to sell the puppet and split the
profits between them.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith died a few months later, before Howdy was sold. The
puppet remained in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's three sons, James, Rufus and Christopher, insist that
their father changed his mind about giving the puppet to the
museum. What could have led the father to change his mind? Perhaps
the likelihood of making a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose collection is as good as it gets,'' said Joshua
Leland Evans, chairman of Leland's auction house, which sold
memorabilia belonging to several of the show's former members for
about $350,000 in 1998. Photo Doody sold for $123,000. ``It's a
monster. It's in the pantheon with Dorothy's red shoes, the piano
from `Casablanca' and Vivien Leigh's Oscar from `Gone With the
Wind.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen stuff like this go for $50,000, and others go for a
million,'' Evans said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already, the search for Howdy's legal guardian has corrected the
widely held misconception that the father created Original Howdy.
In fact, Rose joined the show in 1954, six years after Original
Howdy was made.
</P>
<P>
   The very first Howdy Doody marionette was made by a puppeteer
named Frank Paris. But after a contract dispute several months into
the show, Paris left and took with him his rather crude-looking
puppet, later referred to as ``Ugly Howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantic for a replacement, the show's producers asked Velma
Dawson, a well-known puppetmaker living in Hollywood, to reinvent
Howdy. She modeled the puppet's head in Plasticine, made a mold,
and then cast the head in Plastic Wood. Her finished puppet was a
27-inch-tall boy with prominent ears. He wore jeans, a bandanna and
a checked shirt, and had 48 freckles, one for each state.
</P>
<P>
   It took her two weeks to make, and she was paid $300. After
sending the puppet to New York in 1948, she never saw him again,
until last December. That was when the museum's lawyers arranged
for her to come from her home in Palm Desert, Calif., to verify
Original Howdy. Three puppets were taken out of the vault and
placed on a large boardroom table in an office building in Groton,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, 86, had not seen Howdy in 52 years, but she instantly
recognized it as her creation. ``I'm the real mother of Howdy,''
Dawson said. ``I knew him when he was nobody.

METS AND CUBS PREPARE FOR JAPAN  
 WHOM OLERUD WILL MISS  
 LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Members of the Baltimore Orioles, notably Albert
Belle, have complained that the team's trip to Cuba last March
served as a distraction and caused their team to start the season
poorly. Rickey Henderson, the Mets' problem child, said he doesn't
want to go and won't go to Japan, where the Mets and the Chicago
Cubs open the 2000 season in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor will have none of it. He is the Cubs' new manager,
and he will not allow his players to view the lengthy trip as a
distraction and use it as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two games and we have 160 after that,'' Baylor said. ``So
let's not let a few days dictate the entire season for us. I read
some of the Orioles' comments when they got off to a bad start,
when the pitchers got off to a bad start. I look at it as, `Let's
not make an excuse going there to play.' You have to look at it as
it's baseball; it's an honor to go over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented opening in Japan is part of Major League
Baseball's plan to go global, expanding interest in itself with an
eye toward the increased revenue that interest could generate. The
other major sports have done it; baseball, slow to see the
possibilities, is playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in baseball would like the increased revenue, but not
everyone is willing to contribute to the effort. The Japanese
sponsors of the games, for example, preferred St. Louis because of
Mark McGwire, but the Cardinals, with McGwire voicing his objection
to the trip, declined the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will broaden horizons for some of the players. ``We
have some guys who have never had a passport,'' said Baylor, who is
preparing for his eighth visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has often made the 13-hour flight, Baylor knows what
a grind it is. But, he said, with sensible planning, it becomes
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks prior to breaking camp,'' he said, ``we're going to
start the indoctrination of telling people what to expect, what to
do, leading up to that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lee, the Cubs' Pacific rim scouting coordinator, is in the
team's camp and will aid in preparing the players. ``He has made
over 100 trips over there,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee played in Japan for 10 years, scouted for a Japanese team
and has done consulting work in Japan for Major League Baseball and
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   As if the flight weren't long enough, Baylor said the ride from
the airport to the hotel takes two-and-a-half hours. ``Los Angeles
traffic and New York traffic aren't even close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, once the team lands in Japan, the manager said, is for
the players to stay awake as long as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you arrive there,'' he counseled, ``don't try to go to
sleep. You'll be up all night fighting it. Stay up as long as you
can. Go out and have dinner. You'll wear down. Your body will tell
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' trek will begin at 5:45 a.m. March 24, when luggage is
brought to HoHoKam Park, site of the Cubs' spring games. At 8:20
a.m., they will fly to San Francisco, where they will have a
14-hour layover before leaving for Tokyo at 11:15 p.m. They are
scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 3:10 p.m. March 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets begin their day at 6 a.m. March 24 with luggage
check-in at their park in Port St. Lucie. They will fly from West
Palm Beach at 8:45 a.m. and connect in Chicago to a 1:15 p.m.
flight to Tokyo. They are scheduled to arrive at 5:20 p.m. March
25.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the teams will work out at the Tokyo Dome, then
play exhibition games March 27 and 28, each playing the Tokyo
Giants and the Seibu Lions. They will open the season with a night
game at the Tokyo Dome March 29. The season's first pitch is
scheduled for 4:10 a.m. Chicago time, 5:10 a.m. New York time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and the Mets will play again the following evening,
then leave for home March 31. ``The toughest one is coming back,''
Baylor said. ``That beats you up for a day, maybe two. After that
you're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   While 28 other teams play exhibition games Saturday and a
handful have their final exhibition games Sunday, the Cubs and the
Mets will have no more games until Monday, April 3, the domestic
opening day for everyone. But the Cubs will not be finished
traveling. They will fly to St. Louis Sunday while the Mets sleep
at home Sunday night before their opener at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will impress on the players not to use the trip as an
excuse,'' Baylor said. ``I guarantee you Bobby Valentine will tell
his team the exact same thing. They're in a division with the
Braves and can't have this affect the 160 games left.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said he was looking forward to the trip. ``We never
thought this was possible,'' he said. ``But the world has come
closer because of technology. It's a smaller place than it was 20,
25 years ago. I look at it as being on the frontier of what's going
to happen to our game later.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Infield of Dreams
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud does not expect to have any regrets over leaving the
Mets, because he felt Seattle would be the best place for his
family. But that does not mean he won't miss his remarkable infield
partners, Robin Ventura, Rey Ordonez and Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot of fun, being part of that infield,'' Olerud
said. ``Watching those guys day in and day out, the plays that
Robin and Rey would make over there and the great plays that
Edgardo would make. They're a special group of guys. The part I
liked best about them was I always got good throws. Very rarely did
I have to make a tough catch or anything. They always seemed to
make good throws to me so that was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he ever surprised by a play one of the infielders made after
he thought the ball was going through for a hit, and left
unprepared for a throw to first?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rey cured me of that pretty soon,'' the first baseman said.
``Yeah, he did surprise me a couple times. Then Robin surprised me
on a couple plays. I'm still covering the base, but you see the
play: It's a bunt, it looks like it's a good bunt; he's probably
not going to have a chance on a ball down the line, but he gets it.
Those guys surprised me, not only with the spectacular plays but
how solid they were day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sons Surpassing Fathers
</P>
<P>
   From Earle Mack (Connie) to Justin Speier (Chris), about 160
sons of former major leaguers have played in the majors. But their
success in recent years has been far greater than in the past.
About 20 percent of the total, more than 30, are in training camps
now preparing for the coming season. Others are waiting for their
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Why have sons of this generation become more successful than
their predecessors?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Sandy Alomar Sr. said, ``there weren't many
because of the pressure that was on them. Now, when they're
younger, they go with their fathers to the ballpark. People are
allowed to bring kids into the clubhouse. They're raised in the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was playing with Bobby Bonds, my kids were
playing with Barry. I used to see Tony Perez's kid playing with
Griffey. I think that by getting into the environment, they knew
all the players and they felt like they were at home. They didn't
feel the pressure. I think their parents probably prepared them
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar is the Chicago Cubs' new bullpen coach this year; his
sons, Sandy Jr. and Roberto, play for Cleveland. Ken Griffey Jr. is
with his father, a coach, in Cincinnati. Aaron Boone is the Reds'
third baseman; his father, Bob, is a special assistant to the Reds'
general manager. Brother and son Bret plays second base for San
Diego. David Bell plays second base for Seattle; Buddy Bell manages
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was growing up,'' said David Bell, the grandson of
Gus, ``I don't think he was at the park as much. Back then I think
they tried to keep things more normal. When I was growing up, it
was so easy to go to the park with your dad. I think that's the
biggest advantage I had, being around the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became obsessed with playing in the big leagues and doing
exactly what my dad had done. It was because I got a chance to be
around and see how much I wanted to do it. Just having the
opportunity to do it and teams allowing it. It seems like
everywhere we went we'd look around the field and there were other
players' sons out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar recalled that Sandy Jr. quit playing baseball for about
three years in his early teens, preferring to spend his time with
tae kwon do and dirt bikes. But when he returned to the game at the
age of 15, his father said, he was as passionate about playing as
his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Robby would play,'' the father said. ``He kept telling
me day in and day out he was going to be better than me. I told him
that it wasn't going to be any challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The thing is, they were with me all the time. We
prepared them mentally, made sure they understood the things that
people were going to be saying to them, the things that people were
going to try to compare them with.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Alomar brothers, the Indians have Speier, Jaret
Wright (Clyde) and Chris Haney (Larry), giving them the most sons
of former major leaguers.

GIRARDI PREFERS SECURITY TO ANOTHER RING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ He could have been across the country in Tampa,
Fla., preparing for perhaps his fourth World Series in five years,
but instead Joe Girardi was here, preparing for a season with those
lovable losers, the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, Girardi played for the New York
Yankees; now he will play for the team that had the second-worst
record in the National League last season. The veteran catcher,
however, was not prepared to plead insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the role that they had for me was not the role I
really wanted,'' Girardi said, discussing his departure from the
Yankees as a free agent. ``They offered me a one-year deal to be
the backup. To me, that wasn't a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when the Cubs offered $5.5 million for three years, dwarfing
the Yankees' six-figure offer for the 2000 season only.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get an opportunity to play every day and somebody offers
you a three-year deal, you gotta take it,'' Girardi said in his new
spring clubhouse. ``You have a baby, you take the one year as a
backup, then you have to worry where are you going to be next year.
When you have a family, you want to be a little bit more stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Opting, at the age of 35, for security over the possibility of
another World Series ring, Girardi also preferred the prospect of
playing regularly over a role as Jorge Posada's backup. Not that he
won't feel a twinge of nostalgia if the Yankees do play in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees hadn't reached and won the World Series in his
first, third and fourth seasons with them, Girardi said, ``It
probably would have made it easier to leave because I wouldn't have
known what it was like. I think having the three World Series made
it harder for me to leave, but I knew I had to do what was best for
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi was no insignificant contributor to the Yankees'
success. When Bob Watson became the general manager and Joe Torre
the manager after the 1995 season, they targeted Girardi as one of
the first players they wanted to obtain. They felt they had to
shore up the catching if the Yankees were to have a chance to
become a contender.
</P>
<P>
   When Don Baylor became the Cubs' manager last Nov. 1, he
similarly identified Girardi as a catcher to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first guys I thought about as a free
agent,'' said Baylor, for whom Girardi caught for three seasons in
Colorado. ``I figured Joe would have one last dance close to home.
I said let's see if we can make it work, and Ed went to work on him
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Girardis live in Chicago made it easier for Ed
Lynch, the Cubs' general manager, to make Baylor's idea work.
Baylor had lost Girardi in Colorado four years earlier because of
Girardi's outspoken union views after the 1994-95 players strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no bones about it; I made a mistake,'' Girardi said.
``I think that's the reason I was gone. I got on some people in
management about the way they were treating some of the players,
the pressure they were receiving to cross the line. I made a
mistake blasting management a little bit. You learn and you go on.
I learned a valuable lesson. But it was a blessing for me to go to
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi served the Yankees well. He hit a career-high .294 in
his first season with them and quickly became the catcher the
pitchers wanted to pitch to. He also displayed a high level of
class by helping the young and inexperienced Posada even though it
was obvious the Yankees planned to make him their No. 1 catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons Posada caught the bulk of the games, but
Girardi continued to catch David Cone and Andy Pettitte. His
experience with the crafty Cone is one he has taken with him to the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed catching Coney because of his uniqueness,''
Girardi said. ``There was always something different every day. For
a catcher he allows you to be very creative. That's enjoyable. He's
the ultimate competitor. Everyone knows the type of pitcher he is.
He's a big-game pitcher that just enjoys everything that he does.
He's the best example of a pitcher who doesn't have his best stuff
but finds a way of getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi acknowledged that he will miss Cone and the rest of the
friends he leaves behind. He has taken with him, though, his
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about my four years there,'' he said. ``They've been
the best four years I've had in the game. You definitely cherish
the moments from the World Series. The final games stand out the
most. It's an end to a wonderful season. It's something you know
you're going to reflect on. It's something you know you're going to
hold onto. I think my best moments as a Yankee were jumping into
the pitchers' arms when that last out was recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the arms belonged to John Wetteland; in 1998, they were
Mariano Rivera's. The Cubs will have to make a remarkable
improvement over last season's 67-95 record for Girardi to find
himself in someone else's arms next October.

FOR METS' WILSON, ARM INJURIES PUT A NEW SPIN ON PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The signs read like the morals of the
stories in a series of children's sports books.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates Count on Each Other. Give, Share and You'll Receive.
Only Your Best Counts. Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those sayings and others hang from the ceiling in the locker
room of the Mets' minor league complex here, ever-present reminders
of the fundamentals of teamwork. Paul Wilson, who should be
entering his fifth season in the major leagues, saw those signs
last season day after day, when he went to work in that minor
league clubhouse he calls a dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he should have put that place behind him long ago. ``I
still think of myself as a major leaguer,'' Wilson, 26, said. ``But
it's just not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went 5-12 with a 5.38 earned run average for the Mets in
1996, two years after the club made him the first overall selection
in the amateur draft after a standout career at Florida State. He
has pitched in 17 minor league games the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right (pitching) shoulder
cost Wilson most of 1997 and '98. But he pitched well for Class AAA
Norfolk at the end of '98, and last year started spring training
with nine scoreless innings. He was devastated when he was optioned
to Norfolk, but a week later, things got much worse: Wilson learned
he had torn a ligament in his pitching elbow. He had reconstructive
surgery April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson could have begun throwing Aug. 1, but the Mets waited an
extra month because there was no reason to rush. The recovery has
been slow but sure. Wilson is throwing without pain, and recovering
well the days after he throws. Mike Herbst, the Mets'
rehabilitation coordinator, said Wilson is 90 percent to 95 percent
healthy. The Mets are still being extremely cautious. They will
reduce Wilson's workload at the first sign of discomfort, Herbst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is throwing consistently at 86 mph and expects to be back
to the low 90s with more innings. The Mets may have him start the
season at Class A Port St. Lucie, to take advantage of the warm
weather, or he could begin at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well there, he may be in Shea Stadium sometime after
midseason. Waiting for him there will be the left-hander Al Leiter,
who missed most of two seasons as a young pitcher with shoulder and
elbow injuries. Leiter has taken to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to success _ and I've talked to Paul about it a few
times _ is instead of thinking of yourself in terms of what could
have been and should have been, think about the new Paul Wilson,''
Leiter said. ``Forget about the old Paul Wilson _ you are who you
are now. Deal with the stuff you have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for guys that had great stuff pre-injury is
that when you come back from an operation, in your own mind you see
something differently. So you lose confidence. You don't think it's
enough to get major league hitters out, and you adjust accordingly,
in a negative way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's rehabilitation was so monotonous that the Mets varied
his routine just so he would not be bored. He did not watch
baseball on television last season _ ``It wasn't helping me at all
to watch everybody else doing what I wanted to do,'' he said _ and
focused on other goals.
</P>
<P>
   His progress has been aided by his overall athleticism. Wilson
had the fastest time among pitchers in the 300-yard shuttle run
this spring. Athleticism is important; some believe that another
No. 1 overall pick, the Yankees' Brien Taylor, never recovered from
a serious shoulder injury in part because he was not athletic
enough to adjust after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he works hard on his running, but believes he will
come back mostly because he understands pitching better. After
averaging more than a strikeout an inning in his first two years in
the Mets' system, Wilson has discovered the joys of relearning his
craft. He has learned a changeup, is throwing more curveballs and
has better mechanics. He is a new Paul Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, I'd always gotten away with God-given
ability,'' Wilson said. ``I always thought I was a good pitcher,
but when I got hurt, I really had to pick my spots, think about
what I'm doing out there and learn _ not just learn pitching but
learn the hitters, learn everything about this game, even the
business side of it, just learn this whole entire system. You'd be
surprised what that does for your comfort level and your
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have learned, too, from the example of Wilson, Bill
Pulsipher and Jason Isringhausen, the young pitching trio that was
supposed to resurrect the team in the mid-1990s. Their success in
the farm system helped put up another sign in the minor league
clubhouse: Organization of the Year, 1995. But then all three
developed elbow injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed our philosophy as far as relying solely on young
prospects to be the savior of our organization,'' said Jim
Duquette, the Mets' assistant general manager for player personnel.
``Now, with some of the trades we make, we look for guys with
established major league careers and supplement them with one or
two guys from our own system.''
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen was traded to the Oakland Athletics last summer,
but Pulsipher, who was traded away and then reacquired last month,
is the leading candidate to be the Mets' fifth starter this year.
Wilson said that no matter what happens _ even if he reinjures
himself and has to spend another year in the dungeon _ he will keep
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all I know,'' Wilson said. ``I've always been good at
this; I've always been good at being a ballplayer. I've just always
felt comfortable. I mean, I do not know what I'd do if I wasn't
playing ball. It scares the hell out of me thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter was 26, he had just missed five months with an elbow
injury. Eight years later, he is an established veteran and one of
baseball's more effective starters. He has lived a comeback story,
and believes Wilson can do the same. ``He'll make it,'' Leiter said
of Wilson. ``He works as hard as anybody I've ever seen. He
cares.''

   They tried pawning off Anfernee Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal in
1995 as Michael Jordan's successors. Kobe Bryant came in 1998.
Fresh, young, he would be the face of the next millennium. Grant
Hill got air time, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill was honest enough to acknowledge that the hype was
silly. He called it the Larry Holmes syndrome. ``You come after the
greatest, there's no way you'll ever live up to it,'' Hill said.
``None of us could be Michael. None of us ever will.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter makes his national network debut Sunday, skywalking
into living rooms at 12:30 p.m., Eastern time, against the Phoenix
Suns. NBC thinks so highly of the Toronto Raptors' second-year
forward, they bumped the Knicks-76ers game back to 3 p.m. to ensure
that all of America would see him.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to say Air Apparent because that is the curse,
worse than winding up on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which
Carter did last week. Still, there he was Wednesday night at
Madison Square Garden, detonating for 33 points, nine rebounds and
nine assists against the Knicks. The slam-dunk champion showed
substance as much as style 24 hours after appearing on the ``Late
Show with David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was frightening _ another North Carolina kid who
had left school after his junior year, taking jaded NBA fans with
him as he levitated near the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it dangerous for him to be the future?'' Charles Oakley,
his veteran teammate, asked rhetorically after the Knicks' game.
``It's always dangerous when you market young kids before their
time, when you try to make them be somebody you want them to be
before they're ready to be that person. But Vince knows what time
it is. He knows what this is about. He's handling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is gracious and candid in interviews, if slightly
prepackaged and a bit overmanaged.
</P>
<P>
   Of his growing celebrity, he said: ``It's crazy sometimes, but
as much stuff as I do, I always put basketball first and foremost.
I understand I am where I am because of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is clearly a player worthy of the hype. But with all the
pressure being putting on him by NBC, the NBA and his own marketing
people to be the next suitable ambassador for the game, the
question arises whether Carter will be allowed to grow enough in
the present to indeed become the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sit around and say, `Here's who we sell and here's
who we don't sell,''' Russ Granik, the league's deputy
commissioner, said. ``It just happens on the court. He's a
spectacular, exciting player. Were you there at the Garden the
other night? I was. The NBA didn't make Vince Carter score five
times in a row in the third quarter and dunk the way he dunked.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Historically, in some ways, Michael became a
phenomenon even quicker. Shaq as well. Occasionally, you get that
special combination of personality and a game that attract more
attention than anybody else. Right now, Vince is that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Microphones a Union Issue
</P>
<P>
   During the 76ers-Lakers game last Sunday, coach Larry Brown
could easily be heard giving Allen Iverson words of encouragement
after an atrocious offensive performance in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision to install miniature microphones on one coach and
the lead referee for their featured weekly game was done with the
utmost sensitivity toward players and coaches. They use edited
snippets sparingly and have yet to pander to shock value, instead
giving the lead announcers, Bob Costas and Doug Collins, a chance
to lend perspective to what is being said on the court.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Hunter and several players are worried that the NBA
and the network are walking a fine line between access and
intrusion. Hunter, the executive director of the players
association, plans to speak to Commissioner David Stern and the
deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, this week about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple things that bother me about it, the first
being that they seem to be altering work conditions without any
approval from the players,'' Hunter said. ``These are
across-the-board changes no one even asked us about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, it is somewhat of an intrusion. They've got
microphones all over the court now, so that someone, somewhere can
hear everything that's going on. It's like Big Brother watching
over you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said Shaquille O'Neal complained to him about the NBA's
total-access policies during All-Star Weekend. Several players were
miked for the game on a voluntary basis. What's more, O'Neal was
one of a handful of players who often ended up on nba.com
television, the league's 24-hour news network that one Internet
mogul described as ``like Bloomberg News on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   At one juncture O'Neal jokingly used profanity, apparently
unaware that the nba.com broadcast was live.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several players actually enjoyed the extra exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a former coach, there are certain things that you cannot
do,'' Collins said. ``I don't think in any way we'd try to
embarrass somebody, to try to make it look like somebody is
incompetent or in some way try to do something to upstage
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's still a player-coach confidence that can't
be breached. If we do that, then in essence, we will wipe out
anything we've tried to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is also worried about outtakes ending up in the wrong
hands _ and whether the game is influenced when players understand
that what they say to a referee can be heard by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say if the players are acting out what they're
thinking about a referee who is miked?'' he said. ``I'm not saying
those tapes will be used to fine and suspend players, but it just
takes away some of the spirit of the game when you know you're
being heard. It's something I'd like to address.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Developing a League
</P>
<P>
   With more and more teen-agers migrating to the draft under the
illusion that they are already prepared to play, the NBA has
targeted the start-up date for its developmental league for the
fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not 100 percent sure we can't do something next
fall, but for right now we're exploring a lot of possibilities,''
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said.
</P>
<P>
   The league recently named Rob Levine its senior vice president
for new league development. With the goal of placing teams in
smaller cities, Levine is scouring the country for potential
investors. The teams would ultimately be operated by NBA teams,
serving almost like a minor league club in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The league would run from the fall to the spring, with the idea
that players could be brought up during the season. Salaries would
be small compared to NBA salaries, though it is unclear how the
union and the NBA plan to negotiate an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the union would not tolerate players being sent down on
a whim. Shipping off a veteran who is not playing much, like Chris
Dudley, would not be allowed. But sending down a young foreign
player like Mirsad Turckan, recently waived by the Knicks and
picked up by Milwaukee, might have merit.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas, the owner of the Continental Basketball
Association and a person who has often implored the NBA to take a
more serious look at the issue of young players turning pro, has
had talks with the league about a potential deal. Though the NBA
has yet to close the door on that, it appears the league will look
elsewhere.

 &HT;    FEDERAL TRACKING OF STATE EDUCATION TRENDS CRITICIZED
 &HT;    Editors: Note state-specific insert.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government spends too little and takes
too long when it measures the progress of states in improving their
schools, the National Education Goals Panel declared Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We somehow have to demand the money to get the job done
speedily,'' said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, as he
succeeded Democratic Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky as the panel's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Congress set up the influential, bipartisan panel a decade ago
to monitor the effects of school reforms. It is composed of eight
governors, four members of Congress, four state legislators and two
presidential members.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of the statistics used by the panel to track
national and state-level trends are collected annually. Others are
collected every two, four or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, it's truly ridiculous,'' Patton said. ``The
latest (state-level) data on adult literacy is from 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal agencies and nonprofit research groups that supply
the statistics still collect a lot of data on paper, rather than in
computerized form. Entering, editing and analyzing the numbers can
delay publication for another two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the states who are in charge of changing things can't
use three-year-old data, much less 12-year-old data,'' said
Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses spend a lot to keep track of how they and their
competitors are doing,'' Hunt said. ``In educating our children,
our future workforce, we should do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states and school districts are resisting efforts to get
them to cooperate in collecting uniform data more swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   State resistance would fade if the federal government were to
pick up more of the cost, Thompson said. ``Money has a strange way
of encouraging people to do things,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some local educators avoid national tests because they want to
concentrate on ``high stakes'' state tests that directly affect
funding for schools and teachers and promotion chances for
students.
</P>
<P>
   Mark a decade ago to monitor the effects of school reforms. of
Atlanta, who chairs the National Assessment Governing Board, said
two states refused to take part in this year's national math and
science tests for students in the fourth and eighth grades. He said
seven other states backed out and some of the remaining 41 have had
a hard time finding enough schools to agree to conduct the tests.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage states to take part in the national tests,
President Clinton's budget proposes a $5 million bonus pool to be
shared among states whose students show progress on their latest
national tests in math, science, reading or writing.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Clinton's plan as ``bonuses for performance and
quality,'' Thompson said, ``Business has been doing that for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel voted to:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Vigorously support increased funding'' for speedier
collection and publication of data that allows comparisons of the
performance of states, districts, schools, teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   _ Convene a meeting this summer of national groups of business,
education and government leaders to decide how to cooperate on the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Form a task force headed by former Maine Gov. John ``Jock''
McKernan to recommend new ways to measure and report on educational
trends.

<P>
   MADISON, Conn. _ When protests erupt over news gathering, the
usual complaint is that someone printed fiction instead of fact,
rumor rather than truth. But not here.
</P>
<P>
   In this boutique-size town, where stone fences and woods
surround large homes on Connecticut's southern shore, residents are
condemning the local newspaper for publishing what they believe is
an overkill of truth.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, petitions have been circulating here
and in a neighboring town, Guilford, calling on the local
government to force The Shore Line Times, a small 123-year-old
paper published twice weekly, to stop printing its police blotter.
The blotter, which starts on Page 2, provides the name, age,
address and alleged offense of everyone arrested in Madison and
Guilford in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, the blotter seems as blandly innocuous as the
paper's weekly notices for the local arthritis support group. But
to the 35,000 people who live in Madison and Guilford _ especially
teenagers, whose names pile up in the blotter like driftwood on
Madison's private beach _ Page 2 of the newspaper is an
embarrassing record of who got arrested and for what.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the blotter is a record of petty crimes: underage liquor
possession and speeding tickets flecked with a burglary here, a
felony drug offense there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's about time they got rid of it,'' Meaghan
Egan, 16, a junior at Daniel Hand High School in Madison, said
moments before signing the petition at the Madison Gourmet Beanery.
``It's a gossip column more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the whole town seems to read it religiously, she said,
``It could affect your reputation in many ways at work, in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The petitions, which sprouted anonymously a few weeks ago,
demand that town selectmen in Madison and Guilford force The Shore
Line Times to halt publishing the police blotter. Some 200
residents have signed them, endorsing the assertion that the
blotter constitutes an ``invasion of privacy'' and sparks
``needless gossip'' among residents.
</P>
<P>
   Like police blotters in hundreds of other newspapers across the
country, the one published by The Shore Line Times is drawn from
police files that by law are open to public inspection. Unlike
other community papers that withhold the names of underage
offenders and the exact addresses of those charged with crimes, The
Shore Line Times publishes all the details it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here, that's the first thing they do is open the paper
and look to see who's in the blotter,'' said Leesa Sonnichsen, 49,
of Madison. ``My son got into an accident, and the first thing he
said when he got home was, `I'm glad it wasn't in Madison; it would
have been in the blotter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Young, the paper's exasperated editor, vowed to
continue printing the police log. ``As much as there are people who
don't like it, I think there are many more people that do like
it,'' she said in an interview on Thursday. ``People like to call
it gossip, but it does let you know what is happening in town. It's
not meant to hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials acknowledge they have no authority to stop
publication of the blotter. But Madison's acting first selectman,
Ron Piombino, said that he would support an official resolution
urging the paper ``to really exercise discretion'' about what it
prints. Like other residents interviewed last week, Piombino has no
problem reading about serious crimes. But, he said, printing every
teen-age beer or marijuana arrest, every no-turn-on-red traffic
ticket, every barking-dog citation ``probably isn't the most
responsible way to act.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's really incumbent on The Shore Line Times to
consider whether that's responsible journalism to continue to
publish that.''
</P>
<P>
   That people under 25 hate the blotter so much is no mystery;
they commit about a third of the alleged crimes in it, and they
despise the inevitable taunts from their friends or the wrath of
their parents every Wednesday and Saturday when the paper is
published.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It just, like, rubs people's faces in it,'' said Sarah
Terribile, a Hand High School student whose friends have been in
the blotter.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Vinci, 19, a high school senior, for example, signed a
petition at the Madison Gourmet Beanery three times, presumably
after the blotter ran an item about his Jan. 7 arrest on a
marijuana possession charge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Word of the petition surprised some professional critics of the
news gathering process.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism in Washington, said he had never heard of complaints
against a newspaper for printing too much accurate information.
``What makes it unusual is that you would have a newspaper who
wants to publish this stuff and a community that says, `No, don't
tell us, keep us in the dark,''' he said in a telephone interview
on Thursday. But he said newspapers that print charges against
individuals should also publish exonerations and favorable court
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Young, editor of The Shore Line Times, said she would gladly
publish exonerations and acquittals if someone sent the documents
to her office. But most people don't bother, she said, ``because
they don't want their names ever in the paper again.''
</P>
<P>
   The blotter is such a must-read for the town's busybodies that
Young said she was often accosted with bribes or threats, tears or
pleas for mercy from those recently arrested. It never works.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person looked me straight in the eye and said, `You're not
putting that in, are you?''' she recalled. ``I looked the person in
the eye right back and said, `Yes, I am.'''

SUZANNE GALLO, A DESIGNER   OF DANCE COMPANY COSTUMES, DIES AT 46  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suzanne Gallo, a designer who created costumes for
many of Merce Cunningham's major recent works, died on Feb. 19 at
her home in Manhattan. She was 46.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said David Vaughan, the archivist for the
Merce Cunningham Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   In a relatively short career in design, Gallo became known for
handsome, sometimes luminously pretty costumes that allowed the
body to move and captured the often intangible qualities of
Cunningham's dances without intruding on the choreography itself.
Robert Greskovic, writing in The Wall Street Journal last year
about Gallo's costumes for Cunningham's ``Pond Way,'' described her
work as ``consistently inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, Gallo received a bachelor's degree in theater
and textiles from the State University of New York. She joined the
Cunningham company as a wardrobe superviser in 1982 and worked as a
costume builder _ constructing the costumes from the designs _
before creating her first design for Cunningham in 1993. Among the
Cunningham works for which she designed costumes were ``Ground
Level Overlay,'' ``Windows'' and ``Biped.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo also worked as a costume builder or designer with such
choreographers as Neil Greenberg, Meredith Monk, Lucinda Childs and
Trisha Brown and with companies like the White Oak Dance Project,
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Ballet Hispanico.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her parents, Frank and Joan Gallo of
Lakewood, N.J., and three brothers, Steven, of Lindenhurst, N.Y.,
Anthony, of Levittown, N.Y., and Philip, of Manhattan.

ALFRED ISSELBACHER, A DEALER   WHO SPECIALIZED IN ART PRINTS, DIES
AT 73  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Isselbacher, an art dealer who specialized in
19th- and 20th-century prints, died on Feb. 15 at a hospital in the
Bronx. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Isselbacher was born in Isselbach, Germany, in 1926. His family
emigrated to the United States in 1938 and settled in Manhattan.
After graduating from high school, he served in the U.S. Coast
Guard during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Isselbacher worked at different jobs until the
late 1950s, when he opened a stationery and bookstore in the Inwood
section of Manhattan. He gradually began to sell prints at his
shop, starting with a lithograph by Ossip Zadkin.
</P>
<P>
   Isselbacher opened a gallery at 1225 Madison Ave. in 1965,
moving in 1970 to 1223 Madison Ave. and in 1980 to 41 E. 78th St.
Although he exhibited paintings, drawings and sculpture, prints
remained his main focus. Over the years he had exhibitions of
prints by Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard, Dubuffet, Miro, Escher and
Frank Stella. He closed the gallery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was an active member of the Art Dealers Association of
America, serving on its board of directors and exhibiting in its
annual Art Show at the Seventh Regiment Armory from its inception
in 1989 until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Carmen; a daughter, Audrey Liebman;
and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan.

EX-KNICK MASON IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT IN BAR   BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Mason, the former New York Knick, was charged
with assault early Saturday after he and a group of friends were
involved in a barroom brawl that left three people injured, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who has a criminal record for assault and other charges
in New York, was arrested with four friends at about 4:30 a.m.
Saturday in Harlem, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All five were charged with third-degree assault, said Officer
Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mason now plays for the Charlotte Hornets, who were in town to
play the New Jersey Nets on Saturday night at the Continental
Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that Mason might not appear
before a judge for arraignment until late Saturday night and that
it was unlikely he would be able to make his team's 7:30 p.m. game,
even if he was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Mason's friends _ William Leary, 26; Anthony
Kelly, 24; Mason's cousin, William Duggins, 26; and Paul Boling, 34
_ live in Queens, where Mason grew up. Mason now lives in North
Carolina. It was unclear if any of the five were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 33, got to the bar sometime after midnight, the police
said. The fight broke out around 4:20 a.m. after Mason and his
friends began arguing with three other patrons at Perks Bar, at the
corner of Manhattan Avenue and 123rd Street in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up the fight, the police took Mason and his
friends to a precinct about a block away. The three victims, all
men between 30 and 32, were taken to a hospital to be treated for
cuts, bruises and other injuries, law enforcement officials said.
Their names had not been released Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were available on what sparked the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the precinct Saturday, Don Cronson, Mason's lawyer and
agent, declined to comment other than to say that the charges and
the details were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lewis, 44, a longtime friend of Mason's who was at Perks at
the time of the fight, said that the basketball player was ``if
anything, trying to break up the fight'' that had started between
Duggins and one of the other men.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to get into the limo,'' Lewis said. ``Then a group
of about 25 people started jumping people, I got hit in the face, I
turned around and swung, then I got into the car. Mason went back
in to get my coat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason has had several run-ins with the law in New York. In 1998,
Mason and Duggins were charged with the third-degree rape of 14-
and 15-year-old girls at a party in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who admitted to consensual sex with the girls, pleaded
guilty to two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a
child. The Queens district attorney's office dropped the rape and
sexual abuse charges after DNA testing did not link Mason to the
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was ordered to do 200 hours of community service with the
homeless. Duggins pleaded guilty to statutory rape and to
endangering the welfare of a child and was sentenced to five years
of probation and 800 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the New York police charged Mason with gun possession
and he was sentenced to probation and community service.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, he was charged with assault, menacing and
resisting arrest after a fight with two New York police officers
over a summons. The police said it took 10 officers to subdue Mason
who is 6 foot 8 and 280 pounds. He pleaded guilty to disorderly
conduct and was sentenced to 120 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after he was charged in that case, Mason was
traded by the Knicks to Charlotte. Mason has played in the National
Basketball Association for 10 seasons, five with the Knicks.

   NEW YORK _ Carroll B. Cline, a lighting designer whose clients
included the Santa Fe Opera Theater in Santa Fe, N.M., the Norman
Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., and the lobby of 1251 Ave.
of the Americas, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Katherine D. Cline.
</P>
<P>
   Cline made glass walls glow, lighted floors from above so people
would want to walk from one place to another, and knew not to use
green translucent shades in people's homes. Green glass shades, he
said, made the rosiest complexion look sickly. Neither did he use
fluorescent light in kitchens because the light changed the color
of food, making liver, for example, look inedible.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants, he recommended candles on the tables, so people
could see each other's faces. When people see each other only in
silhouette, he said, they feel alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Cline, who was born in Richmond, Ind., was trained as an
architect at the Institute of Design of the Illinois Institute of
Technology, and worked for Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, the
Manhattan architectural firm. In 1962, Skidmore loaned Cline to one
of its clients, Edison Price, a lighting fixture manufacturer,
where Cline became not only a vice president but also a lighting
designer. Because of his architectural training, however, he was an
empathetic, although occasionally devious, collaborator with other
architects. When Cline worked with Robert A.M. Stern, the Manhattan
architect who is now dean of the Yale School of Architecture, in
designing the Ohrstrom Library at St. Paul's School in Concord,
N.H., in the late 1980s, Stern wanted the lighting to be hanging
pendants and table lamps. ``It was to evoke an old Ivy League
school library, but had to be energy efficient,'' said Francesca
Bettridge, a partner at Cline Bettridge Bernstein Lighting Design,
which Cline founded in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Cline wanted to use a new compact fluorescent bulb, but knew
Stern didn't like fluorescent light. So Cline and Bettridge made
two glass lamps, putting an incandescent bulb in one and a
fluorescent one in the other. But with the latter, they also
inserted a theatrical gel to alter the color. Asked to choose,
Stern picked the fluorescent one _ disguised as incandescent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very endearing, he was a curmudgeon, and he was the
most brilliant and creative lighting designer,'' said Paul Rosen, a
Manhattan architect who worked with Cline on renovating the lobby
at 1251 Avenue of the Americas in 1990. When different lighting
designers were asked how to light the stained glass frieze _
magentas, yellows and blues _ that runs 200 feet just inside the
glass exterior, 20 feet above the lobby floor, most of the
designers had elaborate solutions. Cline did not. He suggested
lighting the neutral white ceiling uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are outside, the ceiling will illuminate the glass
art,'' Rosen said. ``That to me was a sign of utter brilliance.''
He added, ``His solution was sort of underwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Cline was a tinkerer who took apart new sample light fixtures to
see how they worked. Once when a fixture arrived without any
explanation of how it was assembled, ``Carroll just sawed the
fixture in half,'' Bettridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Cline is survived by two children, Rachel K.
Cline of Brooklyn and Henry L. Cline of Manhattan, from his first
marriage, to Barbara Lovett. Other survivors include a twin sister,
Dorothy Yunghans of Pittman, N.J., and a brother, Alan Cline of
Sarasota, Fla. &QL;

ALBERT B. CLEAGE, BLACK NATIONALIST LEADER, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., S.C., Mo. Ind., Ga., Ky., Calif., Mass., Texas)  (EDS: This story will appear without a byline.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Albert B. Cleage, who after the urban riots of the 1960s
built his Detroit church, the Shrine of the Black Madonna, into an
important center for black theology and political power, died last
Sunday in Calhoun Falls, S.C. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage died while visiting Beulah Land, his church's new farm,
where he planned to raise food for the needy and give city youths
peaceful summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop, who changed his name in the early 1970s to Jaramogi
Abebe Agyeman, presided for more than three decades at the Shrine
of the Black Madonna, originally a Congregational church. The
change came in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There were other black secessionist churches, but Cleage's
became one of the biggest and most influential, emphasizing black
interpretations but retaining some traditional Protestant
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage was also drawn to politics. In 1973, Black Slate Inc.,
his political organization, helped Coleman A. Young become the
first black mayor of Detroit, and the bishop was important in the
careers of U.S. Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Democrat of
Michigan; former U. S. Rep. Barbara-Rose Collins; and blacks who
ran for smaller offices, like city council and school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me the importance of organizing,'' Kilpatrick said,
``and he created networks of political activists that continue to
have a profound impact on Detroit's political landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleage became a focus of national attention during the 1967
Detroit riot, when 43 people were killed, and in the turbulent
years afterward. Splitting with both the white power structure and
more moderate black leaders, he emphasized black separatism in
economics, politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem facing black people is their
powerlessness,'' he said. ``You can't integrate power and
powerlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter what he saw as white domination of religion,
Cleage espoused a gospel of black nationalism. He installed a
larger-than-life painting of a black Madonna holding a black baby
Jesus, radical for its time, and preached that Jesus was a black
revolutionary whose identity as such had been obscured by whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning of a whole new religious iconography,''
said Menelik Kimathi, chief executive officer of the Shrine of the
Black Madonna. Kimathi, who joined a shrine youth group 30 years
ago, added, ``I think his legacy will be that he founded black
liberation theology, the idea that the church could be more
relevant to the day-to-day concerns of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jim Holley, pastor of Little Rock Baptist Church in
Detroit, said: ``He brought a black consciousness to the church
community like it never had been brought before. And it translated
into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Life magazine called Cleage one of ``the men who are
speaking to black America,'' along with Jesse Jackson, Julian Bond,
Eldridge Cleaver and Dick Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop was national chairman of the Black Christian
Nationalist Church, an umbrella organization for similar churches,
and he wrote ``The Black Messiah'' (1969) and ``Black Christian
Nationalism'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   Albert Cleage was born in Indianapolis on June 13, 1911. His
father, a physician, moved the family to Detroit, and in 1937, the
son received a sociology degree from Wayne State University. He
received a divinity degree from Oberlin College, then served
churches in Lexington, Ky.; San Francisco; and Springfield, Mass.
In 1951, he became pastor of St. Mark's Community Church in
Detroit, and two years later, he formed the Central United Church
of Christ, which later became the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was at first a believer in integration _ some of the
churches he served were racially mixed _ Cleage came to despair of
the hope that whites would ever willingly help blacks advance. He
also became friends with Malcolm X, the Muslim leader, who had
Michigan roots.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage's vision of a church emphasized social service programs,
reached out to young people and marched for civil rights. He
organized black-owned businesses like grocery stores and
bookstores, and built hundreds of units of housing.
</P>
<P>
   All this activity made him frightening to many whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take over, don't worry,'' he once responded. ``We'll
treat you like you treated us.''
</P>
<P>
   He later founded other shrines, including major ones in Atlanta
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kimathi said, the church has about 50,000 members
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Cleage backed out of the national spotlight to
concentrate more on church programs and working with youths. In the
late 1980s and much of the 1990s, he lived in Houston, then
returned to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage married Doris Graham in 1943; they divorced in 1955. His
survivors include their two daughters, Pearl Cleage of Atlanta and
Kristin Williams of Idlewild, Mich.; three sisters; a brother; six
grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

 &HT;    Bull's eye no longer

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the weird sights in the NBA, nothing was more
awkward than John Starks in a Chicago Bulls uniform. Outside of the
cow that kicked over the lantern, hardly anyone was more despised
there than the fiery Starks.
</P>
<P>
   The former Knicks guard _ traded from Golden State to the Bulls
Feb. 16 in the three-team deal that shipped Toni Kukoc to
Philadelphia _ gained the city's disdain by doing something few
did: He physically challenged Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   During the heated Knicks-Bulls rivalry of the
early-to-mid-1990s, Starks repeatedly lost the one-on-one battle
with Jordan, but not because he backed down. Rather, he challenged
Jordan at every turn. And in a 1993 playoff game, when he said
Jordan used elbows on him, Starks went ballistic in Chicago
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to fight Jordan and was held back by teammates as he
charged toward His Airness. The sellout crowd looked on in horror.
Starks got ejected. Afterward, he said: ``I don't care who he is.
You elbow me, I'm not going to take it. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, Starks was roundly booed and cursed _ and even
objects were thrown at him _ each time he touched the ball in a
game at Chicago. Interestingly, Starks gained Jordan's respect for
his toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Starks is with the Bulls. And just to show how fickle fans
are, a sold-out crowd at the United Center chanted ``We want
Starks!'' during the fourth quarter of a 85-81 loss to the
Grizzlies Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' said Starks, who had 17 points off the bench.
``Whenever you come into a situation like this, you don't know what
to expect. But when you go out there and you play well, that
changes people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Elton Brand said, ``It shows that Chicago appreciates a
hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   And so do the players. ``I think they have accepted him,''
Chicago coach Tim Floyd said. ``When you got good guys, they'll
accept Atilla the Hun. Of course, in John's case, he's not Atilla
the Hun, in spite of what some people will want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks said all the right things after the trade, but he was not
happy. First of all, he was informed about the deal by a reporter.
Secondly, he had asked the Warriors to send him to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common courtesy to give me a call, first and
foremost, and let me know what was going down,'' he said. ``Right
now, I'm at a point in my career where I want to be in contention
to win a title.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he was not sent to Miami, which would have reunited him
with coach Pat Riley, or another contender by Thursday's trade
deadline, Starks will have to wait until the offseason to hope for
a trade that will make him happy. In the meantime, he'll do what
he's always done: play with fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I got some good basketball left in me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Brief, decisive courtship put newcomers in Falcons fold
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The way Ashley Ambrose and Shawn Jefferson planned it,
Friday, Feb. 11, was supposed to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Atlanta Falcons got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Almost before anyone could say, ``It's the first day of the
NFL's free-agency period,'' Ambrose, a cornerback, skipped his
flight from New Orleans to Cincinnati for a friend's wedding, and
flew to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, both men were off the unemployment line. They
agreed to contracts with the Falcons. Jefferson, a wide receiver,
did it without setting foot in Georgia. Ambrose arrived in town
Saturday, and got so lost that he ended up at the Georgia World
Congress Center looking for team headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday also began oddly for Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sleeping, and (Falcons vice president for pro personnel)
Ron Hill called and woke me up,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said, ``I said, `Get on the phone and call your dog and do
some recruiting,'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog'' is what Buchanan calls his best friend, Ambrose, and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons always acted as decisively as they did Feb. 11,
they probably would have more than eight winning seasons in 34.
</P>
<P>
   Their race to keep Ambrose and Jefferson off the open market
began about 7 a.m., when the telephone of Ambrose's agent, Kennard
McGuire, rang in the dark near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know we were very serious,'' general manager Harold
Richardson said. ``I waited to call Jefferson's (agent, Gary
Uberstine), because he's in California. I still woke him up.''
</P>
<P>
   For a change, the Falcons had generous room under the salary
cap, about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   And they had some glaring needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be satisfied taking any one of, say, four
cornerbacks, you're not going to spend as much as if you target one
guy and go forward with it,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would use the word 'fun.' It's the same . .
. as before a game. There's emotion, tension, anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   SECOND TIME'S A CHARM
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons tried to sign Ambrose, 29, in 1999, after he left
the Bengals as a free agent. They didn't have enough money. Ambrose
ended up playing for his hometown Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But New Orleans didn't pick up the option on Ambrose's contract,
even though he had an outstanding season, because it called for
more than $5 million in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   That Friday, Ambrose, wife Monica and 15-month-old daughter
Aisha were getting ready to travel to Cincinnati for a Sunday
wedding of a former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent called and said I had a flight to Atlanta,'' Ambrose
said. ``He said we got a chance to get a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray called right after that. Ray is crazy. He was so excited.
He started doing a rap song, throwing down a beat, `Boom, cha-cha,
my boyz coming to town, I hope he signs, we gonna get down, boom,
cha-cha.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose's wife and daughter went to Cincinnati. He went to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and McGuire went to work. ``My agent told me some
numbers, and before I even left the (Atlanta) airport, I knew I was
going to be a Falcon,'' Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
   The basics of a five-year, $22.5 million contract, including a
$7.5 million guaranteed signing bonus had been agreed upon. As
Ambrose left the Atlanta airport in a car with Falcons pro
personnel assistant Les Snead. A physical, formalities and food
were all that remained. Ambrose's wife arrived Saturday morning
from Cincinnati. He signed the contract, and the Falcons held a
news conference at 10 a.m. Saturday.THE RUN-AROUND
</P>
<P>
   That Friday, when Richardson and Hill weren't on the phone with
McGuire, they usually were on the phone with Uberstine, Jefferson's
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for the former San Diego and New England wide receiver
_ for four years, $14.2 million and a $4.5 million signing bonus _
was worked out quickly, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call on Friday morning, (from) my agent,'' Jefferson
said. ``He said Atlanta was interested. I said, `Man. Wow! Are they
seriously interested? That would be a great fit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is co-owner of the `Any Occasion Catering Company' in
Marietta, an Atlanta suburb. Atlanta also is close to Jacksonville,
where Jefferson and his wife, Marla, grew up and live in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Uberstine) called back and said,' Shawn, they want you,''
said Jefferson, who has played for the Chargers and most recently
the Patriots. `` `I'm telling you, they want you.' I said, `Work it
out. Don't take any more calls. This is where I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson went to pick up his son, Shawn Jr., 3, from preschool,
and his daughter, Paige, 7, from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my way, (Uberstine) called on a cell phone. He said the way
it stands now, you're a Falcon,'' Jefferson said. ``Then, my
daughter said, `When are we moving?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson wanted to drive to Atlanta. His wife persuaded him to
take a Saturday-morning flight.
</P>
<P>
   Snead and Falcons officials were at Ambrose's news conference
about the time Jefferson's flight landed.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jeffersons took a cab. Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn was so late,'' Reeves said. ``We kept waiting and
waiting. I try never to get excited until they're signed, because
so many times we've thought we had somebody and ended up
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson didn't change his mind. He was losing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the cab driver to take me to the Falcons headquarters,
and he took me to the Georgia Dome,'' Jefferson said. ``They had
that big sports show (the Super Show) next door. They kept saying,
`I don't see a name tag; you can't come in here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm trying to find the Atlanta Falcons office.' They
said, `They're closed on Saturdays.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Jefferson called Richardson, and the Snead shuttle was
dispatched. Another physical. Another contract signed. Another news
conference.NOT DONE YET
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are about $1.4 million to $2 million under the
salary cap and have needs on the offensive line, running back,
linebacker, the secondary and, many would say, at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in free-agency . . . takes a little pressure off
the draft,'' Hill said. ``It's not going to happen like this every
year. You're not always going to get the guys you pinpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson and Ambrose have met their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Saturday) night, we . . . stayed up all night talking
about it,'' Jefferson said. ``Man, the Atlanta Falcons. I am so
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose isn't exactly bumming, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still got a chance to be at the wedding in Cincinnati,'' he
said. ``We went Saturday night. I just showed up with a little more
money in my pocket.''

 &HT;    League's two messages
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Eighteen years ago, long before Wayne
Gretzky was gift-wrapped by the Edmonton Oilers and sent to Los
Angeles, a journeyman player gave hockey unforeseen exposure in
Southern California. Paul Mulvey made national news by refusing an
order by then-Kings coach Don Perry _ ``Go out there and don't just
dance.'' Translation: Start a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mulvey nor Perry were long for the NHL. Neither survived
as long as the black eye suffered by the league, which continues to
both embrace violence when it is deemed to be under control and
react with horror when something awful happens, meaning something
that gets hockey on network news.
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction was evident again last week after Boston's
Marty McSorley clubbed Vancouver's Donald Brashear in the head with
his stick. McSorley has received an open-ended suspension and must
seek permission from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman if he wants to
play next season. Brashear has a grade 3 concussion and might not
make it back this season.
</P>
<P>
   What has been overshadowed is that both players _ either
``enforcers'' or ``goons,'' depending on your perspective _ were
put on the ice by their coaches in the final seconds of a game that
had been decided. The league finds no problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has made progress in curbing violence. Fighting is down
and more suspensions are handed out for severe penalties,
particularly involving shots to the head. But the league believes
that fighting is part of the game and finds no connection between
two players brawling and such acts as that of McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that violence is violence. If NHL owners really
wanted to end it, the league would hand out automatic ejections for
fighting and severe stick penalties. Owners and coaches would get
stiff fines. The NHL hasn't done it because speed and violence make
a lovely marketing pair. The negative side is the occasional
incident like the one Monday in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people waving the flag that our sport has
crossed the line,'' league vice president Colin Campbell said. ``It
was an isolated incident. We don't like what happened, and we don't
like that it's on the national news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be grossly unfair to suggest that his conduct is at
all representative of the game, of the other 700 players who play
in the NHL,'' Campbell said. ``We regret that this act occurred and
that it has brought this kind of attention to our game. This is not
how we want hockey portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But they can't have it both ways.

 &HT;    Firms have upper hand in use of tracking stocks
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of tracking stocks, as a separate kind of
security, makes a lot of sense to companies _ but has run into
drawbacks with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant in concept, the tracking stock is tied to a portion of
the company's business, usually a showy business line that stands
out from the rest of the products or services. The idea is to catch
the eye of investors who might not otherwise pay attention and to
raise capital in greater amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems especially appropriate for utilities or companies
in basic materials _ companies that do good work day in and out but
normally lack the drama of other companies that are more often in
the news.
</P>
<P>
   That's why BellSouth is inclined toward a version of the tracker
stock, perhaps an issue tied to growing international business
and/or wireless communication, areas that can claim more growth
than most other product lines within the giant company.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific has already issued a tracker stock for its
timber line of business.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the tracker stock is that it should create
some buzz and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stocks, which sometimes are given to existing
shareholders or sold separately, are supposed to reflect the happy
developments in the tracked business. This is assisted by issuing
separate revenue and earnings statements reflecting what's going on
in those businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems that have arisen are predictable. Creating the
ideal tracker stock is not unlike picking winners on Wall Street,
or timing the market. It simply isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   How was Georgia-Pacific to know that its nice timber stock would
get upstaged by a nice upswing in paper, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the market becomes leery of the decision to track one
activity but not others, or investors get confused and decide to
back away from the securities in that company until they figure it
out _ which may take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   What about the proceeds corralled by sale of tracker stocks?
Often they are plowed back into support for the company at large,
not necessarily the glamour activity.
</P>
<P>
   With tracker stocks, there isn't the tidy closed relationship
between capital, investment and management strategies investors are
accustomed to expect in traditional investments or plays.
</P>
<P>
   As one analyst put it, ``Tracker stocks are a good idea for
companies, not so good for investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific has tried to do some extra things to create the
right environment and feedback relationship between the tracked
unit and the investors. As market capitalization grows in Timber
Co., the tracked business line, it will give greater voice to
holders of the tracker stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Haldin, a spokesman for Georgia-Pacific, says that the
timber stock, launched in late 1997, has done pretty much what the
company desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has allowed investors to measure timber industry activity
against other timber business, apart from all the other parts of
the timber products business,'' Haldin said, ``and to that extent
it has been a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that is a better measure of the success of the
tracker stock than how it stacks up against other tracking
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is some confusion and resistance to tracker
stocks in some quarters, companies are probably going to stick with
the new strategy, at least for a while, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new stocks do, after all, bring in some new capital. They
are also an additional potential benefit and stock option to be
dangled in front of prized employees or managers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders if the tracking trend does not weaken the
wholesome idea of diversity in a company.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a teacher, for instance, it would be hard to
entertain the idea of removing from your class the most brilliant
students so they could go into a fast track of study, leaving you
with only the plodding students.
</P>
<P>
   The magic of the mix could be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, however, anything, even a gimmick, might serve a
decent purpose if it helps to focus new attention on companies,
especially the old-line companies that are sometimes pushed out of
the limelight by the glamour players in the new economy.

A WOMEN'S PRO SOCCER LEAGUE REQUIRES A KICK-START  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Nancy Lieberman-Cline is the president of the Women's Sports
Foundation and general manager and head coach of the Detroit
Shock.)  
 By NANCY LIEBERMAN-CLINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. national women's soccer team won the 1999
Women's World Cup, there has been talk of the establishment of a
women's professional soccer league. Lots of talk, and finally some
action.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, John Hendricks, the chairman and chief
executive officer of Discovery Communications, announced plans to
form the Women's United Soccer Association, with play starting in
the spring of 2001. But will his initiative win approval from the
U.S. Soccer Federation, which governs the sport in this country?
There is no guarantee of that.
</P>
<P>
   The men's league, Major League Soccer, also has a business plan
that includes the option of a partnership between MLS and a women's
league. Many people interpret this as an indication that MLS is
seeking to control the development of a women's league to prevent
competition with its sponsorships. Thus, the female players have
not demonstrated much excitement over the MLS marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the success of professional team sports have
depended on four factors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wealthy individuals who ante up franchise fees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cities that offer arenas and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   _ An experienced and savvy direct-marketing machine in each
franchise city.
</P>
<P>
   _ A central league office that can deliver a stable, long-term
and lucrative television contract and strategic leadership that
prevents weak franchises from dragging down the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The team sports that do not make it fail from lack of any one of
these factors.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular thought, player salaries do not make or
break the model. Negotiations with players actually result in
players receiving a reasonable percent of total revenue, even if
the multimillion-dollar figure for some individuals appears
unreasonable to some fans and observers. Those skyscraper salaries
would not exist if the revenues were not there.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendricks group appears to have only one of the
prerequisites in place: the deep pockets of initial investors. A
minimum of $40 million is to be provided by the initial investors
to finance a minimum of eight teams, plus league administration,
during the first five years of operations. The cast of investors is
impressive: a former chairman of Continental Cablevision, Amos
Hostetter Jr.; the chairman of Cox Enterprises, James Kennedy; the
president of Cox Communications, James Robbins; the president of
Comcast Corp., Brian L. Roberts; the vice president for programming
investments of Comcast Corp., Amy Banse; the chairman and chief
executive officer of Time Warner Cable, Joseph J. Collins; and the
senior vice president for programming of Time Warner Cable, Fred M.
Dressler.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan, each investor will be responsible for staff and
facility resources along with TV and promotional support for the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Herein lie the concerns. A developing franchise needs a
passionate, tireless staff that is focused on one goal: making the
local franchise successful in terms of season ticket sales and
walk-up sales.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the MLS to start the league might be a crucial error.
You cannot take a staff that is struggling to develop the men's
league and tell its members they need to approach a women's product
with the same effort and enthusiasm. The Women's National
Basketball Association started out with an assumption that the NBA
staff would do the women's league too, but it is moving away from
that. The women's soccer league needs to be built from the grass
roots, and each franchise needs an experienced team devoted to
developing one product.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more ingredient in the success of a team sport or
any professional league that cannot be underestimated: the passion
and business acumen of a single individual who can make all the
pieces come together during the league's initial years. The former
U.S. women's coach Tony DiCicco has been talked about as the
commissioner and the former SFX executive Lee Burke has been
mentioned as assisting in the formation of the Hendricks group
league. The credentials of whoever will lead the central office is
a make or break decision.
</P>
<P>
   It took vision and hard-nosed business skill to get past
critical periods in the NCAA (Walter Byers), the NBA (David Stern),
the NFL (Pete Rozelle) and other successful leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the current economic climate, strong central administration
is essential. A new league must have an integrated marketing and
advertising strategy and campaign. There has to be centralized
control that will not allow a franchise to fail. There is no time
and no financial buffer to learn from mistakes. Is Burke or DiCicco
the brilliant marketing or management strategist who will fill this
leadership need?
</P>
<P>
   Local television is a nice addition to the national league
package but will not replace a major cable or broadcast carrier
deal. The Hendricks group reportedly expects significant rights
fees for the league television package. That might not be
realistic. Even David Stern had to buy time for the WNBA Chances
are that the Hendricks group will not be able to get any rights
fees for the kind of coverage it wants and needs. The Women's
United Soccer Association may have investors with potential cable
television and promotional reach, but that potential must be
translated into a reality that will benefit all franchise markets.
</P>
<P>
   Does central ownership of a league help, as in the league model
developed by the now-defunct women's American Basketball League and
nicely executed by the WNBA? Definitely; especially at the start-up
stage when consolidation of costs and central management of
promotions results in financial efficiencies. The WNBA had a
particular advantage by having a big-brother pro team system in
place and lots of muscle _ the leverage of the imminent renewal of
the NBA television contract _ to deliver the TV piece of the
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of naysayers have suggested that there is not a strong
enough market for women's pro soccer and that it needs to have a
significant mass participation base and a successful collegiate
Final Four before launching a pro league. Tell that to the NHL or
the Miami or Dallas NHL franchises. The market is there for women's
soccer. What is needed are the leadership, marketing, investment
and television pieces to exploit it.

   NABATIYEH, Lebanon _ Hidar Madloum is ready to die in his fight
against Israel, but that's not the only reason for his army's
success.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 years with the Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas, he has
witnessed advances that make the small force a surprisingly tough
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very beginning, the training was not based on
precision. Now, we see the latest technology,'' Madloum, a
soft-spoken, but intense war veteran said in an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of firing rockets from our shoulders, we can maneuver
them from a distance,'' says Madloum, 28, pantomiming remote
controls with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Madloum's Hezbollah appears to be on the verge of driving Israel
out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the rugged mountains of south Lebanon, guerrillas like
Madloum have matched a superior force with self-sacrifice,
adaptability and a keen use of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   They move low in the valleys, wait in ambush and cull
information from supportive villagers. They watch videotapes of
their attacks to improve their methods and use the same videos to
torment the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis are losing a guerrilla war and losing it pretty
clearly,'' said Bard O'Neill, an expert on the Middle East at the
National War College in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied a portion of south Lebanon since 1982. It
took the land to chase out PLO fighters. They left, but Israel
stayed and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Party of God, formed in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis fear that Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran,
will attack Israel if allowed to approach the border.
</P>
<P>
   But, opposition to what some call ``Israel's Vietnam'' is
increasing. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promises to withdraw
the troops this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, it could not happen soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   This month, shortly after Israeli leaders touted months without
a loss, Hezbollah killed seven Israelis in just over a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   In one attack, Hezbollah apparently fired an American-made TOW
guided missile _ new to its arsenal _ at a slit in a reinforced
Israeli bunker.
</P>
<P>
   In another, they lead Israelis into a classic guerrilla trap.
They injured several with a hidden roadside bomb, then shelled to
kill a medic who responded.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the Israelis have been slow to grasp that they are
fighting skilled guerrillas, not just ``terrorists.'' Just about
everything, he said, is in Hezbollah's favor _ rough terrain, a
supportive public and the will to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors counter Israel's formidable air force and the
billions of dollars it spends on its army _ including about $2
billion a year from the United States. Israel reportedly has 1,000
to 1,500 troops in southern Lebanon, plus about 2,000 in the local,
Israeli-paid, South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hezbollah's war chest comprises mostly an estimated
$100 million a year from Iran. Some of that goes to a system of
schools and hospitals, and a political party.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated to have 500 to 1,000 full-time fighters and more
part-timers culled from the countryside of rocky, terraced hills
and olive orchards. About 100,000 Lebanese live in the occupied
area.
</P>
<P>
   True, Hezbollah's casualties are higher than Israel's _ about
1,400 compared to Israel's approximately 260 battlefield deaths.
But, Israeli parents worry that their sons might die in vain before
an eventual withdrawal. The guerrillas die readily for their land
and Shiite Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
   Fighter Madloum took shrapnel in his skull last year. He still
has headaches, but he is back fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nabatiyeh, a farming town of about 70,000 that sits just
outside the Israeli-occupied area and below two Israeli hilltop
forts, he talks to Cox Newspapers last week. Dressed in a dark
anorak coat and black jeans, Madloum spoke of his pleasure at his
near death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martyrdom, for us, is victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not disclose his guerrilla specialties, but said his
part-time job as an engineering firm's mapmaker has helped him in
battlefield reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that Hezbollah studies America's weaknesses in
Vietnam and the Soviet Union's defeat in Afghanistan. Commanders,
he said, watch Hezbollah battle videotapes to correct mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is elusive. Fighters wear civilian clothes when not
fighting. They keep few or no fixed camps. Madloum, for instance,
asked that the precise location of this downtown interview not be
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Timur Goksel, senior advisor to the U.N. forces monitoring the
war, says Hezbollah shows a ``natural evolution.'' A process of
trial-and-error costs lives, but keeps pace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Israel began tracking the wires on Hezbollah's
roadside bombs, so Hezbollah began detonating them with radio
signals. Israel intercepted the signals, so Hezbollah scrambled
them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel's natural strength, air power, is limited by
the conventions of modern war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Israel launched a massive air and artillery barrage
against civilian targets. It prompted international outrage and
lead to new rules aimed at keeping civilians out of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is supposed to stay away from civilian areas, too, but
that is hard to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Near Nabatiyeh, an elderly couple lives about a half-mile away
from a hilltop Israeli outpost _ a fortified mound with lights and
fencing.
</P>
<P>
   They are tired of their home being pocked by Israeli shrapnel
and machine guns, but stay to show their determination. They say
villagers inform Hezbollah when Israelis might head toward the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are resistance,'' said 65-year-old Samiha Homani
Kallas, ``the men, women, children, houses, animals and trees.''
</P>
<P>
   (Optional end)
</P>
<P>
   And, in case Hezbollah's successes go unnoticed, it uses videos.
The results in Israel are reminiscent of the coverage that hastened
the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Ra'ad, a Hezbollah member of the Lebanese parliament,
said Hezbollah announces battlefield victories in hopes that
Israeli military sources will deny them. Then, Hezbollah will
release the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dragged the enemy into a kind of press trap,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity also strengthens Lebanese resolve.
</P>
<P>
   A Beirut exhibition this month featured battle videos. One was
called ``Screaming Israelis,'' showing Israeli troops writhing in
pain after a roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has proven that the Israeli soldier can be killed,'' Ra'ad
said. ``The image of the Israeli army is legendary. But now, if you
ask any child in south Lebanon, he will say he can kill Israeli
troops.''
</P>

 &HT;    Let freedom ring on the mountain
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ The granite dome of Stone Mountain isn't
from the center of Stone Mountain Village, but its presence loomed
over Saturday's unveiling of a Freedom Bell dedicated to the memory
of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is where the Ku Klux Klan reorganized at the
beginning of the 20th century. King used it as a symbol of racism
in his ``I Have A Dream'' speech in 1963, declaring, ``Let freedom
ring from Stone Mountain, Ga.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell did indeed ring Saturday in the town that Mayor Chuck
Burris called ``a symbol of progress and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris, elected in 1997, is Stone Mountain's first
African-American mayor. Its six-member City Council has several
African-American members. And the crowd of about 500 who came to
hear the bell rung for the first time was racially mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone Mountain got a bad name because of the Klan, but the
town was never a part of that,'' said Hugh Jordan, former chairman
of the state Legislature's Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Overview Committee, the precursor to MARTA, the current
metropolitan area transportation system. Jordan was born 79 years
ago in a house 500 yards from site of the ceremony on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The races have always gotten along here, that's why you see so
many blacks on our city council,'' he said. ``(Councilman) Robert
Smith has served on it for 25 or 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Georgia State flag flying overhead, Burris introduced
visiting officials, including the consuls of Nigeria and Barbados,
Attorney General Thurbert Baker and the county's CEO, Liane
Levitan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers was Brenda Cornelius, director of community
affairs for Governor Roy Barnes, who read a message from the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far we've come in a city where once the KKK marched with
impunity,'' Barnes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan reminisced about her first days as an Austrian immigrant
in Georgia, when she was not allowed to ride in the back of a bus
because blacks were relegated to those seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not understand,'' Levitan said. ``Change can be slow in
coming, but it happens for those who refuse to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president emeritus of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, also spoke to the crowd,
impressing a visitor from Charlotte who happened upon the ceremony
while his wife was shopping in the stores along Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice ceremony. I got here about the time Rev. Lowery
began speaking and I really enjoyed him,'' Larry Eaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Council members gathered to pull the burgundy velvet drape from
the 1,700-pound bell. Set on a granite slab in the center of the
village and burnished to a golden glow, the bell rang out to cheers
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Bell was rescued from a church in a Pennsylvania
coal mining town that had to be abandoned because of fires in the
mines below it. It is more than 100 years old and larger by one
inch than the Liberty Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very significant. It shows that unity is
coming to Stone Mountain and to the entire country. It's long
overdue,'' said Anthony Byrd, who attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mom Shirley Byrd agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm a part of making history today. It's
wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bell will be tolled annually at noon on King's birthday
holiday, said Burris.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sure we will think of other occasions to ring it
too,'' he said.

the free-agent signing period and used fellow cornerback Ray
Buchanan to help recruit him. A behind-the-scenes look at why the

MASON FACING ASSAULT CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MASON-ARRESTED) 
(nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Running through drills at their
shoot-around Saturday morning, the Charlotte Hornets appeared no
different than any other team on any other day. And perhaps, more
than any other team, they could handle the latest development
without flinching.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets arrived at Continental Airlines Arena before 10
a.m., receiving the news from coach Paul Silas that forward Anthony
Mason was in a Manhattan jail cell, facing assault charges and an
uncertain future. Mason, along with his cousin and three friends,
were arrested outside Perks Bar in Harlem at 4:30 a.m., following a
fight that left three other men hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of difficult moments for the team,
the most visible of which was the Jan. 12 automobile accident that
claimed the life of forward Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the season started, Derrick Coleman wrecked his
Range Rover on Oct. 27 in an accident that left his teammate
Eldridge Recasner with a collapsed lung. Coleman was charged with
drunk driving, but was later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Recasner later was charged with fourth-degree assault at a
Seattle airport ticket counter after his sister and mother were
involved in a car accident and, believing that his sister might not
survive, he snapped at an airport employee.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Hornets' owner, George Shinn, has had his share of
trouble. Shinn was sued on a charge of sexual assault. He was found
not liable in a sordid trial, and two weeks afterward, the woman's
husband committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Silas said. ``But we've come through all
adversity, so another episode doesn't really bother us that much.
We keep rolling. I expect a lot out of them and they expect a lot
out of themselves and we will not falter. Whatever it takes we're
going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman could only shake his head at the news. Despite his own
history of troubles, he has endured and has been playing the best
ball of his career. As he bounced his 3-year-old son, Derrick Jr.,
on his lap, Coleman struggled to explain how the team has still
managed a 30-23 record through the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything that we've been through this year, we've
managed to stick together as a team and that's helped all of us
through it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Mason in particular, Coleman said: ``We're more concerned
about his well-being than anything. We just hope that we can get
him here in time to play the basketball game and he can worry about
that other stuff later on.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of Mason's arrest filtered in, at the Nets' practice
site, Kendall Gill spoke of how an athlete is often placed in
difficult situations. But he said athletes have to be aware of that
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get angry when I see something like Darryl Strawberry
failing another drug test because I idolized him when I was growing
up,'' Gill said. ``To see him have so many opportunities and keep
doing it after it he gets chance after chance, you can't feel sorry
for the guy anymore if trouble keeps following him. Maybe trouble's
not following him. Maybe he's looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mase's situation, I wasn't there, but you hate to see
somebody keep getting in trouble with the law like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gill admitted that it's sometimes hard to walk away when
confronted with situations as an almost everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful when you go into bars, grocery stores,
even when you walk along the street,'' Gill said. ``You never know
when somebody is going to come up and try to start something with
you, say something smart. We're all human beings. You don't like
anybody to say negative to you. Professional athletes,
entertainers, we're targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've walked away sometimes and I've gotten into a brawl or
two. It happens all the time. That's why you see Shaquille O'Neal
taking a bodyguard with him. You have to guard yourself against it.
It's unfortunate it has to be like that, but that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even repeat what people say to you, in the club, on
the street,'' he added. ``Fans may be mad because you missed a shot
or you missed a rebound or they're just plain jealous. A lot of
people think when you make it to the top all your problems
disappear. They actually increase. When you know that you can
better deal with it.'' &QL;

DAN CLEMENTE'S   QUICK RETURN   LIFTS HARVARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Life could not have been better for Dan Clemente last
November.
</P>
<P>
   As the starting power forward on the Harvard men's basketball
team, the 6-foot-6-inch Clemente was a steady contributor as the
Crimson started out with a 3-1 record. Harvard was poised to make a
run at the Ivy League title.
</P>
<P>
   But then Clemente began to lose focus, literally. He first
experienced impaired vision in his right eye in early December.
Initially, the problem did not affect his performance as he shot 7
for 11 and was 4 for 6 from 3-point range in scoring 24 points
against Navy on Dec. 4 in an 85-83 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision in my right eye was very blurry,'' Clemente said.
``I did not think it was a major problem; I thought maybe I needed
a new prescription for my contact lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The blurring persisted, and after a dismal 6-point performance
in a 58-57 loss to Boston University on Dec. 7, Clemente sought
medical attention. ``My optometrist could not figure out what was
causing the blurring, so he referred me to a specialist,'' Clemente
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a consultation with Dr. Jeffrey Heier of the Boston Eye
Institute, Clemente was informed that his retina was detached in
his right eye, severely damaging his central vision. If left
unattended, the eye could go completely blind. Clemente needed
emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Heier said the injury most likely occurred when Clemente took a
hard hit to the head, but Clemente does not recall a specific
incident. ``I get hit hard in the head three times a day during
practice and in the games,'' Clemente said. ``It could have
happened at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente underwent surgery on Dec. 10, two days after his visit
to the doctor. The healing process was a difficult one, as was the
realization that he might never play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have spoken to literally 10 doctors all over the
country who said there was no way Dan would be able to play,'' said
Clemente's father, Brian. ``He was very depressed by this, but we
tried to remind him that this is not the end of his life. He was
determined to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dan Clemente was told he would have to sit out three
to four months before being re-evaluated. Since he had already
played 21 percent of Harvard's schedule, Clemente could not be
designated a redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever really thought there was a chance that I could be
back this season,'' he said. ``I told the coaches that I would be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente's retina healed nicely. He was cleared to play Feb. 1,
and started practicing the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing Clemente's vulnerability to another eye injury,
Harvard's trainer, Gary Gisler, contacted the Boston Celtics'
trainer, Ed Lacerte, and inquired about a pair of protective
goggles.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game back Feb. 4, a 67-57 victory over Cornell,
Clemente shot 9 for 19 from the floor (4 of 7 from 3-point range),
scoring 24 points. In the five games since, he has averaged 15
points a game on 44 percent shooting for the Crimson (10-14 over
all and 5-6 in the Ivy League). Going into Friday night's loss to
Princeton, Clemente, who missed 11 games with the injury, was
leading the league in scoring (19.1 points a game) even though he
had not played enough games to qualify for the scoring title.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente's coach, Frank Sullivan, said: ``It is lucky for a
coach to have his best players as the hardest workers. And he
definitely personifies that. When he was injured, Dan did whatever
possible to keep in good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan admitted that he is concerned about the possibility of
Clemente reinjuring his retina, but reassurances from doctors and
the protective goggles have eased his worries.
</P>
<P>
   The eye injury is not the first time in his Crimson career that
Clemente has shown resilience. Before last season, as a sophomore,
Clemente experienced chronic ankle pain. After talking to the
team's trainers, the consensus was that he did not need surgery. He
could play through the pain without causing permanent damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, however, wanted to hold Clemente out of the opener
last season against Boston College to give him more time to heal.
But Clemente finally persuaded Sullivan to put him in down the
stretch. In the final four minutes, he made two 3-pointers to spark
the Crimson to a 62-61 victory. &QL;

POPE VISITS MOUNT SINAI AND ITS ORTHODOX MONASTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to add in 12th graf reference to the pope as `president of
the Roman Catholic Church.') 
(DW) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT SINAI, Egypt _ Saying he felt ``great joy and deep
emotion,'' Pope John Paul II prayed Saturday at the spot where
tradition says Moses once stood, and called himself a pilgrim ``in
the footsteps of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was a personal triumph for the 79-year-old pope who had
long dreamed of visiting the Holy Lands. But it was shadowed by
some disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who spoke at St. Catherine's, the monastery at the
foothills of Mount Sinai that is one of the most revered in the
Greek Orthodox Church, had once hoped to gather there Christian,
Muslim and Jewish leaders to symbolize reconciliation in the new
millennium. Objections by the Greek Orthodox monks, among others,
dashed that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Poignantly, the pope alluded to his unfulfilled dream.
Describing the wind from Mount Sinai as a sign from God, the pope
said, ``It carries an insistent invitation to dialogue between the
followers of the great monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope spoke to several hundred cheering believers who were
crammed in an olive grove on the monastery grounds. He was seated
underneath a tent beside a pink-budded almond tree, Mount Sinai's
jagged, rusty peaks at his back.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd shouted, ``John Paul II, we love you!'' so often that
the pope at one point replied, ``John Paul II loves you too.'' When
the crowd waved olive branches as he left, the pope waved back with
his cane.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prayer service, the pope toured the sixth century
monastery, asking questions about its icons and collection of
illuminated manuscripts _ the world's second largest after the
Vatican's.
</P>
<P>
   When Archbishop Damianos, abbot of the monastery, took him to
the chapel, which tradition says was built on top of the roots of
Moses' burning bush, the pope fell to his knees and prayed alone
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the relics of St. Catherine, a fourth century
Christian martyr, the pope, in an ancient ritual, took a ring,
placed it on the bones of her finger and skull and then kissed the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was the emotional high point of John Paul three-day
trip _ the first papal visit to Egypt ever. The pope, who looked
tired and weak during much of the journey, Saturday delivered his
speech in a clear, forceful voice.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Orthodox monks helped him down the steps to the podium,
but his spokesman said he needed no assistance to kneel at the site
of the burning bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Church does not recognize the authority of
the pope, and in his introductory re- marks, Damianos ad- dressed
the him as ``president of the Roman Catholic Church.'' Damianos
embraced the pope as he arrived, but he did not pray with him. ``It
is impossible, it is against our canon law,'' the archbishop
explained later. He said that, for his faith, unity between Roman
Catholics and Orthodox was ``possible, but it would take a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Theological differences got in the way of the desired ceremony
with Muslims and Jews. Greek Orthodox Christians are wary of
suggesting that all these religions are equal. Damianos also cited
political realities of the Middle East. ``Perhaps such dialogue
could be possible, but not in an Islamic country,'' he said. ``It
is very difficult because of the mentality of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican repeatedly described the pope's visit as a purely
personal pilgrimage, but inevitably political tensions surfaced
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope left Rome, the Vatican signed an agreement with
the Palestine Liberation Organization that guarantees Christian
property and legal rights in a future Palestinian state. It also
declared that any unilateral decision on the status of Jerusalem is
illegal and immoral.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement angered Israel, and while the pope was in Cairo,
Israeli religious leaders said they opposed his plan to hold a
Catholic service on a Saturday in Nazareth when he visits Israel
next month, suggesting that the necessary security arrangements
would violate the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, however, the pope focused intently on the Old
Testament, and savored his solemn private moments in the Sinai
Desert. There were a few distractions. As the pope's Mercedes drove
through the desolate desert canyon toward the monastery, a group of
young pilgrims from his native Poland waited on a rock on the other
side of the canyon, shouting and waving in his direction. The pope
waved at them as he drove by.

SFX IS TAKING STOCK OF SPORTS COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are SFX Entertainment, and you are dominating the world of
live entertainment. In three years, you have bought your way into
concert tours, touring Broadway shows and family entertainment. You
have shaken up an industry of small independent firms, consolidated
them and recast them as a behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do next? Which other fragmented industry will accept
your cash, your stock and your covetous appetite for growth?
</P>
<P>
   Sports.
</P>
<P>
   You snap up agencies that represent 16 percent of all major
league baseball players and 22 percent of all NBA players. You go
into business with Michael Jordan by acquiring the agent David
Falk's firm and wrest Andre Agassi away from his agents at the
International Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   You send the U.S. national women's soccer team on tour after it
wins the 1999 World Cup, and you offer to help finance a new arena
for the New York Islanders. You negotiate Kobe Bryant's purchase of
50 percent of Olimpia Milano, an Italian basketball team, and you
sign Florida State's Peter Warrick, who will be a top pick in the
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   You expand into professional figure skating championships, the
Internet, monster truck events, stadium and arena naming rights,
player endorsements, corporate sponsorships, film and television
production and financial management.
</P>
<P>
   You are big and brash. You have financed a broad swath of
entertainment and sports acquisitions with $2.2 billion in stock,
loans and debt. You have created a sports group that is a small but
high-profile part of the company, which generated $1.2 billion in
revenues through the first nine months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And you adopt a vision that accommodates your broad ambitions:
Sports and entertainment intersect like the loops of a cat's
cradle, where, with a critical mass of athletic humanity, you can
strike more deals generating more cash for the bottom line and
create events in which players can own equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're asked, `Who's your competition?' _ it's everyone
and no one,'' said Bill Allard, president of SFX Sports Group. ``In
each of our areas, we have competition, but the totality of it,
with what we offer sports- and entertainment-wise, nobody can
provide the kind of value we can.''
</P>
<P>
   SFX's rapid growth signifies the frenzy to combine product and
distribution in a global communications market increasingly
dominated by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything at SFX is, in theory, designed to interact in
the service of athletes, spectators, sponsors and corporate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is quite interested in one-stop shopping,''
said Dean Bonham, a sports marketer in Denver, ``to be able to go
to one place for an event, an athlete, an ad placement and a
sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   That scope attracted Agassi to SFX. He was unhappy with IMG for
not exploiting his personality and feats, especially after he won
the French Open in June. ``We did everything Andre wanted us to
do,'' said Bob Kain, executive vice president of IMG. ``But he said
it was time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi knew SFX through tournaments run by ProServ, which became
part of SFX last year when SFX acquired the Marquee Group,
ProServ's owner since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Blumberg, president of the SFX Sports talent division,
called Perry Rogers, Agassi's lawyer, last November. ``Would you
listen to what we're doing?'' Blumberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi jumped to SFX soon after, believing that its two-pronged
assault on sports and entertainment would benefit him more than
IMG, which had been the paradigm of broad-based sports marketing
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a meeting with SFX with Co. A may result in Deal
B,'' Rogers said. It is unlikely that Agassi wants to be a rock
singer or a Broadway star, but Rogers said Agassi was particularly
interested in SFX's plans for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Had SFX not existed, Rogers said, IMG would still have Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's defection shocked IMG. There has been speculation that
one of SFX's enticements to Agassi was stock worth at least $10
million, which SFX will not confirm or deny. Mark McCormack, IMG's
chairman, blasted SFX in The Sports Business Journal, a trade
newspaper, as a ``stock play,'' accused it of overpaying ``for
everything they have bought,'' and predicted it will sell out a
quick score.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, trading in SFX shares on the New York Stock Exchange
was halted briefly after a report that CBS wanted to buy into the
company. CBS denied it, but SFX stock closed up by $3.312 to
$35.125 a share.
</P>
<P>
   SFX Entertainment began to carry out its sports strategy in
1998, more than a year after being spun off from SFX Broadcasting
and beginning its entertainment-business buying spree. Robert F.X.
Sillerman, SFX's executive chairman, knew about the sports business
_ he co-founded and helped finance Marquee in 1995 with Bob
Gutkowski, a former chairman of Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we spun off from SFX, we had no conscious plan to move
into sports,'' said Mike Ferrel, president of SFX Entertainment.
``But as we aggregated our position in live entertainment, Goldman,
Sachs said they represented David Falk and would we talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   SFX paid Falk, whose clients include Jordan, Patrick Ewing and
Alonzo Mourning, $118 million in cash and stock plus incentives
worth $15 million. The price was rich but gave SFX instant access
to premier athletes, steady cash flow (except during last season's
NBA lockout) and the cachet of adding Air Jordan to the corporate
quiver.
</P>
<P>
   More purchases followed, focusing on agencies strong in baseball
(Hendricks Management and Speakers of Sport), and one with a dual
focus on baseball and basketball (Tellem &AMP; Associates). Marquee was
bought for $115.2 million in stock and assumed debt last year,
which led to Gutkowski's exit after a failed struggle against Falk
to run the SFX Sports Group. Falk is the chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've acquired all we need in basketball and baseball,''
Allard said. ``We're the best in the business.'' Football and
hockey agencies are on deck.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down the road pretty far on something,'' said Tom
Reich, a prominent baseball and hockey agent, who would not
identify his suitors. ``We're re-evaluating the landscape; we're
uncommitted. But it's clear that most people are going to have to
have an affiliation going forward. It's not a direction that will
be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   SFX is not alone in its sports strategy. Assante Corp., a
Winnipeg-based money management company, paid $120 million in cash
and stock for Steinberg, Moorad &AMP; Dunn, which represents Troy
Aikman and Steve Young, then bought Eugene Parker's
football-oriented agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merging to maximize your clout with the players you bring to
the table is a strong force in this business,'' Parker said. He
said Assante preserved his independence but that an SFX acquisition
would have ``felt like a forced fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Octagon, a division of Interpublic Group of Cos., owns a raft of
agencies, including the former Advantage International. ``We all
have a different slant to what we do,'' Frank Craighill, Octagon's
president, said. ``The world's big enough for all of us. To be
honest, I don't think SFX will control the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, SFX has not bought out Ralph Cindrich, a top football
agent. He represents 60 active players and likes his independence.
But he knows it will be difficult to compete against corporations
that can offer stock, cars, lines of credit and signing bonuses to
recruit clients. ``I don't view being acquired as inevitable,'' he
said, ``but almost everyone will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy and Alan Hendricks sold their baseball-based agency to SFX
last June for $15.7 million. Randy Hendricks said he did not sell
to move into easy retirement. ``We did well with a model that we
had for 30 years _ a boutique agency _ but to do the best job we
can, we were better off with SFX,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrel and Allard know they cannot dominate sports in the same
manner as they do live entertainment. If you are a rock star, band
or musical, it is hard to traverse the country without running into
SFX.
</P>
<P>
   With league salary structures and other limitations, SFX is
unlikely to negotiate with team general managers with any greater
leverage than its agents had when they were independent. Falk,
Hendricks or Arn Tellem are unlikely to demand that a team sign one
player in order to talk to a better one, because they are in the
SFX family. But SFX has yet to say whether Falk will recuse himself
from negotiating player contracts with Jordan, the president of
basketball operations for the Washington Wizards, because Jordan
still has marketing deals handled by SFX.
</P>
<P>
   But one agent, who asked to remain anonymous, said he wondered
if SFX's agglomeration of agencies would diminish union solidarity
in the event of a strike or labor tactics that might reduce profits
to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks agents would jeopardize the best interests
of their clients,'' Allard said, ``doesn't know these agents very
well.''

 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the phone rang at her desk, she would answer it in her slow
and distinctive voice, ``Mis-ter Ro-zelle's off-ice.''
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, Thelma Elkjer, who died recently at age 77,
was the late Pete Rozelle's executive assistant, but in and outside
the National Football League headquarters, she was much more. Tall
and slender, usually in a dark dress, she was the commissioner's
feared office sentry who screened his calls and his visitors, the
guardian of his time. On weekends she often took the divorced
Rozelle's daughter, Anne Marie, to museums, the opera and ballet.
</P>
<P>
   And in a little known moment Elkjer (pronounced ELK-yer) drew an
envelope out of a glass bowl that set the course of NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered why the Giants are in the Eastern
Division of the National Football Conference with the Cowboys, the
Redskins, the Eagles and the Cardinals, the answer goes back to
when the club owners were merging the NFL and the American Football
League into two conferences for the 1970 season, each with 13
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers, the Colts and the Browns agreed to join the AFL
teams in the American Football Conference, which quickly realigned.
But the NFC owners couldn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each owner,'' Rozelle often said of that realignment meeting,
``wanted his team to be in a division with at least one
warm-weather site or a domed stadium, with teams with large
season-ticket sales and with teams that are pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after several hours of wrangling, the NFC owners
agreed to put five different divisional alignments in five sealed
envelopes into a glass bowl. But who would reach into the glass
bowl and pull out the deciding envelope?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get Thelma,'' the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Elkjer pulled out the envelope with the slip of paper
marked ``Plan 3,'' which had the Giants, the Cowboys, the Redskins,
the Eagles and the Cardinals in the East; the Bears, the Packers,
the Lions and the Vikings in the Central; the 49ers, the Rams, the
Falcons and the Saints in the West _ the NFC's basic structure ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Had she picked any of the other envelopes, the
Giants-Redskins-Eagles axis would have endured in the East, but
some rivalries would never have developed.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the other four alignments, the Cowboys were slotted
either in the Central or West divisions; had Elkjer pulled out any
of the other envelopes the Cowboys would have only occasionally
played the Redskins, who turned out to be their fiercest rival, or
the Giants. In each of the other four alignments, the Vikings were
slotted in the East Division.
</P>
<P>
   That was Elkjer's only public moment, but those in the NFL
office remember other moments. Like the time a small smoky fire
occurred in the office kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma just closed the kitchen, just locked it up,'' recalled
Don Weiss, once the NFL's executive director. ``She kept it closed
for four or five years. We'd ask Pete to tell her to open the
kitchen. `You're her boss,' we'd say and he'd say, `Next week, I'll
tell her next week.' But next week never came. I don't think he
ever told her, but one day she decided to open the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkjer, who never married, had been Rozelle's secretary in Los
Angeles when he was the Rams' general manager, then moved to New
York to work for him when he was elected commissioner in 1960. She
lived in an apartment on East 63rd Street, about 10 blocks from the
NFL office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the NFL people were scared of Thelma, even my
father,'' said Anne Marie Bratton, the late commissioner's
daughter, from her Fort Worth home. ``But she was like a mother to
me. If my father was away on a weekend, I'd go over to her
apartment and she'd take me places or I'd play with all her cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all her cats and occasionally a stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   After Rozelle retired as commissioner in 1989 and settled in
Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., with his wife Carrie, he opened an office
there with Thelma in charge. But when her move (with all her cats)
was delayed by the illness of an elderly dog, she remained in the
NFL office for a while as Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's sentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, I don't think Thelma liked Jim Finks,''
Weiss said, referring to the late general manager of the New
Orleans Saints. ``Whenever Jim called after Pete retired, instead
of putting Jim through to Paul, she would just transfer him to me
and I'd hear Jim say, `I guess that dog's still alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Pete Rozelle's death in 1996, Thelma Elkjer answered
the phone as she had for four decades, slowly saying ``Mis-ter
Ro-zelle's off-ice.''
</P>
<P>
   And when people reminded her that her boss had died, that maybe
she should answer the phone differently now, she would say, ``It's
still his office.''

LATEST LOSS HAS SETON HALL FEARING NCAA REJECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VILLANOVA, Pa. _ Instead of surging toward its first NCAA
tournament berth in six years, Seton Hall is stumbling at the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates' case for an at-large bid lost more luster Saturday
at Villanova. Seton Hall, buried by a 17-1 Wildcat run in the first
half, lost, 87-74, for its third defeat in four games. Its lone
victory came last Wednesday against a Minnesota team that had lost
two starters the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall fell to 19-7 overall and 10-5 in the Big East. In the
last 10 years, two Big East teams with 19 victories have been
rejected by the selection committee. Both finished poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova, clinging to its NCAA hopes, improved to 17-7 and 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closer now than we were this morning,'' said coach Steve
Lappas of his team, which outshot Seton Hall, 48 percent to 43
percent, and outrebounded the Pirates by 44-36.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates close out the regular season at Madison Square
Garden against St. John's on Tuesday. Before Saturday, Seton Hall
was one of four teams vying for the top three spots in the Big East
standing and a first-round bye in the conference tournament. Just
one and one-half games separated Syracuse, St. John's, Miami and
Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slump-busting 31 points from Darius Lane, the Pirates
turned in their fourth straight lackluster performance. Villanova
stretched a 47-39 halftime lead into a 14-point margin on several
occasions in the second half. The Pirates crept in for three
straight layups to trim the lead to 73-65 late in the second half,
but the Wildcats replied with 4 unanswered points and kept the
margin at 12 with under three minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall pulled within 8 again with 1 minute 30 seconds left,
but a Malik Allen dunk followed by two Gary Buchanan free throws
sealed the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Buchanan scored 17 points apiece, and Brian Lynch
added 16 for the Wildcats. For Seton Hall, Shaheen Holloway
contributed 12 points, followed by Rimas Kaukenas with 11 and Ty
Shine with 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who had shot only 32 percent in his last three games, came
out on target Saturday. He scored 17 points in the first 10
minutes, and his driving layup put the Pirates up by 30-21.
</P>
<P>
   With Samuel Dalembert intimidating the Wildcats' leading scorer,
Allen, inside, Seton Hall appeared to be on its way. But when coach
Tommy Amaker began mixing and matching lineups because of fatigue,
the Pirates were victimized again by a huge 'Nova run.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova outscored Seton Hall, 17-1, to burst to a 40-33 lead.
The Pirates stumbled through eight minutes without a field goal.
Lane broke the spell with a putback, but Villanova answered with a
7-2 surge capped by Lynch's 3-pointer. Villanova led, 47-39, at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Lane made eight of 12 field-goal attempts on mostly bombs, but
then the Wildcats paid more attention to him. And with lineups that
at times did not include the starters Holloway, Kaukenas or
Dalembert, Villanova's job was made easier.
</P>
<P>
   Allen made the most of Dalembert's seven-minute absence, scoring
all 8 of his first-half points without the freshman center guarding
him.
</P>
<P>
   Dalembert had recorded double figures in points and rebounds in
his last two games, but he seemed to get lost in the offensive
scheme when Lane took over.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall could not make headway early in the second half.
Jermaine Medley's 3-pointer gave Villanova a 56-44 lead with a
little more than 16 minutes left.

<P>
   ABU DIS, West Bank _ The Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, which
U.S. envoys were busy trying to revive last week, is deadlocked
over the fate of this unprepossessing Arab town on the eastern
outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing this dusty hillside suburb to become a monthlong
stumbling block bodes ill for the conclusion of a peace deal by
mid-September, and hints at the skepticism of both Israelis and
Palestinians about finding a way to divide the disputed territory
that is at the heart of the bargain. If they were more confident,
it is doubtful that they would have fought to a bitter draw over a
town that is far from the most intractable issue dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis has become important partly by accident, as each side
waits for Hafez Assad, the Syrian president. Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks were adversely affected by the revival of talks between
the Israelis and Syrians in December. Now that Israeli-Syrian talks
are suspended but still may be resuscitated, the Israelis and the
Palestinians are in something of a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Abu Dis has bought them some time. But it has
also turned Abu Dis, which was supposed to be a symbol of
compromise, into a symbol of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate also illustrates how Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, are both now
reluctant to teach their people to swallow the compromises that
would be inevitable under a final peace plan. And they are both
hesitant to make concessions now that would upset their domestic
critics _ as if they expect it to get easier later, when a final
deal is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike nearby villages, Abu Dis was not annexed by Israel as it
expanded Jerusalem. As a West Bank town, it existed under full
Israeli control from 1967 to 1996, when the Palestinians gained
partial control as one of the steps toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   The 22,000 residents of Abu Dis have a Palestinian governor and
civil administration and see little evidence of an Israeli
presence. But the Israelis retain security control of the town,
which means they have the right to enter for the purpose of
preventing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In an unofficial Israeli-Palestinian plan drafted four years
ago, Abu Dis, with its hillside view of the Mount of Olives and the
Dome of the Rock, was proposed as an alternate capital of the
future Palestinian state. Together with other Palestinian towns
outside Jerusalem, it would be packaged as a kind of alternative to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A fancy office building under construction here is widely
believed to be a potential future home for the Palestinian
parliament-to-be. But Arafat does not publicly accept the idea of
Abu Dis as the Palestinian capital, since that would imply giving
up the fight on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   If such a compromise is on the horizon, Palestinians have not
been prepared for it by their leader, and it would come as a shock.
Even the town's residents say that no one could ever mistake Abu
Dis for the real thing _ Jerusalem _ which is called Al-Quds in
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arafat asked that the Israelis hand over full control of
Abu Dis, and other villages, in the transfer of West Bank land that
was supposed to take place on Jan. 20. As a gesture from the
Israelis and a tangible gain to show his people, he wanted a
populated Arab town as close to disputed Jerusalem as possible. But
Barak refused, and continued to refuse even as his refusal caused a
total breakdown in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the American Middle East peace envoy, was shuttling
last week between Israelis and Palestinians, trying to find a
formula to break the deadlock. Palestinian officials said on Friday
that they would tell him by Sunday where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   But if Abu Dis remains a condition, it will be difficult to end
the stalemate. Barak has made such a public point of his refusal to
concede it that it would be difficult for him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Barak objects to turning over Abu Dis, because he does not want
to decide the fate of the greater Jerusalem area in a piecemeal
fashion, but rather to negotiate it all at once. He also does not
want to relinquish territory adjacent to Jerusalem too soon _ given
the possibility that the negotiations could disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Barak does not talk much to the Israeli public about his
reasoning. And into this vacuum the right wing has come charging.
They are trying to equate the concession of Abu Dis with the
concession of Jerusalem itself, and to raise concerns about Barak's
rumored willingness to eventually transfer civil administration of
some Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Barak's cabinet have urged him to reconsider
and to transfer Abu Dis or another village near Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control. Abu Dis will eventually be transferred, they
say. Why wait, they ask, if this is so important to Arafat? Some
have said Barak is humiliating the Palestinians and making it
harder for Arafat to back down, and even to accept a promise that
Abu Dis will be delivered in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli experts believe that Arafat, with his
faith in Barak wavering, is now pushing hard to obtain whatever
land he can, especially the areas close to Jerusalem. Then, if
negotiations break down or never resume, he will declare what he
possesses to be a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis gained a special status in the Palestinian world when
Ahmed Qurei, now the speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
returned here from exile in 1994. It was his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, gave the
Palestinians partial control over Abu Dis two years later, some saw
it as a personal gesture to Qurei, who is known as Abu Ala. They
had both negotiated the Oslo interim peace agreement that laid the
groundwork for the final peace now being sought.

A BOY FUMES, AND SUDDENLY, HE'S CAUGHT IN THE CRUCIBLE OF
COLUMBINE  
(DW)

   ORANGETOWN, N.Y. _ The incident at Cottage Lane School began
with the private seething of a 10-year-old boy. His teacher had
kept the class inside at recess to punish students for talking, and
he was mad.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Misha Spivack, opened his ``Personal Response
Journal,'' where students record their thoughts, and described his
fifth-grade teacher with an expletive for buttocks. After the
teacher, Lawanda Lane, read it last month, she told school
officials, who arranged with Misha's parents for him to take the
next day off and then switch teachers.
</P>
<P>
   With Misha out, Lane discussed the matter with the class _ to
calm students, school officials say; to get dirt on Misha, his
parents say. After that, rumors spread that Misha had pipe bomb
recipes from the Internet and had talked of bringing a gun to
school. Worried parents called the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a post-Columbine frenzy was under way, turning
educators into investigators and parents into defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who did not return telephone calls, alerted the police. A
detective visited the Spivacks and found that whatever Misha might
have claimed, the family had neither a gun nor a computer, much
less Internet access. When Misha got to school that morning, he was
the talk of Cottage Lane. Then a student spotted the knife.
</P>
<P>
   It was a souvenir from a camping trip that Misha said he had
worn for some time on a key chain attached to his belt. It has a
nail file, little scissors and a 1 1-2 inch blade. The student told
a teacher. Misha was suspended pending a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate knives in school,'' said Eileen K. Gress,
superintendent of the South Orangetown Central School District.
</P>
<P>
   Worry swept this southeastern Rockland County community, where
families flock in pursuit of good schools. The principal,
superintendent and school board members all got calls. At the high
school, students asked Anton Spivack, 14, whether his little
brother had stabbed someone.
</P>
<P>
   At the disciplinary hearing, Larry Spivack acknowledged that his
son had the knife and also that he had taken Misha to school once
during his suspension _ so he could tell classmates he was not a
threat. The featured witness, a fifth grader, said Misha told him
he ``didn't like'' their teacher ``and he wanted to hurt her.'' A
transcript shows the boy testified that Misha said ``he might bring
a gun to school'' and that ``he said this school should be
Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivack rested his case with a line from ``The Crucible'':
``I'll tell you what's walking Salem: vengeance is walking Salem.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Misha, whose report cards show
above-average grades, didn't deny talking tough. ``I probably did
say that,'' he said. ``But I don't think I was so specific. I
wouldn't say pipe bomb because I don't even know what a pipe bomb
is.'' He contends many classmates say things like: ``God, I think
this school sucks. I wish we could blow it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gress suspended Misha for a total of eight days. In a letter to
parents, Gress said that despite the pocketknife and ``language
which alarmed'' some people, ``there was never any harm intended to
the students, staff or the school.''
</P>
<P>
   His suspension over, Misha now rides to and from school alone in
a van, not on a school bus. An aide has been with him much of the
time. For a while, he said, he was not allowed in regular student
bathrooms. Gress said she wanted to ``provide support'' in the
transition, emphasizing that ``the incident has been hard on every
child in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Rise Spivack did not condone her son's language, but defended
his right to an opinion, particularly in a journal he expected
would be private. Gress said school violence nationwide had
heightened the ``responsibility to be vigilant,'' but insisted that
a penknife would always trigger a serious response. ``The burden is
to not overreact,'' Gress said.
</P>
<P>
   At least on that point the Spivacks agree. The couple _ he is a
musician, she is a dancer _ moved here for clean air, open space
and good schools. But they said the commute was getting to them,
and Misha's experience was the last straw. They're moving back to
New York City.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his tiny cubicle in the Russell Senate Office
Building, in the lowest foothills of political power, a frustrated
Navy officer wrestled with friends over what to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979, and it was becoming clear that he would never make
admiral like his father and grandfather. He had always dreamed of
doing something great, of imprinting his name on the history books,
but at age 42 he found himself with a stuttering military career
and no base from which to go into politics.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, his personal life was a mess: Although he was
still living with his wife, he was aggressively courting a
25-year-old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich.
</P>
<P>
   That troubled period was perhaps the crucial turning point in
John McCain's life, and the decisions that he made then started him
on the course that he hopes will take him to the White House in
January. In just a few years from those times of soul-searching in
his office as Navy liaison to the Senate, McCain would have a new
wife, a new home state and a bright new political star as president
of the class of newly elected Republican members of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate running on character and biography, it is also
an awkward time to remember: McCain abandoned his wife, who had
reared their three children alone while he was in Vietnamese
prisons, and he then began his political career with the resources
of his new wife's family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although McCain's children and some friends were angry and
disappointed with him at the time, they rally around him today. No
candidate could be luckier in his choice of an ex-wife than McCain,
and he must be the only politician around who could cheat on his
wife and divorce her and still get her support and her campaign
contributions today. Even her friends rave about him.
</P>
<P>
   The past is central to McCain's campaign, yet paradoxically his
most remarkable metamorphosis, from a battered ex-pilot on crutches
to a new congressman, is among the least-known chapters of his
storybook life. McCain's best-selling autobiography ends with his
release from Vietnam prisons, omitting everything afterward. McCain
and his present wife, Cindy, both declined to be interviewed about
that period for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is that phase of McCain's life that underscores his
contradictions and complexities, and that reflects most clearly the
dogged, clenched-jaw determination that seems central to his
personality. McCain may come across as carefree, but friends and
family members say his relaxed style camouflages a braiding of
drive and ambition that enabled McCain to turn his life around
after Vietnam and that, today, explains his campaign for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The story began when Vietnam released McCain and other prisoners
of war in March 1973. He stepped off a military transport plane on
crutches, an instant war hero, and he quickly had a painful shock.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carol, a tall, slim woman who had once been a model,
had nearly died in a horrific car wreck in 1969. Ross Perot, the
businessman and advocate of prisoners of war, had paid for her
medical care, but the injuries left her 4 inches shorter and on
crutches, and she had gained a good deal of weight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was no great shakes to look at himself. He was still
troubled by two broken arms, a broken leg, a shattered knee and
bayonet wounds. Few thought that he could ever fly again, but
McCain was desperate to try.
</P>
<P>
   So he signed up for an excruciating therapy. Twice a week, for
two hours at a time, he would lie in a whirlpool bath with water as
hot as he could stand, and then the physical therapist (he called
her his physical terrorist) would force his knee to bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In physical therapy, you measure pain on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 10 being maximum, off the wall,'' recalled the therapist,
Diane Lawrence. ``Many times we got close to 10, and he would just
put a hand over his face, and say, `Honey, that's it.' And we would
stop for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with his dream of flying again, McCain embraced the
pain and never missed a therapy session, Lawrence said. And he lit
up the clinic with his jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient at the time was Ann Jones, then a 12-year-old
girl struggling to understand the implications of the words ``brain
tumor'' that were whispered around her. Others at the clinic
remember that McCain used to arrive early to cheer up Ann and later
dropped by her home when she was dying.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Sylvia, has not seen McCain since, but she
chokes as she recalls her daughter's radiance at the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, and I'm not trying to promote John McCain
politically,'' Jones said. ``But it tells you something about the
character of this man. There was nothing in it for him to do this.
It was only kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine months of therapy, McCain took his flight physical
and somehow passed. He could be a pilot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in to see me, and he said, `Honey, I made it,'''
Lawrence recalled. ``He had tears in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain won a coveted assignment as commanding officer of the
Navy's largest squadron, the Replacement Air Group in Jacksonville,
Fla. This was McCain's first chance to command men (and a very few
women), but the squadron had a mediocre record, and parts shortages
meant that only half the planes were flyable at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inertia had set in,'' recalled Carl Smith, then an instructor
pilot in the squadron. ``We had some crusty old guys running
maintenance, and they were masters at saying, `no, no, no.' But
then McCain came in and changed them overnight and brought in new
people.''
</P>
<P>
   All this raised eyebrows and hackles, and some senior officers
grumbled about favoritism for the admiral's son. When McCain failed
in his initial efforts to qualify to land an A-7 aircraft on a
carrier, a failure that would have blocked his career, some senior
officers were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John M. Johnson, then a junior officer helping people qualify
for the A-7, remembers two senior officers taking him and a
co-worker aside and ordering them to make sure that McCain did not
make it. But the junior officers were mesmerized by ``the
Skipper,'' as McCain was called, because of both his record in
Vietnam and his glow of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson and the other young officers coached the Skipper
tirelessly for his second try on the A-7, training him on the
simulator and prepping him every moment they could. And when he
qualified, they held a huge party, celebrating him for a version of
the inspiration and iconoclasm that he now lays claim to in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally joined the Navy to avoid being drafted in the
Army,'' Johnson recalled, but he added that he stayed partly
because he had been so inspired by the Skipper. Johnson has done
fine for himself since then: He made his comments in an e-mail
interview from the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, where he is
the admiral in charge of the carrier battle group.
</P>
<P>
   This loyalty to the Skipper was widespread. As one tracks down
and talks to the men he once commanded, it is striking how often
their voices light up as they describe something magical about him.
</P>
<P>
   Officers recall that he would hurtle into the maintenance shops
and start kidding the officers, peppering them with rapid-fire
questions and jokes, urging them, scolding them and leaving them
fired up. McCain learned the names of all the enlisted men so that
he could tease them as vociferously as the officers, a mild breach
of protocol that won their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   They responded, and by the time he left the squadron in 1977,
every single aircraft had left the disabled list _ the last one,
which had been out for two years, was restored on his next-to-last
day.
</P>
<P>
   Although plagued by fatal accidents in the past, the squadron
had no fatalities under his command (a turkey buzzard that
shattered the windshield of a student pilot's plane almost changed
that, but officers talked the pilot down safely), and won its first
meritorious unit citation. McCain's success attracted notice among
the admirals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important to McCain's future, the Florida years
gave him a chance to hone his speaking skills and think about
politics. Hailed as a war hero, he was invited to address Rotary
Clubs and high schools, and he perfected his off-the-cuff speaking
style, scrawling a few notes on the back of an envelope and then
giving patriotic speeches laced with humor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, some local Republicans urged McCain to run for Congress
against the longtime Democratic incumbent, Charles E. Bennett.
McCain toyed with the idea and called up an old classmate, Charles
R. Larson, who remembers urging him to stay in the Navy for at
least another couple of years to get the pension and medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was not an entirely new idea, for McCain had always
been far more ambitious than he liked to let on. Connie Bookbinder,
Carol McCain's college roommate and close friend, realized early on
that this young Navy man had plenty of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were dating,'' Bookbinder recalled, ``I asked Carol:
`What does John want to do with his life? Does he want to be an
admiral like his dad?' She said, `He wants to do something
important, so he'll be in the history books.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain let the scope of his ambitions slip out again in the fall
of 1970, when he was in Vietnam and four of the prisoners of war
were put together in a cell. They spent a couple of weeks talking
nonstop, and the conversation soon touched on their dreams: One
wanted to have command of his own squadron, another wanted to be an
academic, the third yearned to be a military attache in an embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked John what he wanted to be _ chief of naval
operations?'' recalled Richard A. Stratton, one of those present.
``He said, no, the best job in the Navy is commander in chief of
Pacific forces, because then you're chief warrior. But he said that
what he really wanted to be was president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him, it's no flash in the pan, no sudden dream,''
Stratton said. ``He's been thinking of this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McCain decided not to run for Congress in 1976, but
after Jacksonville he got an assignment that put him in the center
of the political world anyway: He was appointed Navy liaison to the
Senate. Normally, the liaison officers are glorified travel agents
for senators making overseas trips _ ``baggage carriers,'' they are
snidely called _ but McCain's personality and renown as a war hero
made his cramped office a magnet for key senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fascinating character,'' recalled Gary Hart, then a
liberal young senator who often dropped by McCain's office. ``He
was current on the issues and could engage on every level. And he
was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the attractions for some liberals was that McCain held no
grudge against the antiwar movement. William B. Bader, then a
Senate committee staff member, remembers sitting next to McCain on
an airplane as they accompanied a delegation of senators on an
overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``One senator after another came back to talk to John,'' Bader
said. ``The senators who came back were the biggest doves, and I
think psychologically they wanted to make their peace with the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain became particularly close to William Cohen, then a
senator from Maine, John Tower, then a senator from Texas, and
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to show respect for senators while at the same time
teasing them. He cemented his friendships on foreign trips when he
took senators bar-hopping in Athens, Greece, or to a meeting with
the sultan of Oman in a tent in the desert (the Americans were
supposed to cross their legs, and when McCain's injuries prevented
him from doing this, Tower teased him mercilessly for creating an
international incident).
</P>
<P>
   Early on, McCain showed his maverick streak. President Carter
was then trying to replace large aircraft carriers with smaller
ones, a policy that McCain and some others in the military thought
was catastrophic and would reduce America's ability to project
power around the world. So McCain conspired with several senators
and staff members to win financing for a large carrier over the
objections of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very strongly about it, but we were out of whack with
the commander in chief and the secretary of the Navy,'' said James
McGovern, who then worked under McCain in the liaison office. ``You
can't control John. He's very much his own man. He stands on
principle, and he's not your classic compromiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Although quietly backed by some senior Navy officers, this was
an exceptionally delicate operation to subvert White House and
Pentagon policy. And it worked: The Senate financed a new large
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as if he was a rogue elephant working on his own,''
said Rhett Dawson, then staff director on the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``But could he have been fired for it if he'd been
caught? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   These political battles thrilled McCain, and he came to feel
increasingly restless. He told friends that he was looking for
something new because he would never make admiral, and they mostly
agreed. His physical injuries were the biggest problem, but his
outspokenness could be self-destructive as well as charming.
</P>
<P>
   His office-mates would cringe when he would get a telephone call
from some admiral's secretary, asking him to hold for the man
himself. As McGovern recalls it, McCain would slam the phone down,
and when it would ring a moment later, they would hear McCain's
voice, angrily: ``No, we weren't cut off. I hung up. You can
presume that I'm as busy as you are. If you really want to talk to
me, pick up the phone yourself and call me!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's angst about his career, family members and friends say,
arose partly because he felt that he had been spared death for
something larger, but, at midlife, he could not see what it was.
McCain had repeatedly survived catastrophic accidents, beginning in
flight school when the plane he was flying crashed into the sea (he
was knocked unconscious but came to as the plane landed on the
bottom, and he squeezed out of the cockpit and swam to the
surface).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he sensed that life held something bigger for him, but
he didn't know what it was yet,'' said Doug McCain, his eldest son.
The younger McCain remembers once going with his parents to France
and visiting Napoleon's tomb _ Napoleon had been a childhood hero
of John McCain's _ and sensing that his father was searching for
any lessons history might hold about how he himself might best
serve his country.
</P>
<P>
   As John McCain puzzled over his career, he also found himself
sorting out his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Navy, many considered it appropriate for a swashbuckling
pilot to pick up a girlfriend here or there, and stories began to
spread about McCain and young women. But McCain was discreet in his
indiscretions: He did not carouse with young women on Capitol Hill
or take dates to the Monocle, a bar near the Senate that he often
went to, and he did not drink himself silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in politics need a drink to loosen up,'' said
Hart, noting that he had never seen McCain even close to drunk.
``John's loose all the time. He never needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has acknowledged running around with women and accepted
responsibility for the breakup of the marriage, without going into
details. But his supporters and his biographer, Robert Timberg, all
suggest that the marriage had already effectively ended and that
the couple had separated by the time he met Cindy, his present
wife.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the most soothing way of explaining a politician's
divorce from a disabled wife and his remarriage to a wealthy
heiress, but it does not jibe with accounts of family members and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   John and Carol McCain had separated once briefly after they
moved to Washington, when he moved his gear into his mother's house
on Connecticut Avenue. That was the first hint that Joe McCain,
John's younger brother, had of any marital problems, for neither
John nor Carol confided much about personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember asking him one time,'' Joe McCain recalled. ``I
said: `You don't look so happy. You want to talk about it?' And he
said, `No, pal.'''
</P>
<P>
   That separation lasted about two weeks and was not repeated
until the final split, said their son Andy, and even close family
friends never knew about it. To outsiders, who often visited the
McCain household, the marriage seemed as close as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely living together as man and wife when I
was there,'' recalled Smith, the former instructor pilot, who moved
to Washington and lived with the McCains in their home from about
February through May 1979. ``And there were no signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody to say that they were separated or at each
other's throats is just nonsense,'' Smith said. ``Complete
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at precisely the time that Smith was a guest in what
appeared to be a happy household, in April 1979, McCain accompanied
a group of senators on a trip to China. The Navy threw a big
cocktail party for the group during a stopover in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I were talking, and then somebody tapped me on the
shoulder and I turned around and exchanged a few words,'' said
Albert A. Lakeland, then a Senate staff member. ``When I turned
around, John was gone. I looked around, and he was making a beeline
for this very attractive blond woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent the whole party talking to her, and he kept avoiding
me when I approached,'' Lakeland said. After the reception, McCain
and the young woman, Cindy Hensley, went out to dinner, and the
romance blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to pursue Hensley, telephoning her to keep in
touch. When she thanked him for sending flowers that had just
arrived (signed ``John''), he modestly said it was nothing. In
fact, as she discovered years later, they were from another man
named John.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, McCain pursued Hensley aggressively,
flying around the country to see her, and he began to push to end
his marriage. Friends say that Carol McCain was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Late that year, the McCains finally separated, and Mrs. McCain
accepted a divorce the next February. McCain promptly married
Hensley, his present wife.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first Mrs. McCain never seems to have said a harsh word
about McCain (nor he about her), and she was discreet even with
friends. Bookbinder, her old roommate, says that her first inkling
came when Mrs. McCain met her one day and abruptly said, ``I'm
getting a divorce.'' When Bookbinder, who was stunned, asked what
had gone wrong, Mrs. McCain answered, ``It's just one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's three children in the first marriage were less
forgiving at first, and none of them was in attendance when he
married Cindy. No one blamed Cindy, however, for she seemed shy,
and it was clear that it was McCain who had been the pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly disappointed and mad at Dad,'' remembered
Andy, who said it took almost four years for his anger to
evaporate. He added: ``I hold him responsible. I don't hold Cindy
responsible a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old friends believe that McCain was as restless in the
marriage as in the Navy, and that he was actively looking for a new
wife when he met Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it was that the marriage had come unglued,'' said
George Day, an old friend who represented McCain as a lawyer in the
divorce. ``Then what happened with meeting Cindy, was that he had
already made the decision to get divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family friends were appalled that a man who seemed so
decent, so full of compassion for anyone who needed help, could
treat his own wife in a manner they regarded as brutal. But McCain
gradually won everyone around again, with the same traits he now
displays after making a mistake: a combination of charm and
penitence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ticked,'' said Nancy Reynolds, an old family friend.
``I'd glare at him, and he'd say, `Nance!''' Reynolds paused and
laughed and added: ``If you meet him, you're under his spell. He's
irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that McCain always accepted blame _ embraced it _
rather than making excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always felt very guilty about it,'' McGovern said. ``I
have never talked with him for more than 40 minutes when he didn't
bring it up, saying he felt badly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So John and Carol McCain managed to remain friends, and she has
backed him in all his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crazy about John McCain and I love him to pieces,'' Carol
McCain said, ``but I'm just not going to do any interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, his children have all gotten over their anger, to the
point that their son Doug chose his father to be best man at his
wedding. And four years ago, after a family conference to make sure
there would be no hard feelings, son Andy decided to go to work in
Arizona for the beer distributorship owned by Cindy McCain's
family. All the children, including those from his second marriage,
are enthusiastically backing their father's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   While the remarriage caused turmoil in his family, it also made
for some new political opportunities for McCain. No one who knows
him thinks that he remarried for political reasons, but it helped
solve one of his basic obstacles if he wished to pursue politics:
Where to run for office?
</P>
<P>
   McCain had grown up as a Navy child, born abroad in the Canal
Zone and constantly moving. But his new wife had firm roots in
Phoenix, where her father was a wealthy beer magnate, so McCain
began to think about running for Congress from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1981, Cohen called J. Brian Smith, a Washington
political consultant who knew Arizona well, and asked him to meet
McCain. Smith said he let the matter slide, because, ``I thought it
was far-fetched that this guy was going to move to Arizona and run
for Congress a year later.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen called again, though, and Smith and McCain finally met for
lunch. As they ate, McCain excitedly explained how he could win a
race for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking him, `What district?''' Smith remembered. ``And
he didn't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they agreed to work together. In March 1981, McCain moved
to Phoenix, where his father-in-law gave him a public relations job
that amounted to an excuse to go around the state giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain expressed interest in elective office, some people
encouraged him to run for the state Legislature. But the state
Legislature had residency requirements that he would not be able to
meet; if he was to run, it would have to be for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then in January 1982, 10 months after the McCains had moved to
Arizona, the congressman in the neighboring district, John Rhodes,
called a press conference. On the assumption that Rhodes might
declare that he would not run again, McCain hurriedly sent his wife
out to look for a house they could buy in Rhodes' district.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes did retire. And, as Smith describes it, Cindy McCain
returned moments after the press conference ended, having already
found a house in the district. They bought it and moved in right
away, and two months later McCain announced his candidacy for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized it was a long shot,'' recalled William Ball, an
old friend. ``He was not the establishment candidate _ just like
today.''

 &HT;    Baylor vs. Sosa: first salvo for manager inside baseball
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Sammy Sosa finally gets on the field today.
Don't think that doesn't disappoint the new boss of the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor fired his first warning shot as new manager of Cubs
after Sosa postponed his arrival in Mesa, Ariz., because of a case
of flu and a sudden flight home to the Dominican Republic. The rest
of his position players have been working out for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big deal,'' Baylor said. ``I imagine a lot of guys in
that (locker) room probably care. You don't want to put one guy
before the team. That's not going to happen. I know one thing for
sure. This team lost 95 games last year. We have to change that
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people are watching Baylor this spring, after he left
his Atlanta hitting coach job for the resuscitation project that is
Chicago. For years, the Cubs have been seen as a fun, if not
frustrating team to play on, where Wrigley Field and rabid fans
make for a comfortable setting for yearly underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's first priority has been to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bases are still the same, pitching mound is the same, but we
have to change an attitude,'' Baylor said. ``This is not a spring
training where you take bats and balls and throw 'em out and let
'em do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Sosa straight off is an interesting choice. Baylor
had just designated the right fielder, along with reliever Rick
Aguilera, first baseman Mark Grace and right-hander Kevin Tapani,
as unofficial team captains.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has customarily been a late spring arrival and played in
all 162 games last year. But Baylor is demanding the 1998 MVP make
up the defensive drills he missed, particularly since the team will
start newcomer Damon Buford in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to stay after school,'' Baylor said. ``He
has to find time to get it all in. The defensive end, I don't care
when you report, it still goes on. He will have to do the work
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will also find a new set of team rules, for Baylor has
tightened up on what was allowed under former manager Jim
Riggleman. A sampling: no caps will be worn backwards; no cut-offs
or gym shorts allowed; all players will stand on the top step for
the national anthem; and no scruffy beards or unkempt goatees. No
sooner were the rules taped to the clubhouse wall than Aguilera
trimmed his trademark beard into a trim goatee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club is very visible and appearance has a lot to do with
things,'' Baylor said. ``To me, it's part of attitude. Look
professional. Look like you're a major-league player, not a rock
star.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome home, Mr. Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   THE ART OF THE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Mets are serious about dealing left-handed
reliever Dennis Cook, Texas is already serious about acquiring him.
The Rangers are concerned lefty Scott Venafro, who has yet to throw
his spring, may have a career-threatening circulation problem in
his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has renewed talks with Anaheim for center fielder Jim
Edmonds. Angels general manager Bill Stoneman seems to willing to
listen, having just been turned down by Colorado when he offered
Edmonds for a starting pitcher. The Mariners are willing to deal
newcomer Brett Tomko or left-hander John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   CALL IT A CAREER
</P>
<P>
   New Cardinals reliever Scott Radinsky, bouncing back from elbow
surgery, realizes his second career as guitarist in his alternative
rock band Pulley may be drawing to an end. He is 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can jump around and scream at 15-year-old girls only so
long,'' Radinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   WRY, FUNNY VALENTINE
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Mets' October run diminished the pressure on
manager Bobby Valentine, someone forgot to tell Fred Wilpon. The
club's CEO says he has no intention of negotiating a new contract
for Valentine until season's end, when his current deal expires.
This is the team's response to Valentine's 273 wins since 1997 and
the club's finishing two games short of the 1999 World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have the answer for why he said that?'' Valentine
asked. ``If I thought about it, and didn't have the answer, then I
guess I'd scratch my head. If I got an answer, I wouldn't scratch
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, worried about Todd Hundley's stalled career (.207,
major-league 16 errors for catchers last season), quietly
negotiated a $500,000 buyout of his option for 2001, which could
make him a free agent after this season.... San Francisco's options
at second base for the injured Jeff Kent (strained rib muscle) are
reserve Ramon Martinez, Wilson Delgado (a natural shortstop),
prospect Jay Martinez, Toronto reject Felipe Crespo, or moving Bill
Mueller from third base. The downside: no one knows how long Kent
will be out.... Cincinnati's relaxing of its player jewelry rule
doesn't do much for catcher Eddie Taubensee. ``I'm not going to
wear one, even though my wife has some nice ones in her jewelry
box,'' he said. ``It would be hard for pitchers to take a catcher
seriously when he is wearing an earring.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took another step toward moving left fielder Ron
Gant when the club decided to let rookie Pat Burrell, the No. 1
overall pick of the 1998 draft, start in Gant's position all
spring. ``I've been traded before,'' said Gant, whom the club tried
to move over the winter. ``I know what it's like. I know baseball
is a business and sometimes teams go on youth movements. So, if
they trade me, I understand the situation. But it would be their
loss.''... The new bidder for the Kansas City Royals is an
Atlantan: Facundo Bacardi, the wine and rum heir, is the third
party to show interest in the club, promising to keep the Royals in
Kansas City. Born in Chicago, raised in Florida, Bacardi had never
visited Kauffman Stadium until last week.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Boston's Jimy Williams if he had caught
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra's guest appearance on ``Two Guys and a
Girl,'' the manager said he missed it and asked, ``He played the
guy, right?''

WEST BANK STUDENTS THROW STONES AT FRENCH LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Angry Palestinian students pitched stones at French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday and pummeled his car with
rocks as he was ending a visit with Palestinian intellectuals at
the leading university in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The students at Bir Zeit University outside Ramallah were
protesting remarks that Jospin made last week during a visit to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin had condemned as ``terrorist acts'' the attacks by
Hezbollah _ or Party of God _ guerrillas on Israeli soldiers in an
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. His remarks immediately
raised a fury in the Arab world. On Saturday the Syrian government
summoned France's ambassador to protest the remarks and to clarify
Jospin's position, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protest because Hezbollah is a resistance movement,
not a terrorist movement,'' said Ziad, a demonstrator who would not
give his last name. ``It's not only a Lebanese matter. It's an Arab
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence greatly embarrassed the academic leaders of Bir
Zeit, whose new law school was financed by the French government.
And it angered Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who was
playing host to Jospin and had lent the French leader his silver
Mercedes, which was dented by the stones.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin was struck by at least one stone and received a small
scratch on the head, despite the Palestinian security officials,
who formed a human shield and held a plastic bullet guard above his
head. After the incident, Jospin continued to Gaza as planned and
dismissed the demonstrators as a small, unruly group.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians saw the attack as an outburst of frustration.
Students at Bir Zeit, expressing a deep-seated feeling in their
communities, said they believed that the peace effort was going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   After apologizing to Jospin, the university announced that it
was shutting down for three days. Palestinian police arrested at
least 15 students who had participated in the melee, and senior
Palestinian security officials opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   When Jospin arrived, students began yelling in French, ``Barak
terrorist, Jospin accomplice.'' Ehud Barak is the prime minister of
Israel, who has been severely criticized in the Arab world for
bombing Lebanese power stations in response to attacks by Hezbollah
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The protests escalated, and Jospin was harangued throughout his
visit, despite his attempts to proclaim France a friend of Lebanon
and a critic of the Israeli zone.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving, the demonstrators threw leaflets, then small
stones, then larger ones. Stones also flew at Nabil Shaath, a
senior Palestinian official who accompanied Jospin. The students
followed their car, kicking it and pelting it.

 &HT;    Veteran Falcons ends let go easily
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ One of the basic laws of physics says that for every
action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
</P>
<P>
   For the Falcons, it means that for Ashley Ambrose and Shawn
Jefferson there are Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau.
</P>
<P>
   The two longtime Atlanta defensive ends became unrestricted free
agents on Feb. 11. Now, Smith's a Panther and Archambeau's a
Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   For all the energy the Falcons used in pursuing Ambrose and
Jefferson, they expended virtually none in pursuit of Smith, 30, or
Archambeau, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined interview requests for this article, but he said
last week on WQXI-AM, ``(The Falcons) never tried.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Harold Richardson began trying last summer to
extend the contracts of Archambeau, center Robbie Tobeck, wide
receiver Terance Mathis and fullback Bob Christian, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Christian worked out extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Archambeau ended in October, shortly after the
player's age became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The team had a few brief conversations with Smith's agent but no
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Because they would never give us a figure of what they
were looking at,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``You had to expect they
were thinking a huge number.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith might have considered himself worthy of a $9 million
signing bonus like the Colts gave defensive end Chad Bratzke a year
ago, or the five-year, $30 million contract and $6 million signing
bonus Chidi Ahonotu got with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Harold, `Here's where (the bidding) is going to be. Are
you going to be in the ball game?''' Smith's agent, Jimmy Sexton,
said. ``He said, `Let me think about it. I don't think so.'''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing precluded the Falcons from making an offer to Smith
if they were interested in having back the second-leading sacker in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance to do a deal. After defensive tackle Travis
Hall signed a seven-year, $51.5 million extension the day before
the season opener, the agents for Smith and Archambeau called
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had three years left; Archambeau and Smith one each. So,
why extend Hall first?
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told Sexton that he would give the same deal, which
included a $5.1 million signing bonus, to Smith that very day.
</P>
<P>
   As the free agency approached, re-signing Smith was not as big a
priority as signing Ambrose, or probably Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only chance would have been if the market came back to a
range we were talking about,'' Reeves said. ``But if we waited, we
might not have been able to sign Ashley and Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Even after signing Ambrose and Jefferson on Feb. 12, the Falcons
had enough cap room to match the Carolina offer that Smith's agent
called in to Richardson on Feb. 16. The Falcons declined to match.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, they agreed to a four-year, $10 million contract
with Saints free-agent defensive end Brady Smith, 26, who got a
$2.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, Archambeau signed a seven-year, $17.5 million
contract with Denver, including a $2.5 million signing bonus. The
last offer made by the Falcons in October was better.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Archambeau's stats dropped this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, age can work against you,'' Archambeau's agent,
Alan Herman, said. ``I don't think you can look back with regret.
And I don't feel any hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith might.
</P>
<P>
   ``As... we started putting the deal together, he started looking
at things that were important beyond money,'' Sexton said. ``I
think, in the end, the fact he'll get to play against Atlanta twice
a year was important.''

JOURNALIST ATTACKS RUSSIA AFTER BEING REARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Radio Liberty journalist Andrei Babitsky,
rearrested Friday after surfacing from more than a month's
detention in Chechnya, has told his colleagues at the American
radio network that Russian officials violated the agreement under
which he voluntarily agreed to be exchanged for Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he was coerced into the roadside swap Feb. 2 under
protest, a colleague said Saturday. Babitsky, a Russian national
whose radio reports on civilian suffering and military brutality in
the war in Chechnya inflamed the Russian authorities, has been
detained since Jan. 16 in a case that has drawn international
attention over the manner in which Russian security services seized
a war correspondent and traded him into captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky surfaced Friday in Makhachkala, the capital of
Dagestan, which adjoins Chechnya, and was arrested on a charge of
carrying a false passport, a charge that is sure to further
complicate the legal proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
   While Babitsky was in detention, one of his colleagues at Radio
Liberty, Oleg Kusov, was able to debrief him over several hours.
Kusov said Saturday that Babitsky was coerced into the exchange
after Russian officials reneged on their pledge to carry it out in
a manner that would place Babitsky in the hands of a Chechen field
commander, Turpal Ali Atgeriev, who was known to Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television on Saturday night broadcast part of the
police interrogation of Babitsky, in which he said he had been
promised that Atgeriev ``guaranteed my freedom after the
exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Babitsky was escorted to the place where the exchange
was to take place, the masked man who approached from the Chechen
side was clearly not Atgeriev, and Babitsky tried to call off the
exchange. ``He refused to be exchanged, as he told me,'' Kusov
said, ``but his words could not change anything, and the man in the
mask rudely took him by his arm and took him to the car.''
</P>
<P>
   The swap engineered by Russia's Federal Security Service was
described by Russian officials as ``voluntary.'' Babitsky's account
will probably further enrage Russian journalists, many of whom have
taken up his cause because they see their own fate threatened by
the pre-emptory and authoritarian manner in which a journalist
unpopular with the Kremlin has been singled out for harsh
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After being held in a ``dark room'' in an unidentified Chechen
village for several weeks, Babitsky is apparently in good health,
his colleague said. ``He was locked in a small room,'' Kusov said.
``Food was scarce and he had no chance to get any information. He
did not know these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky apparently was traveling with a false Azerbaijani
passport, bearing his photograph but the name of Ali Musayev. He
used the passport to register at the hotel in Makhachkala after
being delivered to the Dagestani capital by masked men who then
released him there. Kusov said Saturday that Babitsky ``knew he had
this passport on him; there was his picture in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The police in Dagestan, a Russian republic, are awaiting
instructions from Moscow on the matter. Asked during his police
interrogation why he was carrying the false passport, Babitsky
replied, ``I had no other document'' and ``I was afraid to disclose
my whereabouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Liberty officials said they would travel to Dagestan on
Monday seeking Babitsky's release.

LONG SHOT WINS PLACE ON U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ She moved from the anonymity of the pack into
sudden contention in Saturday's Olympic marathon trials, surging
into third place, second, then first after 20 miles, and finally,
all the runners with faster qualifying times and bigger reputations
were behind her. At that moment no one was more surprised to be
ahead than the leader herself, Dr. Christine Clark.
</P>
<P>
   There could not have been a more unlikely victor. Clark, who is
37, finished 76th at the 1996 Olympic trials on the same course. A
pathologist and mother of two, she runs only 70 miles a week, 30 or
40 fewer than the average. And she does two-thirds of her training
on a treadmill in the winter, considering that her home is
Anchorage, and no one has yet discovered a way to put snow chains
on running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature rose above 80 degrees on the rolling 26.2-mile
course, which might have melted a runner not conditioned to such
wilting heat. Instead, Clark shaved more than seven minutes off her
previous best time to win the trials in 2 hours 33 minutes 31
seconds. Because that was a half-minute slower than the Olympic
``A'' qualifying standard, only Clark will represent the American
women at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I'd be here,''
said Clark, who had only the 22nd fastest qualifying time. ``I
think this gives a lot of women hope that they can be in their 30s
and have a career and kids and do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to Kristy Johnston of Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
one of the favorites, in 2:35:36. She had qualified for Saturday's
race in 2:32:34, under the Olympic standard, but the U.S. track and
field federation decided last December that only runners who won
the trials or finished under 2:33 Saturday would be eligible for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston called the process unfair, but Craig Masback, the chief
executive officer of USA Track and Field, said that the most
equitable system was to let the athletes decide the Olympic team in
the same race, on the same course, under the same conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing third was Anne Marie Lauck (2:36:05) of Hampton, N.J.,
who made a gutsy move near Mile 4, looking over her shoulder,
finding that no one wanted to work with her and just taking off.
Lauck apparently made her move with the 2:33 requirement in mind.
She reached the halfway mark in 1:15:28 with a 33-second lead over
Kim Pawelek and a 60-second advantage over a pack of runners that
included Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so tough, I thought she was gone for the duration,''
Clark said of Lauck, who finished 10th at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not gone. Lauck runs with the pounding stride of a
track runner, and her legs seemed to grow heavy as she put in three
consecutive miles at a pace above six minutes. Pawelek began to
have trouble with her feet in the heat and faded to seventh in
2:39:16. Clark caught her just after Mile 16 and pulled even with
Lauck at Mile 20. Then Clark tossed in a 5:42 mile on a downhill
portion and was alone in front. She kept the lead on a series of
hills and ended any suspense by running Mile 23 in 5:39.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to run my race, keep a steady pace,'' Clark said.
``I don't have tremendous leg speed. I can't run one mile at 5:10,
so where am I going to get a surge? People kept coming back to me.
It so far surpassed my expectations, it's a little hard to
describe. I wanted to make the top 20. If I had a great day I
thought I could make the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauck was so drained that she collapsed at the finish line. Joan
Benoit Samuelson, the 1984 Olympic champion, finished ninth in
2:39:59. But Clark maintained her long, fluid stride throughout the
race and won by more than two minutes. Of eight or nine marathons
that she has run, this was her first significant victory. She was a
high school cross-country champion in Billings, Mont., but ran
sporadically from 1983 through 1993, while she completed medical
school and her residency.
</P>
<P>
   She works 25 to 30 hours a week at Providence Medical Center in
Anchorage, where her husband, John, is a pulmonary physician in the
intensive care unit. On days that she works, Clark arises at 6 a.m.
to train on her treadmill with tempo runs of five or six miles at a
5:30 pace, or with a 15-mile run at a 5:50 pace. Time for running
must be slotted between time for her patients and her sons,
Matthew, 9, and Danny 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't have any more time to do more miles,'' Clark
said. ``I don't see the purpose of that for myself. Less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   She has always dreamed of the Olympics, but it always seemed a
distant dream. Now that it has come true, Clark said the feeling
was unfathomable. She is not expected to contend for a medal in
Sydney. Her time Saturday was 13 minutes, or more than two miles,
off the world record. Then again, Clark has shaved 11 minutes from
her personal best in her last two marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have more minutes to shave off,'' she said. ``I
don't think I've reached my peak.''

ORDER TO LEAVE U.S.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla, Md., Cuba, Switzerland)  DEFIANT, CUBAN DIPLOMAT DEFIES By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cuban diplomat ordered expelled last week by
the United States on spying charges gave up his diplomatic immunity
Saturday and challenged U.S. officials to arrest him so that he
could prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, Jose Imperatori, said through his lawyer that he
would not leave the United States by Saturday afternoon, the
deadline he had been given. His lawyer, Kurt L. Schmoke, a former
mayor of Baltimore, said he would begin a hunger strike ``in order
to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was identified by the Cuban interests section, which
represents the Cuban government in the United States, as the
diplomat who was identified as having been in contact with the U.S.
immigration official who was charged last week with spying.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has insisted that Imperatori did nothing wrong and met with
the official on routine business.
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke said at Imperatori's apartment that American authorities
had told him Imperatori would be taken into custody and flown out
of the country Saturday night. He added that Imperatori would not
resist and would cooperate with any investigation, and that even if
he were deported, he would be willing to return to the United
States to testify in the spy case. The State Department did not
respond immediately to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary confrontation, breaking the normal standards
of diplomatic conduct and forgoing the routine tit-for-tat
expulsions that are the norm when diplomats are entangled in
charges of espionage, comes at a time when the United States and
Cuba are also embroiled in a dispute over whether to return a Cuban
boy to his father in Cuba or allow him to stay with relatives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Cuban interests section, Fernando Remirez de
Estenoz, said at a news conference at the diplomatic mission here
Saturday that the arrest of the American immigration official and
the move to expel Imperatori were connected to the custody battle
over the boy, Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest and expulsion order, Remirez said, took place just
days before a court case concerning the boy, although the United
States contends that the charges involving Imperatori and the
American official ``went on for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agent, Mariano M. Faget, is a senior official in
the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Remirez said that the accusations made against both Imperatori and
Faget were false.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori said in a letter to the head of the mission:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Comrade Remirez,
</P>
<P>
   ``I am addressing you to submit my resignation, as of this
moment, to my position and functions in our beloved interests
section and to the prerogatives therein. I have decided to stay in
America, assuming all the necessary risks and consequences, to
struggle against the slanders that hurt my honor, and that of the
interests section in Washington and my own homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by Felix Wilson Hernandez, the deputy chief
of the diplomatic mission, Imperatori said: ``I have become the
victim of a major slander. I have been wrongly accused of doing
intelligence work in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that one factor compelling him to waive his diplomatic
immunity and stay in the United States was his wish to disprove the
accusations against Faget.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government had issued an expulsion order for Imperatori
last Saturday, giving him until 1:30 p.m. this Saturday to leave
the country or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could have avoided arrest by staying inside the
interest section, an embassy in all but name that operates under
the auspices of the Swiss Embassy in Washington, he chose instead
to spend the day at his apartment in suburban Bethesda, Md., where
it would be easy to arrest him. Schmoke pointedly gave out the
street address and apartment number at a televised news conference
Saturday .
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was first accused of espionage after the FBI arrested
Faget and charged him with espionage on Feb. 17.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It is not insignificant that William D. Powers,
the feared and powerful chairman of the New York state Republican
Party, was one of only 87 marines stationed in Cuba on the day the
Cuban missile crisis broke out. And although reinforcements arrived
within hours, Powers said, he spent much of the next few days in a
foxhole awaiting nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good odds, though,'' said Powers, 58, in his coolest
hey-no-problem voice. ``Eighty-seven marines can create a lot of
havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   Which immediately brings him to the present task: facing down
the New York presidential primary, a potential humiliation for a
state Republican Party that embraced Gov. George W. Bush and then
fought, to ridicule and ultimate failure, to keep the surging Sen.
John McCain off the ballot. Now, with less than two weeks to go
before the March 7 vote, Powers, along with Gov. George Pataki, is
under enormous pressure to deliver the state for Bush _ not only to
avoid the embarrassment of defeat, but also to help ensure that
there is a Bush administration so that New York Republicans can
count on appointments and influence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Powers has to keep up the pressure on his
stubborn U.S. Senate candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to campaign
more upstate. On his flank he is deflecting sniper fire from an
ambitious party guerrilla, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, who
continues to insist to disbelief that he may challenge Giuliani in
a Republican primary. Powers is also trying to hold down the
fighting on another front within his own party, notably between
Pataki and the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, who,
when asked how he was getting along with Governor Pataki,
responded, ``Governor who?''
</P>
<P>
   Not least, there is the tension between Giuliani and Pataki,
plus the complications of Powers' own relationship with each man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I have problems,'' Powers said one afternoon
last week in his Albany foxhole, a historic four-story brownstone
near the Capitol that serves as the state party headquarters. ``I
really don't have any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask him.
</P>
<P>
   On Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University, for example, and
whether its Christian conservatism and anti-Catholic leanings will
alienate the large numbers of Catholics in New York, Powers was
sanguine. ``I would suppose from a PR point of view that maybe it
wasn't the best thing,'' he said. But, ``I know George W. Bush, I
spent quite of bit of time with him. I don't believe that there's
any bias, I think he's a good man, and I don't believe that voters
are going to hold that against him.''
</P>
<P>
   On his fight to keep McCain off the ballot, which critics
compared to Soviet politics, Powers was without remorse. ``He came
into New York, didn't go through the petition process, got people,
and sued us,'' Powers said. ``So I'm on the defensive the minute he
walks in. So which cheek do you want me to kiss him on? The party
is being attacked. What am I going to do? Lay down, or roll over?''
</P>
<P>
   On Giuliani's campaign, and the anxieties of Republican county
chairmen that the mayor has been AWOL upstate, Powers was relaxed.
``We've not had a problem moving him around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And on his own relationship with Giuliani, the man who in 1994
endorsed Powers' arch-enemy, Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, Powers
was straightforward. ``You and I can pick something to fight about
all day. We're going to get tired of doing that,'' he said, adding,
``So you're better off putting that behind and saying, `We don't
agree, we didn't agree, and we didn't do very well on that.' And
that's kind of, maybe, how Rudy and I get along.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ballot fight, Powers was largely invisible, but in
the last week has begun to endure interviews in the interest of
promoting the idea that the state Republican Party is not imploding
and that his political organization can handle the challenge of
McCain. ``I don't like to do this stuff,'' Powers said, noting that
in the old days he was so desirous of press attention that he once
held a news conference accusing Cuomo of stealing his car. But
after the party defeated Cuomo, Powers said, ``I didn't think that
was my job anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Today his main job is to make sure that his 62 county chairmen
line up enough bodies to get out the Republican vote, work the
phone banks and blanket the state with leaflets. ``You want to win,
or you want to lose?'' Powers said. ``There's no second place in
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say that nobody is better at winning than Powers,
a former aide to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato who took over the state party
after it had been left for dead in the 1990 election, when the
Republican candidate for governor, Pierre Rinfret, finished a far
second to Cuomo and left the party more than $2 million in debt.
Rep. John Sweeney, a Republican from Albany, remembers that on the
day in 1991 that Powers assumed his duties, among the well-wishers
at the hotel ceremony was a man with a subpoena, who very
unceremoniously thrust it into Powers' hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party was so in debt, the creditors were beginning to
seize property,'' Sweeney said. ``It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, Powers and his patron, D'Amato, built the
party from the ground up as they assembled one of the most
prodigious political fund-raising machines in the country. Powers
began to be compared to an old-style Tammany Hall political boss
and played a big role in promoting the gubernatorial candidacy of
an obscure former mayor of Peekskill, Pataki, who upon election in
1994 became Powers' biggest success story. Of course, Powers lost
races, too, including the 1998 re-election campaign of D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And now, should McCain win?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about that,'' Powers insisted. ``That's
negative. I think about what I have to do to win.'' For years, he
said, he kept a picture of Cuomo in his office. ``And everybody
thought I was crazy,'' Powers said. ``Hung right there.'' And they
said, ```How in the world can you have a picture of Mario Cuomo up
there?' I said, `Because I think about what it takes to beat him
all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he had not yet festooned his mantle with a picture
of the first lady.

 &HT;    Changing families, wavering political loyalties

   TROTWOOD, Ohio _ Traditional politics is losing its hold on
American families.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Melson family of Trotwood.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, 51, is a Democrat, his wife, Connie Lucas-Melson, 48, a
Republican. They have a blended family, with nine children ranging
in age from 15 to 31 and in politics from Democrat to Republican to
those who don't know what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has three kids from past relationships. Connie's first
marriage produced four children _ two from childbirth, one by
adoption and one is a foster son. The couple, who married in 1996,
is now raising two teen-age foster sons. But when they talk about
any of their children, they only use the words son or daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't the typical family in terms of what society portrays
as family, but we promote love, education and self respect, things
that too many families are missing,'' Lucas-Melson said.
</P>
<P>
   America is full of families like the Melsons. Families are less
traditional and less predictable politically. No longer can
Democrats assume if you're a minority you're a Democrat. Soccer
moms, the great symbol of the last presidential election, are part
of the expanding middle that determines who wins and who loses.
Fewer young people look to mom and dad when deciding how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this new politics it doesn't matter where you come from or
what you were before, it's what you want to get now,'' Lucas-Melson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Political loyalties still have a hold on many families.
Fifty-six percent of Miami Valley residents said they are
registered in the same political party as their parents, according
to a Dayton Daily News poll. But, nearly a third _ 29 percent _
said they were not, and 15 percent said they didn't know or didn't
answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American family is really changing in fairly dramatic
ways,'' said John Green, a political scientist at the University of
Akron. ``People are marrying late. A lot of people don't get
married. People are living longer. Divorce is very high. I'm not
sure we quite understand where it's heading.''
</P>
<P>
   This much seems certain: Changing family dynamics present
difficult _ and expensive _ challenges for political parties and
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just run candidates out there and say `vote for them
because he or she is a Democrat,' it doesn't work that way
anymore,'' said Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery County
Democratic party. ``Families and their children are constantly
changing, as parties we have to prove ourselves in every election.
You can't dictate or rule by fear anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Melson is one of those Democrats who doesn't like being taken
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood would find it difficult creating a black American
Democrat that could match Melson's life.
</P>
<P>
   He picked cotton with his grandma on a Georgia plantation.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he was plucked from rioting streets by a
well-known Dayton civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnam soldier thrust into combat, he hated the war and the
Republican president who wouldn't send him home.
</P>
<P>
   A former union boss and prison counselor, Melson has never voted
for a Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If Vice President Al Gore or any other Democrat could take for
granted at least one vote in November, you would expect it to come
from Melson.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional politics now mean little to Melson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become more radical in my voting over the last few years.
I just don't give my vote to the Democrats any more because they
are on the ticket or because I'm black,'' Melson said. ``Hell, I
might even vote for McCain. In my eyes I don't see a whole a lot of
difference between the Democrats and Republicans anymore. But I
promise you that I'm gonna make them work for my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News poll, conducted from January 5-9, underscored
some of the challenges facing both political parties in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how interested they'd be in politics if there wasn't
a political system with two dominant parties, 84 percent said
they'd be just as interested or more interested, the poll found.
Only 13 percent said they would be less interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican and I will always have some sense of loyalty
toward the party,'' said Mike Kitchen, a 38-year-old father of
three who participated in the Daily News poll. ``But like most
people, a big part of my vote is based on the issues that affect me
and my family. For me, it's tax relief, education and family
values. Whoever rates best in those areas gets my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Melsons are not the Waltons or even the Cosby family.
</P>
<P>
   When Connie Lucas-Melson was raised in West Dayton in the early
1960s, her politics were already decided _ or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother preached that blacks and working people supported
Democrats. Republicans were only rich and white.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking changed for Connie as a 12-year-old school girl
when she played the role of a Republican as part of a civics
project. Her seventh-grade teacher took her class to a downtown
campaign rally held by Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, who was
supported by the local black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I decided right then to become a
Republican. I thought if the Republicans are so bad, then they need
more black people in the party to make a change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to support the ``white party'' wasn't popular with
her black friends as a teen-ager. They questioned her loyalty to
Dr. Martin Luther King and the on-going civil rights movement. They
challenged her to stay black. She challenged them to think for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always wanted me to separate my blackness from my
politics and I won't do that for anybody,'' said Lucas-Melson,
whose living room resembles a memorial to Dr. King, Malcolm X and
her African-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas-Melson's political ambitions in the Republican party have
moved far beyond her seventh-grade civics project. In the mid-1970s
she helped recruit blacks to the Montgomery County Republican Party
as a member of the Young Republican West group and helped run
campaigns for black candidates. In the 1980s she was the 2nd vice
president of the Ohio Republican council. And most recently she
served eight years as the 2nd vice president on the Montgomery
County Republican Party's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas-Melson's political involvement has now taken a back
seat to her marriage and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love politics, but it's a lot tougher for families to stay
involved with everything else going on in your life,'' she said.
Still, in a time when 30 million people are glued to a single game
show and worrying about how many lifelines someone has left, the
Melsons find time to talk and debate politics.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about education, Clinton, gun control, and other
issues, but the conversation often centers on racism and why the
world still seems so black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Melson doesn't understand why a baseball player would
publicly degrade blacks, gays, and just about anyone who isn't a
white male. Why the Ku Klux Klan gets so much attention from the
media. Or how in the late 1990s three guys in Texas could tie a
black man to a pick-up truck and drag him to his death.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Melson was recruited by C.J. McLin Jr., a
legendary Ohio politician from Dayton, to lead a local youth patrol
that would help prevent street riots during the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Melson said McLin and Art Thomas, his other mentor, a Dayton
civil rights leader in the 1960s who went on to become president of
Central State University, bombarded him with messages of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope 30 years ago was that all the hating would stop.
Politics hasn't helped bring people together because everyone has
to be labeled something like white conservative, black liberal and
so on,'' Melson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the young people who are oblivious to what's
going on in the world. We had the war, the civil rights movement,
Watergate and all that stuff that had the country wrapped for
politics. What do today's kids care about?''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Sam and Connie's sons have the answer to their dad's
question.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitchell and Lukinte Lucas admit that their world revolves
around their careers, bodies, bigger bank accounts or a new car.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 27, is a graduate of the prestigious Pennsylvania
University Wharton School of Business with a degree in economics
and already has an annual income of $67,000. He works as an account
executive for an advertising and printing company in Evansville,
Ind., and spends several weeks a year traveling around the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell uses the Internet every day to keep track of
technology, business and Wall Street, but politics isn't part of
his daily browsing. He drives an SUV, but says his next car will be
a Cadillac. When he's not on-line or working, he can be found in
the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the economy doing well? Yes it is, and I'm doing well, so
that's pretty much what I need to know about politics right now,''
Mitchell Lucas said. ``That's the main reason I don't want to go
back to school or even think about having children right now,
because there's a lot of money to be made in this economy. The bulk
of my time is spent on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is a registered Republican, but admits that he voted
for President Clinton because of the thriving economy. He plans to
vote in November and the candidate promising the biggest tax cuts
will likely get his vote.
</P>
<P>
   While money and career are driving his current life, Mitchell
believes politics and marriage will eventually become higher
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to come back home some day and become mayor of
Dayton,'' he said. ``My mom was so into politics when we were
growing up, but my brothers and I never really talked about it. I
couldn't even tell you if they are Democrats or Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's brother Lukinte isn't sure whether he's a registered
Independent, Democrat or Republican, but it really doesn't matter
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always vote, you have too, that's something I learned
from my mom, but nothing about politics seems real,'' Lukinte said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukinte, 22, lives in Atlanta and spends most of his time trying
to launch a music career. He is a Rap and R&AMP;B performer and also
owns a small company that promotes concerts in Atlanta-area clubs.
When he's not rapping, he's listening to rappers like DMX and JZ.
</P>
<P>
   He watches the news and believes Gore will take on Texas Gov.
George W. Bush for the presidency in November. But he has never
heard of John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to take care of your own life,'' he said,
``it's hard to keep up with everything going on in the country.''

 &HT;    Different generations, different politics
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, Ohio _ He was born during World War I, walks with steel
knees and survived open heart surgery with six bypasses. Kitchen
towels wrapped around his boots keep him from slipping as he walks
a visitor up a snow-covered hill on his 215-acre farm, proudly
pointing out the creek that runs through the property, the
farmhouse built before the Civil War and the gazebo constructed
with family labor.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching the top of the hill, William Henry Otto
Baudendistel pledges his allegiance to God, family, farming and
Republicans _ not necessarily in that order. In between breaths he
grumbles about the ``good men'' disappearing from politics.
Coolidge, Ike, Reagan, Bush _ these were presidents that embodied
character, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And then the visitor leaks the family secret: His son Tom and
his grandson Tommy voted for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They voted for who? That ... Clinton? My God, I thought I
taught them better than that,'' he says with no trace of a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The Baudendistels, like many American families, pass on their
homes, recipes and heirlooms from generation to generation, but not
their politics.
</P>
<P>
   Children aren't looking toward mom and dad anymore to tell them
how to vote. And in some families, children don't even tell mom and
dad how they vote. Families are more diverse, more politically
independent, more complex.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the family have become the politics of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Baudendistels are a family drenched in tradition and
history. They are farmers, Catholics and craftsmen. Their holiday
reunions resemble a small town festival.
</P>
<P>
   But their political views don't match their personal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   William and his wife Margaret are hard-line conservatives. Tom
and his wife Sandy are Democrats, but don't consider themselves
liberals. Tommy and wife Lyn are Republicans, but consider
themselves moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dirt in our blood from my grandfather, but we didn't
get his politics,'' Tommy said. ``I respect my father and
grandfather, but I decided to support a candidate or party based on
my own life and beliefs, not theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   TRADITION, HISTORY AND FAMILY VALUES
</P>
<P>
   William Baudendistel, 85, says he was Republican, before he
really knew what it meant to be a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid you didn't wait around for hand-outs from the
government or anyone else, you got your butt out there and hunted
for work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression was pummeling his family's income and
William wasn't earning any money sitting in a school house. So he
quit school at the age of 14 and got his big break a few years
later when a roofing company agreed to pay him 30 cents a day to
make shingles.
</P>
<P>
   He married his sweetheart Margaret and went to work on a dairy
farm.
</P>
<P>
   But to get his own farm William borrowed $13,000 in 1946 _
$10,000 from his father-in-law, $2,000 from his sister-in-law and
$1,000 from the guy who bought his milk. The $13,000 included 126
acres and a farm house. They later added 90 more acres for
$120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put everything we had and everything we didn't have into
the farm and this old house,'' said Margaret, 82. ``We raised it
all here. Seven kids, hundreds of cows, corn, wheat and more
memories than my walls can keep track of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baudendistels, who have been married 63 years, estimate the
farm's value at about $10 million, but have never considered
putting up a 'For Sale' sign. William stopped milking cows a few
years ago and now rents portions of the farm for other families to
work.
</P>
<P>
   William and Margaret spend much of their time keeping up with 17
grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren. Traditional Catholic
family values mean everything to the couple. ``A lot of these
politicians come at you with this idea or this plan, but that stuff
means nothing if his character smells like the cow pasture,''
William said. ``I learned my lesson on Democrats with (John F.)
Kennedy. I really liked him and then he started all that womanizing
and carrying on.''
</P>
<P>
   William is supporting George W. Bush over John McCain because he
sees him as a true conservative. He likes McCain's military record
but doesn't like his one-time reputation as a playboy. He likes
Bush's dedication to cutting taxes and government spending, and
thinks he mirrors his father's commitment to family values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think anymore. The country votes out
George Bush, a great man of character devoted to his family, after
one term, and then we keep the disgrace we have in the White House
now for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   FROM REPUBLICAN NEST TO KENNEDY
</P>
<P>
   Once he graduated from high school and left the family farm, it
didn't take Tom Baudendistel long to become what his father didn't
like. Tom traded his farm chores for a union card and went to work
at the General Motors Corp. factory on Home Avenue in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of United Rubber Workers Local 817, which has
since been molded into the United Steel Workers of America. Tom
worked in the plant for 14 years before his dad finally set foot in
the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad didn't want to know much about the plant or what I did, he
hates unions and I was a union guy,'' said Tom, who retired from
GM's Delphi Chassis plant after 30 years. ``I think my dad, like a
lot of people, resented how much GM was paying us back then. It was
a lot more than he could pay people to work on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom was also a Democrat. As a teen he was captured by the glow
of President John F. Kennedy and vividly remembers Kennedy's 1961
inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking what I could do for my country after I heard that
speech,'' he said. ``The country believed in him and that both
(inspired) and scared a lot of people. For me it was like a member
of my family died the day he got shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, now 56, has been married to his high school sweetheart,
Sandy, for 35 years. They have two grown sons, Tommy and David.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy, 55, also worked full-time most of her life and together
with Tom helped put their sons through college. Then, in 1993, a
week before Tommy and Lyn's wedding, Sandy learned she had breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Except for her husband, she didn't tell family members about her
illness until after her son's honeymoon. She used radiation
treatment to eventually beat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics don't mean a whole lot during a time like that,'' Tom
said.
</P>
<P>
   The scare not only shook the family but changed the family's
political priorities, putting health care issues on the front
burner.
</P>
<P>
   Lifelong Democrats, Tom and Sandy now say they are undecided on
their choices for president, and Tom says he may even vote for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that will get me back in my dad's will,'' Tom said with
a smile.
</P>
<P>
   CONCENTRATION ON ISSUES, NOT POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Baudendistel didn't inherit his dad's blue collar.
</P>
<P>
   He was the preppy fraternity brother at the University of Dayton
who earned both a bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical
engineering and is working on his Ph.D. He helped local Republicans
put up yard signs for their campaigns, loved Ronald Reagan and
enjoys debating politics with his Republican friends.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he now earns over $60,000 a year working as a design
engineer for Delphi Automotive's chassis division in Dayton. He has
become a moderate Republican and is hoping McCain becomes the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I are very different people, we vote don't vote the
same way and believe in different things, but so what? We still
love and respect each other,'' Tommy said. ``My grandfather grew up
during the Depression, my dad was a teen-ager during the '60s and I
was raised in the '80s. Of course, our politics is going to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But politics is hardly the top priority for Tommy and his wife
Lyn. The couple have been married for six years and are raising two
young daughters. Lyn works part-time and they are slowly restoring
and renovating a Baudendistel family farm house in Farmersville.
</P>
<P>
   They hire a baby sitter on Monday evenings, but instead of
dinner and a movie, the couple can be found in their basement
installing insulation or in an upstairs hallway blowing out walls.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have time to study Al Gore's health care plan or
ponder whether George W. Bush would make a good commander and chief
for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Their votes hinge more on issues than politics. Lyn wants a
president who is firmly pro-choice and will fight for equal rights
for women. Tommy wants a ``true education president'' who will work
to fix public schools and at the same time supports a voucher
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, become a parent, your views of politics and
what's really important tend to change,'' Lyn said. ``Our
generation has it easy. We are so lucky that we only have to worry
about ourselves. I don't think people today care as much as they
used to because they really haven't had to sacrifice.''

Texas routs Texas A&AMP;M, awaits Kansas 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas took a break from the Big 12 championship war
long enough to record what has become an automatic victory in the
once-and-perhaps-future competitive series with Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a career-high 20 points from forward Chris Owens and a
smothering defensive performance from guard Will Clay on flashy
Aggies rookie Bernard King, the No. 14 Longhorns disposed of A&AMP;M
yesterday, 85-58.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, that's 14 in a row over the Aggies (7-18, 3-11)
and 23 of the past 25. Texas (20-7) hit the 20-victory mark for the
first time since 1996. The Longhorns bumped their Big 12 record to
11-3, helped wipe away the memory of] Tuesday's loss at Iowa State
and turned their focus toward tomorrow night's visit by No. 23
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iowa State game has been made in some reports like it was
the end of our season,'' said Chris Mihm, who, with 21 points and
10 rebounds, recorded a conference-leading 17th double-double. ``It
was definitely a big loss, but we're not going to lose our
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a day off to settle things, two great practices and we
totally put it behind us. We gave great effort and had a lot of fun
today. This was what we needed. We played hard and controlled the
game from start to finish. We play like we did today and we'll be
in good shape Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens had eight rebounds in addition to his 20 points against
the Aggies, who were missing center Aaron Jack. He fainted from
apparent dehydration in the dressing room at halftime of
Wednesday's game at Kansas State. While Owens and Mihm were
dominating inside yesterday, Clay put the clamps on King.
</P>
<P>
   King carried a 17-point average into the game, but had averaged
25 points in his past four games, connecting on 17 of 40 3-point
shots. He finished with 13 points yesterday on 5-for-20 shooting,
including 3-for-9 from beyond the arc. But he scored just eight
points against Clay, whose 16 points were one shy of his season
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge guarding Bernard,'' said Clay, who started
in place of slumping guard Lawrence Williams. ``It's my job to
bring energy to this team and guard the other team's best
\Rperimeter\S player. Bernard is a great player and I took it as a
challenge. I just tried to play hard and bring energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow's game looms large for the Longhorns for seeding
purposes, both for the Big 12 and NCAA tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game this time of year is important,'' said UT coach
Rick Barnes, whose team led by as much as 36 (79-43). ``Today's
game was important. They're all big because at this time of the
year you're dealing with mental makeup, the momentum you want to
get going and you've got to play good hard basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've responded well this season after losses. I liked the way
we worked the game today. Not to take anything away from Iowa
State, but we got away from our plan up there. Today we stayed with
what we needed to do. We know Kansas is a young team, but they're
very talented and they've played a great schedule like we have.
They've been battle-tested, and we've got to be ready to lay it out
there on Monday.''

CONNECTICUT WOMEN TOPPLE IRISH FOR TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Since joining the Big East in 1995, the Notre
Dame women's basketball team had beaten every team in the
conference except one: Connecticut. And if the Fighting Irish were
to do it, Saturday seemed the opportune time.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Notre Dame had won 20 straight games _ the longest
winning streak in Division I _ and was ranked fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 6-foot-5-inch junior center Ruth Riley and the freshman
point guard Alicia Ratay, the Irish had two of the best players in
the Big East and, indeed, in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame saved its worst game of the season for a showdown
confrontation with top-ranked Connecticut in a game that was to
decide the Big East championship.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing from the start, and with Riley held to only one field
goal before fouling out with just under five minutes left, the
Irish lost their 11th straight game to UConn, 77-59, before a
capacity crowd of 16,294 at the Hartford Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen turnovers, including six by Riley, who came into the
game averaging 16.5 points but scored only four, hurt the Fighting
Irish (24-3 overall and 15-1 in the Big East).
</P>
<P>
   So did seven blocked shots by Connecticut (26-1, 15-0), four of
them by center Kelly Schumacher, who, surprisingly, outscored
(eight points to four) and outrebounded Riley, a potential
all-American and Big East player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 16 points in the second half, Notre
Dame drew within six points at 58-52 with 4 minutes and 45 seconds
left in the game on Niele Ivey's fourth 3-pointer and two free
throws by Ratay, who, like Ivey, finished with 17 points, a total
matched by Connecticut's Shea Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   But then UConn went on an 11-2 run keyed by three baskets by
point guard Sue Bird, who wound up with 14 points on 6-of-9
shooting, which effectively put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, in Connecticut's second-to-last regular-season
game, gave the Huskies their seventh consecutive Big East title and
guaranteed them the top-seeded spot in the Big East tournament,
which begins March 4 at Storrs, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, hitting its first three shots, spurted to an 8-0
lead at the start on layups by Ralph _ the second off a
behind-the-back pass by Bird _ and Swin Cash and a follow by
Schumacher off a missed jumper by Svetlana Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three minutes elapsed before Notre Dame scored on point
guard Ivey's first of two 3-pointers in the half. Then, two free
throws by Riley narrowed UConn's margin to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as the Irish got in the half, and the two
free throws were the only points scored by Riley, who came into the
game averaging 16.5 points. Adding to that, Notre Dame's
second-leading scorer, Ratay, managed only one field goal in the
half. The freshman, who entered the game averaging 15.6 points a
game, hit a 3-pointer with just under five minutes left before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Ratay's 3-pointer, followed by Ivey's second, trimmed the
Huskies' lead to 22-15 with 4:13 left in the half. But then UConn
finished with an 11-4 run to take a 33-19 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the sloppily-played half, marked by 13 Notre Dame turnovers,
four of them by Riley, the Irish made only seven of 25 shots for 28
percent, while UConn connected on 13 of 29 for 44.8 percent, with
Ralph leading the way with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   With Riley getting off only two shots in the half, Notre Dame
managed only four points in the paint over the first 20 minutes
while the Huskies tallied 22, including four by Schumacher, who
also had five rebounds.

GORE GOES INTO THIN AIR IN NEW TV SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be called ``Al's Excellent Adventure.'' Last summer,
Vice President Al Gore and his son, Albert Jr., climbed to the top
of 14,000-foot Mount Rainier in Washington. In this new 30-second
spot that began running Saturday, Jim Frush, the president of the
American Alpine Club and the climber who led the expedition,
recounts the experience.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Century Media Group
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Shots of Frush, alternating with pictures of Gore
and company, in full climbing gear, on the snow-covered mountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Frush: Before I guided Al Gore and his son to the summit
of Mount Rainier, I knew him primarily for his environmental
positions, not as a person. But you get to know somebody in the
mountains: how they react to pressure, how they handle adversity.
And we had a very tough climb. Terrible conditions. A lot of people
turned back, but Al, he didn't want to quit. He wanted to try to
get to the top. And we made it, safely. Strength of character,
perseverance, grace under pressure _ these are qualities you look
for in a mountaineer; they're even better in a president.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: As in any situation in which one sits through the
slides from someone else's vacation, the pictures say it all.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: In taking up one of the hardiest of ``in'' pastimes,
give Gore an A for trend-spotting. The sight of Gore trudging into
thin air is intended, of course, to establish his rugged, outdoorsy
credentials, at a time when he is seeking to solidify his image as
a protector of the nation's natural resources _ an image that
environmentalists say he deserves. The spot expresses a
vigorousness that is missing in most political commercials, and
certainly provides a vivid contrast to the many television
advertisements that feature his opponent, Bill Bradley, looking a
little tired as he sits in a chair and talks about his philosophy.
As with many of Gore's attempts to seem a regular guy, though, the
script might appear to some viewers to lay it on a bit thick,
especially when Frush gives the impression that getting to one kind
of summit makes one more suitable to capture another.

AFTER A FALL, PANTANI GETS BACK ON THE BIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Over eight months after he was stripped of certain
victory in the Giro d'Italia, the world's second-ranked bicycle
race, a troubled Marco Pantani has finally come out of seclusion
and returned to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Other Italians say that Pantani, 30, the winner of both the Giro
and the Tour de France in 1998, remains despondent. In remarks
before he briefly started racing in the Tour of Valencia last week,
he did little to contradict that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worrying about my return,'' he began, jauntily enough,
at a news conference in Spain. ``I'm not afraid. I've never been
afraid,'' and here he changed tone, ``even if recently I've felt
very isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to news reports, he dealt with a question about
whether he had contemplated retirement after he was ousted from the
Giro because the red cells in his blood exceeded the maximum
permitted level, an indication of drug use. A second test of the
hematocrit, or red-corpuscle count, in his blood sample confirmed
the finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that I thought about it,'' he said of retirement.
``I had my doubts. But in the end, I couldn't do anything but
return to bicycle racing. I don't know how to do anything else but
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he cut short his return, failing to appear at the
start of the race's third daily stage on Thursday. His next
scheduled appearance is in the Clasica de Almeria in Spain on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His fall from grace has been cataclysmic. The 5-foot-7-inch,
132-pound Pantani is the sport's swiftest and most explosive
climber. That power had put him in the pink jersey of the Giro's
leader with two days left in the three-week race when he failed the
blood test last June 5.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was arguably the most popular person in Italy _
il campionissimo, the champion of champions, as he was called after
he won the Giro and the Tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After his ouster, Pantani, who rides for the Mercatone Uno team
in Italy with a shaved head covered by a bandanna, a ring in his
left ear and the nickname of the Pirate, went from the life of a
hero to one of a recluse.
</P>
<P>
   Until he showed up in Valencia, Spain, he had not raced since
his disgrace. Last July, he refused to ride in the Tour de France,
in which he was the defending champion, saying that the course did
not please him and that he was in no mood to compete. Then in
October he skipped the world championships in Verona, Italy, that
were not far from his home and were over a course that was ideal
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the presentation in Rome of the course for this year's
Giro drew him out of seclusion last fall. Pleading a cold, he
stayed away, and his name was barely mentioned during the ceremony.
The reason is that he continues to be investigated by Italian court
officials who are looking into the use of illegal
performance-enhancing drugs in sports.
</P>
<P>
   What Pantani failed is technically not a drug test. Introduced
in 1997 ostensibly to safeguard riders' health, the test hints at
the use of the synthetic hormone EPO, which bolsters red blood
cells and thus the amount of oxygen that is carried to muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani's troubles did not end with the Giro ouster.
Investigators next focused on his hospital records from an incident
four years earlier. Pantani had to learn to walk again after he was
hit by a car during the Milan-Turin race late in 1995. His left leg
was fractured and he was on crutches for the rest of that season
and most of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The records showed that Pantani's red-corpuscle count at the
time was 60.1 percent, far above the 50 percent limit. When an
Italian prosecutor summoned him in November for questioning,
Pantani invoked his right to silence. He has been placed under
formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a panel of experts appointed by the prosecutor to
examine Pantani's blood sample in the 1999 Giro dismissed his
explanation that his elevated hematocrit level there was the result
of dehydration or natural causes. Instead, the experts ruled that
he could have been using EPO.
</P>
<P>
   While he was still riding in the Tour of Valencia, which ended
Saturday, Pantani refused to comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just passed through a very negative period,'' he said
earlier in Spain. ``But I've learned a lot these last few months.
I'm here to race, because I want to race. I feel relieved now
because the most important thing is simply to be back.''

<P>
   SUFFERN, N.Y. _ Now in its 23rd year, the World Fishing and
Outdoor Exposition will return to the Rockland Community College
Fieldhouse on Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, most comprehensive and most durable affair of its
kind in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area, the show
focuses on fishing, hunting and outdoor equipment, much of which
can be bought at special show discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Expo, as it is known, has also for a long time included special
exhibits of live birds and animals. This year the New York Raptor
Project will have a number of live wild birds of prey on hand,
including eagles, falcons, hawks and owls.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer to the show will be Brody, a 1,200-pound, 4-year-old
Kodiak brown bear. Brody's present home is in Indiana, where he
lives with his owner and trainer, Jeff Watson. According to the
Expo's manager, Paul Fuller, Brody has quite a few entertainment
credits on his resume, including a television appearance on
``Walker, Texas Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a chance to ogle, and perhaps even fondle,
the latest fishing, hunting, boating and camping equipment,
showgoers can talk with guides, outfitters, charter-boat skippers,
lodge and resort operators from the United States and Canada. It is
an excellent opportunity to arrange an outdoors adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Expo's seminar series, generally devoted to
fishing and casting instruction, hunting and the habits of such
creatures as deer and wild turkeys, have been well attended. They
take place every day and are open to all ticket-holders at no extra
charge. Schedules are handed out at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Hite, a professional black bass tournament angler and
winner of the 1999 Bass Masters Classic, will conduct three
seminars, two on Saturday and one next Sunday. Additional insights
into how experts catch black bass will be provided in other
seminars, two on Thursday and two on Friday by the ``Hawg Trough
Team.'' Doug Hannon, who calls himself The Bass Professor, will
dispense more black bass lore over the weekend with presentations
titled ``Understanding Bass Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a fly-casting demonstration and lecture by Frank
Angelo each day. Also scheduled for a seminar session each day is
Peter Fiduccia, an author and well-known expert on the habits of
whitetail deer. Hunters might also wish to attend one of Kevin
Kreh's whitetail deer seminars as well as one of those presided
over by Craig Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   The Kreh seminars will include insights into ``the Rompola Buck
Story.'' This story, which has been given considerable attention in
hunting publications and newspapers, involves a whitetail buck with
a huge set of antlers that was killed with bow and arrow by Mitch
Rompola in his native Michigan in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rompola has said that the buck exceeds the present Boone and
Crockett Club record for a typical whitetail rack, held by Milo
Hanson, a Saskatchewan farmer, who shot the animal on his own land
in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Boone and Crockett Club founded in 1887 by President
Theodore Roosevelt and others to promote conservation of big game
animals and their habitat, began in 1932 to keep trophy records of
animals taken in North America. Scoring involves meticulous
measurements of the antlers, including the circumference of the
main beams and their spread, the length of the points and the
symmetry of the antlers.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Rompola has not applied for Boone and Crockett
recognition. Kreh, a friend of Rompola, will presumably elaborate
on this decision.
</P>
<P>
   Other seminars include black powder deer hunting by Dave Ehrig;
trophy striped bass fishing with Bob Rochetta; offshore fishing
with Capt. Matt Muzlay; and ``Finding Fish Wherever You Go'' by
Mike Laptew, who is, among other things, a superb underwater
photographer. Manny Luftglass has a seminar on fishing New Jersey's
Lake Hopatcong and another on fishing the tidal portions of that
state's rivers and its bays.
</P>
<P>
   New to the show this year are six dioramas _ provided by Halley
Caller Wildlife Calls _ of all the subspecies of North American
wild turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The show also has two angling competitions. On Sunday there will
be a casting contest, with prizes awarded, for youngsters,
sponsored by the Westchester Rod and Reel Bassmasters, and every
day of the show those so inclined may take part in a simulated big
game fishing tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Rod bent and line peeling off the reel, contestants will respond
as well as they can while a computerized scoring machine measures
how well they fight the big game fish that is cavorting before them
on a television screen.

CRITICISM FOR LAW BARRING FOSTER PARENTS WITH FELONIES IN PAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under a far-reaching new federal law designed to
protect children's safety, New York state officials for the first
time are conducting criminal background checks on all current and
prospective foster and adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, children's advocates and some government officials
contend, youngsters are being removed from otherwise stable foster
homes without regard to their parents' fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Two State Family Court judges have declared the state's
interpretation of the federal law unconstitutional, allowing a
woman with a 21-year-old manslaughter conviction and a man
convicted of robbery more than 15 years ago to retain custody of
their foster children. The state attorney general, whose office is
authorized to defend the statute, has appealed neither ruling.
Several similar cases are pending statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, children from 44 foster homes in the city have been
taken away in the last several months, according to the
Administration for Children's Services, and children from at least
another 65 foster parents are about to be.
</P>
<P>
   The new law calls for what some people in child welfare circles
say should have been required long ago in New York. Until the
federal Adoption and Safe Families Act took effect a year ago, New
York was one of the few states where foster care agencies were
legally barred from conducting criminal background checks on foster
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a radical shift, all current and prospective foster and
adoptive parents are fingerprinted. If found to have been convicted
of any one of a list of felonies considered violent, from attempted
robbery to murder, they are automatically disqualified. Their
foster children must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of that mandatory provision has unleashed an
intense and sensitive debate over whether a convicted felon can be
a capable guardian. Lawyers for foster parents have argued that the
provision violates their right to due process, making it the first
piece of the far-reaching new law to be widely challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems to have made strange bedfellows. Gov. George
Pataki said last week that he planned to introduce a bill to give
judges or local social service officials flexibility to decide
whether someone convicted of a felony should retain custody of a
foster child. The Office of Court Administration, a state agency in
charge of the courts, has proposed allowing greater judicial
discretion in the matter. Even the Giuliani administration, hardly
known for being soft on crime, is drafting similar revisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Nicholas Scoppetta, the city's child
welfare commissioner, was careful to note his support for the
mandatory checks. But, he said, those presumed to be unfit parents
because of their criminal convictions should have a chance to prove
otherwise. ``In general, it's a very positive thing to do these
checks,'' he said. ``I just want to allow for exceptions to the
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the law took effect, lawyers for foster parents and
children have sought to declare it unconstitutional, often with the
backing of the very agencies that are required to remove the
children. The Legal Aid Society's Juvenile Rights Division is
seeking to file a class-action suit in State Supreme Court in
Manhattan on the question, although a judge has yet to certify it
as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates contend that to remove a child automatically,
without regard to how long ago the foster parent was convicted or
how well he or she has since cared for the child, can do more harm
than good. In many instances, they say, the convictions are old,
and the foster parents have proved to be able caretakers, providing
stable homes to children whose ties to their biological parents
were severed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Adoption and Safe Families Act went into effect last
February, New York has fingerprinted nearly 54,000 current and
aspiring foster and adoptive parents, as well as all adults in
their households, according to figures from the state Department of
Social Services. So far, 316 have been found to have convictions
that disqualify them.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3,770 have been convicted of discretionary crimes _
meaning foster care agencies can remove the children if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Because of court challenges, the removals of dozens of children
have been temporarily blocked, pending final decisions by Family
and Supreme Court judges statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the case of a 10-year-old girl in Brooklyn. Under
the new law she must be removed from the custody of her foster
parent, an aunt she calls ``Mommy'' who has cared for her for half
her life. A lawyer representing the foster mother painted a bleak
picture: taken as a toddler from her biological parents because of
drugs and domestic violence, the girl lived with a grandmother for
three years. When she died, the girl landed at her aunt's.
</P>
<P>
   In January, came the prospect of another shuffle. The foster
parent, whose lawyer declined to identify her, had been convicted
of two attempted robberies, 10 and 11 years ago. After a required
safety check, the foster agency in charge of her case recently
concluded that the child was not at risk, according to the foster
mother's lawyer, Lauren Shapiro, director of the Family Law Unit at
South Brooklyn Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the woman was told, the child would have to be removed.
At the request of the child's lawyer, a Family Court judge in
Brooklyn has issued a temporary reprieve, pending a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jacobs, a lawyer with the Legal Action Center, pointed to
the case of two boys who hopscotched through foster homes and group
homes before landing with a foster father in the Bronx two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name Jacobs declined to reveal, had been
convicted of attempted robbery in 1966. So the boys, he was
notified last fall, would have to be removed, notwithstanding the
favorable assessments of his care by the foster agency in charge of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' guardians, Jacobs said, plan to go to court to block
their removal. Once they do, Ms. Jacobs will argue that the
mandatory removal provision is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two Family Court judges, Philip C. Segal in Brooklyn and
George J. Pulver Jr. in upstate Greene County, have agreed,
declaring that the mandatory removal provision denies due process.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brooklyn case, Segal has allowed the woman convicted of
manslaughter _ named in court papers as Gwendolyn Grant _ to adopt
four nieces. ``Irrebuttable statutory presumptions created by the
Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) violated state and federal
constitutional due process requirements,'' his September decision
concluded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Greene County, Pulver ruled that an old criminal conviction
should not automatically disqualify a man, whom he called Richard
C. Benson, using a pseudonym, from continuing to serve as a foster
father to three young brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, whose ties to their biological parents were severed by
the courts, have been with Benson and his wife, Alicia, for more
than two years. But when the couple sought to adopt the children,
identified in court papers as Corey, Steven and John, they were
told they could not. Benson had been convicted of armed robbery in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   The man's criminal record was no secret to the foster care
agency that handled his case, according to the parents' lawyer,
Joseph Stanzione. The couple was well known in their community as
able caretakers, he said, so much so that social service officials
living nearby sometimes entrusted them to baby-sit their own
children. In court, they testified on the couple's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The foster parents ultimately prevailed. ``It is absolutely
clear to this court that Richard has fully rehabilitated himself
from his long-ago life of crime and is a positive role model,''
Pulver wrote in his decision. ``It is equally clear that
petitioners are the best thing that ever happened to Corey, Steven
and John and that it is in the children's best interests to become
petitioners' legal sons through adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   The adoption proceedings are continuing.

remarkable metamorphosis, from a battered ex-pilot on crutches to a
new congressman, is among the least-known chapters of his storybook
life. (The New York Times)

left Hollywood for stardom in New York. Howdy has been locked in a

it's a lawsuit and custody battle over the actual Howdy Doody
marionette used on the show, which ran for 2,543 episodes from 1947

   GA-RACE _ The most exciting GOP presidential campaign in a
generation is missing two important elements in Georgia _ the
leading candidates. Neither Texas Gov. George W. Bush nor Sen. John
McCain has spent much time in the state, and on Friday McCain
canceled an appearance in Atlanta that had been planned for Monday.
It was his only planned stop in Georgia before the March 7 primary.
(Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NOTAGAIN _ As Rep. Bob Barr puffed away on a cigar at a
congressional retreat last month, he heard something peculiar
coming from some fellow Republicans: worrying about Gov. George W.
Bush's candidacy. Suddenly, the man they had anointed to lead the
party to the White House was not such a sure bet. Instead, Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) seemed like the man to watch, having just won
the New Hampshire primary. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   OLDFAMILY _ He was born during World War I, walks with steel
knees and survived open heart surgery with six bypasses. Kitchen
towels wrapped around his boots keep him from slipping as he walks
a visitor up a snow-covered hill on his 215-acre farm, proudly
pointing out the creek that runs through the property, the
farmhouse built before the Civil War and the gazebo constructed
with family labor. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NEW FAMILY _ Traditional politics is losing its hold on American
families. Take the Melson family of Trotwood. Sam, 51, is a
Democrat, his wife, Connie Lucas-Melson, 48, a Republican. They
have a blended family, with nine children ranging in age from 15 to
31 and in politics from Democrat to Republican to those who don't
know what they are. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS-HISPANICS _ NEW YORK _ As voting nears in the four
biggest states, Vice President Al Gore appears to have a major
advantage in Hispanic support, a significant bloc in California,
New York, Texas and Florida. Why he's ahead and why it matters.

   DEMOCRATS-GEORGIA _ WASHINGTON _ In an indication of Vice
President Al Gore's dominance in the South, Bill Bradley is not
even contesting the March 7 Democratic primary there. The big
question seems to be whether Democratic voters will cross over to
the state's open GOP primary, as they did in Michigan. (Shepard,

   INTERNET-TAXES _ WASHINGTON _ When the National Association of
Governors opens its annual meeting Sunday, topic A will be what to
do about taxing sales on goods sold over the Internet. Most
governors fear that the growth of e-commerce will rob them of the
money to hire cops and firefighers or build roads. At the same
time, governors desperately want to appear friendly to tech
companies so they can attract New Economy jobs. Their dilemma
deepens as sales boom in cyberspace and complaints increase on Main
Street about the unfairness of a tax-free Internet. (Geewax, Cox

hearings and planning on how to overcome the reluctance in many
states to provide more accurate and more timely data on everything
from test scores to dropout rates. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   SHELTERS _ WASHINGTON _ The plight of millions left homeless by

city that, at the time of King's speech, was home of the KKK, will

   LEBANON-HEZBOLLAH _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ How can a guerrilla
movement with 500 full-time fighters and a couple of thousand
part-timers consistently rack up battlefield successes against the
Israeli army? Hezbollah can do it because it is fighting on its own
turf, with grass roots support and cunning adaptability. A military
expert at the National War College in Washington says Hezbollah is
one of the world's best guerrilla armies. Meanwhile, Israel, like
the U.S. in Vietnam, still doesn't seem to have the hang of
guerrilla warfare. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

<P>
   RUSSIA-ELECTION _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Who exactly is the
man considered the favorite in the Russian elections? He has
declared the election is about morals and character, but he is
secretive and close-mouthed about his own history. He won't talk to
the press, so what do school friends, former bosses and neighbors
say about his personality? Where did he used to live and study?
What characteristics have struck such a resounding chord in the
Russian electorate? (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS

<P>
   STOCK-TRACKING _ Tracking stocks, whose values are tied to the
performance of designated segments of corporate operations, are
gaining popularity and are now being used or contemplated by
familiar names like General Motors and AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, and
local companies like BellSouth. Trackers give companies a chance to
highlight product lines or services that stand out from the rest of
the company wares, and also create a new currency useful in
acquisitions. But do the stocks serve a real purpose, and what are
investors to make of them? Do they detract from the the older
company shares? We discuss tracker basics, and also provide some
outlook. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED

TALK OF MERGER RAISES NEW CONCERN FOR ATLANTIC CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been more than four years since the Las Vegas casino
magnate Stephen Wynn announced plans to build a $2 billion hotel
and gambling complex on a landfill in the marina district of
Atlantic City, N.J., and almost as long since MGM Grand said it
would build a $700 million resort at the northern end of the
Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials were so eager to get Wynn to bring badly
needed hotel rooms and Las Vegas-style glamour to Atlantic City
that they agreed to his demand for a new $330 million roadway and
tunnel to whisk visitors from the Atlantic City Expressway to the
western side of the city. That tunnel, known as the Brigantine
Connector, is on schedule and expected to open in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But neither company has yet broken ground. Both Wynn's Mirage
Resorts and MGM Grand have been stymied by legal and political
complications. And a bid a few days ago by MGM Grand for Mirage has
suddenly left Atlantic City officials fearing further delays and
the potential for serious business stagnation: With hotel occupancy
near capacity, Atlantic City needs to add rooms fast to stop losing
business.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, MGM Grand made an unsolicited $3.3 billion offer
to buy Mirage. Two other major casino companies, Park Place
Entertainment Co. and Harrah's Entertainment Co., then said they
were considering making their own offers for Wynn's empire, which
is perceived as vulnerable because its lavish new resorts in Las
Vegas and Biloxi, Miss., have failed to meet financial
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Toscano, the senior policy adviser to Mayor James Whelan,
said Atlantic City feared that a battle between Mirage and other
casino operators would lead to further delays in the Atlantic City
projects, just at the moment when the impasse appeared to be
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Takeover struggles have a tendency to freeze both the
companies involved,'' Toscano said, ``and this is not a good time
for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirage officials would not talk about what impact the proposed
merger might have on its Atlantic City project. ``All of the
activity in Atlantic City is moving forward as planned,'' Alan M.
Feldman, a Mirage spokesman, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Murren, the president and chief financial officer of
MGM Grand, said it was ``extraordinarily premature'' to speculate
about what would happen in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   If MGM Grand does acquire Mirage _ and no one can say whether it
will _ the Atlantic City plans are likely to merge as well,
resulting in one new resort instead of two, according to several
analysts. The new hotel is likely to be located on the larger
170-acre marina site rather than on the 30-acre Boardwalk parcel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is desirable because it's such wide open land,'' said David
W. Anders, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``You could
develop the property exactly as you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss _ or postponement _ of one of the resorts would be a
disappointment for Atlantic City, where hotel occupancy rates
exceed 90 percent. Thanks to the expansion of several existing
hotels, the city has nearly 12,000 hotel rooms. But Atlantic City
could fill twice that many, despite increasing competition from
casinos in Connecticut, said Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The room shortage makes it difficult to attract package tours
and scheduled flights by major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The construction delays have also placed a financial burden on
the city, which is heavily dependent on the casinos for tax
revenues. The city's tax base took a hit recently when the aging
Trump World's Fair Casino closed. Last month, Whelan said he was
``out of smoke and mirrors'' and proposed a 3.7-cent increase in
the property-tax rate, the first since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 48,000 people are employed in Atlantic City's
casino industry, the city needs the jobs that the new resorts would
add. The unemployment rate in 1998, the last year for which figures
are available, was 13.4 percent, more than twice the rate for the
state as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this drags out, the more frustrated people
become,'' Toscano said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mirage is also a partner in The Borgata, a $750 million casino
resort planned at the marina by Boyd Gaming Corp., which operates
the Stardust Resort Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Boyd still
intends to break ground this summer, said Rob Stillwell, a company
spokesman. Designed to resemble an Italian village, the resort
would be next to the new Mirage complex.
</P>
<P>
   Long before MGM Grand made its takeover move, the Mirage project
had encountered a series of hurdles. Donald Trump, a longtime
rival, tried to block it through litigation, saying Wynn had been
given preferential treatment because he did not have to pay for the
land. (Mirage did have to pay to clean the former landfill,
however, and it is contributing one-third of the cost of the
tunnel, with the state subsidizing the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   A protracted legal fight was also waged by residents who said
the tunnel would destroy their middle-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Toscano said Mirage contributed to the delays by revising its
design plans twice. On Wednesday, however, in what Toscano
described as ``the first major step,'' the company is scheduled to
appear before the city planning board to seek approval for roads
proposed at the marina.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand also faced obstacles in assembling its Boardwalk
parcel, but Toscano and Murren said that the last holdout among the
property owners was on the verge of making a deal.

 &HT;    Georgia voters eager to see action _ and candidates
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most exciting GOP presidential campaign in a
generation is missing two important elements in Georgia _ the
leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Texas Gov. George W. Bush nor Sen. John McCain has spent
much time in the state, and on Friday McCain canceled an appearance
in Atlanta that had been planned for Monday. It was his only
planned stop in Georgia before the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of a Georgia visit by Bush before the balloting,
but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched among the giants of the electoral process, Georgia
has been relegated to almost an afterthought. The state offers
fewer than 10 percent of the delegates who are up for grabs March
7. Not only are California, New York and Ohio voting the same day,
but a cluster of New England primaries, where McCain appears
strong, also diminish Georgia's importance.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the national race has been growing in Georgia since
McCain's victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get it in my law office, at the barbershop, walking around
on the square,'' said Chuck Clay, chairman of Georgia's Republican
Party. ``The only candidate being talked about in a real positive
way is McCain. He has the enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain buzz may not translate into enough support to
defeat Bush in Georgia, Clay said _ and other Republicans who also
are neutral in the GOP race agreed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a skeletal organization in Georgia, with a brand-new
headquarters. More than 2,000 people have signed on as volunteers,
most of them since McCain won the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1,
said John Sours, McCain's Georgia chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may have been shaken by Bush's loss to McCain
in the Michigan primary last week. But the Texas governor retains
significant advantages over McCain in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is expected in Atlanta sometime before the primary,
has a well-developed statewide organization that is geared toward
turning out traditional Republican voters on primary day. The
campaign has volunteers making phone calls in 40 counties. Campaign
workers distributed 120,000 pieces of literature last weekend
alone, said Eric Tanenblatt, manager of the Bush campaign in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Georgia's elected Republicans are supporting Bush,
although the same edge existed in Michigan and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The spillover from the South Carolina primary campaign also may
work in Bush's favor. Voters in the Augusta and Savannah areas saw
and heard his ads. ``The best thing for the Georgia Bush campaign
is to have South Carolina produce a clear victory, which it did,''
said Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), Bush's top supporter in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In South Georgia, Coverdell said he would remind farmers that
McCain voted against sending them disaster relief in the name of
fighting wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's successful appeal to social conservative voters in South
Carolina also should work in parts of the state, although perhaps
not in the vote-rich metro area.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and McCain are similarly opposed to abortion rights,
McCain sent a disturbing signal to social conservatives when he
said his family would decide whether to end his teenage daughter's
hypothetical pregnancy, said Rusty Paul, the former Georgia GOP
chairman and aide to Steve Forbes' former presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was sent, but it was received, this
dichotomy between what he would want to apply to everybody else and
his family,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Sours argued that tailoring a campaign to attract social
conservatives would not work as well in Georgia as in South
Carolina. ``South Carolina does not have an Atlanta, such a large
concentration of voters who are independent minded, conservative on
some issues, moderate on others,'' Sours said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially important factor is that the Democratic
presidential candidates also will be competing in Georgia on March
7. Democrats and independent voters crossed over in large numbers
in the primaries in Michigan and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who is not supporting either Bush or McCain, said that
Democratic leaders who back Vice President Al Gore in Georgia will
work hard to produce a large turnout for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gov.) Roy Barnes is under pressure to turn out Democrats for
Gore in the first Southern state for the Democrats,'' Paul said.
``That probably hurts McCain some.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain forces are banking on Gore's overwhelming lead in the
polls and Bill Bradley's failure to mount a serious campaign in
Georgia to persuade some Democrats and independents to vote where
the action is _ or at least appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has played an important role in one or the other party's
nominating process for the better part of 20 years. In 1984, the
state gave Walter Mondale a win that stopped Gary Hart's momentum.
Four years later, Jesse Jackson claimed a victory that prevented
Gore from sweeping his home region. The beneficiary was the
eventual Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, Gov. Zell Miller convinced lawmakers to hold the
primary a week earlier in March. The change made Georgia Bill
Clinton's first stop after New Hampshire, and Clinton's resounding
win propelled him to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, President Bush won almost two thirds of
the vote against Pat Buchanan's insurgent campaign in 1992. Four
years later, Georgia again helped seal Buchanan's fate, this time
voting strongly for Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing those campaigns had in common was candidates who
spent time in the state and, more significantly, bombarded
television viewers with political ads.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the calendar forced the candidates to campaign
elsewhere, the ads were a near-constant reminder of the importance
they attached to the state. This year McCain plans no television
ads in Georgia, political director John Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as McCain is relatively quiescent, Bush has no need to
ratchet up his campaign, said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who
is not affiliated with either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign doesn't look like much here and probably won't
unless McCain gets a lot more going,'' Ayres said. ``But if you
haven't built a foundation up to this point, I don't know that you
have time to do it.''

U.S.-SAUDI MEETING ON OIL TAKES A STEP FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The U.S. effort to secure lower oil
prices took an important step forward Saturday when senior Saudi
and U.S. oil ministers agreed that there could be a better balance
between oil supplies and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully worded statement issued here Saturday night by the
Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson did not state that boosting production would help end
that imbalance or stabilize oil prices, which at over $30 a barrel
have hit their highest level in nine years. Nor did it commit Saudi
Arabia to producing more oil.
</P>
<P>
   But it did show, according to oil experts and diplomats here,
that both Saudi and U.S. officials are concerned that the soaring
oil prices caused by production quotas imposed last year are now
creating speculation and shortages that jeopardized world economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Saudi Arabia vowed that it would continue to
``review the oil supply and demand levels to ensure market
stability, prevent oil price volatility and avoid harming the world
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Naimi had stressed in his talks with Richardson
that the decision to pump more oil could be made only by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is scheduled
to meet in Vienna, Austria, at the end of March to review
production cuts that it adopted a year ago after the price of oil
fell below $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   But several oil experts and diplomats interpreted this statement
to mean that Saudi and U.S. oil officials had similar
interpretations of oil market pressures and that the Saudis would
try to persuade other OPEC members that some production increases
were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's trip also suggests that a consensus is emerging
among key OPEC states that the production cuts, which Saudi Arabia
urged other members to adopt last March, may have outlived their
usefulness. Oil prices have almost doubled since OPEC decided last
year to reduce daily production by 4.3 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Whether OPEC should pump more oil and at what pace will also be
discussed in London on Thursday at a meeting of oil ministers from
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico. Before that, officials said,
Richardson will meet with Venezuela's oil minister. The OPEC
members, together with nonmembers Mexico and Norway, produce about
a third of the world's supply of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials said no announcement would be made before the
OPEC meeting. But privately, several Saudi officials said they
believed that an increase of more than a million barrels a day
could be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Yet differences persist over tactics and pricing strategy, not
only among OPEC members but within Saudi Arabia's ruling family.
While Saudi oil officials seemed impressed by U.S. data showing
that oil inventories in the United States have fallen to the lowest
point in 20 years and that the world is consuming 75 million
barrels of oil a day and producing only 73 million, a senior Saudi
official wondered whether there was what he called a ``false sense
of crisis'' spurred by a media frenzy over rising prices and
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reserves are meant to go down, especially during a harsh
winter,'' Prince Saud al-Faysal bin Abd al-Aziz, the foreign
minister, said in an interview. ``That's what reserves are for,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi oil officials are concerned that rising prices for major
consumers risk jeopardizing the economic growth upon which future
oil sales depend. At the same time, they emphasized the need for
building consensus in OPEC. Any suggestion that the kingdom was
responding to U.S. pressure would complicate that task, one
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration is said to be preparing measures to
address shortages, Richardson reiterated on Saturday that oil from
the strategic reserve should be used only to respond to a national
emergency, not to affect price levels.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the discussions here, Richardson said, ``This has
been a very successful trip.''

JUNIOR ADDS POP, BUT LEAVES REDS SHORT-ARMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Thirty miles due north on the interstate,
baseball's biggest story of the spring unfolds daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live'' from Sarasota, it's the Junior Griffey Show, starring
Junior himself, and co-starring Jim Bowden as the master thief who
stole Junior from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's version of Hollywood has now moved to Cincinnati,
with a temporary training camp stop in Sarasota. Fast-forward the
fantasy script to October, and Griffey will be leading the Reds
into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's fine. Except here in the swampland of Charlotte
County, also known as the Hooterville of spring camps, there is a
somewhat bemused reaction to the hoopla surrounding the Reds and
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Respect among the Rangers for Junior is immense, based on 11
seasons of facing him in divisional competition. But as one voice
said here Friday, ``Tell me again _ who do the Reds have for
pitchers?''
</P>
<P>
   Junior or no Junior, it always comes back to that, right? It
certainly did in Seattle, when once the Mariners lost Randy
Johnson, they surrendered AL West supremacy to the Rangers. Griffey
was still there, and so was Alex Rodriguez, along with a batting
order that could equal the Rangers' firepower. But the turning
point in the division was the departure of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with what's going on in Sarasota with Griffey, the
Rangers work out here daily in relative seclusion. A few fans show
up, and an alligator or two might wander by. Baseball-wise,
however, there is a comparison between this spring's Reds and the
Rangers of forever.
</P>
<P>
   See if you've heard this before:
</P>
<P>
   A pitching staff with two marginal starters _ Denny Neagle and
Pete Harnisch _ and total question marks in the other three
rotation spots. A bullpen that overachieved last season, and was
also overworked, and may be facing that same load of innings again.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Reds, who added Dante Bichette's bat, along with
Griffey, meaning the lineup is packed with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds of this season are exactly where the Rangers had always
been, and don't want to be anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Less pop, more pitching. Around here, that's the new plan for
2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the expectations to be high, and I feel they deserve to
be high,'' said Dick Bosman, the pitching coach who is normally
scrambling in spring training to fill staff holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have lost an 18-game winner (Aaron Sele) and a
13-game winner (Mike Morgan) from last season's rotation. Plus, the
main pitching acquisition of the off-season, Justin Thompson, is
only doing long-toss in spring training while rehabbing from
shoulder surgery. Thompson may not be ready for the rotation until
May.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnny Oates, not a manager who normally backs himself into
a verbal corner, still says ``this is the best and deepest staff
since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   While adding free-agent returnees Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver
in the off-season didn't exactly cause an Arlington box-office
stampede by the fans, Oates and Bosman were elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of this job is to think maybe I can point out one
little thing, or change one little thing, and suddenly that pitcher
is improved,'' Bosman said. ``Guys like Rogers and Oliver are
veterans who have thrown a lot of quality innings in the majors.
And they have the kind of arms that can throw a lot more. I love
the kids, but now we've got seasoned pros one-through-five in the
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers left here last spring with Sele and Rick Helling as
the established starters, but after that it was up to a relic like
Morgan or a soft-tosser like John Burkett to fill in. That's all
the Rangers had. Even worse, Mark Clark, expected to be the No. 3
man in the rotation, was an immediate bust and contributed nothing
last season.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Bosman will have lefties Rogers and Oliver, in
addition to Thompson when he's ready. That's three southpaws
compared with none last season. Rick Helling will be the No. 1
starter out of camp, and he's expected to improve off a subpar 1999
(14-11, 4.84 ERA), while Esteban Loaiza is the fifth starter. He
was 8-4 with a 3.83 ERA as a starter after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The depth allows another lefty, Matt Perisho, to replace
Thompson in the early rotation, although Clark is still a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say I'm excited by what I think we have, and leave
it at that,'' said Bosman.
</P>
<P>
   His overworked bullpen carried the staff last season, ``but
we've now got some innings-crunchers in the rotation,'' Bosman
added. Plus, the bullpen has added young Francisco Cordero, an
exciting prospect with a large arm.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the Rangers talk pitching as the
team strength. Against all the noise about Junior that's coming out
of Sarasota, it's no more than a whisper in the swamps.
</P>
<P>
   The answer from here, however, is: been there many times and
don't want to go back.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the co-producer of ``New Jack City,'' a 1991 film
starring Wesley Snipes as a Harlem drug lord, George Jackson
introduced a mass audience to the sounds and sensibilities of
inner-city streets.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, after a string of other movies and a brief stint
as president of Motown Records, Jackson embarked on a third career.
He developed ambitious plans for reaching the expanding market for
hip-hop and Latino culture through a network of World Wide Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   With two close friends, he founded Urban Box Office Network, a
year-old company that already employs 250 people at ramshackle
offices in Chelsea. Later this year, it will become the first
Silicon Alley company to set up headquarters in Harlem, bringing
badly needed high-technology jobs to the neighborhood where Jackson
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no homecoming. On Feb. 10, less than three
weeks before the scheduled start of the company's first major Web
site, Jackson died of a stroke. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Jackson, a 300-pound Harvard-educated bear of a man
who was affectionately known as Papa, has devastated his young
staff and left a void that his partners _ Adam Kidron, a long-time
British music industry producer, and Frank Cooper, the former vice
president for business affairs at Def Jam Recordings _ are
struggling to fill. But they say they are not deferring any of
their plans. And their backers maintain that Jackson left behind a
company in good enough shape to withstand his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the investors feel confident that the leadership and the
depth is there to take it forward and make it a successful media
company,'' said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the New York City
Investment Fund, a private company that tries to stimulate job
growth. The fund has given Urban Box Office $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone _
a federal, state and city program designed to foster economic
development in Harlem _ to grant it a $4 million loan for
renovating an industrial building at 126th Street and Amsterdam
Avenue. And the company will receive tax breaks for hiring
neighborhood residents, who make up one-fifth of its current work
force, said Terry C. Lane, the president of the Empowerment Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he hoped that Urban Box Office would inspire other
Internet companies to move to Harlem. He said he had been talking
to two dozen other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its Harlem location, the new venture will not be aimed
exclusively at African-Americans and other minority groups, Kidron
said. He defined the target audience as young people with an
``urban mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle, the president of Target Market News, a Chicago-based
company that monitors African-American media and marketing, says
that although African-Americans have been slower than other groups
to embrace the Internet, they are catching up fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of sites trying to go specifically after the
younger portion of this audience,'' Smikle said. ``That's a field
that could get pretty crowded quickly.'' But he said no one else
had matched Urban Box Office in scale.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating a Web portal for urban music, entertainment
and information did not originate with Jackson. But his friends and
business associates say that his ebullient and forceful personality
got the project off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was a role that Jackson was used to. ``He was the type of guy
who would take iconoclastic people and create a family,'' said Doug
McHenry, his film-producing partner. ``He would be the glue and
help them formulate the vision and make it practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the drawing card for Flatiron Partners, a venture
capital company specializing in the Internet that has invested $16
million in the online network. Jerry Colonna, the managing partner,
said, ``I'd be lying if I didn't say that within 10 minutes of
meeting George, I knew I wanted to fund this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonna said he was impressed by the breadth of the company's
goals. In addition to serving as a distribution system, Urban Box
Office will offer original content, including situation comedies,
dramatic series, talk shows and animation. Other sites will offer
hip-hop blended with Latin rhythms and what Kidron called ``the
full range of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   As Colonna said, ``As a venture capital company, you want to
back entrepreneurs who think big, not people who say, `I want to
get bought out by Yahoo.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites are being rolled out one by one, and company
officials say the network itself will not go online until a
critical mass has been reached. The most elaborate one so far _
www.indieplanet.com, which is intended to showcase independent
musicians, artists and writers _ will make its debut on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The online network was actually the brainchild of Kidron, who
produced albums for the Sex Pistols rock band in the 1970s. Kidron,
40, said he initially hoped to create a cable channel but was
unable to secure an outlet in New York.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to a public library in Yonkers, Kidron said, he
began to understand the changes the Internet had wrought. As a
group of teen-agers logged onto the Internet to listen to music, he
noticed that they relished being able to flit from site to site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was more important than the quality,'' Kidron said, ``was
that the kids could go on the Web and they could choose what they
were going to program. That was the defining moment in building
Urban Box Office and why it is structured the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kidron was developing his idea, Jackson was coming off a
frustrating year. He had moved to New York in 1997 to try to rescue
Motown, a legendary record label founded in Detroit that had been
run into the ground. Since he was a neophyte in the music business,
his arrival was greeted with skepticism. But Danny Goldberg, the
former chairman of Polygram's Mercury Group, which then owned
Motown, said he had hired Jackson to run the label for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had tremendous executive and leadership qualities that are
extremely hard to find,'' Goldberg said. ``The things he didn't
know he could learn.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson acknowledged, the Motown job was a struggle.
``There's tremendous pressure on me, nothing but pressure,''
Jackson told The Boston Herald a few months after he took the job.
Before he had a chance to prove himself, however, Polygram was sold
to Seagram Co. and he was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When he teamed up with Kidron, Jackson was initially reluctant
to base the new company in Harlem. ``He didn't want to go there and
have us be this isolated thing of privilege in this place of
enormous destitution and lack of opportunity,'' Kidron said. But
eventually Jackson came to see the advantages of locating in a
world-famous neighborhood with deep cultural roots, his friend
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidron does, too. ``Harlem,'' he said, ``is this amazing urban
brand that has fallen into decay.''

 &HT;    Georgia comrades stick with Bush as primary nears
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Rep. Bob Barr puffed away on a cigar at a
congressional retreat last month, he heard something rather
peculiar coming from some of his fellow Republicans: worrying about
Gov. George W. Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the man they had anointed to lead the party to the
White House was not such a sure bet. Instead, Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) seemed like the man to watch, having just won the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, an early backer of Steve Forbes for president, stood on
the outside of the conversation, surprised at the level of concern
over Bush's prospects. ``They were a bunch of nervous Nellies
running around talking about what they should do,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before McCain swept the Michigan and Arizona
primaries last week, creating the specter of a hotly contested
Republican primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   The worry that Barr heard isn't shared by his fellow Georgia
Republicans in Congress _ at least not on the surface. Seven of the
nine back Bush. And they don't seem say they are not swayed by
McCain's bid.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMM WAS THEIR MAN
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, every one of them all but one of them endorsed
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) for the Oval Office, save one. Rep.
Nathan Deal was too busy defending his own seat to worry about the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   So, have Georgia's congressional Republicans bet on the wrong
horse again?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell offers an unequivocal ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go for the person you want to win, the person you
believe is the best for the job,'' he said. ``I have never believed
in sitting around and waiting to see who is most likely to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, Bush's point man on Capitol Hill, has a long history
with the Bush family. He was an early supporter of supported Bush's
father for president back in 1980, when he had about 1 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said 44 of the 55 GOP senators Senate's 55 Republicans
back the Texas governor and that his `` Coverdell said. ``Bush's
support among Republicans is increasing. It's getting bigger and
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he said Republicans see him as a ``spokesperson
for the Democrats.'' That's why there are so many cross-over votes
for him, Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston, who has not endorsed a candidate, said
backing Gramm so early the last time taught him a valuable lesson:
Sometimes the Lone Star candidate isn't always a shining star.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston thinks McCain's challenge to Bush has actually been
good for the GOP. ``We all quietly appreciate what McCain is doing
because if (Bush) can't get past McCain, he won't get past
(Democrats Al) Gore or (Bill) Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly invigorated the race and drawn attention, he
said. to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the Democratic primary race is like watching two life
insurance salesmen argue about which annuity is the best,''
Kingston said. ``It's absurd that they are arguing about who is
more liberal. That's sort of like Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia
arguing about who is the hippest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder hasn't wavered from the Bush camp, either,
mainly because he likes the way Bush cut taxes and improved schools
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's predictable,'' Linder said. ``If an issue comes up, I
know where he'll be. I can't say the same about John McCain. He's
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood was among the first in the delegation to
jump on the Bush bandwagon. He's convinced that McCain has gotten
where he's gotten on the backs of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that they see in McCain that's liberal,''
Norwood said. The media, he said, has hyped McCain because they
don't want to write about a ``boring Republican primary.''''What
would they be talking about if Bush were a shoe in?'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory in South Carolina shows he can be a serious
candidate, Deal said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, plenty of people respect McCain for being a maverick,
``but most traditional Republicans are overwhelmingly Bush
people,'' Deal said. If the race goes to the convention, it would
force Bush to spend lots of money and detract from his being able
to help lawmakers in congressional races, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the good part of it is it generates a lot of interest,''
Deal said. ``I think McCain is doing what our system allows people
to do: run and put their best effort forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson agrees that McCain generates interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think what's going on in this hotly contested
primary is there are more pluses than minuses,'' he said. ``The
media have gone from writing every day about Gore and Bradley to
writing about Bush and McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means voters are getting engaged in GOP politics.
</P>
<P>
   `IT'S THE RECORD, STUPID'
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss stood with his fellow Georgians and said he
doesn't regret his early endorsement of Gramm in 1996. endorsed
Gramm when he announced four years ago and He doesn't regret that
decision. Nor does he regret backing Bush early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the wrong horse with Gramm,'' he said. ``It was the
right thing to do. We think we've done the right thing this time in
supporting Bush so early on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, Chambliss turned philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you'd like for your guy to breeze through without any
problems,'' he said. ``But what primaries do is make better
candidates out of you. He's going to be fine in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, ``It's the economy, stupid,'' helped Bill Clinton
win the presidency in 1992. Rep. Mac Collins hopes this time voters
will see that, ``It's the record, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long, Collins has soothed concerned Bush voters in Pike
County by merely laying out his record as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference between the two,'' Collins said of
Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's list of reforms in Texas include tort reform, tax relief,
welfare, education and managed care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's list? A bill to regulate tobacco companies and one to
overhaul campaign financing, Collins said. Both were major pieces
of legislation, and both failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president who knows how to work with a legislative
body,'' he said. ``I think once people start looking at the record,
they will see that Bush is the right choice.''

CHINA'S WARNING TO TAIWAN POSES CHALLENGE TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Inserts ``on Monday,'' in 2nd graf.) 
(lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China's abrupt shift to a more aggressive stance on
Taiwan left the Clinton administration scrambling last week for a
response and struggling to temper increased pressure for new sales
of sophisticated arms to Taiwan, congressional and administration
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they were given no hint of the
shift by the Chinese, who made their announcement on Monday, just
days after one of the highest-ranking U.S. delegations ever to
visit China spent two days in Beijing in talks that focused on
urging restraint over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped that relations with China were on
the road to improvement, but they now appear to be entering an
extraordinarily delicate phase, and a series of approaching events
_ including elections in Taiwan _ threatens to make things
dramatically worse.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chinese policy, announced suddenly in an 11,000-word
paper that had apparently been in preparation for many months, said
in essence that China would not wait indefinitely for Taiwan, which
Beijing considers a renegade province, to reunite with the mainland
and would consider a military attack if negotiations dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   In immediate response, the undersecretary of defense for policy,
Walter Slocombe, made the firmest of warnings to Beijing, saying in
the middle of last week that China would face ``incalculable
consequences'' if it followed through on its stiffer policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the document set off intense debate within the
administration over a further reply throughout the week. On Friday,
a senior Pentagon official said the Chinese statement was
``unfortunate and very, very unhelpful,'' particularly from the
``point of view of arms sales'' to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   There is now ``incalculable pressure to sell more, do more,''
for Taiwan, another administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bolstering support for legislation in the Senate that
seeks to expand military ties between Washington and Taiwan, the
new Chinese stance threatens to help unravel the administration's
effort in Congress to usher China into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation in the Senate, known as the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, is strongly opposed by the White House. But the
administration remains divided over the long-term effects of
China's policy statement, known as a white paper, a senior
administration official said. Some believed that it would
significantly heighten the potential for the use of force in the
Taiwan Strait. Others thought it would end up being a ``blip'' on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as delicate a moment in U.S.-China relations as ever
before, and never have so many factors been involved,'' said Chris
Williams, the senior foreign policy adviser to the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who is a strong supporter of
Taiwan. ``The potential for a significant crisis in the Taiwan
Strait is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the very way the policy shift was announced by
China was taken as a slap by the administration, which has been
working toward what it calls ``constructive strategic partnership''
with China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had sent a deliberately high-powered
delegation to Beijing on Feb. 17 and 18, intended to impress upon
the Chinese the importance of a range of topics, but specifically
restraint on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation consisted of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott; the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Joseph W. Ralston; Slocombe; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
Kurt M. Campbell; and the deputy national security adviser, James
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   The group suffered its first setback when the Chinese did not
include a military official of equivalent rank to Ralston in the
talks, but sent a more junior officer.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting included ``lectures'' on Taiwan from Chinese
officials, administration officials recounted, although the tone
was not significantly different from past discussions of the
subject, which Beijing considers its most vital.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the delegation did not receive any
hint that a major policy change affecting the relationship between
China and the United States was about to be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, members of the U.S. delegation learned of
the change of policy through the news media. ``There was no `by the
way,''' said an official familiar with the Beijing meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said that the record of the
talks had been scoured last week to see if the Chinese had tried to
foreshadow the policy paper in such an oblique way that the
delegation had missed the signal. There was no such signal,
administration officials concluded last week.
</P>
<P>
   The shift came at a particularly fragile moment. Taiwan holds
presidential elections next month, and the warning by Beijing that
it would not wait indefinitely for the island to reunite with the
mainland was clearly intended to warn candidates off further steps
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration is well into its annual review
of arms sales requests from Taiwan and is contemplating a much more
robust sale of weapons than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the weapons the Pentagon is considering selling to Taiwan
are four Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers equipped
with Aegis air defense radars that would help Taiwan toward
creating a missile defense system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said Friday that the destroyers were
``under consideration.'' Two would be built in Mississippi, the
home state of Lott, and two in Maine, the home state of Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has warned Washington that providing the destroyers
could be ``the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' said Rear Adm.
Eric McVadon, retired, who was the U.S. defense and naval attache
in China from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said they will react harshly if we do it,'' he said.
``They have said they will not allow Taiwan to have them, and the
concern is they will destroy it before it became operational. That
then starts a conflict that could bring in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating the atmosphere was the release on Friday of a
human rights report by the State Department that was highly
critical of China, and the intention of the administration to
gather European support to censure Beijing for its human rights
record at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva in April.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said the administration had to consider two
factors when deciding what to sell Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The first, he said, are the ``objective'' conditions, called for
under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, of Taiwan's ability to
defend itself. Second is the ``broader, overall'' context, meaning
the state of relations among China, Taiwan and the United States
and the internal political situations in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing its policy statement a month before the Taiwanese
election on March 18 and in the midst of a presidential primary
campaign in the United States, Beijing is playing with U.S.
domestic politics in a way that will backfire on China, the
official suggested.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Yu Shuning, the counselor,
said that the policy statement was intended to ``let the
international community, including the United States government,
know China's principled issue on Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the policy remained ``peaceful unification with one
country, two systems.'' He added, ``This paper will make the United
States government better understand the settlement of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, both Democrats and Republicans said the document
had heightened broad dissatisfaction with the administration's
China policy.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, support of the administration's
legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations had
waned significantly, Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Geared to China's entry to the World Trade Organization, the
measure had already been complicated by Vice President Al Gore's
apparent coolness and by the opposition of the labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   But China's policy paper adds another strong obstacle, making it
possible that the measure will fail, even in the face of a
concerted lobbying campaign by the White House, an aide to a
Democratic senator said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, an aide to a Republican
senator said there was growing enthusiasm among Republicans to
bring the legislation to the Senate floor for debate. Such a debate
would encompass the broad range of U.S.-China policy and could take
place as early as this week, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pent-up frustration about the
administration's policy approach to China,'' the aide said.
``Either that gets vented in terms of the World Trade Organization
and permanent normal trade relations or on the Security Enhancement
Act.''

   His countdown on hold
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Tierney
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What really gnaws at Jason Respert is that he already
had given the gate to the Gators. The premier offensive-line
prospect in the Southeast had whited-out Florida on his roster of
candidate universities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in this mutual exploitation society that defines
recruiting, Respert took a freebie trip to Gainesville that,
worst-case scenario, could cost him his freedom. Four days before
Tennessee would roll out the orange carpet for him, he was jailed
for alleged attempted sexual battery and burglary of a residence.
</P>
<P>
   In the football universe, his current residence is limbo. The
Volunteers have placed his scholarship in deep freeze. They do not
dare tender it unless and until his litigation is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, he lingers in purgatory. Prosecutors still are winding
up interviews with witnesses to determine what to do in the case.
Respert is free on $50,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from proclaiming his innocence, Respert volunteers no
details on the Gainesville soiree that apparently brought him to a
tavern patronized by Gator players and dead-ended during the wee
hours in an apartment occupied by several young women.
</P>
<P>
   He did offer this: ``Like my mama always says, `The world isn't
fair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Respert would cringe at being labeled a mama's boy.
Wouldn't any 18-year-old, especially one whose rock-solid 6-foot-4,
300-pound body fills a doorway? But he might not deny it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Home for June Respert was College Park near Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport when she divorced in 1988 and headed south
with her three children. Seeking a fresh start in a locale within
reach of Jason's father, who since died, and her parents in
Montezuma, she dropped anchor in Warner-Robins.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Jason was a typical W-R kid. Which is to say, he
played football.
</P>
<P>
   His heritage? Not so typical. Jason was borne of an interracial
marriage. It confused and hurt when classmates called him ``Oreo.''
Once, he angrily asked June, ``Mama, why did you have to have me by
a black guy?''
</P>
<P>
   June bit her lip and drummed a message into him: Be proud, not
ashamed. At the same time, she grew concerned that those who
frowned on her former marriage were watching this youngster with
mixed blood, ready to pounce on any misstep. So she did not spare
the rod in his upbringing. Asked how she administered the
tail-whippings, Jason whispered outside of her earshot, ``With the
first thing she could grab.''
</P>
<P>
   The spankings were leavened by positive maxims. ``You can have
both worlds,'' she eventually told him. ``You can date and fall in
love with anyone you choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Football brought respect, never more so than after Respert tore
the left anterior cruciate ligament in spring practice before his
sophomore season at Northside High. Standard rehab for such a
debilitating injury at his age requires as long as a year. His was
completed by four months, which astounded Dr. James Andrews of
Birmingham, the noted surgeon who repairs football-damaged knees of
all shapes and status, from high school backups to Pro Bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   With his balletic footwork, brute strength, mean streak and
college-eligible grades, Respert was sniffed out by the A-list of
college coaching. B. Bowden and Spurrier, Fulmer and Donnan. He
whittled his wish list to five, matching the NCAA's maximum
allowable recruiting visits.
</P>
<P>
   The first, to Michigan, was a dud. Georgia bowled him over with
the name-on-the-jersey scheme, and he obliged with an oral,
non-binding commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered there,'' he said. ``It was the home-state
school. I liked coach (Doug) Marrone,'' the offensive line
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Respert felt like TV's millionaire bride as doubts
crept in. In retrospect, he said, Georgia pressued him because, as
the linchpin of its class, he would lure other prospects to tag
along.
</P>
<P>
   Next on his itinerary: Knoxville. Respert thought about begging
off and advised Phil Fulmer about the pledge to UGA. Fulmer urged
him to visit nonetheless. ``Then if Georgia's still the place for
you,'' the coach said, ``go there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Big Orange country, Respert was taken by the Tennessee River,
the notion of playing before crowds exceeding 100,000 and,
especially, the paternal approach of Fulmer. ``About 85 percent of
the time, Coach talked about non-football stuff,'' he said. ``He
was just like part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Tennessee it was. Respert canceled scheduled inspections of
Florida State and Florida. But, on the final weekend before signing
day, Gainesville was back on _ in defiance of advice from his high
school coach to treat these as business trips.
</P>
<P>
   Respert saw it differently. He wanted to escort his twin sister,
Jennifer, who had yet to accompany him on the college tour, and
repay the efforts of UF line coach Jimmy Ray Stephens. Bottom line,
though: ``I wanted a Florida vacation. (A teammate) told me,
'They're gonna pay for it. Why not go?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's job duties forced her to cancel. His stepfather
became ill. Respert told June, who came along, ``Mom, we don't have
to go.'' On the drive down, they shooed away second-guesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is standard procedure for recruits to get chaperoned around
campus by college players. Too often, they detour into forbidden
territory. ``If the NCAA knew what was going on at some of these
schools ...,'' June said.
</P>
<P>
   Respert apparently had parted ways with his escort when,
according to Gainesville police, he hooked up with fellow recruit
Tre Orr of Lake City, Fla., and Gator sophomore Alex Brown at a
bar, the Purple Porpoise. June was staying at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Police maintain that the players obtained telephone numbers of
two women at 2 a.m., called them an hour later and showed up at
their apartment. Brown and the other recruit paired off with the
two women, and Respert allegedly entered the bedroom of a third
resident, asleep and ill. Respert is accused of lifting the woman's
pajama top and putting his hand down her pants.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, he was taken into custody at Florida Field. The
last 28 hours or so of his recruiting experience were spent in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cervone, chief assistant prosecutor, said his office might
determine this week whether to pursue the existing charges, file
reduced ones or dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it seriously,'' Cervone said, ``but we don't file
charges just on the basis of a police report.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that polygraph tests arranged independently by the
Resperts are not admissible and would have no bearing on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Resperts were barely home when Florida announced it no longer
would recruit him, a token gesture, given his dissipated interest
in the school. Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley caucused
with coach Jim Donnan and declared that they, too, were pulling out
of the Respert sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs assumed that they remained in the running; indeed,
Respert had just told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that UGA and
Tennessee were running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   But his heart was speaking louder than his muddled mind. And it
was screaming Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   So did his wardrobe. On a junket to Maui for high school
All-America players, Respert was spotted in Tennessee orange.
</P>
<P>
   Respert views the reaction of the schools involved as validation
of his leanings. The Bulldogs, he said, ``are saving face, trying
to do what's best for Georgia. But that was humiliating to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That Tennessee has maintained contact ``means a lot to me,'' he
added. ``One thing I'm happy about is that I went through a
situation like this to find out who's gonna stick with me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks of too many tears and not enough sleep,
Respert has settled into a holding pattern. Friends and family
organized a defense fund for lawyers' fees. Acquaintances are asked
to contact the prosecutor's office to volunteer as character
witnesses. The mayor is being urged to designate a Jason Respert
Signing Day _ if that day comes.
</P>
<P>
   Respert's calendar, loaded for so many years with school
activities, is blank. School-board policy forbids students in his
legal situation from engaging in extracurriculars. That means no
basketball, no shot put and discus. No Mr. Northside contest, an
honor awarded to a lone graduating senior. Possibly no
Florida-Georgia all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   To a teen who says his worst trouble until now was a speeding
ticket for driving 60 in a 45-mph zone, Respert shudders at what
might transpire. ``I'm confident in my innocence,'' he said. ``I'm
scared that my life is in the hands of someone who doesn't know the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Respert's favorite TV shows does not register in the
Nielsen ratings. ``Ever since I was little, I watched 'Countdown To
Signing Day,' `` he said of the updates on football recruiting. ``I
was waiting for my chance to be on _ counting the days to when I
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The count is on hold. To be young is to have 20-200 vision,
unable to see clearly beyond tomorrow. And Respert cannot tell you
what the rest of his senior year, which should be the apex of his
life to date, will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just the best year,'' he decided, ``it's gonna be
the best teaching tool I've had.''

 &HT;    FEDERAL TRACKING OF STATE EDUCATION TRENDS CRITICIZED
 &HT;    Editors: Note state-specific insert.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government spends too little and takes
too long when it measures the progress of states in improving their
schools, the National Education Goals Panel declared Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We somehow have to demand the money to get the job done
speedily,'' said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, as he
succeeded Democratic Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky as the panel's
chairman.

CHECKING OUT FREE-AGENT LANDSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Double-trouble agent David Falk doesn't mind
taking an interview to the next level ... pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Julius Caesar said after he crossed the Rubicon, `The die
is cast,' '' Falk sang about 45 minutes after he'd been crossed by
the Clippers in Thursday's trade-deadline, snake-eyes roll to
liberate Maurice Taylor from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Falk had just attempted - and failed - to sell the Clips on
Knicks forward John Wallace after an attractive deal that would
have landed Othella Harrington from Vancouver fell through (blame
the Grizzlies). This Rubicon speech was designed to inform the
planet there is no turning back on his promise that Taylor will
never ever re-sign with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's practice, Taylor fudged a bit on the party line,
admitting that returning isn't an impossibility, although ``this is
as close as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   So does his agent still believe ``Mo'' - who now openly
campaigns for future employment in Orlando is worth a maximum
contract (about $67.5 million over six seasons) prescribed by NBA
law?
</P>
<P>
   ``Categorically, you can take that to the bank,'' Falk said,
although the last few words were tough to make out over the
stomping of his cloven hoof.
</P>
<P>
   Before we bother the neighborhood teller, let's examine this
summer's free-agent landscape. With only 154 days before the Class
of 2000 honor roll can strike it rich, we're certain to really nail
things down today.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the top dogs - by far - are San Antonio's incomparable Tim
Duncan and Grant Hill of Detroit. The top salary cap dogs - by far
- are the Chicago Bulls and Orlando Magic. By economic design, both
teams stink, although first-year coach Doc Rivers gives the Magic
an aroma of hope. Both teams have enough cap room to offer max
contracts to both players.
</P>
<P>
   Both players share the same agent (Lon Babby), are decent
friends and together would transform either team into a contender.
But, according to most league watchdogs, if they don't team up,
Hill and Duncan are likely to remain where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line on free-agent row is Tracy McGrady of the Toronto
Raptors. McGrady, who only averages 28 minutes per game, will be
paid on spec, but his lab-freak skills dictate he'll receive top
dollar. Recently, the Raptors have backed off their initial
approach of alleged fiscal responsibility and plan to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to McGrady's future may be teammate and cousin Vince
Carter, who can become a free agent after the 2001 season. If
Carter is planning to ditch the hockey-huggin' Toronto area,
McGrady will do so a year earlier. McGrady is building a home in
Orlando (he grew up in Florida), but insists this is not an
etched-in-stone clue about his future.
</P>
<P>
   On McGrady's heels is Charlotte shooting guard Eddie Jones.
According to one of the Hornets' limited partners, ownership will
offer Jones a max deal. But one league source has indicated that
majority owner George Shinn has issued a thumb-down on the prospect
of paying Eddie about $70 million over six seasons (that's the
ballpark rate for keeping your own hotshot).
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to Taylor and Motown crony Jalen Rose, the
free-agent-in-training Indiana Pacer, who - like Mo - dumped agent
Norm Nixon in favor of Falk last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing on the same team as Jalen is very important to me,''
said Taylor, who did admit he would have signed a long-term deal
with the Knicks, had that trade gone through. But, according to a
league source, the Knicks were prepared to offer Taylor a contract
a notch or two below the maximum rate. Since they already are
committed to $70 million in team payroll for next season - about
$15 million more than the limit that would kick in the league's new
luxury tax - the source sounds credible.
</P>
<P>
   A stoolie close to the Orlando scene said that while Rivers is a
big Taylor fan, the team's money handlers don't think Mo's heroic
enough for mad max money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Falk keeps rolling the dice, expecting to hit seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three of the top six free agents,'' he said, allowing
`we' to include McGrady, whose agent - L.A.-based Arn Tellem - sold
his business to the same outfit (SFX) that made Falk ridiculously
wealthy by purchasing his. ``The other three are going to stay
where they are.'' We assume he's referring to Hill, Duncan and
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Under Falkland logic, the Bulls and Magic will be forced to dump
their considerable loot on the SFX crew.
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor at least, Chicago may be a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a four,'' Bulls GM Jerry Krause said of the Clipper's
power forward job description, ``and we have a player at that
position we like (Elton Brand).''
</P>
<P>
   Krause is setting his cap for Duncan and Hill, with McGrady in
the wings to catch the Bulls if they falter on either or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough room under the cap now to sign two full-boat
free agents,'' he said after unloading Toni Kukoc on the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full boat'' is how Krause defines a player worthy of big
money.
</P>
<P>
   But we still don't know if a full boat is required when crossing
the Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources, one member of the Grizzlies'
ownership group sought the advice of a league insider before
telling GM Stu Jackson that any trade involving Harrington and
Wallace would not be sanctioned. The insider is former Pistons
assistant coach Dick Versace, who reportedly may replace Jackson.
... Fresno State's Courtney Alexander leads the nation in scoring
and is the top offensive two-guard prospect in this summer's draft.
``But he may be the worst defensive player I've ever seen,'' said
one NBA general manager. ... Cincinnati power forward Kenyon
Martin, for now, appears to be the runaway answer to what had been
a puzzling question a few weeks ago. The question: If the NBA Draft
was scheduled for today, who would be the first player taken? ``You
know what you're getting with that guy,'' said one scout, who raves
about the 6-foot-8 greyhound's intensity and athletic chops. ...
There was plenty of fiction hacked up by NBA writers last week, but
the weakest was the thin-air report of a deal that would send
Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo to the Suns, who would have kept Jason
Kidd, Penny Hardaway and Cliff Robinson. ``Of the 15 teams in the
Eastern Conference,'' said one general manager, ``11 of those teams
start centers that are 6-10 or shorter. Trading Mutombo (who's 7-2)
would be insane.'' ... More fiction: Miami's Voshon Lenard or San
Antonio's Avery Johnson to the Clippers for free-agent bait Derek
Anderson? All three teams involved laughed off those two ``deals.''
... Joe Safety, the Clippers' VP of communications, must have spent
a great deal of his youth spying on cartoons. Upon hearing Falk's
Rubicon reference, Safety said, ``The die is cast? I thought Mr.
Peabody said that.''

 &HT;    FEDERAL TRACKING OF STATE EDUCATION TRENDS CRITICIZED
 &HT;    Resending for all needing
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government spends too little and takes
too long when it measures the progress of states in improving their
schools, the National Education Goals Panel declared Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We somehow have to demand the money to get the job done
speedily,'' said Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, as he
succeeded Democratic Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky as the panel's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Congress set up the influential, bipartisan panel a decade ago
to monitor the effects of school reforms. It is composed of eight
governors, four members of Congress, four state legislators and two
presidential members.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of the statistics used by the panel to track
national and state-level trends are collected annually. Others are
collected every two, four or 10 years.
</P>

<P>

funding for schools and teachers and promotion chances for
students.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Musick of Atlanta, who chairs the National Assessment
Governing Board, said two states refused to take part in this
year's national math and science tests for students in the fourth
and eighth grades. He said seven other states backed out and some
of the remaining 41 have had a hard time finding enough schools to

 &HT;    Proving time for Chen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ No more red carpet, no more rave reviews.
Bruce Chen has to roll up his sleeves and do some serious work to
win the Braves' fifth starter spot this year.
</P>
<P>
   With Steve Avery recently signed and Terry Mulholland another
viable option, Chen has the inside track but not much more. But
both he and the Braves say they're starting over fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always start with a clean slate,'' pitching coach Leo
Mazzone said. ``You don't think of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth starter's job was Chen's to claim last year, but after
his shaky spring Odalis Perez emerged with it and Chen was off to
AAA Richmond. Once John Smoltz's elbow problems started flaring up
again and Perez was lost for the season to an elbow injury, Chen
got several more opportunities. But he failed each time and became
one of the last pitchers out of the bullpen. He was left off the
postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old left-hander will have to show the Braves he has
come a long way from his rookie season. He pitched in 16 games for
Atlanta, seven of them starts, and went 2-2 with a 5.47 ERA. He
gave up an eye-popping 11 home runs in 51 innings, walked 27
batters and allowed 38 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he would exhibit the precision he was known for in
the minors, but in the end it was his control that failed him.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's shining moment came in Philadelphia when he pitched the
second game of a doubleheader in July and allowed one unearned run
in a 3-1 win. But his next turn he was back to getting slapped
around, allowing six runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Brewers.
That would be his last start before the second-to-last game of the
season, when the Braves had long since clinched the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year made me a more mature pitcher, a more confident
pitcher,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Stop. Rewind. Confident?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, Chen said, and this was his explanation: ``It's like
taking the SAT. The first time you take the SAT, you do bad. You
know the next time you take it you're going to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year I know a lot more about myself _ what pitches
work for me, how I react to different situations, what I can do to
overcome them,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen chose to play winter ball in Venezuela this offseason
instead of going back to Georgia Tech, where he's pursuing an
engineering degree. The results weren't great _ he went 0-4 with a
5.68 ERA in six games, allowing 48 hits in 31 2/3 innings. But the
work was important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thrown only 20 innings in the last six months,'' Chen
said. ``I wanted to get my control back, to improve my change-up
and get a more consistent curveball. ... (Last year) I lost my
focus, one batter or one inning. I just want to be consistent. It
shouldn't take me three or four runs to realize I'm off target.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have always raved about Chen's repertoire of pitches
and have done more of the same this spring. But the true test will
come when exhibition games start later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about working ahead in the count,'' Mazzone said. ``And
if you do get behind, don't sacrifice stuff to get strikes.''

REPORT TELLS OF CIVILIAN KILLINGS IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ The names have no streets in the sprawling mass
of ruins that used to be Grozny. The ceilings have no walls, the
fences have no houses, the splintered branches strewn across the
muddy earth have no trees.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's capital, once home to more than 400,000 people, has
become a nightmare of jagged and jumbled war debris, where ghastly
secrets are buried under the rubble with the dead.
</P>
<P>
   After 60 days of constant Russian bombardment and the fierce
street fighting between Russian troops and separatist militants
that ended this month, just about everything has been shot full of
holes, blown up, burned, or flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Packs of dogs and flocks of crows roam the ruins. They feed on
the remains of soldiers, fighters, and civilians who died here,
Russian troops say.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Russian soldiers who captured the city say the ruins
should just be plowed under rather than repaired. But then the
truth about the looting _ as well as the torture and summary
executions that rights groups and Chechens accuse the Russians of
committing _ would be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this grim landscape of ruins, mud, and shrapnel
has been closed to the rest of the world by the Russian military.
The official reason is that unexploded mines and rebel fighters
still hiding among the rubble make Grozny unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But others express concern that the army is covering up evidence
of war crimes. The New York-based Human Rights Watch says it has
evidence that Russian soldiers have executed more than 150
civilians in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston-based group, Physicians for Human Rights, released
preliminary findings Saturday of a survey that indicated the
killing may have been more widespread: Of 326 Chechens interviewed
at refugee camps in Ingushetia, across Chechnya's western border,
44 percent said they had seen civilians killed by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports have raised calls for independent investigations
and greater access to Chechnya. The calls were intensified by
footage shown on Russian TV of soldiers dumping a pile of male
bodies into a pit, their legs bound in wire and an ear of at least
one of the bodies cut off. Russian authorities said the videotape
was a fake, and have dismissed most allegations of atrocities as
rebel propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The only people allowed in Grozny are 6,000 to 10,000 stranded
civilians, ekeing out an existence among the ruins because they
have nowhere else to go. Then there are Russian police and Interior
Ministry Army units, and the occasional journalists they bring in
for a closely guarded look.
</P>
<P>
   One such tour on Thursday started on the muddy, debris-strewn
path that used to be the main route leading into Grozny from the
north, the Staropromyslovsky Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed Interior Ministry commandos accompanied the
reporters atop two armored personnel carriers. Every house along a
row of formerly neat one-story homes had been damaged. Some had
ragged holes in their roofs, blown-out windows, burn marks on their
walls. Others were nothing but four crumbling walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People Live Here,'' pleaded signs hanging on some fences.
</P>
<P>
   But they no longer live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``House for Sale!'' read other signs, the exclamation point
adding a touch of urgency, quite gratuitously.
</P>
<P>
   This neighborhood is the place where, according to Human Rights
Watch, about 50 Chechen civilians were shot and killed in their
yards by Russian soldiers combing the area for rebels this month.
Some of the survivors appeared to confirm the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people were shot _ we found one old woman in a home
for the elderly, they shot her in the head and left her there in
her wheelchair,'' said Malika Kurbanova, who lives with her family
in a cellar that was largely spared destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman began describing how Russian paramilitary units
fired on civilians who tried to prevent looting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to the house when the troops are there, or else
they start shooting,'' said the woman, who only gave her first
name, Teresa. ``We hated the rebels, but (the Russians) were just
as bad, if not worse.''
</P>
<P>
   A police major escorting the journalists tried to shout down the
woman. He asked her whether she had seen the damage done by the
apartment bombs that killed 293 people in Moscow and other cities
last summer, which Russian authorities blamed on Chechen rebels. No
one ever proved the Chechens' responsibility in those blasts, and
the bomb sites were buried almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``You set those bombs off yourselves to justify invading
Chechnya!'' Teresa shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was shouting, ``We have no hope! We have no future!''
when the major and his men pulled the reporters away.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to show their side of the story _ the site
of a battle with rebel fighters in which their unit, the 21st
Interior Ministry Brigade, lost 43 men.
</P>
<P>
   On the former intersection of 9th Avenue and Tashkala Square
stood the rusting hull of an armored troop carrier, blown up by a
Chechen antitank grenade during fighting last month.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Noncommissioned Officer Filippov died here as he tried
in vain to pull three comrades out of the burning tank, said the
21st Brigade's commander, Colonel Anatoly Yepifanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the civilians were in bomb shelters when we arrived,''
Yepifanov said, denying his troops committed atrocities. ``All we
found here was a lot of fighters, and you can see the damage they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had done visible damage during the five-day battle
for 9th Avenue. A row of apartment buildings had become a frozen
cascade of concrete, plaster and brick. In what was once a leafy
park, trees and shrubs were cut into splinters. A burned-out tank
lay under a sign on one chopped-up trunk that read ``No trash _ 200
ruble fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-minute drive into the center from the north was an
obstacle course of 10-foot-deep craters from the 1,100-pound bombs
Russian jets dropped on the city. Only two buildings on the road
escaped destruction _ Cafe Linda, and a small store with a sign
offering Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Handfuls of civilians roamed the pathways, many tugging crude
handcarts full of plastic bottles of diesel fuel they found at
abandoned warehouses. Heat is the one thing they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``No food, no help, no safety,'' muttered Lyudmila Kurbanova, as
she tugged her cart through the mud. ``I don't know who is right. I
lived in a basement all December and January. There was a direct
hit on our house. Mama died in January . . . some soldiers came and
took our mattresses and rugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have set up soup kitchens and a field hospital
closer to the center, but the escort did not let the journalists
stop. Instead, the armored personnel carriers rumbled on to the
center of the city that Russia destroyed to save.
</P>
<P>
   This was where the main fighting took place in the first two
battles for Grozny, in 1995 when the Russians took the city, and in
1996 when the Chechen rebels reclaimed it. Much of the center was
ruined in the first battle, and thousands of people were killed.
Only 150,000 residents remained when Russian troops reentered
Chechnya in October, but those who could fled before the city was
retaken.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the central Independence Square was just a flat,
desolate plain, littered with empty rocket casings, bullets, and
gravel. A lone staff bearing a tattered rebel flag was the only
thing standing on the east side of the extensive square.
</P>
<P>
   Across a wrecked bridge over the Sunzha River, Avturkhanov
Avenue was pocked with deep craters from Russian bombs and shells.
``Dial 01 in case of a Fire'' said the remains of one sign. The
``Ocean'' food store was gone, as was the hotel, the Orthodox
church, the apartment buildings and the pharmacy. Even the ruins
that used to be here were gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops stopped their armored personnel carrier at
Minutka Square, a huge interchange south of the center. Dmitry
Mokrushkin commanded a platoon that battled the rebels hand-to-hand
for the square. Out of Mokrushkin's 30 men, 10 survived. When the
Russians captured Minutka, they blew up the remains of the
high-rises that once had ringed the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets,'' Mokrushkin said. ``We should plow the
whole city under the ground. Otherwise, the bandits will be back
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it has the rebels trapped in the mountains south of
Grozny. But the troops know it is not quite like that. Mokrushkin
said the separatists have split up into small groups. Some are
pretending to be civilians; others probe Russian positions at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get shot at each night,'' Mokrushkin said. He professed to
know nothing about the theory favored in some political circles:
that the Kremlin organized the war to help Acting President
Vladimir Putin win next month's election. Mokrushkin only found out
this month about Boris Yeltsin's resignation and Putin's ascension
to power on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' Mokrushkin said, looking at the leveled
battlefield, ``is what they did to our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The journalists were driven past the monument where Chechnya's
rebel leaders held public executions in 1997, infuriating Russia
and disturbing many in the West. They drove past the place where in
January, Globe correspondent Dmitry Shalganov found Svetlana
Kapustina wandering the ruined streets, hoping for news of her
daughter Irina, 15, who had been abducted in Grozny in November.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of nearly 1,800 kidnapping victims in Chechnya since
Russian troops left after the 1994-1996 war. Now the troops are
back, and hostages are being rescued. Russian TV reported six
hostages were freed Saturday, among them Svetlana's daughter. A new
problem arises: how to find Svetlana in these ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A column of Russian trucks drove by, filled with mattresses,
chairs, rugs and furniture, past the ruins of Grozny's central
market, destroyed in a Russian rocket attack that killed over 150
shoppers in October.
</P>
<P>
   A team of riot police in battle gear moved cautiously along 9th
Avenue, aiming at the ruined buildings. Someone had just discovered
unexploded mines, and explosives specialists were moving in to
detonate them safely.
</P>
<P>
   A shock wave and a bright flash preceded the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find stuff every day,'' said Lieutenant Roman Krivosheyev,
commander of the bomb squad. ``No one will be able to live here for
a long time.''

COMBINING APARTMENTS FOR MORE LIVING SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeremy and Susan Berman live in a white brick
high-rise on West 72nd Street, the urban equivalent of a 1960s
ranch house. And just as suburban ranch houses are being renovated
to reflect the styles and needs of today, the white brick
buildings, erected in the same era, are undergoing their
transformations, although the results are not as obvious as, say, a
new French-country facade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Bermans bought a one-bedroom apartment on the 12th
floor in the doorman building, next to the Dakota and steps from
Central Park. Then, seven years later, after the birth of their
first child, Adam, now 5, they sold their apartment and bought a
studio and a one-bedroom apartment on the sixth floor, combining
the two to create a large two-bedroom place with an office.
</P>
<P>
   No longer were they living in the same cookie-cutter layout
typical of the white brick buildings, with every place in a line
matching the one above or below. In fact, just as they were putting
together their two apartments, others in the building were making
the same combination, but in very different ways, transforming the
spaces to have large eat-in kitchens, or loftlike living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Once again needing more room, this time for their daughter,
Joanna, who was born 17 months ago, the Bermans in December bought
a studio apartment directly below their current one, paying
$197,500 for the 550-square-foot space, $89,500 more than they paid
for the same-sized studio three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When the two are joined with a staircase that will eliminate the
current office as well as the kitchen below, at a cost of about
$40,000, they will have a duplex apartment with three bedrooms and
a new office.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermans didn't arrive on the block thinking they would never
leave, and they have at various times considered finding a larger
place elsewhere. ``We did try spending a summer in Larchmont as an
experiment, when Adam was 7 months old,'' Berman said. It was a
summer with little rain, he said, and he liked being able to cook
out every night.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Berman said she found the town isolating; although she
could walk to stores, there were few people on the street, at least
compared to Manhattan. And so they returned to 72nd Street, where
Berman had first begun living in 1983, when he shared an apartment
with his brother, Daniel. Jeremy Berman, who works for a law firm
near Times Square, can walk to and from work every day.
</P>
<P>
   They speak of their building, the Mayfair, as its own community,
with friendly residents and employees who have turned it into an
urban Eden, where they can avoid many of the annoying aspects of
home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff is so wonderful,'' said Mrs. Berman, who does some
consulting work for nonprofit organizations. ``They do everything,
from putting in lightbulbs to fixing the oven to moving
furniture.'' The building also has a back yard, an enclosed
playground, a rooftop and a gym.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations have become common in the city as families decide
they prefer Manhattan to the suburbs. But getting that adjacent
apartment, or the one above or below, involves the tricky etiquette
of suggesting that the neighbors move away. ``I didn't want to
approach my neighbors,'' Berman said. ``You have to see them every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Bermans called Susan Ruttner, a senior vice president at
Halstead Property Co. who had sold them their first apartment, the
two they combined and a bungalow in a summer community north of the
city. Ruttner, who has lived in the building for 21 years and has
sold about 75 apartments there, left a note with the doorman for
their next-door neighbor, who said he had renovated his kitchen to
his liking and didn't want to move. So she left a note with the
doorman for the resident directly below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever accost anybody,'' Ruttner said. After a few
weeks, when she had heard nothing, she left another note, not
taking the silence personally. ``Maybe it got lost,'' she said.
This time she got an answer, and eventually, they reached an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The space acquired in a combination is nearly always more costly
than it would be on the open market, but the resulting apartment
also tends to be more valuable than the separate pieces. Some
boards make the renovations difficult, but this building seems to
welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is very combination-friendly,'' Mrs. Berman said.
``I think they feel it adds value to the building if there are
one-of-a-kind residences.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before they closed on the space, the Bermans had an
architect and an engineer look at it, to be sure their plan was
workable, and they received an informal indication that the board
would look favorably on it. They are now awaiting approvals and
looking for a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   They're not in a great rush to combine the space, because
they're not yet crowded. At first, they will use the space
downstairs as an office and a playroom. It will become bedrooms
when the children are ready for their own rooms; at that point, the
room they share upstairs will become a new office.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, their large open living room, furnished with little
more than an Oriental carpet and a couch, functions as their play
space. ``Adam can lay out 150 matchstick cars,'' Mrs. Berman said.
And just as a country child would make roads in the dirt for his
vehicles, she said, ``he makes roads with the patterns in the
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   When they have joined their two floors, and the children's toys
move downstairs, she said, ``I'll get my living room back.''

TRADING DEADLINE PRODUCES LITTLE ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Has the trade deadline passed yet? Or does it just
seem like the NBA took the week off during what is usually the
busiest time of the season?
</P>
<P>
   There was only one deal Tuesday, and it's barely worth
mentioning (the Hawks shipped guard Anthony Johnson to the Magic
for a second-round draft pick).
</P>
<P>
   That flies in the face of history. In the past 10 years, there
were 30 trades involving 82 players on the day of the trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it has to do with a complicated issue called the luxury
tax, which goes into effect next season. If player salaries exceed
55 percent o f the league's Basketball Related Income (BRI), the
players must return 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow
fund.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother any owners.
</P>
<P>
   But if the salaries surpass 61 percent of the BRI, teams must
match the excess amount with their own payments into the escrow
fund.
</P>
<P>
   That bothers owners.
</P>
<P>
   So any team that traded for an overpriced star (like Cleveland's
Shawn Kemp) would only be boosting the amount it might be expected
to contribute towards the escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is the NBA, so some esoteric issue like luxury
taxes can't be the only reason there were no trades. There were
plenty of potential deals out there that just didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expected the Clippers to deal Maurice Taylor, because
getting something in return for the free agent is better than
nothing, but once again logic took a back seat to stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   And the Heat called nearly every team in the league, desperate
for backcourt help. One potential deal involved Clippers guard
Derek Anderson for Voshon Lenard. But in the end, they accomplished
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason no deals took place is that the teams were
reluctant to take on the burdensome contracts of the Kemps and
Dikembe Mutombo's oft he world, or else tried to swindle other
teams by offering little in return: Like Lenard for Atlanta's J.R.
Rider.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a deadly silent deadline, and should mean
that the free-agent period will be extremely active, as teams saved
their salary-cap money to sign players this summer.
</P>
<P>
   All is not forgiven: Hornets guard Eldridge Recasner was act
ivated this week, after missing most of the season with a broken
shoulder, collapsed lung and other internal injuries suffered in an
automobile accident on Oct. 27. Recasner was a passenger in a car
driven by Hornets forward Derrick Coleman, who turned in front of
an oncoming truck to cause the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Recasner is still upset with Coleman over the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what happened,'' Recasner said. ``It doesn't
matter what the courts said, I don't think. Everybody knows what
the deal was. I don't want to make a big deal out of it because
it's in the past, but it's nothing I've forgotten about, believe
me. I don't want to make a big issue out of it, but I'll never
forget that. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was acquitted of DWI charges after the accident, but
Recasner is upset that Coleman waited more than a week to call and
see if he was OK .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into time frames, but whatever length of
time it was, it wasn't satisfactory to me,'' Recasner said. ``If I
did that to somebody, I would want to be there to see how they were
doing, and I didn' t feel that was the case. So nine days or
whatever it was, there's no excuse for that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has said he plans to talk to Recasner, but Recasner said
it is too late to patch up any differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much time has passed, so I just want to move on,''
Recasner said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus stops here: The funniest scene of the week had to be in
Minneapolis, where Clippers forward Maurice Taylor refused to get
off the team bus when it arrived at the Target Center, because he
was upset that the team had not traded him.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was so upset a trade to the New York Knicks fell through
that he initially refused to get off the team bus when it arrived
at Target Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated,'' Taylor said. ``They had a chance to get a
couple of first-round picks . . . evidently they chose not to, and
again that shows you what type of organization they are. If they're
going to risk losing free agents on their team that have some type
of value to them for nothing . . . that's just the story of the
Clippers. That's what they do every year. They have free agents,
and they lose them for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brew town blues: Warriors forward Jason Caffey tried to kill a
potential trade to Milwaukee this week by ripping the city. Caffey
said Milwaukee was ``terrible'' and that Bucks coach George Karl
``knows ( Milwaukee's) messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade, which would have sent Caffey and Adonal Foyle to the
Bucks for Robert Traylor, J.R. Reid and a first-round draft pick,
never materialized. But Karl felt it necessary to defend the city's
honor anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who live their lifestyles on judgments of cities,
to me that's kind of a low judgment of your intelligence,'' Karl
said. ``A guy on a losing team that's struggled for years, for him
to say that . . . it (ticks) me off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caffey still wasn't backing down after being told of Karl's
comments. ``If I'm dealt at the end of the season,'' he said,
``that's obviously my destiny. As long as it's not that place
(Milwaukee).''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought: Two weeks ago, the Celtics traded Danny
Fortson to Toronto, before the Celtics killed the deal after Rick
Pitino was savaged by the Beantown media.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Pitino is now claiming the Celtics want to re-sign
Fortson, who is a free-agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a bad gamble, but I'm going to make it. We'll
see if I can sign him,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   The flip-flop is only the latest example of why players can't
stand Pitino.

 MCCAIN TAKES BATTLE TO OHIO; DEMOCRATS COURT WASHINGTON STATE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Hoping for a reprise of his Michigan victory,
John McCain barnstormed through Ohio Saturday, trying to win the
hearts of voters _ especially Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bill Bradley, campaigning in Washington state, accused
the state Democratic Party of violating its pledge of neutrality
and boycotted a party event in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before Washington's nonbinding primary, the last
Democratic clash before the crucial round of primaries on March 7,
Bradley blasted the state party's decision to set up a caucus site
inside Vice President Al Gore's campaign office in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That move ``probably says it all'' about Bradley's contention
that the state party has abandoned ``any pretense of neutrality,''
Bradley's state director, Robert Becker, wrote Saturday to party
chairman Paul Berendt.
</P>
<P>
   In protest, Bradley canceled plans to attend the party's
``presidential primary chili fest'' Saturday and said he held a
dueling chili fest across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were scheduled to speak at the state NAACP
chapter's 60th anniversary dinner Saturday night, although they
were not expected to cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley started his day in Spokane, where he told about 400
supporters that his effort to close Gore's large lead in Washington
was showing signs of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday is the time for the state of Washington to step
forward and send a message to the rest of the country,'' Bradley
said, ``This could be the launching pad and you can be the rockets
that make us take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain's victory in the Michigan primary, in which
Democrats and independents outnumbered Republicans, the Arizona
senator has been pushing his GOP credentials, partly to head off
claims by Texas Governor George W. Bush, that the senator lacks
support in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Ohio Saturday, and at a San Diego event Friday
night, handwritten signs read, ``Republicans for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was in Austin Saturday, taking a break from
campaigning, McCain's day began with a tour through Cleveland's
West Side Market. Narrow aisles were jammed with supporters as
McCain moved among the stalls, chatting with shopkeepers, signing
copies of his book, and shaking hundreds of hands.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ferguson of Cleveland Heights, a registered Democrat, said
he would vote for McCain in Ohio's primary March 7, even though
there is a Democratic primary the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like candidates who are anointed. I don't mind George
W. Bush, but too many endorsements doesn't smell right,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where McCain stands on a variety of issues,'' he
said. ``But he seems authentic. I just want somebody with a bit of
fire in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one voter took issue with the claims of Bush and other
Republicans that McCain was reaching beyond the party's base for
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baloney,'' said Ed Klimas of Lyndhurst. ``I used to be a
Republican. But I got so disgusted with the party that I became an
Independent. This is the first guy who's gotten my blood pressure
up in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later tried to dispel doubts about his conservativism at
a town hall meeting at Ohio State University before about 2,000
people. He referred to his Republican heroes, particularly Ronald
Reagan, and called himself ``the real fiscal conservative in this
race.''
</P>
<P>
   He also gave a couple of acid responses to two groups of
protesters for liberal causes. When the first group, protesting the
relocation of Native Americans of the Navajo nation, began
chanting, McCain stood and listened to them. After security guards
forced them to stop, McCain said: ``You know, guys, it'd be a lot
more convincing if you brought a Native American with you once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   To the second protesters, who shouted, ``Give us a living
wage!'' McCain's response was far swifter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be glad to,'' he told them. ``Go to work!''

MASS. GOVERNOR STUMPS FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ With his candidate trailing badly in
statewide polls, Governor Paul Cellucci set off on a bus tour
across the state Saturday, promising a ``massive'' get-out-the-vote
effort for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But during Cellucci's few minutes in front of City Hall, where
he was kissing babies and touting the Texas governor's bid for the
Republican nomination, a crowd of only about 100 Bush supporters
braved the cold drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the rally, Cellucci acknowledged polls
showing Bush trailing his main opponent, John McCain, by nearly 2
to 1 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have our work cut out for us,'' he said. Avoiding
a comparison to Michigan Governor John Engler, who endorsed Bush
but couldn't deliver the election, Cellucci said: ``As you know, we
have a very narrow Republican base here.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's road tour Saturday also ferried him and scores of
sign-toting Bush backers to Haverhill, Lowell, and Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Texas governor's devotees in Worcester described
Bush as an inclusive candidate whose calls for deep tax cuts
awakened fond memories of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Toussaint, a 53-year-old Haitian immigrant, said it
didn't bother him that Bush addressed Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, which bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush should do whatever he has to do to consolidate his
base,'' Toussaint said. ``He doesn't have to change every group he
speaks to.''

<P>
   Though he agrees with most of Bush's conservative views, the
real reason he attended Saturday's rally was because of Cellucci.
``I trust Paul Cellucci, and that's why I will vote for Bush,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Petitti, a 68-year-old developer, said he'll vote for
Bush, even if he has to ``drop a notch or two in arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has been a steady stream of Bush supporters
trickling into McCain's camp, Cellucci reaffirmed his commitment to
Bush and observed the oddity of an increasing number of Democrats
voting for McCain, a self-described social conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision to endorse Bush is rock solid,'' Cellucci said.

AFTER VERDICTS, SEEKING ANSWERS IN NYPD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that the four officers who killed Amadou Diallo
have been found not guilty of any crime, the focus is shifting to
what many call the ``unindicted codefendant'' _ the New York Police
Department itself.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts on Friday, many community leaders, street
protesters, and Democratic politicians began to pose the questions
first raised when the shooting took place a year ago:
</P>
<P>
   Is there something about the training methods, the hiring
practices, or the social culture of the department that drove these
four white plainclothes officers, all members of the elite Street
Crime Unit, to fire 41 bullets at a short, slight West African
immigrant as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building?
</P>
<P>
   The officers said, and the jury apparently believed, that they
thought Diallo was pulling a pistol from his pocket _ not, as it
turned out, a wallet. Still, the question has buzzed for a year:
Why should suspicion trigger 41 bullets?
</P>
<P>
   And how much of what happened that night reflected a word that
has loomed over every discussion of this shooting, but went
unmentioned during the trial _ race?
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some impressions, shootings by this city's
40,000-member police force are rare and getting rarer. Police fired
their weapons 155 times last year, killing 11 people, according to
department statistics. This was down from 249 shootings, killing
19, the year before, which was down from 317, killing 31, the year
before that. Going back further, police killed 41 civilians in
1990, and averaged 63 killings a year in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   However, in recent years, New York police have assumed a more
aggressive presence, especially in black neighborhoods. In some
respects, this has been welcome, as crime has fallen most sharply
in those areas. But it has also aggravated racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true of the Street Crime Unit, a force of
380 officers with the mandate of ridding the city of guns. They
roam the city unshackled by the boundaries of precincts. Until
recently, their motto was ``We Own the Street,'' and they wore
T-shirts quoting Hemingway on hunting humans: ``Those who have
hunted armed men long enough, and liked it, never really care for
anything else thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   They are told to be aggressive. Unofficially, they get monthly
gun-nabbing quotas. And they follow their directives with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, according to a study by the state attorney
general, they stopped and frisked 45,000 people. This resulted in
9,000 arrests involving gun possession.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, that meant a lot fewer guns on the street. On
the other, it meant 36,000 innocent people had been frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the frisking officers were white. Almost all the
frisked citizens were black. The officers were seen as an
occupation force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no business sending four white police to patrol a
black neighborhood that night,'' the Rev. Betty Neal, a black
minister who often counsels police and has close relations with
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir,
said of the night Diallo was shot.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Diallo shooting, 80 percent of Street Crime
Unit officers were white, 16 percent were Hispanic, and 3 percent
were black. Afterward, Safir opened up 50 slots for minority
officers. Now, 64 percent of the unit's officers are white, 19
percent are Hispanic, and 16 percent are black.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that the unit's racial composition, still far
whiter than the neighborhoods it patrols, affects not only the
residents but also the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Julian, who was the department's personnel commissioner
during William J. Bratton's tenure as police chief, said of the
officers who shot Diallo, ``They were overwhelmed by fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else, Julian said, could explain their having fired so
many bullets. Two officers, Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon, who
stood closest to Diallo, unloaded their 9mm pistols, each
containing 16 bullets. (The other two, Kenneth Boss and Richard
Murphy, fired five and four bullets, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   Carl Clay, a Queens filmmaker who has made documentaries for
schools and youth groups on how black men should behave when
stopped by police, said: ``Some officers have a level of fear, just
being in a certain community. Their perception is `I'm working in a
jungle.' The people they stop and frisk, they see as `street
trash.' They automatically think, `He looks like a criminal,' which
sometimes really just means he's black and he's doing something a
little unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian said: ``If you send people out in the street and tell
them they're going to approach people in high-crime areas, you have
to give them specific commands on what's allowed by law.'' In his
mind, the four officers who shot Diallo, especially the two who
unloaded their pistols, ``weren't properly prepared for the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics have suggested a reemphasis on ``community
policing,'' the concept of putting more police officers on foot
patrol, with the idea that walking the streets makes them better
acquainted with a neighborhood and thus with how to deal with
people in it.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot Diallo testified that they had seen
Diallo's street as being infested with crime. In fact, while drugs
are sold nearby, Diallo's block is fairly middle-class, with
well-kept two-story apartments, cars parked on the street, no
graffiti, and little crime.

POPE MAKES PILGRIMAGE TO MOUNT SINAI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHERINE, Egypt _ Pope John Paul II came Saturday to Mount
Sinai to rise above the ancient enmities and modern politics of the
Middle East and reflect on the covenant God made here with his
people.
</P>
<P>
   In this millennial year, ``our faith leads us to become pilgrims
in the footsteps of God,'' John Paul said at an outdoor service at
the Monastery of St. Catherine, which dates to the sixth century
AD.
</P>
<P>
   In a garden shaded by olive and almond trees at the base of
Sinai's pink granite slope, the pope spoke of how his personal
pilgrimage was part of a history that began with Moses in a
redemptive story that binds Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   As a dry gust swept down from the mountaintop, John Paul said,
``That wind carries an insistent invitation to dialogue between the
followers of the great monotheistic religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The steep, two-hour hike up a footpath and ancient stairs that
lead to the summit was out of the question for the ailing but
resilient 79-year-old pontiff. Even pilgrims less than half his age
struggled with the ascent.
</P>
<P>
   He was too frail to climb a set of stairs at the base of the
mountain that would have given him a direct view. Instead, John
Paul circled by plane the craggy summit of Mount Sinai to
contemplate the spot where the Bible says Moses received the Ten
Commandments from God.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, known for his indefatigable desire to travel the world
in the name of God, fulfilled a lifelong dream in coming to Mount
Sinai, Vatican officials said. The pope has described this first
leg of a pilgrimage that will continue next month in Jordan,
Israel, and Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem, as ``the coronation'' of a
22-year reign that has included 90 foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinai was the wilderness through which the Israelites
wandered for 40 years in search of the Promised Land. Local legend
holds that the monastery sits on the site of the burning bush,
where Moses received a command to lead his people out of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the monastery, the legendary site of the bush is the base
of a chapel altar. The bush itself, legend holds, was planted in a
sunny corner of a courtyard inside the walls of the monastery. The
pope spent nearly an hour of meditation there, receiving a sprig of
the bush from the monks of this Greek Orthodox monastery.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's spiritual journey marked a quiet change of focus from
the first two days of his three-day visit to Egypt, when he
delivered more contemporary statements on the needs for improved
Muslim-Christian relations. That call resonated in the wake of
Muslim-Christian tensions that erupted last month in the worst
sectarian strife Egypt had seen in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to Sinai was part of his efforts to build
bridges between the Roman Catholic church and the Greek Orthodox
church, which broke apart in 1054.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to St. Catherine's, where only 20 monks live
but which is one of the most important sites in Greek Orthodoxy,
was laden with historical significance. But it was not without its
moments of tension.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Orthodox Archbishop Damianos, senior cleric of the
monastery, had refused permission for the pope to hold a service
inside the chapel. After presenting the pope with gifts, including
several of the monastery's icons of Jesus and the Virgin Mary,
Damianos and his monks left the stage and conducted a separate
ritual because the two churches do not have, Damianos said, ``an
ecclesiastical communion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's visit, Damianos was asked if a reunion between
the two churches could ever be achieved. He replied, ``It is
possible, but it would take a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the backdrop of tensions, John Paul seemed focused on
delving into Catholic dogma and the place of the Ten Commandments
in Catholic theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ten Commandments now make themselves heard through the
voice of the beloved son,'' he said, reading his sermon from a
gilded throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``God revealed man to man himself,'' he said, stopping on the
phrase and repeating it, and looking out at the 1,000 pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was mostly composed of Egypt's minority Copts in this
overwhelming Muslim country. Only about 200,000 of the estimated 5
million Christians are Roman Catholic. Scores of American and
European pilgrims also journeyed into the desert wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was US Army Sergeant-Major Daryl Niles, 41, of
Fitchburg, Mass., who commands a unit within the international
peacekeeping operation in the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides my kids being born, this is the most exciting moment
of my life,'' he said. ``The message he has sent out for world
peace makes you very proud as a Catholic.''

WORRY ABOUT BUSH HANGS OVER GOVERNORS' MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was supposed to have been a time of gaiety and
celebration. When the nation's Republican governors rallied around
George W. Bush's campaign last year, they had hoped he would have
the GOP presidential nomination wrapped up by this time.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little gaiety, and no celebration, for the
Republicans who gathered here Saturday for the National Governors'
Association midwinter meeting. While they put up a brave front in
public, in private the GOP governors shared their worries about the
rise of Senator John McCain as a challenger to Bush, their friend
and fellow governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic? No. Concern? Yes. As there should be,'' a Republican
Governors' Association official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think we will be talking about our problems when we talk
with each other in our closed-door sessions? Absolutely,'' said
Governor Michael Leavitt of Utah, who chairs the National
Governors' Association this year. ``Will you have a lot of
Republican governors offering suggestions? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a weekend for Republicans throughout the country to take
stock of the surprising turn of events in the presidential race. As
the GOP governors gathered here, Senate Republicans flocked to a
private retreat in rural Pennsylvania. And in Austin, Texas, the
Bush campaign's officials and fund-raisers gathered to ponder their
course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt expressed confidence that Bush would eventually triumph.
``It yet will turn out the way we want it to,'' he said. ``If I
were George Bush I would not for a minute want to trade places with
John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   That outlook got some support Saturday from a new Time/CNN poll
that showed Bush leading McCain 48 percent to 23 percent in
California, which holds its primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats, were delighted at the way the
Republican infighting is draining resources that could have been
focused on the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One never takes glee from the anguish and destruction of
someone else,'' Governor Parris Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat,
said with tongue in cheek, when asked about the predicament of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But ``when you look at the other side and see . . . what is
going on. It can only help the Democrats,'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governors and their aides expressed concerns
about Bush having spent $60 million of a $70 million campaign
treasury, including $2 million in a losing effort in McCain's home
state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And several Republican leaders have worried aloud that the Bush
campaign message _ that he is a ``compassionate conservative'' who
can unite folks of all kinds _ has been muddied by the rough
tactics his campaign used to defeat McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``stupid'' for Bush to give a speech at Bob Jones
University, a South Carolina college whose officials have made
anti-Catholic statements, Governor John Rowland of Connecticut, a
Republican, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, of Utah, tried to put things in perspective. He is a
Mormon, he said, and his religion has also been vilified at Bob
Jones. But he said he would not tar Bush with guilt by association.
A decision to speak at a college is not an endorsement of
everything anyone connected to the college ever said, Leavitt
argued.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no defections by governors. McCain, who labeled
the governors ``greedy'' when they called for the power to tax
sales on the Internet, has cemented their loyalty to Bush, Leavitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling to have somebody say he doesn't care about the
governors, and the governors are greedy,'' Leavitt said. ``John
McCain is a respected war hero. But a reformer? He's been in
Washington for 18 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 30 Republican governors showed up for a
confrontational press conference in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main problem, Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas told
reporters, was that ``he gets a size 13 shoe up his backside every
day from the national press.''
</P>
<P>
   On a less combative note, Huckabee said voters should consider
the support of one's peers. He noted that when then-Senator Bob
Dole ran for president in 1996, he was endorsed by most Republican
senators. When Bush announced last year, he won the support of all
but two or three of the GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   But, Huckabee added, ``there's a whole bunch of US senators who
know John McCain, who have worked with John McCain, and joined us
in supporting George W. Bush. That's a very important thing to
remember.''

DODGERS FACE PITCHING DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. -- All indications are Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson would prefer to begin the season with 11 pitchers,
including six in the bullpen. But the bullpen depth the Dodgers
have in camp, coupled with contracts, may force the club to break
camp with 12 relievers.
</P>
<P>
   It could boil down to two factors:
</P>
<P>
   First, if lefty Carlos Perez is awful in spring training and
begins the season in the minor leagues, Orel Hershiser could move
from the bullpen to the rotation. That would allow the Dodgers to
keep an extra reliever on the 25-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the Dodgers can package a pair of right-handers to
acquire a quality, veteran left-hander. Tops on the trading block
is right-hander Alan Mills, in the second year of a three-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those scenarios could allow the Dodgers to remain with
11 pitchers and keep right-hander Mike Fetters in the mix. The
former Pepperdine standout has dazzled the first 10 days of camp,
but contract issues can force the Dodgers' hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters has a clause in his contract that he can opt for free
agency if he doesn't make the major league roster. The Dodgers
would hate to lose a fit Fetters because his sinker ball induces
double plays late in games .
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you have to hold on to at all costs is pitching,
and your pitching depth,'' Johnson said. ``And we have some depth,
unlike this time last year when we were paper thin. Now we have
some veterans that can handle that role, and I don't want to lose
that depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who preaches the importance of bullpen and bench almost
daily, still has a month to settle the issue. Closer Jeff Shaw and
set-up men Gregg Olson and Terry Adams are givens. Mills looms as
the top set-up guy if he's not used to lure a lefty. Hershiser also
fits in the mix. Lefties Jeff Williams and Onan Masaoka may battle
for one spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers also have Dan Naulty, Fetters, Matt Herges and
Jamie Arnold as right-handers, and all but Fetters can be sent to
the minor leagues. Also, Antonio Osuna remains ahead of schedule on
his rehab program.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he'd like to have it figured out before the club
breaks camp and plays a pair of exhibition games in Toronto on
March 31 and April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, that last week I'd like to have a place for everybody
and not have to re-arrange the whole roster to accommodate and
protect,'' Johnson said. ``There's contract issues and options.
Things generally have a way of working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the hitting: With Mark Grudzielanek's change from
shortstop to second, he's spent so much time working in the field
that he hasn't spent much time in the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   For Grudzielanek, who loves to swing the bat, that isn't a good
thing. Luckily for him, though, it shouldn't take long to find his
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about hitting because I haven't done it much,''
said Grudzielanek, who set a Dodgers record for shortstops with a
.326 average last season. ``I've leaving one side away. I have to
try and get back to where I was at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Las Vegas: A meeting of many minds, including those of
the Dodgers front office, will take place in Las Vegas on March 6
as six teams hold a super summit to discuss a mega-complex for
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president and COO Bob Graziano said the club is involved
in discussions involving Las Vegas, but since no teams train there
it would take an agreement from at least four teams before a
complex could be built.
</P>
<P>
   This provides that opportunity. The Dodgers will joined by
representatives of the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays,
Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers. Each of the
teams currently train in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also entertaining ideas about setting up their
spring fling camp in Florida and Arizona, though officials from
both areas are wary about the money Las Vegas can put together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much money they could put something together in a
month or two,'' said Robert Brinton, director for the Mesa (Ariz.)
Convention and Business Bureau and treasurer of the Cactus League.
``I think Las Vegas has everyone concerned. They're talking only
about teams in Florida, and Las Vegas is saying they're not
targeting Arizona, but that could change quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson said it's likely righty Mike Judd and
lefty Jeff Williams, along with a host of veteran relievers, will
pitch in Friday's Grapefruit League season opener against Houston.

 &HT;    Let freedom ring on the mountain
 &HT;    eds. added dropped word in first paragraph
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ The granite dome of Stone Mountain isn't
visible from the center of Stone Mountain Village, but its presence
loomed over Saturday's unveiling of a Freedom Bell dedicated to the
memory of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is where the Ku Klux Klan reorganized at the
beginning of the 20th century. King used it as a symbol of racism
in his ``I Have A Dream'' speech in 1963, declaring, ``Let freedom
ring from Stone Mountain, Ga.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell did indeed ring Saturday in the town that Mayor Chuck
Burris called ``a symbol of progress and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris, elected in 1997, is Stone Mountain's first
African-American mayor. Its six-member City Council has several
African-American members. And the crowd of about 500 who came to
hear the bell rung for the first time was racially mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone Mountain got a bad name because of the Klan, but the
town was never a part of that,'' said Hugh Jordan, former chairman
of the state Legislature's Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Overview Committee, the precursor to MARTA, the current
metropolitan area transportation system. Jordan was born 79 years
ago in a house 500 yards from site of the ceremony on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The races have always gotten along here, that's why you see so
many blacks on our city council,'' he said. ``(Councilman) Robert
Smith has served on it for 25 or 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Georgia State flag flying overhead, Burris introduced
visiting officials, including the consuls of Nigeria and Barbados,
Attorney General Thurbert Baker and the county's CEO, Liane
Levitan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers was Brenda Cornelius, director of community
affairs for Governor Roy Barnes, who read a message from the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far we've come in a city where once the KKK marched with
impunity,'' Barnes wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan reminisced about her first days as an Austrian immigrant
in Georgia, when she was not allowed to ride in the back of a bus
because blacks were relegated to those seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not understand,'' Levitan said. ``Change can be slow in
coming, but it happens for those who refuse to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president emeritus of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, also spoke to the crowd,
impressing a visitor from Charlotte who happened upon the ceremony
while his wife was shopping in the stores along Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice ceremony. I got here about the time Rev. Lowery
began speaking and I really enjoyed him,'' Larry Eaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Council members gathered to pull the burgundy velvet drape from
the 1,700-pound bell. Set on a granite slab in the center of the
village and burnished to a golden glow, the bell rang out to cheers
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Bell was rescued from a church in a Pennsylvania
coal mining town that had to be abandoned because of fires in the
mines below it. It is more than 100 years old and larger by one
inch than the Liberty Bell.

<P>
   ``I think this is very significant. It shows that unity is
coming to Stone Mountain and to the entire country. It's long
overdue,'' said Anthony Byrd, who attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mom Shirley Byrd agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm a part of making history today. It's
wonderful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bell will be tolled annually at noon on King's birthday
holiday, said Burris.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm sure we will think of other occasions to ring it
too,'' he said.

 &HT;    Woods coasts into the finals
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It won't be the ideal matchup for today's
36-hole final of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship _
No. 1 in the world, in other words, against No. 2 _ but don't blame
Tiger Woods. He did his part. David Duval's the one who stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Playing as perfectly as he can play, Woods, the world's No. 1
player by more than the rankings indicate, Saturday dismantled Sea
Island's Davis Love III 5 and 4 in the semifinals, going 8 under
par for 14 holes at the La Costa Resort and Spa, to coast into the
finals of the $5 million event.
</P>
<P>
   The upset came in the other semifinal as Ireland's Darren
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, the 19th seed, eliminated No. 2 Duval, 4 and 2, and
ruined a chance for the world's top two players to meet
head-to-head with a million bucks up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the last two European Ryder Cup teams, Clarke, 31,
upended Duval at the top of his game, too. After pounding Scott
Hoch in the morning quarterfinals, Duval never led against Clarke
and lost the lead for good on the 5th hole, where the Irishman hit
his approach to four feet and birdied.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, basically toyed with Love, the world's No. 4
player, who had strung together three matches without a bogey.
Woods shot a front nine of 30 for a 4-up lead and breezed in. He is
a huge favorite today over Clarke in a battle of two players
coached by Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the best I've played in a while,'' Woods said.
``It's nice to go out there and execute the golf shots the way I
know I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who 24 hours before had relished an opportunity to return
to a role as Woods' main challenger, took a step backward with the
semifinal loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my own fault,'' Duval said. ``I just didn't get close
enough to the hole. I wasn't really thinking ahead. Unlike the
American public who might not know Darren, I'm not foolish enough
to look past him. . . You make 15 pars and a birdie at this point
and you're going to lose. I got what I deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is 6-1 in career 36-hole finals, his only loss coming to
Mark O'Meara, 1-up, in the 1998 Cisco World Match Play in England.
Although 36 holes are not needed to identify the best player in the
world, Woods likes the fairness of the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because if you get off to a bad start, you can make it
up,'' Woods said. ``The best player that day is going to win the
match. In 18 holes, the best player doesn't necessarily win.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Woods would give him wins in all of the World Golf
Championships _ and three straight. While considering them less
than a major championship in importance, he said, ``I think anytime
you get to play against the best players, it's going to be more
special than a normal tour event.''

 McCAIN ALLIES REMINDED VOTERS OF BUSH SPEECH  
 (SUBS 5th graf with more information on calls.) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the past week, the Republican presidential race
was stirred by a telephone campaign in Michigan criticizing Gov.
George W. Bush for speaking at a college whose leaders have
espoused harshly anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for Sen. John McCain, who have acknowledged making the
calls, Saturday said the inspiration for them came from a handful
of political amateurs, and McCain acknowledged that he had
personally approved of the phone bank operation.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the Michigan primary, a group of McCain
volunteers began calling Catholic friends and neighbors, the aides
said, telling them that Bush had given a speech at Bob Jones
University, a bastion of the Christian right whose leaders have
called the pope the anti-Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, immediately after Bush had defeated McCain in a
bitter South Carolina primary with the help of Christian Coalition
and antiabortion phone banks, the McCain campaign recognized the
effectiveness of the Michigan phone calls and decided to expand on
the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Aides drafted a tele- phone script, bought lists of Catholic
voters and contracted with a tele-H marketing company, Conquest
Com- munications of Richmond, Va., that on Monday, the day before
the pri- mary, called 24,000 Roman Catholic households in Michigan.
The cam- paign spent $8,000 on the calls. While all of McCain's
television commercials and print materials clearly state that they
are paid for by the McCain campaign, the taped telephone messages
did not reveal that the McCain campaign was behind them.. But Bush
quickly caught wind of them, and as he was falling to defeat on
primary day, he bitterly accused McCain's campaign of orchestrating
the calls, which he said unfairly implied that he shares the
anti-Catholic views of Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, a McCain spokesman denied that the campaign
had anything to do with the calls, but later in the day a top aide
acknowledged that they had been made by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, responding to frequent questions about them from both
reporters and voters, has tried to use the issue to lump Bush with
the forces of the far right. Though conceding that Bush ``is not a
bigot,'' McCain has repeatedly asked how Bush could have spoken at
the university without repudiating its anti-Catholic teachings or
its ban on interracial dating. Had he been invited to speak at the
university, he told a crowd in Sacramento, ``I'd have told them,
`Get out of the 16th Century and into the 21st Century.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now some of Bush's own supporters, such as New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, are saying the visit to Bob Jones University was
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush has countered by saying the calls reveal
the hypocrisy behind two of McCain's signature pledges _ his
promises to suspend all negative advertising and to always tell the
truth to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, senior strategist for McCain, suggested it was a
matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between 20,000 advocacy phones calls and $8
million in negative TV advertising is the difference between a
grain of sand and the Rock of Gibraltar,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has lately been vigorously denouncing what he says are
McCain's deceptive campaign tactics, and he has said he is a victim
of ``guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running against a man,'' Bush said Friday on a swing
through Virginia, ``who on the one hand says he's going to run a
clean campaign and on the other hand makes phone calls in Michigan
that talk about anti-Catholic bias.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff refused to rule out more such phone calls
in the coming primaries and have even expressed glee that Bush's
criticism of the calls draws more attention to Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they squealed about it, the more an issue it
became,'' McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, borough president of Staten Island, the
co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign, has promised to
highlight Bush's visit to Bob Jones University with the state's
Republican voters, almost half of whom are Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after a rally in San Diego, McCain expressed
irritation when a reporter pressed him on how his campaign's
telephone calls were any different from the telephone calls that
Pat Robertson made, in which Robertson referred indirectly to a
McCain adviser, Warren Rudman, and called him ``a vicious bigot''
because of statements he had made about the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that you don't get the difference,'' McCain said
tartly. ``The calls that Pat Robertson made called Warren Rudman a
bigot. That's entirely different from factual phone calls that
describe exactly what the facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a script from the Bush campaign, the McCain calls
stated: ``Gov. George Bush has campaigned against Sen. John McCain
by seeking the support of Southern fundamentalists who have
expressed anti-Catholic views. Bob Jones has made strong
anti-Catholic statements, including calling the pope anti-Christ,
the Catholic Church a satanic cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has stayed silent,'' the script read.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day of the primary, as voters were still going
to the polls, Opinsky denied the campaign had been behind the
calls. Later in the day, other aides said they may have been made
by over-exuberant volunteers. After the polls closed, with McCain's
victory assured, the campaign manager, Rick Davis, acknowledged the
phone calls had been paid for by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, in defense of Bush's appearance, noted that a
string of Republican leaders have given speeches at Bob Jones
University, including Rep. Lindsey Graham, McCain's most prominent
supporter in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey Graham isn't running for president of the United
States,'' McCain said in an interview Friday night on a flight from
California to Ohio.

TAKING SIDES IN THE 6 PERCENT EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The deed, dated July 20, 1668, conveys a 15,000-acre
swath of northern New Jersey, now including the Borough of
Rutherford, from Tantaqua, a chief of the Lenni Lenape Indian
Nation, to an Englishman, William Sandford, ``for the following
consideration:
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred and seventy fathoms of black wampum, 200 fathoms
of white wampum, 19 watch coats, 17 guns, 60 double hands of
powder, 10 pair of breeches, 60 knives, 67 bars of lead, 1 anker of
brandy, 3 half vats of beer'' and various other items.
</P>
<P>
   The commission on the deal, said Peter Van Winkle, a Rutherford
real estate broker _ tongue slightly inserted in cheek _ ``was
probably 6 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been, because 6 percent has long been the
customary commission,'' said Van Winkle, who offers historical
perspective on such matters. It was in 1692 that his
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather,
Waling Jacob Van Winkle, founded the Rutherford real estate firm
that still bears the family name.
</P>
<P>
   So how far back does the traditional 6 percent brokers'
commission on residential deals go? ``Certainly as far as I know,''
said Van Winkle, ``and as far as what my father told me, and his
father before that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far back that the 6 percent figure seems etched in stone _ at
least in the minds of many, and maybe most, real estate customers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years, some brokers have been chipping away at
that set-in-stone perception _ advertising their willingness to
negotiate commissions or even to offer flat-rate fees _ despite the
fierce and often carefully reasoned resistance of their peers. One
broker in Queens said his firm takes a ``Home Depot, Priceline
approach, where you can name your own price,'' much to the chagrin
of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It is a phenomenon impelled, particularly over the last five
years, by a housing market in which listings are precious, prices
are high and homeowners can be demanding _ a classic seller's
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dreaded words in our industry are `Will you take
less?''' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Manhattan
brokerage firm that bears her name. ``The commission we charge as a
firm is 6 percent, but we're constantly questioned.'' Ten days ago
the Corcoran Group held an in-house seminar for its sales agents to
discuss strategies for ``Holding On to That 6 Percent Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Halstead, founder of Halstead Property Co., is adamant
about holding the 6 percent line. ``If you needed brain surgery,''
he asked, ``would you negotiate a lower price with your surgeon?
You would probably decide you need the best expertise and be
willing to pay.'' Lower commissions, he insisted, mean diminished
interest by potential co-brokers from other firms, leading to
decreased exposure to the market and, consequently, less than top
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, brokers' commissions have been entirely negotiable
since 1950 when, in a case called United States vs. National
Association of Real Estate Boards (predecessor to the current
National Association of Realtors), the Supreme Court ruled that
fixed commission schedules constituted restraint of trade under the
Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers can never discuss the commission among themselves,''
said Barbara Frechter, president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills
and past president of the Long Island Board of Realtors. ``I can
only discuss it with my sales agents, not with another brokerage''
_ which might end up splitting the commission, assuming one firm
takes the listing from the seller and the other finds the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people teach sales classes,'' said Frechter, ``they say,
`X commission,' without the number, because it's such a stringent
law. And in the '80s, when you joined the real estate board, they
showed you a movie and the jail door slams shut to teach you that
you are never to discuss the commission with another broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that 1950 Supreme Court ruling, and subsequent legal
opinions that bolstered the high court's original finding, there
have been varying attempts at discounting commissions _ both by
brokers and sellers; most legal, some questionable; some
profitable, others not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days,'' Frechter said, ``a seller might tell you:
`This is what I want for the house; anything you get above that is
yours.' It's called a net commission. But, by law, you can't take a
listing that way. You have to tell the person what the commission
is up front.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Eileen Scott is a sales agent for Van Winkle. But in
the late '80s, Scott said, ``my husband and I opened a Help-U-Sell
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fixed-rate commission: $3,450 for a house priced up
to $150,000,'' she said. ``After that it switched to $4,450. That
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   For that set fee, Scott would help her clients sell their homes.
``They would do their own advertising, and also the showings,'' she
said. ``We would put a sign up: `For Sale By Owners, Assisted by
Help-U-Sell.'''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't survive, because of the expenses of running an
office and charging such low commissions,'' Scott said. And the
timing for the Help-U-Sell franchise company was unfortunate _ a
depressed housing market. ``The promises were that we would capture
at least 10 percent of the market, whereas, after the first year,
it was more like 4 percent,'' Scott said. ``By the third year,
after we lost all of our money, we closed the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Help-U-Sell, which had about 100 franchises, was
bought by American Pacific Financial Corp., and now it has 158
franchises nationwide _ seven in the New York area. ``It was ahead
of its time in the '80s,'' said Rick O'Neil, Help-U-Sell's
president.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Scott and Van Winkle hold a decided preference for
the standard fee. ``Most of our residential commissions are 6
percent, but on occasion we do deviate,'' Van Winkle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter and I agree that if you need to take 5 percent, you take
5 percent,'' Scott said. ``But in the long run, when you consider
the expenses, we'd rather get our 6 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, on the other hand, newspaper advertisements placed
by Fleet Street Properties Co. in Rego Park, Queens, have asked,
``Why Pay More Than 4?''
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the question seemed unassailable to Nicholas
Cerrito Jr. Cerrito, 40, an air freight dispatcher, has lived with
his wife, Marie, and two children in Babylon, on Suffolk County's
South Shore, for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I bought a rental property in North Babylon in 1992,''
Cerrito said. Last year the Cerritos put that rental home on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend told me about Fleet Street, that they only charge 4
percent,'' Cerrito said. ``I had it on the market for $137,000; 30
days later, I closed for $135,000.'' Cerrito was pleased with the 4
percent, rather than 6 percent, commission. The difference, in cash
to him, was $2,700.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Thomas Henry is president of Fleet Street Properties. ``We've
been in business here for 54 years,'' Henry said. ``For the past
five years, we're doing this special deal: 4 percent. We put it on
the multiple listing service under LIBOR'' _ the Long Island Board
of Realtors, which lists 1,550 brokerage firms _ ``and we split
50-50 with the selling broker.''
</P>
<P>
   For sellers who would like to negotiate with buyers themselves,
Henry said, ``We have a program where we will list a property with
the MLS'' _ for a flat fee of $199.95 _ ``and they can name the
commission they wish to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said he recommends that the seller choose a 3 percent
commission, ``because this is what the selling broker would get on
a 6 percent split, and we still have the right to get the 3
percent, if we sell it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his company's ``Home Depot, Priceline approach,'' he said,
``We're doing a good business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, five years ago,'' he said, ``they threatened us with
lawsuits, the other brokers. We got calls saying, `You're killing
the business. We're not going to sell your listing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not killing anything,'' Henry insisted. ``Now they've
capitulated and they can't get enough of our listings. They seem to
accept that splitting 4 percent is better than splitting nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even splitting 3 percent _ on a property selling for $1 million
or more _ can be profitable, said John P. Noonan, past president of
the Brooklyn Board of Realtors and president of the Park Slope
brokerage firm that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had this huge increase in real estate values and there's
certainly a lot of room to negotiate and still get a handsome
commission,'' Noonan said, citing several factors bearing on his
decision to accept a commission lower than 6 percent. His primary
consideration would be if the homeowner gave Noonan's company the
exclusive right to sell the home, without the participation of a
broker representing the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling is that if a seller gives an exclusive to
a broker, it's certainly worthy of a reduced commission payment,''
he said. ``You're not competing with other brokers and it's a more
comfortable way of working.'' The listing broker, in that instance,
would keep the entire commission.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being granted an exclusive, Noonan said he would
consider a reduced commission if he had several ``good prospects''
lined up to buy the property promptly, and if the house was
appropriately priced in the current market. ``And certainly if I'm
involved in a bidding war between clients from different brokers, I
would cut a commission to make the deal work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would negotiate commissions on a home priced for
less than $1 million, Henry said: ``We don't see $100,000 houses
any more; if we see anything below $300,000, it's a rarity. So any
of these could be negotiable, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous wrinkles exist in the seller-broker relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, there are two opportunities during the marketing
process for a seller to seek a reduced commission: at the time the
listing agreement is being written, and again when a deal with a
buyer is about to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   At listing time, the broker's resistance to a reduction may be
stiffer, probably prompting the argument that a lower commission
will dampen the interest of all the other brokers who belong to the
multiple listing service.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, at the time the deal is about to be struck, the
broker says to the seller something like, ``Your asking price was
$250,000, we have an offer for $225,000,'' the seller could say,
``Cut your commission a bit and we have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens occasionally,'' said Michael Finder, a real estate
lawyer in Manhattan. ``A seller might try to persuade a broker to
reduce the commission to conclude the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A seller has no obligation to accept anything less than the
listed price. Yet, as Finder pointed out, ``once the broker does
produce a purchaser willing and able to pay that asking price, the
seller runs the risk of litigation with the broker if the seller
refuses to proceed with the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some listing agreements tie the commission fee to a specific
asking price, but most commissions are tied to a certain percentage
of the final purchase price. ``Almost always,'' said John Hall,
former chairman of the real property section of the New York State
Bar Association, ``the commission is computed as a percentage of
the selling price, rather than a percentage of the listing price.''
And in some cases, a flat commission amount is agreed upon,
regardless of the selling price, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a theory on all this bargaining,'' said Corcoran of the
Corcoran Group: ``that sellers believe that apartments today sell
themselves _ and they're right.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the torrid market of today, Corcoran said, ``where
brokers truly earn their money is in 10 times the number of
showings and navigating the bidding wars through the feeding
frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Greater Harlem Real Estate
Board, and of the brokerage firm that bears his name, points out
that commissions may also rise. ``It can be indicative of a
property that is unusually difficult to unload,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, rooming houses are difficult to sell, because
financing is not readily available for that type of building,''
Punter said, ``although they are getting scooped up for family use
in my community.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case like that, a broker might ask for 7 percent, Punter
said, ``vs. a building on a very desirable block, say a brownstone
on Striver's Row or Hamilton Terrace. A broker there may be willing
to take 5 percent because it tends to move quickly, because of
demand in that marquee location.''
</P>
<P>
   Halstead, however, believes that bargaining is bad business _
for both the broker and the seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two tools a seller needs to be certain he's getting
the best price,'' Halstead said. ``One is a battle-hardened,
energetic broker with a full quiver of marketing arrows. The other
is a full competitive commission, because what the seller wants is
all the brokers in town motivated to show his property.''
</P>
<P>
   His company, Halstead said, has 250 agents. Once the listing is
shared with members of the Real Estate Board of New York, he said:
``That brings several thousand agents and their customers in. And
the point is that what the seller wants is as many interested
parties as soon as possible in order to ensure the best price.''
</P>
<P>
   Halstead did the math to illustrate how reduced commissions
squeeze brokers.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a Manhattan apartment sells for $1 million, the
standard commission would be $60,000 with, most likely, a 50-50
split between the listing brokerage firm and the firm that found
the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, for the listing firm,'' Halstead said, ``of the
$30,000 received by them, 50 percent goes to the sales agent,
leaving $15,000 to address marketing expenses and overhead. For a
$1 million property, marketing expenses could easily be, say,
$5,000 to $7,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses would include, in Halstead's evaluation, ``the
most expensive agate advertising in the world _ that's classified
advertising _ offered by The New York Times at $18 a line,'' before
quantity discounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``We have to take photographs, put the
property on our Web sites; do a brochure or a fancy oversized
postcard. We have to hold open houses, if the board allows. And we
do mailings to people in the building and in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For a multimillion-dollar property, display advertising might be
required in glossy publications like Quest or Avenue, or in The
Times' Sunday magazine, he said, ``and we're talking there, now,
rates of $8,000 for a quarter page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the economic realities of operating a real estate
brokerage,'' Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Just such realities prompted an audacious experiment two years
ago by Long &AMP; Foster, the largest brokerage firm in Washington _ a
standardized commission of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you the Washington plea,'' said Wes Foster Jr.,
the company's president. ``In the last 15 years, the amount of
money the company has left after we've paid our sales agent _ what
we call the company dollar; it's what we use to pay our overhead
and hopefully have something left over _ has dropped from around 45
cents of the whole dollar to 29 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national problem,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``A total, ugly failure,'' Foster said. ``We wish we'd never
done it. It cost us market share, and we backed away quickly, in a
couple or three months. But it stuck with some of the public and
made them angry with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Long &AMP; Foster has since expanded into titles, mortgages and
insurance, ``so that we can give the customer a one-stop shop,''
Foster said, ``and us a chance to make a little more profit.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, the struggle is on to maintain the 6
percent commission, ``which we really need to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're doing OK because it's a good market,'' Foster
said. ``But I can tell you this: when another slow market comes,
you're going to see real estate companies going out of business
left and right, because the margin is too slim. It's tough.''

HEBERT LOOKS TO EARN BACK RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- After nearly seven years of smooth driving, Guy
Hebert has been in the pits the last week or so trying to get tuned
up for the Western Conference playoff drive.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who prides himself on playing his best in big games, is
expected to play tonight against Edmonton, but that only after
hours of work with Mighty Ducks goalie consultant Francois Allaire
and some serious self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a swift kick in the pants and to gain the respect of my
teammates and coaches back,'' said Hebert, who is 1-2-1 and has
allowed 19 goals in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Hebert sitting on the bench while Dominic Roussel played
against St. Louis and Calgary was a strange sight considering
Hebert's reputation being an iron man of sorts in the final halves
of seasons. He played 69 games last year as he helped lead the
Ducks into the playoffs. Hebert also led a late-season charge into
the 1996-97 playoffs and nearly got the Ducks into the postseason
in '95-96.
</P>
<P>
   Allaire, a studious looking French-Canadian who happens to be
one of hockey's most repected goaltending instructors, has been
acting as a crew chief of sorts for Hebert, who hasn't started
since Feb. 18 when he allowed three third-period goals in a 4-4 tie
versus San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL is like Formula One (racing), the car has to be
perfectly tuned up, so you can put your foot on the gas and go,''
said Allaire. ``When you have two wheels on the side of the road,
you are no faster than a Volkswagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally a slow starter, the 33-year old goalie got off to an
excellent start this season. He was among the league leaders in
save percentage, goals against average, wins and shutouts through
mid-December. But since suffering a strained neck in a 8-2 loss to
Phoenix on Dec. 22, Hebert's performance has been wildly
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg to step up his play
heading into a crucial five-game road trip, Hebert responded by
stopping 158 of 169 shots as the Ducks went 3-0-2. He was
especially brilliant in ties at Buffalo and Philadelphia, kicking
out 94 of 99 shots.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebert, generously listed as 5-foot-11, 186 pounds, was run
over in the last three games of Anaheim's trip. Keith Primeau, the
Flyers' 6-4, 210-pound crashed into him in Philadelphia. The Kings'
Jason Blake got away with a flagrant elbow to Hebert's head in
Anaheim's victory at Staples Center on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hebert has stopped only 83 of 102 shots. He admits
his neck isn't 100 percent, but refuses to blame his woes on his
physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm healthy enough to stay in there, then there are no
problems,'' insists Hebert. ``I've had enough excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows excuses mean little at this time of year anyway --
``there's nowhere to hide,'' he said. ``But every night there's a
chance to be a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years Hebert has been a hero more often than not, since
being acquired by the Ducks in the 1993 expansion draft. After
playing only 37 games for the Blues, Hebert has carved a memorable
career in Anaheim, where he owns virtually all of the team's
goaltending records, including games (381), wins (152) and shutouts
(24). Last season he set career highs in wins (31), shutouts (6),
goals against average (2.42) and save percentage (.922).
</P>
<P>
   An easy-going sort as goalies come -- ``for me to play my best I
have to be happy, on an even keel,'' -- Hebert has been frustrated
as of late. He is still msytified at how Vincent Damphousse's sharp
angle shot bounced off his glove in the San Jose and readily admits
``I've haven't been at the top of my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, along with Roussel, have also been the victim of Anaheim
defensive zone breakdowns as the Ducks have given an average of 4.4
goals a game in their last seven contests.
</P>
<P>
   But the only player to be with the Ducks since the franchise
began play in 1993, isn't ready to point fingers at anybody but
himself, especially since he has seen his save percentage drop from
over .920 to .907.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (his time between starts) gives me a chance to look in the
mirror and I realize I haven't done enough to help the team win,''
he said. ``I have to get back on the top of my game.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of doing that Hebert said he tried to pick up his
practice intensity instead of relying on the rhythm he might build
between good performances. And nobody helps him pick up that
intensity like Allaire. The goalie gruru also studies tapes of
recent games to pick out any flaws or trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, he works you very hard,'' said Hebert. ``If there
is something major he can pick it out right away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have great intensity of practice to be able to
play a solid 60 minutes without mental or physical lapses,'' said
Allaire. ``If the body is strong, the mental is part is strong too.
</P>
<P>
   For player who has become such a fan favorite at The Pond -- the
chant Guy, Guy, Guy has become a mantra of sorts -- Hebert plays a
very unspectacular style when he is going good. Flashy glove saves
or two-pad slides aren't his trademark, and that's fine by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in control, the less I'm noticed the better,''
said Hebert, who knows full well that the less his play is a topic
of conversation the better the Ducks' playoff chances.

 &HT;    How we rank them
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Schultz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. New Jersey. The Devils lost only five of their first 32 home
games. No need to ask how important home ice is in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto. Darcy Tucker has given the Maple Leafs some
toughness. A physical defenseman would be the missing piece to a
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia. The Flyers aren't overwhelming anybody, but
what do you expect when they can dress in All-Star team in the
trainer's room, with Eric Lindros and Keith Primeau?
</P>
<P>
   4. Florida. Goalie Trevor Kidd is back; unfortunately, the same
defense is in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   5. Washington. Just in case the Panthers thought the Capitals
would fold, Chris Simon sent a message by scoring the overtime
winner the other night.
</P>
<P>
   6. Ottawa. Senators owner Rod Bryden says the team isn't moving.
He didn't say how long that guarantee is good for.
</P>
<P>
   7. Buffalo. Whatshisname's return in goal has the Sabres
climbing back into a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   8. Pittsburgh. Jaromir Jagr's hamstring pull might pull the plug
on the Penguins' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis. The Blues are so good, even enigmatic forward
Stephane Richer looks as if he cares again.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dallas. Goalie Ed Belfour has kept the Stars near the top
despite injuries.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detroit. There might be nothing to the Chris Osgood trade
rumors, but the Red Wings' goalie and the defense in front of him
are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix. The Coyotes have held together despite missing their
best player, Keith Tkachuk, but they need to add a physical
defenseman before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Colorado. The Avs still might have the best talent in the
West, but injuries and seeming lack of control by coach Bob Hartley
is starting to wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   6. Edmonton. Kevin Lowe has the young team higher in the
standings than anyone expected. If the goaltending holds up, look
out.
</P>
<P>
   7. Los Angeles. After a brief slumber, the Kings' offense is
rolling again -- seven goals on 48 shots against Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   8. San Jose. Goalie Steve Shields is starting to make the Sharks
regret they traded Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   NO SURPRISES
</P>
<P>
   Florida has been atop the Southeast Division all season but it's
not because of any miraculous comebacks. The Panthers are one of
only two teams that hasn't won a game after trailing after two
periods. Following are the teams who have the best and worst
records after losing the first 40 minutes:
</P>
<P>
   Best W-L-T Worst W-L-T
</P>
<P>
   1. Dallas 7-15-2 28. San Jose 0-19-2
</P>
<P>
   2. New Jersey 4-10-2 27. Florida 0-14-1
</P>
<P>
   3. Ottawa 5-16-2 26. N.Y. Islanders 1-30-2
</P>
<P>
   4. St. Louis 4-13-3 25. Chicago 1-23-1
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix 3-12-2 24 Buffalo 1-21-1
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Canadiens goalie Jeff Hackett went 7-1-1 (including a shutout of
Phoenix) in a span of nine starts _ and illogically, is central to
several trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes, who flopped in Vancouver, is
3-1-1 with a 1.77 goals-against in his last five starts, including
wins over neighboring Devils and Rangers and a tie with the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   So much for slowing down: Kings winger Luc Robitaille had 10
goals and 19 points in a span of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs were hoping they could rejuvenate Wendel Clark.
Wrong. After recording only four points in 16 games, he might be
released soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers goalie Mike Richter has missed five games with a knee
injury since the All-Star break, which is linked to the team's dip
in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Joe Sakic has one goal in his last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's 3-2 overtime win over New Jersey kept the Canadiens
as one of the league's hottest teams _ 13-2-2, including a
seven-game win streak. Montreal surprisingly has resuscitated its
playoff hopes, despite limited offensive talent, while the Devils
began to show cracks atop the Eastern Conference (0-3-1).
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches put the opponent's lineup on the board and circle guys
and say, `You've got to be hard on this guy, finish your check on
this guy, make it difficult for this guy.' Players read into that
to go out and get guys and be physical against them. It starts with
the coaches. Borderline players are going to listen to that because
they don't want to work anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dallas center Mike Modano on dirty play in the NHL
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull became so frustrated the other night with Dallas'
sagging power play that he ripped into his own coaching staff. ``It
doesn't help when you've got power- play units that you practice
with and then you go out in the game and the coach puts different
people with you,'' Hull said. ``You don't know what side you're
working. You don't know who's going where on the breakout. There's
a lot more to blame than the players for the power play.'' Coach
Ken Hitchcock had a meeting with Hull but later attempted to defuse
the comments, saying, ``It's no big deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Sergei Fedorov missed four games while trying to find
a brace for his right thumb, which has ligament damage. Fedorov,
who has missed 12 games with injuries this season, might need
surgery in the off-season. He has only 17 goals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Center Bobby Holik wasn't concerned when New Jersey went winless
four games in a row. ``That's just part of the season,'' Holik
said. ``We can lose them now. As long as we don't lose them when
the playoffs start.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is that Pittsburgh coach Herb Brooks hates the job so much
he might not make it through the end of the season. If the
``Miracle Man'' leaves, associate coach Ivan Hlinka would be the
Penguins' third boss this season, following the fired Kevin
Constantine. Brooks wants to go back to scouting and his home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that San Jose opened a nine-game homestand. The
bad news is that the Sharks opened it with a loss to St. Louis and
fell to 3-9 in their last 12 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi on Blues defenseman Chris
Pronger: ``He's the equivalent of a Dominik Hasek for defensemen
right now. He can completely control a game in all phases.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida planned to auction off a dinner for six with Pavel Bure
for $6,500 at a charity function. Then Bure's South Florida
neighbor and ``friend'' Anna Kournikova said she also would attend
the dinner. Dinner with Pavel and Anna _ or Anna and Pavel _ sold
for $12,500.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on Jaromir Jagr's return from a hamstring pull range
from 10 days to a month. The Penguins are 1-5-1 this year without
Jagr, 13-17-19 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Constantine, who clashed with some of Pittsburgh's stars
and was fired as Pittsburgh's coach earlier this season, is dealing
with a more flexible bunch these days. Constantine is helping coach
a youth team and plans to run a coaching clinic and youth camp this
summer. ``I know I'm supposed to take this time and not be in
hockey rinks,'' he said. ``But I've got a small addiction.''
Regarding criticism that has been leveled at him from players since
his departure, Constantine said, ``There's no value in (responding
to) any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic got fed up last week with the Avalanche's lackluster
play: ``I mean, you can talk as much as you want in the locker room
and everybody's prepared, everybody's ready. And then we get out
there and we don't do it. It's very frustrating. Everybody says,
`Well, we have to learn from this.' But school's over. Hey, let's
get going.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   One reason Vancouver's Donald Brashear has said little about
Marty McSorley's mugging is that he might file a civil suit. Yes,
there is precedent. In 1975, Detroit's Henry Boucha sued Boston's
Dave Forbes after he was hit in the face with the butt-end of
Forbes' stick and suffered a fractured cheekbone. Criminal charges
were filed, but the case ended in a hung jury. Boucha filed a $3.5
million civil suit, and the matter was settled out of court five
years later. In a similar case, Detroit's Dennis Polonich
successfully sued Kansas City's Wilf Paiement in 1978 and won
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent defenseman Mark Tinordi is close to finishing his
rehabilitation from ankle surgery in October and could be close to
signing. At least three teams have interest -- Colorado, St. Louis
and Detroit. Tinordi has missed 96 games in the last three years
with injuries, but the Thrashers selected him from Washington in
the expansion draft. Atlanta wanted no other players on the
Capitals' unprotected list, and the team will receive a
compensatory pick in the June draft when Tinordi signs with another
team.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the 2000 presidential campaign began, the
Republican and Democratic primaries that will be held in Washington
state on Tuesday were hardly more than blips on the political
horizon, arcane little contests lying somewhere out on the trail
between the first-in-the nation Iowa caucuses and the
could-end-it-all mass of 13 primaries scheduled for Titanic
Tuesday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But because the early months of the campaign have been so
unexpectedly topsy-turvy, the Washington primaries, with their
quirky rules and oft-quirky voters, suddenly loom large, and the
candidates have been forced to change plans and divert scarce
resources and time to compete. The Democrats were in the state
Saturday and they will be joined by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on
Sunday. Sen. John McCain of Ari- zona plans to arrive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is opportunity, and danger, for all candidates in these
contests, but especially for McCain, still trying to forge ahead of
Bush on the Republican side, and for former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, still badly trailing Vice President Al Gore on the
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no party registration and voters may choose on
primary day to vote in either contest. Both McCain and Bradley have
been going after party switchers and independent voters, McCain
particularly, while their opponents have been concentrating mainly
on the hard-core base within their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Given that an unusually large number of Washington voters, 50
percent or more, claim to be independents (many maintain that
ideology is a private matter), there has often been a lot of voting
flux in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a very tricky state when it comes to politics and
voting,'' said David Brine, the communications director for the
office of the secretary of state, which regulates state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is fixed in stone here,'' Brine said. ``There's a long
tradition of switching around in parties and on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are chasing after independents and party
switchers so hard that they find themselves in competition for some
of the same votes, particularly when they are talking up one of
their favorite issues, government reform. In fact, Bradley has
concluded that Washington not only offers him a big chance to go
after independent voters but also offers what may be his last
chance, with the help of independent votes, to post a victory over
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Such a victory would come in a race that under party rules is
essentially a beauty contest, with no convention delegations to be
won. But Bradley nevertheless is committing huge amounts of time
and money to what amounts to a bet-it-all gamble _ win a contest,
any contest, anywhere, of whatever nature.
</P>
<P>
   The actual choosing of the state's allotment of 75 delegates to
the Democratic National Convention will take place in a March 7
round of caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, comfortably ahead in most recent Washington polls, has
been forced to match the Bradley effort to protect his flank,
something he had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were both in Seattle Saturday to address a
meeting of the state NAACP. While Gore was to attend a state Dem-
ocratic Party chili dinner, Brad- ley held a chili dinner with
support- ers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also committing significant resources to the contest
here and, much to Bradley's frustration, seems to be dominating the
chase after independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Gore, is responding in kind with money and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest is part beauty contest, part real primary
and, like the Democratic contest, will be followed by a round of
caucuses on March 7. Twelve of the party's allotment of 37
delegates to the Republican National Convention will be chosen on
Tuesday, the rest on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the Bush-McCain competition too close to call,
just as it was too close to call on the eve of voting in several
earlier contests.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, coming off his surprise victory on Tuesday in
Michigan, a Washington victory would add to the momentum he has
been building as he seeks to overcome Bush's huge earlier lead over
most of the country. This would be especially true if he were to
win both the beauty contest and the 12-delegates contest, though he
and Bush very well might end up splitting those contests because of
the complex rules that govern them.
</P>
<P>
   But if a McCain victory here is to have truly significant
meaning, the senator must not only beat Bush but demonstrate in
beating him that he can pull large numbers of conservative
Republican votes _ the ultimate key to the party's nomination _ not
just the votes of Republican moderates, dissident Democrats and
independents, his victory mix so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been very successful in doing that in other states,
no matter how hard he has tried. But now that he has retooled his
pitch _ ``I am a Reagan Republican,'' became his mantra after
Michigan _ he may have a better shot at it, particularly here in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Republicans tend to be more moderate than Republicans
in many other states, though there are plenty of conservatives
here. Certainly Washington Republicans are likely to be more
receptive to the new McCain pitch than Republicans in Virginia, a
conservative bastion and Bush stronghold that also will hold a
primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a McCain kind of state,'' said Kris Wilder, the
director of the McCain effort here. ``More than in most states, the
Washington state voter has a mind of his own, of her own, just like
John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, needs to regain momentum in Tuesday's
voting. He badly needs a success here to twin with a presumed
victory in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a tough one but we feel good about the
outcome,'' said Mike McKay, a chairman of the Bush effort here.
``We feel we have the support and we're confident we have the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are filling the airwaves with a round of
last-minute television and radio advertisements, mailing out
thousands and thousands of campaign fliers and inundating voters
with telephone calls. The senator flew here for a day of
campaigning just hours after his Michigan triumph and will return
for another visit just a few hours before the polls open.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the Democratic contest here could be his last
hurrah, because a loss in Washington would lengthen Gore's string
of victories over him to four in a row. So unlike the other
candidates, who are dipping in and out of the state so that they
can also work the other states in the March 7 primaries, Bradley is
remaining here almost the entire week leading up to Tuesday's vote.
His main pitch: Gore is a conservative whereas he is the true
liberal and Democrat.

   ``If we win this primary or have a very strong showing,'' Mo
Elleithee, Bradley's spokesman, said the other day, ``it will be a
signal to the rest of the country that Bill Bradley is viable and
this thing is not wrapped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, confident momentum on his side, plans to visit the state
briefly over the weekend but otherwise is leaving his campaign
effort here up to surrogates, many of them top labor leaders and
members of the state's Democratic establishment, like Paul Berendt,
the Democratic state chairman. They have kept up a drumbeat of
charges that Bradley is engaging in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking the low road,'' Berendt said, ``and what he's
going to find is that Washington voters are going to punish him for
it.''

IN CALIFORNIA, HOUSING ON A PLATFORM, STORES DOWNSTAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDONDO BEACH, Calif. _ Developers in this oceanfront city 15
miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles are building a condominium
community with stores at street level and 98 detached homes atop a
second-level concrete platform.
</P>
<P>
   Known as 1800 PCH _ the address is the project's street address
on Pacific Coast Highway _ the project demonstrates the growing
ingenuity of home builders in carving out space for housing at a
time when housing sites for infill development are growing scarce
along the Southern California coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fairly innovative to build a residential structure on a
deck,'' said Aaron Jones, the economic development manager of this
city of 66,000 residents. He called the project ``the first genuine
mixed-use development in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-story detached homes in 1800 PCH will range in size from
1,407 square feet with three bedrooms and two and a half baths, to
1,835 square feet with four bedrooms and two and half baths.
</P>
<P>
   The project is taking shape on a steeply sloping site. At the
bottom of the slope is the Pacific Coast Highway, a busy
thoroughfare lined with low-rise residences and retail strips on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The front entrance of 1800 PCH is a row of stores with a total
of 20,000 square feet of space that front the highway. Behind the
stores, and out of view, is parking for both store customers and
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The garage is covered by the platform, which also serves as the
foundation for the housing on the second level. The housing is on
the same level as the top of the slope, where an existing
neighborhood of apartment buildings borders the project.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the design was to create the feeling of a
pedestrian-oriented neighborhood, according to the developers, a
partnership of Braemar Urban Ventures, of Agoura Hills, Calif., and
Shawbeth Inc. of Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Houses are arranged along pedestrian walkways about 20 feet
wide, or in courtyards around gardens. At the center of the site,
there is a 40-by-55-foot formal rose garden. The garden serves as a
sort of ``village square,'' said Robert T. Steinberg, president of
Steinberg Group of San Jose, Calif., the project architect.
</P>
<P>
   For the landscaping, the biggest challenge was to find a way to
introduce plants and grass onto the concrete platform. The solution
was a species of grass that can grow in a few inches of soil, which
lies in shallow trenches in the concrete floor. Boxed ``orangerie''
trees complete the landscape scheme.
</P>
<P>
   One buyer, Alexis Sheehy, said she was impressed by the car-free
character of the project, which reminded her of pedestrian-only
streets in the neighboring cities of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Sheehy, who is a high-school principal, said that
she and her husband were also attracted to a low-maintenance home
after years of gardening. ``We are empty-nesters, and we're just
looking to reduce the effort and the maintenance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The project represents the confluence of several trends in
California home building.
</P>
<P>
   One is to build detached homes that resemble single-family
housing in increasing densities. This practice accommodates rising
land costs, the shrinking amount of available land for development,
and the continued market preference of buyers who want to own
detached homes in an era of rapidly rising housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   A more conventional approach to developing the project would
have been attached town houses on a single level, according to Avi
Brosh, president of Braemar Urban Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   By building homes without garages, Brosh said, he could almost
double the density. He also found he could have a greater profit
margin by selling detached houses with windows on four sides rather
than attached town houses, which typically have windows on only one
or two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the detached home ``opened the project up to a
larger spectrum of buyers, such as families looking for three and
four bedrooms,'' Brosh said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from about $349,000 to $436,000. The median price
for both detached houses and town houses in Redondo Beach as a
whole is $378,299, according to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The project's design represents a new concept in increasing the
density of detached housing, according to Steinberg, the architect.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to one popular approach, which consists of
clustering houses around a courtyard or a shared driveway, ``we
have tried to take this idea to another level, by developing a
sense of neighborhood and community, and by providing a mix of uses
on the site, including retail and restaurants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In design, the narrow, two-story houses resemble town houses
rather than the ranch-style houses found elsewhere in the city.
Lots range from 21 to 25 feet wide and from 35 to 40 feet deep and
include a small, fenced-in front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never kidded ourselves into thinking that these homes were
single-family homes in a traditional setting,'' said Brosh, the
developer. ``We had to play a little balancing act'' between
accommodating a high density of units, on the one hand, and
satisfying expectations of privacy and comfort on the part of home
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg called the two-story units ``saltboxes,'' noting their
simple, square shapes and pitched roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1800 PCH project reflects the city's intention of
encouraging mixed-use projects that combine housing and commercial
space near important commercial areas. Although common in many East
Coast cities, mixed-use development remains an avant-garde idea in
suburban California.
</P>
<P>
   The city, in fact, developed its new mixed-use ordinance at the
same time it evaluated earlier proposals for what became 1800 PCH.
Among the requests made by the city were setbacks to clearly
separate commercial and residential portions of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Redondo Beach ordinance encourages mixed-use projects, in an
effort to support commercial parts of the city. The 1800 PCH
project is about a quarter of a mile east of a commercial area
known as the Hollywood Riviera, which includes upscale stores and
small office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   For Brosh, the developer, 1800 PCH is a ``uniquely Californian''
variant of residential mixed use. He thinks many Californians would
be resistant to the conventional approach to mixed-use housing,
with stores on the ground floor and housing above on an urban
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixed-use is a new concept for California,'' he said. One
challenge is to accustom middle-class Californians to live in
medium- to high-density housing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brosh added, a denser project would be ``difficult to
do in California today, because it is not a mainstream kind of
product.''

 &HT;    Ga. Tech club team top-ranked
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ As miracles on ice go, it isn't exactly Lake Placid,
1980. It's Hockey Night in Alpharetta, however, and that in itself
is a small miracle. Or as Al Michaels might've said, ``Do you
believe in electrical-engineering majors on the power play? Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Georgia Tech hockey is all about rags to riches,''
said Monal Dhabliwala, a sixth-year senior defenseman. ``We went
from 12:45 a.m. practices _ Tuesday mornings _ to Saturday night 8
o'clock games.''
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a Friday night in The Cooler in Alpharetta and the
last home game of a season to savor, a game that began with
Dhabliwala street clothes and sitting in the stands, the logical
place for a guy with a torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I made an agreement with Coach,'' Dhabliwala said. ``If it
was a one-goal game, I'd come in.''
</P>
<P>
   So with Vanderbilt leading 1-0 after two periods, Dhabliwala
suited up and skated out for the third period. ``I probably
shouldn't have, but I did,'' he said. ``My last game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Dawe's, too. After Nick Olander's goal tied it midway
through the period, Dawe scored a minute later on a wraparound for
a 2-1 victory and tied a bow around the best season in Georgia Tech
hockey history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a way to go out!'' the sixth-year senior center cried. He
wasn't talking about Bobby Cremins' resignation earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Dawe's final goal in The Cooler improved the Jackets' record to
21-3-1, the best in the 27-year existence of the Georgia Tech Ice
Hockey Club. On Friday, Tech, ranked No. 1 nationally in Division
III of the club-level American Collegiate Hockey Association, plays
Navy in the Division III national playoffs in Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a hockey club that is precisely that: A club. Not a
varsity sport. Not a scholarship program. A club sport, a group of
25 or so guys who nearly all are engineering majors and who play
hockey for the purest of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the love of the sport,'' said Dawe, 23, an
electrical-engineering major who played high school hockey in Katy,
Texas. ``We get pretty good fan support but not a lot of
recognition from the school. We have to (budget) our personal time,
be full-time students and full-time athletes. These guys don't do
it for the ego, headlines or notoriety. It's for the love of the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a kid come to Tech to play hockey?'' asked Greg
Stathis, the volunteer head coach since 1991. ``It's a great
school. But a kid can play at a high caliber of play. And it's
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Must be. How else to explain driving out of town every Monday
night at 10 for an hour's practice at the Ice Forum, then to The
Cooler each Tuesday at 10:15 p.m. for a 90-minute workout? How else
to put up with driving in vans to road games; all games are played
on Friday and Saturday nights, to avoid missing too much
schoolwork. Or sleeping four to a motel room? Or coughing up $150
apiece each semester to help pay for ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know how to balance everything,'' said junior
forward Ryan Dawe, Aaron's younger brother and a computer-science
major. ``Your schoolwork, practices, two games on weekends _ I
probably couldn't handle a varsity sport. This club team is just
right. You have time to have other aspects of your life: A
fraternity, a girlfriend, a social life.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like real students who happen to be able to skate and
slide-rule with the best of 'em. That's part of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey team, they're really nice guys,'' said pep band
member Jill Womack, a senior who plays trumpet and sang the
national anthem a cappella before the Vanderbilt game. ``We love
the football team, but they don't know our names. The hockey team
knows our names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not on a scholarship,'' said Womack, among the pep
band members who voluntarily, eagerly, attend games, even on the
road. ``They're regular guys. They're all smart. They're all
engineers. The football team's all management majors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech hockey club was founded in 1973. In 1979, the Jackets
joined the new Southern Collegiate Hockey Association, consisting
mainly of ACC and SEC club teams, and moved to College Hockey South
in 1997. Now, Tech has a $50,000 budget, including $13,000 from the
school, thanks largely to corporate sponsorships, sales of Tech
hockey merchandise and players chipping in for ice time. This
year's team was helped by several talented freshmen who played high
school hockey and by the return of Shawn Montague. The sophomore
left wing is the best player in the CHS and Tech's leading scorer
for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Tech ended ACHA Division II Virginia Tech's 34-game winning
streak, won two of three games from N.C. State and twice beat South
Florida, last year's CHS champ. Going 2-0-1 against Georgia was,
well, icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're a club, we treat it as a varsity sport,''
Stathis said. ``Eventually, we'd like to go Division II or I. But
it's nice to see the program grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for guys like Aaron Dawe, who was born in Calgary,
Alberta, and discovered hockey there, but harbors no illusions
about his ability. ``I might have been able to play (minor-league
hockey) somewhere but not make a living,'' said Dawe, who recently
accepted a job offer from Nortel Networks. ``So I do it for the fun
of it now. Then I'll make a living.''

WITH AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK, BUSH'S COLLEAGUES OFFER UNWAVERING
SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ark., N.D., Utah)   (rk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unshaken in their view that George W. Bush will
vanquish his Republican opponent, the nation's Republican governors
rallied Saturday around Bush, a fellow governor, and said they were
confident voters would embrace the man has who won over many
Democrats, minorities and women in his own state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite Bush's stinging defeats in Michigan and Arizona,
they stressed that Bush must focus his campaign on what appealed to
people in the first place: his pitch for tax cuts and education,
and his record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, here for a meeting of the National Governors
Association, flocked to Bush's side close to a year ago, throwing a
total of 26 endorsements his way. Saturday, they seemed to be
trying to write his campaign platform for him as they defended one
of their own, arguing that it is Bush, not his challenger Sen. John
McCain, who has long connected with a broad cross section of
voters, including Democrats and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, he has brought people together in
Texas,'' said Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., at a news conference.
``Texans are hard to please. They are nit-picky. They're tough
voters to make happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one thing for George W. Bush to defeat an incumbent
sitting governor in Texas,'' he added. ``That was an incredible
accomplishment in 1994. But the real miracle is that he got nearly
70 percent of the vote in his re-election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   As the governors took turns praising Bush and pronouncing their
optimism, they also acknowledged that McCain, a man who once called
the governors ``greedy,'' has trampled on their plans, at least for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the governors agreed to endorse Bush _ with his large
war chest, familiar surname and broad appeal _ as the perfect
antidote to Republican malaise. It did not hurt that Bush, an
advocate of greater power for the states, would also help in their
own fight for greater authority. A few governors even joked about
which one of them would serve as vice president in a Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it is McCain who appears to be the man breaking the
Republican mold, the candidate who can successfully attract the
nation's middle-of-the-road voters, and it is Bush who has become
the more conventional Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some frustration out there,'' said Edward T. Schafer,
the governor of North Dakota and chairman of the Republican
Governors Association. ``No one expected the campaign to be this
close or this mercurial.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has defeated Bush in New Hampshire, Arizona and Michigan,
where the Republican governor worked hard to turn out the vote for
Bush. A cavalcade of Democrats voted for McCain in the open
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush obviously will have to right himself, and he
will,'' Michael O. Leavitt, the governor of Utah and chairman of
the National Governors Association, said Saturday. But, he added,
``The name of the game right now is 1,034 delegates, and I believe
George Bush will have them in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governors will talk privately over the course of
the next few days about strategies for helping Bush reshape his
message to reach moderates and independents in their states,
Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that it was not so much the nuts and bolts of a
campaign _ raising money, turning out the vote _ they needed to
worry about as amplifying Bush's attempt to portray himself as a
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose early pitch was one of inclusion and compassion
conservativism, has found himself blemished by his link to Pat
Robertson and an appearance he made at Bob Jones University, which
bans interracial dating and whose namesake once labeled the
Catholic Church as a ``satanic cult.'' While the move helped him
win the primary in South Carolina, where the school is located,
some Republicans have also said they are concerned it has muddied
his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as governors can paint a clear contrast to senators in
taking care of people,'' Schafer said. ``People look to the Senate
to mess up their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the vast sums of money Bush has spent so far, the
governors said they believed it would pay off in the weeks to come
in states where McCain has invested little cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an entirely new game once you start campaigning in 13
states on March 7th at the same time,'' Leavitt said.

ROCKETS ARE NO PUSHOVERS FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO _ If the Lakers maintain their current pace of
winning games, this might go down as a trivia question: What two
opponents beat them twice this season?
</P>
<P>
   Hint: They play both teams in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   That Portland, their opponent Tuesday, has beaten the Lakers
twice is hardly surprising, considering the Trail Blazers' record.
But it's understandable if no one remembers that today's opponent,
the 21-34 Houston Rockets, also took a pair from the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Houston beat them in early November, taking advantage of
Shaquille O'Neal's suspension and Kobe Bryant's broken right hand.
It was a throw-away game.
</P>
<P>
   The one that hurt was the 89-83 loss at Houston on Jan. 30.
Everyone played, everyone was healthy. It's just no one could
shoot, or stop the Rockets' little guards from penetrating for
layups, or kickouts to open shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most pathetic game we played all year, to be
honest,'' coach Phil Jackson said Saturday, after a practice
session at the new Healthsouth Training Center. ``It was a game in
which our energy was poor, our shooting was awful. ... And we just
didn't finish that game well at all, against a team I thought was
very susceptible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets guards Steve Francis, Bryce Drew and Cuttino Mobley
combined for 42 points in that game, but Bryant said the Lakers
have improved their defense since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played agaisnt them, we were going through a stretch
when we really weren't playing our best basketball anyway,'' he
said. ``As of now, we're doing a good job defensively, executing a
lot better defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Home sweet home: Some bugs have yet to be worked out, and
everyone's still unpacking, but Jackson said players are warming up
to the new training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're liking it a lot, although they see it as a big
change , and all change takes some adjustment to get used to,'' he
said. Jackson wants Healthsouth not to be viewed as a ``drudgery
place'' for work, but ``a place whee they can come and be with
their community of guys. ... It's going to be full of things that
they can do here, between going up (to the management offices) and
negotiating a new contract with Jerry West to complaining to Mitch
(Kupchak) about moving expenses to whatever else that's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Bryant was treated Saturday for a bruised left calf
after getting kicked in the fourth quarter of Friday's victory over
Boston. He's not expected to miss any playing time.
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. ROCKETS
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff: 2:30 p.m., Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KNBC-Channel 4; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (44-11) update: They've won 10 straight to go with their
previous 16-game winning streak, marking the fourth time in
franchise history that a team has had two double-digit streaks in
the same seas on. The feat was also accomplished by the 1986-87
team (11 games, 12 gam es) and the 1987-88 team (16 games, 11
games), each of which went on to win the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets (21-34) update: They've lost seven of their last nine
games and four in a row. The Rockets are 2-0 at Staples Center (one
win each against the Lakers and Clippers). They're a horrid 2-14 in
NBC-televised games over the last two seasons, but both wins came
against the Lakers.

HALF ISN'T ENOUGH FOR MINUTEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Years from now, University of Massachusetts
players will tell their grandchildren about the time they did what
few folks in college basketball thought they could do. They went
into Temple's Liacouras Center and for 20 minutes left the nation's
hottest team, its coach, and a partisan crowd virtually stunned.
</P>
<P>
   They'll talk about the zone defense that fooled a coach whose
staple is zone defense. How they held Temple to 31 percent shooting
in the first half. How they took a 3-point lead into the locker
room against a team that beat the Minutemen by 27 in Amherst
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Then their grandchildren will ask what happened in the second
half, and each man will quickly, and sadly, change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Just when UMass appeared on its way to the biggest win in
Bruiser Flint's four-year tenure, Temple doused its hopes with
several big plays midway through the second half. The Owls led by
as many as 19 before claiming a 72-54 Atlantic 10 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 13th consecutive victory for conference-leading
Temple (22-4, 13-1), which has beaten all three of its top A-10
competitors (Dayton, St. Bonaventure, and UMass) in its last four
games, as well as previously top-ranked Cincinnati. The win
clinched the A-10 East Division crown for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Wadley led Temple with 21 points, but it was reserve
guard Lynn Greer (17 points) who carried the Owls to victory.
</P>
<P>
   With 17:51 left, he replaced the team's leading scorer, Mark
Karcher, who ended the first half 0 for 6. Temple scored on five
consecutive possessions with Greer in the lineup. With the score
tied at 30, Greer scored 5 unanswered points, including a 3-pointer
with 15:47 left to put Temple up, 35-30.
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit a runner in the paint with 11:26 left to give Temple a
44-34 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating at times,'' said UMass forward Mike Babul,
``because we kept making them work and we were taking 25-30 seconds
off their shot clock. Then at the end, we would either foul or they
would hit a big shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That spelled curtains for the Minutemen (15-12, 9-5), who led by
as many as 7 in the first half thanks to a 2-3 zone that held
Temple starters Karcher, Pepe Sanchez, Kevin Lyde, and Lamont
Barnes to 1-for-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew once we got a convincing lead, after we hit a couple of
threes in a row, that they would have to come out of the zone and
start chasing us, and that's what happened,'' said Temple coach
John Chaney. He applauded Flint on the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly any solace for Flint, whose volatile complaints
to officials earned him a technical foul _ his first of the season
_ with 11:09 to go. Wadley sank two free throws, and on the ensuing
possession, he got fouled and sank two more, giving Temple a 48-32
lead with 10:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Flint had long abandoned the zone strategy. Temple,
which had as many offensive rebounds as UMass had total rebounds
(20) in their Feb. 1 meeting, began dominating inside. Consecutive
putbacks by Lyde and Barnes gave the Owls a 61-42 lead with 4:18 to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up with a few big rebounds and we missed a lot of
free throws,'' said Flint. ``That's crucial, especially when you're
trying to keep (the deficit) to within 4 or 5 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mack led the Minutemen with 20 points, hitting 5 of 12
from 3-point range. Shannon Crooks and Chris Kirkland contributed
10 points each.
</P>
<P>
   UMass, in a second-place tie with St. Bonaventure in the A-10
East, hosts George Washington Tuesday and visits the Bonnies
Saturday.

EAGLES AT A LOSS WITHOUT BELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ No exit polls were needed after this one.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Boston College's 45-40 loss Saturday to
Providence College before a Civic Center crowd of 8,938 proved just
how strong a candidate BC freshman guard Troy Bell is for Big East
rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It demonstrated how important Bell, sidelined for the remainder
of the season with a lateral meniscus tear in his left knee, has
become to the fortunes of BC's beleaguered basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an indication, good or bad, how much we rely on
him and his ability,'' said BC coach Al Skinner, after his team
clinched the No. 13 seed in the Big East tournament after dropping
to 10-18 overall and 2-13 in conference play. ``You take him out of
the lineup and we score 40 points. I mean, it's a clear indication
of how important he is and it's clear that he's one of the
cornerstones of this program. For those reasons that's why he
should be rookie of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bell in the lineup, the Eagles would have had a good shot
to win Saturday. Without him? Well, they combined with the Friars
to record the lowest scoring game in Big East history.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Harley picked up some of the slack for Bell, scoring a
team-high 12 points, but he was the only Eagle in double figures.
Kenny Walls scored 2 points on 1-for-14 shooting, but had almost as
many rebounds (13) as field goal attempts while senior guard Dwayne
Pina, making his first start in Bell's place, had 2 points, 7
rebounds, 3 assists, and 4 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' senior forward Michael Cotton said of
Bell. ``I don't know if there's a better freshman in the country,
honestly. All through this season, he's made all the big shots and
he's played well offensively and defensively. I don't know if
there's a freshman in the country who is more important to their
team than Troy is to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --In BC's 67-62 victory over Providence Jan. 8 at Conte Forum,
the Eagles hit 20 of 56 shots and got a game-high 28 points from
Bell, who connected on 8 of 17 field goals, 4 of 8 shots from
3-point range, and 8 of 11 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   --Saturday, with Bell in street clothes, BC made a season-low 16
of 62 field goal attempts, converted 1 of 12 from 3-point range,
was held to 9 points in the last 10:52 of the game, and wound up
with its lowest point total since a 58-36 loss at Georgetown Jan.
27, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Providence, which had lost five straight
home games, went scoreless for the first 7:18 of the second half
after trailing at halftime, 21-20. Still, the Friars were not
deterred, mounting a comeback from a 31-23 deficit with less than
10 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Erron Maxey led Providence (11-16, 4-10) with 16 points and a
career-high 21 rebounds (12 offensive). Donta Wade, who had 13
points on 5-for-14 shooting, drilled a pair of huge treys. His
first trifecta tied it, 35-35, with 4:58 to go. Then, after Xavier
Singletary (5 points, 1-for-9 shooting) knocked down BC's first
3-pointer in two games to snap an 0-for-17 skein, Wade hit another
trey that put the Friars in control for good, 40-38.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way we played, but our shooting was our only
shortcoming that we had,'' Skinner said. ``When you miss shots that
are good shots, I can't really complain about that. Every other
part of the game, I think we did a pretty decent job considering
the situation we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without Troy Bell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bell sat with reporters before the game and discussed how his
season had come to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I kind of feel like everything happens for a
reason,'' he said. ``Maybe something good might come from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell will undergo arthroscopic surgery on Friday.

CLARK WINS OLYMPIC MARATHON TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ On a morning in which the improbable took 2
hours 33 minutes 31 seconds to become the undeniable, an unknown
37-year-old pathologist came down from Alaska to win the US Olympic
Team Trials for the Women's Marathon Saturday, overcoming startling
heat to leave in her wake a trail of big-name athletes and a
simmering controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just in shock,'' said Christine Clark, a mother of two
from Anchorage who follows 1996 winner Jenny Spangler into Trials
lore as a longshot who made good. ``No one could have been more
surprised than me. I'm certainly a late bloomer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the slowest winning time in Trials history, run under
relentlessly sunny skies and in temperatures that registered in the
80s at midrace, means that Clark will be the only US representative
in the women's marathon at the Sydney Olympics. For the United
States to send the usual three-woman contingent, Saturday's victor
needed to cross the finish line in 2:33 or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that was an issue,'' said Clark. ``If there was any way
I could have run under 2:33, I would have.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Clark, winner of the 1995 Seattle Marathon and third
at Twin Cities last fall, ran almost seven minutes faster than her
previous best marathon, an astonishing improvement coming out of
the pack as the 22d-fastest in the field, to earn $35,000 and an
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It so far surpasses my expectations, I don't know what to
say,'' said Clark, who fortuitously did the bulk of her relatively
low, 70-mile-a-week training on a treadmill in a converted bedroom
with the thermostat set at 70 degrees. ``No one could have been
more surprised than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Second was Kristy Johnston of Shepherdstown, W.V. (2:35:36),
while Anne Marie Lauck of Hampton, N.J., was third (2:36:05).
Libbie Hickman, the favorite, came in eighth in 2:39:57, while Joan
Samuelson, who revealed after the race that she had taken a
cortisone shot in her back on Thursday to ease symptoms of a
herniated disk, came in right behind her, finishing ninth in
2:39:59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, it was tough in the heat,'' said Samuelson, 42.
``I thought it was going to be in the 30s or 40s down here. I never
could take enough water.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson said the disk flareup left her with no feeling in her
toes and no power down her left side. In her last two 13-mile runs,
the most recent on Tuesday, her left leg ``was just slap, slap,
slapping,'' she said. ``I just held my breath at 13 miles
(Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   For the second-place Johnston, it was a day of crushing
disappointment, despite the $30,000 payday, because any other year
second and third place at the Trials would mean a trip to the
Olympics. ``I think we're probably going to fight some of the rules
somehow,'' said Johnston, who has met the Olympic ``A'' standard
but needed Clark to run 31 seconds faster so she, too, could make
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who works three days a week at Providence Hospital in
Anchorage and has two sons (Matthew, 9, and Danny, 6), ran the
first half of the race in the pack that was chasing Lauck, who by 3
miles had taken the lead, and 26-year-old Kim Pawelek. At 11 miles,
Gwyn Coogan (sore left foot) left the pack and dropped out. By the
halfway point, Lauck had built a 42-second lead over Pawelek and
was 54 seconds ahead of the pack. But by 16 miles Pawelek had been
reeled in and by 17 miles Clark was in second, having whittled 15
seconds off Lauck's lead in just a mile. By 18, she was just 11
seconds behind; by 19, a mere four; and at precisely the 20-mile
mark the stranger from Alaska took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just running evenly, and people were coming back to
me,'' said Clark, who runs for Alaska's Team Raven Running Club.
``I didn't really let myself think I could win until the last 2
miles, and then it hit me. I don't think I'll sleep for three
days.''

US COMES UP SHORT IN AMERICAN CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ They're calling it Operation Sneak Attack, the
out-of-nowhere strike that the American men's gymnastics team hopes
will put them on the Olympic medal stand in Sydney. By then, Blaine
Wilson and Jason Gatson will be fully fit again and John
Roethlisberger will be his ageless self.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be standing on the podium with a medal around their
necks,'' predicts program director Ron Galimore. ``I am 110 percent
confident about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that confidence wasn't there Saturday at Orlando Arena, when
the decimated US squads lost both titles at the American Cup for
the first time in the event's 25-year-history. Cuba's Eric Lopez
took the men's title ahead of Russia's Alexei Bondarenko and
Roethlisberger. And Russia's Elena Produnova, a two-time world
medalist, easily outpointed Morgan White, a 16-year-old from Ohio,
for the women's crown.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans expected much more here. Though the US
males had won the last five titles, they took the floor without
Wilson, the three-time champion who's still rehabbing from shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine, but I'm not in routine shape,'' said Wilson, who
missed last year's world all-around bronze by a thousandth of a
point. ``It's a hard thing to swallow, to have to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So the home hopes rested with the 29-year-old Roethlisberger,
who'd won in 1995 and 1996 but has been fighting age and injury.
``Obviously, I have some work to do,'' conceded Roethlisberger,
who'll be trying to make his third Olympic team this summer. ``I
don't want to lose to these guys down the road. But this is a step
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With four world team members (Kristen Maloney, Vanessa Atler,
Jennie Thompson, and Elise Ray) still recovering from injuries, the
US women had no illusions of winning here. ``Produnova is the best
gymnast in the world right now,'' said US team coordinator Bela
Karolyi. ``She is not a rookie. She is an old-timer.''
</P>
<P>
   Produnova easily won all four events, but White and 15-year-old
Tasha Schwikert hung in gamely. ``A success, a very good start,''
Karolyi concluded. ``Our big cannons are still out there, waiting
for their time to come in. So I feel no frustration about being
second and fourth here.''
</P>
<P>
   The US championships in St. Louis aren't until the end of July,
the Olympic trials in Boston not until mid-August. By then, Karolyi
hopes, he can get enough women healthy and honed enough to make a
run Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything we can do to get rid of this perception
that American gymnastics is weaker than before,'' he said. ``We
will be around the medal-contending area. Remember this. Bela said
it. There is the talent there.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, who placed two in the top 10 at the 1996 Olympics and
have added the 19-year-old Gatson (who's recovering from a
blown-out knee), are solid enough to make a run at the top four at
Olympus. But winning a team medal, which hasn't happened since
1984, may take a top-secret plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may say, `You guys won't be good enough to win a
medal,' and they may be right,'' said Roethlisberger. ``But we're
going to go out there and take on anybody.''

Iowa State takes charge of Big 12
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AMES, Iowa _ Before the game, Iowa State senior Michael Nurse stood
on the court with tears streaming down his face, as he prepared to
play his final home game for the Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, junior Marcus Fizer, who might leave early for
the NBA draft after the season, was so overcome by the emotion of
what could be his final home game that he fell to his knees and
wept.
</P>
<P>
   In the 40 minutes between, the weeping and wailing in the Hilton
Coliseum came from the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who watched almost
helplessly Saturday as Fizer and Nurse led Iowa State to a 72-61
win in a battle for first place in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer scored a game-high 29 points and Nurse added 15 on 5-of-10
3-point shooting as the Cyclones dominated the Cowboys from the
opening tap. Iowa State trailed only once in the game, by one point
less than a minute into the contest, and led by as many as 21
before Oklahoma State scored the game's final eight points to make
the score look respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did what we were supposed to do we were successful, we
just didn't make all the plays and we did not play as smart as we
should have,'' said guard Joe Adkins, who led the Cowboys with 14
points. ``We can't come in here and play a team like this, not play
well, and win on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State, which did not lose any of its 18 games at the Hilton
Coliseum this season, put its home-court advantage to good use
twice in the past week. The 17th-ranked Cyclones entered the week
tied with Texas and No. 10 Oklahoma State, but bettered both by
double digits at home to take control of the conference race, with
just two games remaining (at Texas Tech on Wednesday and at Baylor
on March 4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this game would be the easiest of the three
(remaining games),'' Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said. ``That's
not a knock against Oklahoma State, but we had a home-court
advantage and I knew `Hilton Magic' and our fans would help us
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (24-4 overall, 12-2 in the Big 12) can clinch at
least a share of the league title and the top seed in the
conference tournament with one more win. Oklahoma State (22-4,
11-3) needs two Cyclones losses and wins over Colorado and Oklahoma
to win the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't bet any money on it,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie
Sutton said. ``I'd be surprised if Iowa State would be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer said the emotion that hit him came in thinking about the
relief that the conference race was almost over, though he
cautioned that the regular-season championship was not officially
the Cyclones'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this Texas road trip is going to be extremely
hard,'' said Fizer. ``This season has been so great, so magical.
It's hard to finally realize that this is the last home game of the
season and Stevie Johnson's and Michael's last home games of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to go out there and do my best to do
everything I could to help the team win for them in their last
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State, which has not won an outright league title since
capturing the Big Six in 1945, built a 10-point advantage midway
through the first half, thanks to Fizer's quick start. The 6-8
forward displayed his skills again for the slew of professional
scouts in attendance as he drained a pair of 3-pointers, sank a
running jumper in the lane and rocked the rim with a forceful slam
on his way to 16 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins had 10 points to keep Oklahoma State surprisingly close
at the break, but a manageable 37-31 deficit turned into a rout
rather quickly as the Cyclones put together a 21-6 run to start the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   All five Iowa State starters scored in the blitz, with Nurse
leading the way with consecutive treys and Jamaal Tinsley, the
team's worst outside shooter (15 percent on 3-pointers), adding an
omen-like 3-pointer from the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Desmond Mason had a sluggish effort, scoring only
eight points in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us to win when our best player goes 2-for-11,''
Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such trouble for the Cyclones, as Fizer was one
point shy of his third consecutive 30-point game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anybody in the country playing better
than Marcus Fizer right now,'' Eustachy said. ``That's why we find
ourselves in the standings where we do. He is a man. He's turned
into a team leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is ever so close to leading his team to a conference
title.

CRAIG, SIMMS UP TO CHALLENGES IN BOXOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ Dante Craig and Michael Simms Jr. joined
some illustrious company Saturday. Craig, of Cincinnati, and Simms,
of Sacramento, became just the 10th and 11th boxers to win the US
Olympic team as box-off challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Craig edged Larry Mosley of Los Angeles at 147 pounds at
Foxwoods Resort Casino, landing a scoring blow in the final seconds
to tie the score, 9-9, and winning on points awarded for scoring
blows, 49-46. The scoring-blows tiebreaker is calculated by
totaling the number of punches recorded by five judges, then
dropping the high and low totals.
</P>
<P>
   Both Craig and Simms, who defeated Olanda Anderson at 178
pounds, had to defeat their opponents twice in succession to
advance to the Americas qualifying March 27-April 1 in Tampa. That
was because their opponents had won at the Olympic Trials a week
ago, leaving the likes of Craig and Simms to battle in a losers'
bracket on their way to a double-elimination box-off.
</P>
<P>
   Since the box-off format was instituted in 1984, the list of
successful challengers had included just Evander Holyfield, Jerry
Page, and Meldrick Taylor in 1984; Kelcie Banks, Riddick Bowe, and
Andrew Maynard ('88); Montell Griffin ('92); and Albert Guardado
and Floyd Mayweather ('96).
</P>
<P>
   Most of those fighters have gone on to successful professional
careers, and Craig and Simms appear headed in a similar direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante has always been confident,'' said trainer Roy Dale, who
once challenged Carlos Monzon for the world middleweight title in
Rome on less than three weeks' notice. ``He has natural ability. I
told all the guys who came up with him in the Junior Olympics they
would be champs. But he is making a few mistakes still. He can't
wait to counterpunch like that. You need to counter off the
counter, start off the action, because there is no time to wait
around. In the amateurs, they count the blows, and you have to be
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he had lost, they might have been able to forget about
him as an amateur but they would have to reckon with his name as a
pro. He is tall, fast, strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Craig: ``Coming out of the losers' bracket and winning
twice like that proves it's not a fluke. (Mosley) is a good amateur
but he is the easiest fighter I had. He doesn't take a punch and
doesn't have the stamina for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to win the Olympics and then become world champion
in the middleweight class. I know I will be a better pro than
amateur. I've been trained like a pro since I started.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms also displayed poise and power in pulling his 11-7 upset.
Simms believed he had to overcome the image of Anderson, a staff
sergeant and member of the US Army World Class Athlete Program, as
a potentially more glamorous Olympics entrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought USA Boxing didn't want me here,'' Simms said. ``It
was just some thoughts I had inside, and from talking to past
amateurs. It just seemed that way, but I just had to look past it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I had to come out of nowhere. I am America's best-kept
secret. Toughness and a big heart got me this far. It shows that 10
years of hard work pays off. There have been a lot of ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simms-Anderson rivalry is becoming intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anderson) said he doesn't like me personally,'' Simms said.
``So I'll say the same thing about him. If he doesn't give respect,
he doesn't get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't stop here for me. I want to take the same steps
Holyfield took.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other box-offs, Jeff Lacy of St. Petersburg, Fla.,
defeated Arthur Palac of Hamtramck, Mich., 10-9, at 165 pounds; and
Calvin Brock of Charlotte, N.C., defeated T.J. Wilson of Tulsa,
Okla., 6-5, at 201-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Palac's father and trainer said his son was a victim of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows they don't want a white man in the Olympics,''
Ted Palac said. ``There hasn't been a white man on the team since
1988.''

Texas has easy time against Texas A&AMP;M
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ Some day, maybe the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M rivalry that is so
intense on the football field every November will carry over to the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   That day wasn't Saturday. Not by a long shot. The No. 14-rated
Longhorns toyed with the Aggies 85-58 before 11,451 at the Erwin
Center. The victory was the 14th straight for Texas over Texas A&AMP;M,
the longest streak by either team in the series.
</P>
<P>
   This one was open-and-shut. Texas (20-7 overall, 11-3 in the Big
12) used its depth up front to scorch the undermanned Aggies, who
played without 6-9 senior forward Aaron Jack, home in College
Station with a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to suffer without A.J., because he gives
us some things underneath that some of us can't give,'' said
reserve forward Jason Boeker, who played a season-high 27 minutes
and had four points and five rebounds. ``We tried to step it up,
but those guys are so strong and so big. They're pros. They're
tough to get around.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas center Chris Mihm had 21 points on 7-of-7 shooting from
the field, forward Chris Owens added 20 and forward Gabe Muoneke
had eight points and seven rebounds off the bench. Mihm and Owens
combined for 13 points in the first eight minutes as the Longhorns
set the tone for the game quickly. Overall, Texas had 36 points in
the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get two or three guys going the way we did today, it
pretty much makes us unstoppable down low,'' said Mihm, who had 10
rebounds and recorded his 17th double double of the season.
``They're not able to just sit on one guy. Things open up in the
post.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fast start by Mihm and Owens, the Longhorns led only
19-16 with 11:05 left in the first half when Aggies freshman
Bernard King scored off an offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a pair of 3-point baskets by reserve forward Chris
Ogden and robust slam dunks by Muoneke and Darren Kelly, the
Longhorns went on a 21-7 run to take a 40-23 lead with three
minutes to go in the half. Texas led 46-28 at the half. The Aggies
(7-18, 3-11) never were able to get back in the game, shooting only
28.9 percent in the second half and 32.3 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, they're so strong,'' said Aggies coach Melvin
Watkins. ``There's no way to compare what they have and what we
have right now. It's tough for us to match up with them right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas guard Will Clay, who had 16 points, carried the matchup
problem for the Aggies to the backcourt. Clay was in King's face
most of the day, holding King to 13 points on 5-of-20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Clay, a senior from Bryan, used an aggressive style
of defense on King would be putting it mildly. King wore a headband
for the first time this season Saturday, and Clay was wrapped
around King nearly as tight as that headband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge, but it's my job to go out and guard the
other team's best player,'' said Clay. ``He keeps moving all the
time, so you just have to stay with him and be more aggressive than
he is. There's times when you have to give a guy a hard foul early
in the game to let him know that's the way the rest of the game is
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing at Iowa State last Tuesday night to fall out of a
tie for the Big 12 lead, the Longhorns needed a breather before
they face Kansas at home Monday. They got just that against the
Aggies, running up a 36-point lead (79-43) midway through the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Melvin and what he's doing, and I
told our kids at halftime that the Aggies weren't going to quit,''
said Texas coach Rick Barnes. ``They played hard the whole way, but
we did an excellent job of keeping our concentration once we got
ahead. There's been times this year where we haven't done that, but
we probably played our best mental game for 40 minutes that we have
all season.''
</P>
<P>
   That diligence allowed the Longhorns to reach the 20-win mark
for the first time since 1996, when they went 21-10. Barnes said
that given the Longhorns' rugged schedule (ranked the third
toughest in the nation in the latest RPI,) the 20-win plateau is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the schedule we've played and the travel we've had, I'd
say the kids have done a heck of a job getting to 20 wins. None of
those guys in there have ever won 20 games in a season, so it's
something special for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, maybe a basketball game between the Aggies and
Longhorns will be something special. For the last six years, Texas
has had its way over Texas A&AMP;M, winning 12 of the 14 games by 10 or
more points and five times by more than 25 points. The Longhorns
won both games this season by 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible feeling to have inside you, losing as many
games as we have by so many points,'' said King. ``But I also know
inside that we're going to be better.''

ST. JOHN'S SURPRISES NO. 2 DUKE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ This scramble had no purpose: Bootsy Thornton
drifted to the middle of court. Lavor Postell hopped toward the
free-throw line. Erick Barkley skipped toward the baseline and his
joyous teammates. The horn had just sounded on St. John's 83-82
upset of second-ranked Duke, and the Red Storm players did not
quite know how act.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the 9,314 Blue Devils fanatics who had come to
Cameron Indoor Stadium intent on showing solidarity with the
NCAA-beleaguered team only to find a superb basketball game hijack
their social protest. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski had asked the
student body to spare Barkley any cutting witticisms. In fact, a
list of alternate cheers directed at the NCAA had been circulated
through the stands.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Storm's purposeful scrambling for 40 minutes did not
give Coach K, the Cameron crazies or anyone else time to thumb
their noses at college sports authority.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until Thornton was near the 3-point line with 11.9
seconds left in the game, there was only one unifying thought in
this sweltering gymnasium: which team loses a contest in which both
teams shoot nearly 50 percent, both starting lineups score in
double figures, and both teams rarely make a turnover?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, because of Thornton, is not St. John's. With the Red
Storm trailing, 82-81, the left-hander got the ball on the right
wing and was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking: `Hey! They left me wide open,' he said. ```This
is where I've been hitting from,''' said Thornton, who stroked his
21st and 22nd points through the net.
</P>
<P>
   In a game with 12 lead changes _ with acrobatic runs that at
different stages had the Blue Devils up by 12 and the Red Storm up
by seven _ there was plenty of drama left after Thornton's basket.
With five seconds left, the Blue Devils inbounded the ball
underneath their bucket to Chris Carrawell. St. John's had bottled
the player of the year candidate all afternoon, holding him to 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm did it one more time. Thornton and Anthony Glover
sandwiched the senior in a double team and forced him to take an
off-balance 22-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the longest five seconds of my life,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   If the past three weeks under NCAA scrutiny disrupted the Red
Storm, it certainly has not shown it. It is 7-0 during that stretch
and in the last week has beaten No. 13 Syracuse, No. 22 Connecticut
and now No. 2 Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resiliency that our kids showed is the reflection of who
they are, their character, where they have come from and where they
want to go,'' coach Mike Jarvis said. ``Whatever we're doing on or
off the court, it's about doing it as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season St. John's and Duke turned in a memorable duel _ a
92-88 overtime victory for the Blue Devils _ at a sold-out Madison
Square Garden. Thornton poured in 40 points during a breakout
performance. The Red Storm needed everybody Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis thought it was too much to ask for his team to repeat
that performance. But with four minutes left in the game and Duke
up, 78-75, he turned to his son and assistant, Mike Jarvis II, and
said: ``This is great. I can't believe this is happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened because every Red Storm player on the court played
for the other. Glover scored 12 points and wrestled with the Blue
Devils' Carlos Boozer. Postell softened Duke's middle with slashing
assaults on the blocks and contributed 16 points. Off the bench,
Donald Emanuel and Chudney Gray combined for nine points, two
steals and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a different style because they have four guys who
handle the ball,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was Barkley. His 14 points, eight assists and
three steals do not evoke the stone-faced precision he exhibited
throughout a week in which NCAA investigators were interested in
who paid for a portion of his prep schooling in Maine. Krzyzewski
and Blue Devil forward Shane Battier spoke out on the guard's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In fact on Friday, at a tent encampment filled with Duke
students waiting for tickets, Krzyzewski told the crowd that his
good friend, Jarvis, had told him that Barkley was probably going
to have to miss a game before the end of the season because of the
tuition arrangement. He told the students to support Barkley and
St. John's because it was not fair.
</P>
<P>
   When Barkley was introduced the Blue Devil student body
applauded loudly; when his teammates were introduced, the crowd
chanted, ``Fight the Power.'' But cheers of ``Stop the Witch Hunt''
that were listed on the handouts never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barkley found Battier after the game for a hug and a
whispered conversation. ``I thanked him and Coach K for watching my
back 100 percent,'' Barkley said. ``We're a top-five team in the
country right now on my list and that's what I'd like to talk
about. Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm made a statement on the basketball floor that was
much more poignant.

MONTGOMERIE DOESN'T LET HIMSELF GET RANKLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Somehow, the presence of Colin Montgomerie
signals to some reporters a duty to get antagonistic. How else to
explain a nonsensical exchange during what should have been a
routine press conference prior to the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship?
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie was asked how well he understood the world ranking
system, which he rightfully saw as a blueprint for entrapment.
``What are you trying to get me to say?'' asked Montgomerie, well
aware that it was hoped he'd offer stinging criticism of a points
system that gets knocked all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter kept on, at one point asking Montgomerie how he
would explain the system to his wife, which produced this quip:
``She knows the system as well as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have stopped, but it escalated to the point where the
reporter got sarcastic. ``I don't understand it completely. That's
why I want a genius like you to explain it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncalled for, most certainly, and intended only to stir
criticism. That Montgomerie was unable to steer clear of the
questioning without his own touch of combativeness was no surprise,
but it was a line of questioning that never should have started.
``You should know the system,'' said Montgomerie. ``What's the
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Score one for Monty, though the exchange again cast light on the
world rankings, which have become important in pro golf circles. It
is a system with flaws, and the reporter was trying to get
Montgomerie to say so. Admirably, he did not take the bait.
Instead, Montgomerie offered a simple, but accurate, viewpoint:
``It's a very, very difficult way of trying to judge one's form,
but if no one comes up with a better system, this is the best we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for better or worse, we have the world rankings,
administered by the International Management Group (unsettling to
some), and used as a basis for extending invitations to World Golf
Championship events, not to mention the Masters. There are
problems, no doubt. Most flagrant is the two-year time period that
is used, thus distorting a player's current form. Mark O'Meara is a
most glaring example. His remarkable 1998 season (Masters and
British Open triumphs) still counts for points; thus O'Meara was
seeded 14th for the Match Play Championship. Obviously, that
ranking is way too high, but as 1998 tourneys lose weight and his
1999-2000 performance (no wins, just three top 10s) counts more,
O'Meara's ranking will plummet.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be the only one. Consider that of the 64 players who
qualified for last year's inaugural event, 14 did not maintain high
enough status in the world rankings to earn invites for 2000. Nick
Faldo, for instance, was No. 64 a year ago; now you can find him
residing at No. 186. Craig Stadler, Scott Verplank, Bill Glasson,
Brad Faxon, Steve Jones, Michael Bradley, John Cook, Ian Woosnam,
and Tom Watson are some of the others who slipped to the wrong side
of 64.
</P>
<P>
   So far, and yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of this tournament create a harsh reality, since
some players come an awful long way to play less than one round of
golf. Ireland's Padraig Harrington, for example, was eliminated by
Jesper Parnevik at the 17th hole of Round 1. Although the $25,000
paycheck eased his disappointment, his early exit had to make a
long trip even longer. Though some Europeans (such as Retief
Goosen) chose to make the trip to the United States more worthwhile
by adding next week's Doral Open to their schedule, others (Miguel
Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal, for example) are in for a
serious case of jet lag as they head to the Dubai Desert Classic.
For his part, Harrington chose to take the next two weeks off. So,
after being eliminated Wednesday, the Irishman was on the driving
range at La Costa, working on a game that let him down against
Parnevik. ``I was swinging the club terrible,'' said Harrington.
Though he is not a household name, Harrington is held in high
regard by many of his colleagues. A personable man with a great
work ethic, Harrington earned a spot on his first Ryder Cup team in
September and did not disappoint. He teamed with Jimenez to go 1-1
in foursomes, then beat O'Meara, 1 up, in singles. ``It was a good
week and good to look back on it,'' said Harrington, 28.
``Certainly enjoyable up to the very end. Obviously, if we had won,
it would have been the icing on the cake.'' He was ranked in the
top 50 at the start of the year, earning him a spot in his first
Masters. That's the good news. The bad? His rank has since slipped
to No. 57, thus he most likely will not be in the fields at either
the Bay Hill Invitational (March 16-19) or The Players Championship
(March 23-26) . . . Two first-day results that had to sting the
most at the match play event involved Fred Couples and Brent
Geiberger. Couples had a 1-up cushion when he missed a 2-foot putt
at No. 17 that would have halved the hole. Ruffled, he then pulled
his drive well left into rough at No. 18, and watched helplessly as
Joe Ozaki stuck his approach to within 3 feet for the winning
birdie. Geiberger birdied No. 17 to go 1 up, then threw away the
lead with a bogey at No. 18. He followed with a bogey on the 19th
hole to get his ticket home . . . Another tournament tidbit: All
four of 1999's semifinalists (Jeff Maggert, Andrew Magee, Steve
Pate, and John Huston) were bounced in the first round. Magee is
the guy who last year made light of the fact that he had to go buy
socks for Sunday's championship match with Maggert, having packed
for a short stay. This year? Magee certainly didn't need extra
socks, but he told reporters that leaving early was OK because he
was playing for the sixth straight week and needed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Apples and oranges
</P>
<P>
   Since 20 of the 24 Ryder Cup participants were in this week's
field, Montgomerie was asked if the match play event took on a
similar feel. He cringed. ``No. This is a world event. It's not a
Europe vs. America type of idea. That's once every two years. This
has nothing to do with that.'' . . . The only Ryder Cuppers not
here? The late Payne Stewart and the three Europeans who were kept
out of the lineup until the Sunday singles matches _ Jarmo
Sandelin, Jean Van de Velde, and Andrew Coltart . . . Though eight
of those European players advanced to Round 2 and five got to the
Final 16, smiles are not so prominent because of a simmering
dispute that could boil over shortly. It has to do with a decision
made by PGA European Tour executive director Ken Schofield to
change the eligibility for this summer's NEC Invitational, the
second of four World Golf Championships events. As originally
structured, the $5 million purse would be for members of the most
recent Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams, but Schofield, in a
veiled attempt to get European players to commit more to their home
tour, has put forth another set of guidelines for his players.
Instead of the Ryder Cup team, Europe will send the top 12 players
on its Order of Merit as of Aug. 14. Since Sergio Garcia, Paul
Lawrie, Van de Velde, and Parnevik plan to play extensively in the
United States, they very well could fall outside the top 12 on the
Order of Merit, a scenario that has angered all of them.
Reportedly, Garcia is most vocal, which is not good news for
Schofield, since his tour desperately needs the star appeal of the
young Spaniard . . . Tiger Woods blew off some steam when asked to
comment about published reports that he had proposed to girlfriend
Joanna Jagoda. ``I don't know where people come up with this stuff.
It's not true. I'm here to tell you that right now. Let's put an
end to this crap.'' The report first surfaced in a London tabloid,
then got picked up by the New York Post . . . Oh, for a PGA Tour
event without the hideous lift, clean, and place. It is a license
to cheat, and they are far too quick and far too liberal with it on
the PGA Tour. Disturbing sights abound, like the player in a Round
1 match here who was able to move his ball before a crucial putt.
He would have had to putt over 8 inches of fringe. But given a
club's length placement, he was able to choose a different angle
and position his ball just on the edge. By all means, plugged balls
deserve a free lift, but a little mud isn't bad, particularly since
everybody plays the same mud.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Karrie-ing on
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that Woods's winning streak was impressive,
but we perhaps cast our eyes at the wrong golfer (Michael Campbell)
in an effort to find someone just as hot. How about Karrie Webb?
She has been overwhelming in 2000, having won both her starts in
easy fashion. Webb will attempt to make it 3 for 3 in this
weekend's Australian Ladies Masters, and you would have to say her
chances are attractive. After all, she has won the event the last
two years and in 12 tournament rounds at Royal Pines in Gold Coast,
Webb is 56 under par. ``She has no flaws,'' said Peter Thomson, the
five-time British Open champ and Australian golf legend . . . The
LPGA Tour is keeping a close eye on the developments in Canada as
du Maurier Ltd. conducts a search for a sponsor for that women's
major golf championship. Du Maurier is likely to withdraw its
support because of restrictions on tobacco-company sponsorships in
Canada. This year's event includes a $1.2 million purse put up by
du Maurier . . . Betsy King, the LPGA Tour's career money leader,
is closing in on $7 million in this, her 23d season. That's a good
season for Woods . . . Old friend Peter Teravainen, the world
traveler from Duxbury, Mass., finished eighth in last week's Casino
Filipino Open . . . A three-day golf fair at Stow Acres CC winds
down Sunday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Merchandise will be available, and
golf professionals will be present to offer advice . . . Organizers
of the Cape Cod Open (June 7-8) and Cape Cod Senior Open (Sept.
25-26) merged efforts to form the Cape Cod Golf Championships
committee. A third event could be added to the summer schedule . .
. The Boston Golf Expo opens a three-day run at the Bayside Expo
Friday (1-9 p.m.) and will again feature equipment, instruction,
health clinics, a driving range and miniature golf course, and
exhibits from retailers and destination bureaus. Saturday's hours
will be 10 a.m.-9 p.m. and Sunday's 10 a.m.-5 p.m.

No. 22 seed wins U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By STEVE SIEVERT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A mother of two from Alaska who does the majority
of her training indoors on a treadmill stunned America's best
female marathoners by winning the U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon on
Saturday in a personal-best time of 2 hours, 33 minutes, 31
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Little-known Christine Clark, seeded 22nd in the field of 171,
reeled in Anne Marie Lauck at the 20-mile mark, built a 20-second
lead over the next mile and cruised to her biggest marathon win
ever. Clark's time was a remarkable seven minutes faster than she
had ever run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock when I caught Anne Marie,'' said Clark, who
qualified for the trials with a less-than-elite time of 2:40:38.
``I was really surprised the favorites didn't catch up to me. I
didn't even think about winning until the last two miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory earned Clark, 37, a trip to this summer's Olympics
in Sydney, Australia, a trip Clark wasn't planning on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really going to complicate my life,'' she said
jokingly. ``But it's a good complication.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauck, a 1996 Olympic marathoner, fired the race's opening salvo
by breaking up a lead pack of 20 with a 5:34 fourth mile. By the
half-marathon, covered in 1:15:28, Lauck had built a 42-second lead
on Kim Pawelek. A chase group, including Clark, top-seed Libbie
Hickman, Kristy Johnston, Liz Wilson and Melody Fairchild, was
another 24 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Lauck maintained a sizable advantage over the next couple of
miles through the Fort Jackson army base, but as the unseasonably
warm weather continued to heat up, Lauck began to wear down. Over
Lauck's right shoulder, Clark was closing in a hurry. At mile 19,
Lauck's grip on the lead was all but gone. Clark was only four
seconds back. A mile later, the lead changed hands for the final
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was more surprised than me,'' Clark said. ``I was
hoping to finish in the top 20, maybe in the top 10, if I had a
good day. I never expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   The race marked the second straight women's trials in which a
little-known runner stole the day. Jenny Spangler emerged from the
pack as the 61st seed to win in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who finished 76th in '96, turned in the sequel to
Spangler this year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about her chances in Sydney, Clark was glowingly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my potential is,'' she said. ``I've only
been training seriously with a coach for about a year. I don't
think I've reached my peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Houston-area runners went to the starting line at the
trials, but only one finished. Joy Smith of Sugar Land ran 2:54:16,
good for 70th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge from the start,'' she said. ``Sometimes you
wake up and you just don't feel right and that's what happened to
me today. The weather made it even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Patty Valadka battled hamstring problems and was
forced to drop out at the 10-mile mark.

PEDRO, NOMAR PUT SIGNATURES ON MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ They park far beyond the outfield fences,
then make the long walk on the white stone path that leads into the
five diamonds of the Red Sox' minor league compound. They are
hardball pilgrims _ pasty-legged men, women, and children _
carrying cameras, Sharpies, beach chairs, rosters, baseballs,
gloves, bats, posters, and the eternal hopes of Red Sox Nation. You
have never seen so many people wearing shorts, black shoes, and
white socks.
</P>
<P>
   At the site, amenities are few. There's almost no seating; fans
must stay behind yellow ropes; there's no concession food; and four
port-o-potties serve as discomfort stations. But it's all
worthwhile because this is where everyday people have a chance to
make contact with Pedro, Nomar, and the other gods of Fenway lore.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez keeps everybody loose, even the autograph-hungry
masses. Crossing from one diamond to another Saturday, he walked
through the crowd and broke the jawdrop silence with a loud ``Hi.''
In unison, the fans said, ``Hi, Pedro.'' It was a little like the
``Cheers'' routine in which George Wendt walks into the bar and
everybody says, ``Norm!''
</P>
<P>
   The critical moment of the day comes at the end of the grueling
three-hour workout when many players take turns walking to the
ropes and signing autographs. It can be the best and worst part of
the day for Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra because it is impossible
to accommodate everyone and there are always disappointed pilgrims
when a star stops signing. Friday a woman holding a poster stood in
the crowd while Nomar signed for at least 20 minutes. She kept
telling Nomar he was her favorite while he signed for dozens of
kids, elderly folk, and a man in wheelchair. Finally, Nomar wheeled
on his heels and bolted for the clubhouse. The woman made a face
and turned two thumbs down toward Nomar's back.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro has a system to avoid this scenario: ``First of all,
before I start signing, I tell 'em exactly what's up,'' said the
ace of diamonds. ``I tell 'em, `I will sign for a half-hour, but
only if you promise me you won't get mad when I leave. Because I
will have to leave. Otherwise I won't stop and sign. I just keep
going.' But if they agree to that, some of 'em get autographs,
especially kids. I just try to do kids first. Then I do older
couples, people that really need to be helped at the time. Stronger
people I'll do later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard. I have a hard time saying no, but you have to
understand, rules are rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar added, ``The way I look at it . . . I sign every day no
matter what. You can't satisfy everybody and you can't make 'em all
happy. You're always going to miss some people and some of them are
going to be upset. Hopefully, they respect that I'm there every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a time for it. I don't like to sign when I'm
working _ like when I'm down here going from station to station. I
do it after the workout. I try to take care of all the kids. It's
great. You see their eyes light up. They just want to get you to
sign. It's not like they want to sell it or get it for the value.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he spot the subhuman form of life we've come to know as
``collectors''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Nomar. ``They ask for things a certain way and
then they get mad after you sign, and I'm like, `What? I signed
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro and Nomar, poster boys of the Dan Duquette regime, are two
of the most popular players in the majors. It's a little like the
situation in Seattle when the Mariners had Ken Griffey Jr., Randy
Johnson, and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro and Nomar did several Sox promotional and charity
functions in Greater Boston during the winter and their celebrity
is growing daily. Elvis and Sinatra. The King and the Chairman of
the Board. Sox publicist Kevin Shea has fielded more than 25
national media requests for Boston's shortstop and stopper.
Everyone from GQ to Newsweek to Gear. Charity requests are pouring
in at record rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand it's part of what they do,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Nomar are gonna be always asked to do stuff,'' said
Pedro. ``It's hard, but what can you do? It's the same now in the
Dominican, but it's OK. It's not bad. If you analyze it after all,
it's not bad. It's good that they love you, that they want you. Bad
would be when they boo you everywhere you go. But this year in
spring training I've never seen so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the stars themselves? Do they ever get autographs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have certain special kinds of autographs,'' admitted Nomar.
``When I played in Japan in an All-Star Game I asked Sadaharu Oh to
sign a baseball. When I played with Michael Jordan, I had him sign
a baseball, but that was more for my little brother. I had Kevin
Costner sign a ball, but he signed it, `Crash Davis, Durham Bulls.'
Another one he signed, `Ray Kinsella,' from `Field of Dreams.'
That's how I wanted it. I never asked Ted Williams for an
autograph, but I do have a bat and ball signed by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pedro, ``I have balls and bats signed by Ted Williams,
(Dennis) Eckersley, and (Bret) Saberhagen. My first All-Star Game I
got Edgar Martinez, (Mark) McGwire, Frank Thomas, and Tony Gwynn on
the same bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Signed items can be treasured memories _ even for superstars.
And that is why Pedro Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra take time to
sign the baseballs thrust forward by the hardball pilgrims.

COACH TRIES TO GET READ ON THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick still remembers the first time he saw what Bob
Troutwine could do. It wasn't his speed, size, or agility, unless
we're talking about his mental agility, that impressed Belichick.
It was the fact that he could read minds. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was maybe after my second season in Cleveland that we got
hooked up at the combine,'' Belichick said of the psychologist from
Liberty, Mo., who will be assessing the psychological makeup of 300
players at the combine this week for 10 NFL teams. ``I asked him
for some past reports on guys we'd drafted, and he had most of them
cold. He had a lot of guys right on the nose.''
</P>
<P>
   As for players Cleveland didn't draft, ``He hit the reasons why
it turned out to be a bad fit right on the nose,'' Belichick said.
``And some had some severe problems. I thought he had some insights
we didn't have on guys, so we brought him in so he knew our staff
and our philosophy. I think a lot of Bob and what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, Troutwine has done for the NFL what he previously
did for years for corporate America: assess clients' potential
employees. With the dawning of free agency and the kind of bonus
money that is now being laid out, the need for as much information
as possible about the potential of a draftee or a high-priced free
agent has grown, and with it a new wing of NFL scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially there were a lot of skeptics,'' Troutwine said.
``But my findings and my forecasts spoke for themselves. At one
point, I did do interviews with players, but I don't do that
anymore. It's too time-intensive at the combine. Questions are more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Troutwine said it is revealing, for example, when he asks a
player if he would rather be a cat or a dog. The athlete's answer,
he maintains, says much about his mindset and NFL potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I developed a 75-question test,'' Troutwine said. ``Most
questions have two choices: true or false or A and B. There's also
a concentration drill that takes about 90 seconds and involves
remembering different colors in a certain order. We send out
engraved invitations to the players with the logos of the 10 teams
we represent. Most are very cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one question is indicative of anything. But after they
answer all of them and we assess them, trends develop, and we begin
to learn about the players' motivations and personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog or cat question is one we feel has a lot of symbolism.
A dog is man's best friend. A cat is more independent. Players who
go for dogs tend to like structure, and being part of a team is
more important to them. Cats are guys who are more comfortable
being a more solo contributor. You have to let him feel like he's
making the decisions. Picking a cat or a dog is not the kiss of
death. Saying you'd like to be a poodle might be a little
problematic, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Troutwine assessed Ryan Leaf and Peyton Manning
for the Indianapolis Colts. It was his assessment that Leaf would
have far more problems coping with early failures than Manning and
that he might not react well under mounting pressures from the
media and the public. His assessments were right on the money. He
also said Manning's attention to detail was far superior to Leaf's.
Manning became a star in his second season, while Leaf has
immolated himself and is trying to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Troutwine told Colts general manager Bill Polian that
Edgerrin James was a better match for his team than Ricky Williams
because James's personality was more adaptable to having a bigger
star _ Manning _ on his team. Williams, Troutwine felt, needed to
be the center of his team.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts went for James for an assortment of reasons, not just
the assessment of a psychologist from Missouri, but it was a part
of the picture. It is a part that has grown to the point at which
the Chiefs, Chargers, Seahawks, Packers, Colts, Bengals, Bears,
Eagles, Jaguars, and Panthers are all using him and, Troutwine
hopes, perhaps the Patriots will soon join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know him, but I have people in the personnel
department who swear by him,'' said Packers general manager Ron
Wolf of Troutwine. ``With the kind of money we put into these guys
today, you want all the information you can possibly get. This is
another thing that allows you to get into the player a little more
prudently. We use it in case of red flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does is a hard sell for anyone my age who came up
through the NFL the way I did. I wasn't brought up with these kind
of things. It was about how you play football, not the other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's more how will they fit into society, especially up
here in Green Bay, where it's a little different. It's a tool. To
say it helps you draft is wrong. It doesn't. It's another little
piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a puzzle Troutwine has been putting together for corporate
clients for years, ever since he left Tulane with a Ph.D in
psychology. But 17 years ago he turned his interest to pro football
after a short stint as a receivers' coach at William Jewell
College, a highly regarded NAIA school. His business has grown
rapidly ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to work with corporations, but this week he will
focus all his efforts on the annual league combine, where all the
top college talent will be weighed, measured, tested, interviewed,
and now psychologically assessed.
</P>
<P>
   He and his assistants have already attended the Senior Bowl,
Blue-Gray Game, Hula Bowl, Gridiron Classic, and East-West Shrine
Game to test and re-test the nation's top seniors. Now he will do
it one last time, write up reports on all the players, and send
them out knowing they will affect the football futures of many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opinions are within my territory,'' Troutwine said. ``Fit is
an important part of every job situation. Because you don't fit
with one organization doesn't mean you can't excel with another.
But if you make a mistake with a guy who doesn't fit your style or
what you want to do, you take a step back, and so does the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   As Belichick, Wolf, and other NFL coaches, general managers, and
personnel men will attest, a step back in the day of multimillion
dollar signing bonuses is something no team can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency scorecard
</P>
<P>
   The first signings are in, and the NFL is proving again there's
not much sanity when it comes to free agency. No one is happier
about it than guys like Kivika Pittman and Orpheus Roye.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman and Roye were two young free agents who came on the
market this year with little on their resumes but what is
euphemistically known as ``upside potential.'' As Bill Parcells
used to say, ``You know what potential means? Potential means you
haven't done a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to apply in both cases, but this morning, each
guy is worth millions after signing stupendous contracts with the
Denver Broncos and Cleveland Browns. Pittman and Roye were signed
despite having the kind of years that might get a player fired if
he were an eight-year veteran instead of a four-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman signed a seven-year deal worth $28 million, but it is so
back-loaded the last two years that it's really a five-year
contract worth $15 million, including a signing bonus of $3.15
million. What did he do to earn this kind of money? He made 3 1/2
sacks last season as an oft-injured defensive end in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   As for Roye, he signed a six-year, $25 million deal after making
the same number of sacks for the Steelers. Those signings, as well
as the earlier five-year, $24 million deal inked by Philip Daniels
to jump from Seattle to Chicago, not only set the market for
defensive linemen, they made it clear to one long-time agent that
the free agent environment has changed in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rewarding mediocrity now,'' the agent, who requested
anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the case, although once again, the biggest
checks went out early, and there may not be many more big ones
soon. One team that is getting drilled is the Rams, who have lost
center Mike Gruttadauria to Arizona (four years, $8.6 million),
right tackle Fred Miller to Tennessee (six years, $24 million).
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rams have to rebuild 40 percent of their offensive line
less than a month after winning the Super Bowl, underscoring the
fact that the era of dynasties is over in the NFL. The poaching now
starts quickly on any team that is even moderately successful.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and New Orleans appear to have helped themselves with
volume, at least. The Bears added what were generally regarded as
two of the top 10 free agents, Daniels and cornerback Thomas Smith,
who, although he has only six career interceptions, was considered
the best available cover corner on the market by many personnel
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, meanwhile, have finally decided to play football
with a quarterback, signing Cincinnati's mercurial Jeff Blake to a
four-year, $17.2 million contract. They also added receiver Joe
Horn from the Chiefs, plus two corners to help their defense, and
they re-signed center Tom Ackerman. If Blake can come close to his
form of a few years back in Cincinnati and can combine with running
back Williams smoothly, New Orleans could have a powerful,
two-pronged offensive attack.
</P>
<P>
   With other teams, things are spotty. Tennessee's situation is
typical. Tackle Jon Runyan was the top-rated offensive lineman
among veteran free agents, and he jumped from the Titans to the
Eagles for a six-year, $30 million deal. Then Tennessee brought in
Miller for $6 million less to fill his spot. This was viewed as no
worse than a wash for Tennessee, although the Eagles believe
Runyan's power blocking will help revive a dormant offense. At the
high rate they're paying him, it better.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams have focused their efforts on re-signing their own
players, as the Patriots did with Pro Bowl safety Lawyer Milloy.
But often, those signings cost them elsewhere. In New England,
retaining Milloy resulted in the dumping of high-priced but
slipping veteran stars such as tight end Ben Coates and tackle
Bruce Armstrong, with no replacements on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   That is the nature of things in the NFL these days, where
potential is paid higher than production once a player's peak years
have passed. There is no loyalty in either direction any more. When
a player can score big, as Runyon, Daniels, and others did this
year, he leaves. When a team needs to dump an aging star with a
bigger salary than upside, it does, as Buffalo did with Bruce
Smith, the Hall of Fame defensive end who signed immediately with
the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Redskins, they invested more than $50 million to
shore up their defense by adding Smith, safety Mark Carrier, and
linebacker Kevin Johnson to a team that showed last year it could
score big-time but needed to find a way to stop opponents from
returning fire even faster. If these three can help do that, maybe
the Redskins will be this year's big winner in the free agency
game. If not, owner Dan Snyder will fire somebody. You can count on
that.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who signs whom, however, you get the feeling that
in the end, the biggest winners in this game are often the teams
that don't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me, how many of these guys have gone on to other
teams with big contracts and played better?'' Tennessee executive
Jeff Diamond asked.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, frankly, is not many.
</P>
<P>
   Quick kicks
</P>
<P>
   Lester Hayes's toothache has turned into a real pain. According
to the former All-Pro cornerback of the Oakland/Los Angeles
Raiders, last April he finished a charity autograph signing for the
Children's Miracle Network in Reno and came down with a terribly
abscessed tooth. Four hours from his home in Modesto, Calif., he
went to the first dentist he could find but didn't have his wallet
or enough cash to pay him. In unbearable pain, he says, he drove to
a pawn shop and hocked his Super Bowl XVIII ring for $800, got a
receipt that said he had four months to pick it up at that price
plus 10 percent interest per month, got his tooth fixed, and went
home. When he still hadn't picked up the ring by Super Bowl week,
Palace Jewelers put it up for auction on eBay, and within 24 hours
the bidding was up to $11,000. Hayes got wind of things and tried
to buy it back for $16,000 from the pawn shop owner, but she
refused, saying it would destroy her credibility in future eBay
auctions. Eventually, the ring went to an anonymous bidder for
$18,200, and now Hayes is trying to sue on a technicality, claiming
he should have been notified before the ring was put up for sale.
The moral of this story is one of two things: Always floss after
eating, or don't forget to pick up your things . . . Randall
Cunningham refused to take a major pay cut in Minnesota and may
find himself among the unemployed soon, while Viking punter Mitch
Berger landed the biggest signing bonus for a punter in NFL
history. Berger joined Cleveland's Chris Gardocki as the
highest-paid punter when he signed a five-year, $6 million deal,
but Berger's $1.65 million signing bonus was a record.

NEW ZEALAND TAKES CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ If Team New Zealand goes on to win the
America's Cup in the next couple of days, it will, in a season of
firsts, set another mark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will New Zealand be the Cup's 30th winner, it will be
the first nation outside the United States to successfully defend
the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   If we discount the wacky Big Boat/catamaran race of 1988 as a
mere blemish on Cup history, then New Zealand is the first sailing
team to successfully defend the Cup since 1980, when Dennis
Conner's Freedom campaign became the last winning defense by the
New York Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this important? Ever since New York lost the Cup in 1983,
the theory has taken hold that it is easier to drive a camel
through the eye of a needle than it is to win and then successfully
defend the Anerica's Cup. The record:
</P>
<P>
   --1986, Freemantle. After defeating NYYC in '83, Australia's two
defense syndicates (Australia and Kookaburra) were pathetically off
the pace and were beaten by Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes, 4-0. It is
assumed by most that New Zealand's ``White Magic,'' which lost to
Conner in the Louis Vuitton Cup, 4-1, would have also beaten
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   --1988, San Diego. This 4-0 Stars &AMP; Stripes catamaran win over
the renegade challenge by New Zealand's 120-foot monohull is
discounted from history because the ``race'' was between such
disparate boats without a class.
</P>
<P>
   --1992, San Diego. Stars &AMP; Stripes was easily beaten by Bill
Koch's America3, which easily beat Italy's Il Moro de Venezia for
the Cup. Il Moro, helmed by Paul Cayard, beat New Zealand in the
Vuitton finals.
</P>
<P>
   --1995, San Diego. Team New Zealand's Black Magic beat the US
entry of Conner's syndicate sailing Young America's boat (with
Cayard driving). It was a 5-0 win, the most lopsided in history, as
New Zealand won all 25 marks and extended in all 30 legs.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the record book, the logical theory arises that the
challengers have much more competition than the defenders on their
way to the America's Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this set of races, in which 11 challengers began
competing in round robins in October. Each challenger raced each
other three times through the round robins, with the best six
advancing to the semifinals for another round robin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after those 40 races, Prada beat AmericaOne in the closest
Vuitton finals in history, 5-4, and entered the America's Cup match
with 49 races under its belt.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand, on the other hand, has had nothing but racing
between its two boats, NZ57 and NZ60. Throughout the Cup season,
the Kiwis have assured everyone that 22-year-old Dean Barker,
skipper of NZ57 and skipper Russell Coutts's heir apparent, has
been pushing the A team on NZ60 just as hard as any challenger
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' said Sir Peter Blake, the syndicate's figurehead
leader, ``these guys push each other plenty hard. We're going to be
as fast as we can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's words were dismissed as prerace rah-rah fight talk. How
could Team New Zealand possibly be as battle-hardened as Prada,
especially after the Italians' excruciating win over tough guy
Cayard and AmericaOne?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as New Zealand contemplates putting Barker and the junior
varsity aboard NZ60 for their first America's Cup race, the
challengers see in horror that Blake was right.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in a remote corner of the South Pacific, a tiny nation
of 3.8 million has produced the boat technology and sailing skill
to stand a full head above the best designers and sailors from the
United States, Europe, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have just raised the standard,'' said Nippon skipper
Peter Gilmour. ``We were all shooting at the standard New Zealand
set in '95, and many of us got there. The problem is that they
moved on to a new level, and if we shoot for that next time, they
will have gone beyond us yet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how New Zealand got to such a commanding level by going it
alone will doubtless be analyzed for the next three years until the
next Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, its design team, led by Laurie Davidson, got outside
the box, just as Australia's Ben Lexcen did when he came up with
the Australia II breakthrough winner in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is not only that NZ60, a big, powerful boat with a
meter more waterline, runs away and hides when the wind pipes
stronger than 15 knots. In the lighter ranges, she also holds her
own nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory to chew on in the final days of America's Cup 30
is that Cayard may be correct: With so many challenger syndicates,
the gene pool was dragged down by its lower end more than it was
heightened by its top performers.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand began with excellence coming out of '95 and
spawned nothing but more excellence. The truth is that the races
the Kiwis don't win with boat speed, they do with superior teamwork
and afterguard tactics.
</P>
<P>
   And if Gilmour is correct in his assessment, then the ultimate
question is whether New Zealand can match the New York Yacht Club's
record for holding onto the Cup: 132 years.

DUVAL AND DREAM FINAL MEET MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Half of the dream matchup avoided being
tripped up by a falling pine cone Saturday morning. The other half
could not avoid a steamrolling gentleman who has been described as
a ``big teddy bear.''
</P>
<P>
   So what we have in Sunday's 36-hole final of the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship at La Costa Resort and Spa is
Tiger Woods against Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, with David
Duval relegated to a consolation match against Davis Love.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be what TV folks had hoped for, but don't call it a
shock, said Duval after his 4-and-2 thrashing by Clarke in the
semifinals. ``I wasn't fool enough to look past him. I got what I
deserved,'' said Duval, the world's second-ranked player whose
first real head-to-head battle with No. 1 Woods will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Woods was grateful to get past Paul Lawrie in the
morning, in a quarterfinal match punctuated by misfortune at the
10th. Beneath a tree after an errant drive, Woods got to the top of
his backswing when his club grazed the tree. Down came a small
branch _ ``I got hit on the head with a pine cone'' _ and the hole
was lost, Woods having violated a rule by improving his swing path.
Two down, Woods casually scooped up his ball, halved the 11th, then
won the next three holes to put a stop to any thoughts of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Woods was nothing short of brilliant in
putting the hammer to Love with a 5-and-4 blitz that was a
combination of power, finesse, and pure imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Woods eagled the 526-yard second, then birdied the fourth,
fifth, eighth, and ninth for a 6-under-par 30 trip out. There was
no slaughter rule in effect, so Woods went to the back with a 4-up
cushion and one thought on his mind: ``I needed to execute golf
shots and keep applying pressure to Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? How about unmerciful glitz, too. Like his second shot
to the 541-yard, par-5 12th. Woods had driven well right into the
rough, perhaps his only bad shot of the afternoon, and a tree
blocked his path. No worries. Not when you are the one human being
capable of shaping a 6-iron from 221 yards around one tree, then
another, to a green that should not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was phenomenal,'' said Love, who despite putting up a
55-hole stretch without a bogey was helpless as Woods rolled in his
second eagle of the afternoon to go 5 up. When the match ended two
holes later, Woods was 8 under, which you may think is pretty good.
Silly you. ``I could have been 14 under or better,'' said Woods,
and though he smiled, it was hard to say whether he was kidding.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clarke, he was joking early during the week when he told
Woods that ``I am 1-0 against you,'' referring to a four-ball
triumph last September in the Ryder Cup Matches. But there were
partners then, and Sunday Clarke is on his own. Going one-on-one
against Woods, he said, is a formidable task because ``he is the
best player in the world. That's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but what should not be lost is the fairly
impressive way in which Clarke stormed from 3 down to beat Hal
Sutton in the morning, then dismantled No. 2 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Duval had easily been the best player on the course during the
morning, dishing out a 5-and-4 beating to Scott Hoch, a six-birdie,
bogey-free blitz that was so efficient that the loser said he had
no chance. ``Where's Tonya Harding when you need her?'' said Hoch,
who was all square through six before Duval birdied five of the
next seven holes to put the issue to rest.
</P>
<P>
   What Duval couldn't do was carry that momentum into the
afternoon, as the only birdie he made going out against Clarke was
a bomb at the fourth to square the match. It would be the final
highlight of Duval's tournament, however, as Clarke hit it stiff at
the fifth to go 1 up and regain control.
</P>
<P>
   Duval put up a parade of pars _ 12 of them _ but slipped further
behind as Clarke birdied the par-4 10th and par-5 12th. The
frustration took its toll on Duval at the 13th, where after yanking
his approach from the middle of the fairway well left of the pin,
he slammed his club into the turf. His mood did not improve minutes
later when his birdie chance rolled past the hole and Clarke, in
tighter and on the same line, made his.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 up, Clarke had his ticket to an improbable final match that
will pay $1 million to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big teddy bear,'' said Butch Harmon of Clarke, with
whom he has been working for more than a year. Which gives Harmon
two pupils in Sunday's final match, for he has been with Woods
every swing of the way for nearly seven years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a lot of fun,'' said the teacher, ``but when
Woods is on, he can't be beaten.''

 &HT;    The power struggle
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Indiana Pacers: The work off the bench from little-known
forward Austin Croshere has been significant. The Pacers have won
more blowouts than anyone except the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   2. New York Knicks: Hard-nosed defense keeps them in most games,
but it's difficult to get consistent offense. Also, a lack of
interest against weaker teams is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   3. Miami Heat: Best road team in the conference, but still not
intimidating at home. Offensive struggles show against teams with
tough defensive mindset.
</P>
<P>
   4. Charlotte Hornets: It is truly impressive that they have
remained rock-solid emotionally after Bobby Phills' death. Derrick
Coleman has been brilliant, and Anthony Mason as point forward has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   5. Philadelphia 76ers: By playoff time, Allen Iverson and Toni
Kukoc will be comfortable with each other and their ranking should
be higher. They're tops in the league in tight games.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Los Angeles Lakers: They get top billing because they have
the best player, Shaquille O'Neal. It also is impressive that they
hold teams to a league-low shooting percentage (40.8).
</P>
<P>
   2. Portland Trail Blazers: Quick: Who's the best defensive team
in the league? Yep, these guys. And with all that offensive talent,
that kind of D makes them extremely tough.
</P>
<P>
   3. San Antonio Spurs: How long can they survive without a true
small forward? So far, they've fared just fine, thank you. With
them, it all starts and ends with defense and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix Suns: Penny Hardaway seems healthy, finally, and his
play has opened up the game for everyone. But reserve forward
Rodney Rogers has been the Suns' best player lately.
</P>
<P>
   5. Utah Jazz: Karl Malone and John Stockton just keep on going.
Utah knows how to play as a team, and it often overcomes individual
talent on other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle point guard Gary Payton: Since the All-Star break,
Payton has been on a torrid stretch, exemplified by the 41 points
in three quarters against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phoenix forward Rodney Rogers: The firepower he's provided off
the bench has been big in the Suns' rise in the West. Even in his
low game of the week, Rogers had 17 points in 17 minutes against
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlotte forward Derrick Coleman: The much-maligned Coleman
capped a string of brilliant play with a 32-point, 12-rebound,
5-assist and 3-steal effort against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   _ Golden State guard Larry Hughes: Once he gets comfortable, he
probably will star for the Warriors. But he has yet to find his
shooting eye, as in his 2-for-16 effort against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle's Vin Baker: Not long ago considered one of the best
power forwards in the league, Baker mostly has been ordinary. He
bottomed out with a 2-point effort in 30 minutes against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lakers ran off six in a row on the road, with the only
serious threat being a nationally televised victory at Philadelphia
during which Kobe Bryant shut down Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Commendably, the New York Knicks responded to an NAACP boycott
of South Carolina by pulling their training camp site at the
College of Charleston as long as the Confederate battle flag flies
atop the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Georgia Tech star Stephon Marbury was brilliant amid a
consistent chorus of boos in his return to Minnesota after forcing
a trade to New Jersey last season. Marbury had 39 points in a rare
Nets road win. ``I just have fun on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   _ With the Hawks unable to move Isaiah Rider before Thursday's
trade deadline, it bears watching what the club will do with the
talented but troublesome shooting guard. They have considered
releasing Rider, an idea that might gain momentum if he continues
to be the kind of distraction that has affected the team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Milwaukee coach George Karl just might blow a gasket _ or
strangle a player _ if the Bucks continue their recent fall. They
dropped all the way to eighth in the conference by losing seven of
10 games, including four in a row. Two of those defeats came at
lowly Washington and at home to awful Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toni Kukoc makes his first return to Chicago as a Philadelphia
76er on Saturday. It will be interesting to see the reaction Kukoc
gets, as he was a key part of the Bulls' last three titles but not
as integral as Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING SPREE
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the league's best and worst bargains among NBA
players this season (relatively speaking, of course):
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, Indiana: $2,437,500 _ Bargain
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley, Dallas: $7,560,000 _ Overpriced
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor, L.A. Clippers: $1,367,400 _ Bargain
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, Milwaukee: $3,750,000 _ Overpriced
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, New York: $11,910,714 _ Overpriced
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers, Phoenix: $2,000,000 _ Bargain
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker, Seattle: $9,000,000 _ Overpriced

<P>
   ATLANTA _ How about the Vancouver Grizzlies, where the next
owner has his own guys scouting, sometimes double-booking games
where current general manager Stu Jackson already has scouts on
site? Dick Versace, the so-called consultant hired by incoming
owner Michael Heisley, has put together a shadow scouting staff
that already is scouting college games. Versace's team of scouts
has Grizzlies' personnel arranging credentials. One of the most
recent examples was last Sunday when Cincinnati played Temple.
Larry Riley, Vancouver's director of player personnel, was on hand
for the Grizzlies. But Mitchell Anderson, a former NBA player who
played for Versace at Bradley University, also was accredited.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jason Caffey of Golden State did not want to be moved before
the trade deadline, and certainly not to Milwaukee. On Wednesday,
report published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the
Warriors were talking to the Bucks about a possible trade involving
Caffey. Caffey did not want to go to the Bucks _ under any
circumstances _ and made it known after his team beat the Bucks
91-86 in Milwaukee. ``There's no way I want to come to Milwaukee,''
Caffey said. ``I called my wife last night, and she started crying
when I told her about Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pat Riley's honeymoon in Miami is over. He is getting bashed
on radio call-in shows for stubbornly refusing to even consider
deals for non-scoring forward P.J. Brown. One columnist labeled
Riley's master plan a failure and called on him to start over: Keep
Alonzo Mourning and trade everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Kevin Garnett played a game-high 35 minutes in the
All-Star game Feb. 13, Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said he was
going to try to find time to rest Garnett. Over his last five
games, however, Garnett has logged 45, 40, 41, 46 and 40 minutes.
He averages 40.1 minutes a game, sixth in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the excise tax of 2002 killed the trade market _ no
surprise with the cap scheduled to go to $35.5 million for 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   _ Portland leads the league with a salary-cap total of
$73,898,705, with New York second at $71,340,801. The Indiana
Pacers are third at $54,158,605 and the Lakers fourth at
$54,123,533. The tax will be assessed at $1 for every $1 over the
cap.

NOTHING COMES BETWEEN GARCIAPARRA AND HIS GLOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ This is a glove story, and as such, it
contains the usual elements: passion, romance, heartbreak, and
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my baby,'' Nomar Garciaparra said, nuzzling his cheek
against his glove while a photographer shot away. ``I'm going to go
to sleep with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding (we think) about the glove occupying the pillow
beside him. But say this for the Red Sox shortstop: He's faithful
to a fault. Let someone else opt for younger, fresher, sexier, more
supple. Garciaparra doesn't even look at the new models.
</P>
<P>
   His glove is all about wrinkles and worry lines, comfort and
familiarity. It's the very definition of age over beauty, the
lived-in over the never-touched.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the glove peddlers appear at spring training camps,
showing off the latest fashions in leatherwear. Saturday morning,
the Rawlings people were here. Most players have a contract with a
glove company. Garciaparra? He's been using the same worn piece of
leather since his sophomore year at Georgia Tech, eight years ago.
And he protects it jealously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody touches my glove,'' Garciaparra said. ``You can't put
your hand in my glove. You can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This glove, Garciaparra only wears in games. He has a backup
just as old. Something breaks, a lace comes undone, or the webbing
frays, Garciaparra fixes it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it lying around? Perish the thought. Garciaparra never
takes his game glove out of the Sox' clubhouse during batting
practice. His glove sits beside him on the bench. His backup glove,
he places under the dugout bench _ in the exact same place _ before
every game.
</P>
<P>
   See him between pitches out on the field? He's always biting on
the dangling laces of his glove. They're for his lips only.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even make my glove anymore,'' Garciaparra said of
the SSK infielder's glove he wears. ``You're not going to find one
anywhere. You won't find the same leather. They don't use it
anymore. Even if you found a similar model, they use a different
tanner, different leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find a glove you're comfortable with, you stick with it. I
make my living with this glove. The model number? N-O-M-A-R.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz was like that. Carl Yastrzemski used the same glove almost
his whole career. Sox hitting coach Jim Rice now has Yaz's glove.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin is another one. The Sox third baseman has been
using the same Mizuno glove for eight years, too. It doesn't look
like it has the same mileage as Garciaparra's, but that's because
this used to be Val's backup model. The glove he used to use, the
one he first wore in the minor leagues in 1990 and with which he
turned an unassisted triple play against the Mariners in 1994, that
one was stolen the following year.
</P>
<P>
   It still pains Valentin to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triple play glove, it was in my Toyota Land Cruiser,''
Valentin said. ``They stole the car in New Jersey, right out of my
in-laws' driveway. My biggest loss that day? The glove, without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin covers the outside of his glove with pine tar. Why?
``Because at night, there's dew on the grass and the ball gets
wet,'' he said. ``It helps me with my grip. I learned that from
(ex-Sox catcher) Tony Pena.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox outfielder Darren Lewis changes his glove every other year.
``I don't want my glove too loose, because I don't want the ball
popping out of my glove,'' he said. ``Outfielders, we're a little
different than infielders. A lot of times we're running full
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has a Gold Glove for defensive excellence, shares a
little secret about his Rawlings glove: ``If you're a Gold Glover,
they use a little better leather,'' he said. ``It's not the same
leather as other gloves. It's like if you're a home run or batting
champion. The wood they use for your bats is a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rowe is the Red Sox trainer, a line of work he first got
into in 1985, when he was trainer for Beloit (Wis.) in the Single-A
Midwest League. When you're a trainer in the lower minors, you do
more than tend to ankle sprains and pulled muscles. You become the
glove doctor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have equipment managers in the minor leagues,''
Rowe said. ``The trainer does that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows all the tricks. ``Little quirky things,'' he said,
``like breaking a glove in by dipping it into the whirlpool, then
sticking it in a dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players cover their glove in Alboline, a hand cleanser used
for massages, then stick it in a dryer. Others opt for the
microwave. Not a good idea, Rowe said. ``It cooks the laces. Take
it out of the microwave, and it snaps all the laces. Plus there's
metal in gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players have been known to place their gloves in a
hot-pack machine. There's a pounding tool, often a metal ball or
even a baseball attached to a rod, which is used to whack the
pocket of a glove. ``Some guys just look for the biggest bat they
can find and pound the heck out of their gloves,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Those big first baseman's mitts? Rowe will often cut a sheet of
orthoplastic _ the kind he uses to make pads _ place it in the
glove, then sew it up. Catcher's mitts, which take such a pounding,
require constant TLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason (Varitek) always takes care of his own,'' Rowe said.
``He's very self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Repair tools to tighten the laces or repair a broken one?
There's a darning needle, of course, a threader, a hemostat (the
instrument doctors use to put in sutures), and an Army survival
tool _ ``You know, the kind that has pliers, a hole punch, a can
opener, and a leather punch,'' Rowe said. ``I've got a zipper bag
with 15 years' worth of stuff in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are definite rules of etiquette in one's glove life. ``You
never put your hand in someone's glove unless you ask him,'' Rowe
said. ``You have to respect that there's a perfect hand fit there
after someone's taken so many ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rowe said, there's a special relationship between a player
and his glove. ``Some guys never want to give up their glove until
it's ready to fall apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever known a player to name his glove? Rowe laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anyone who has ever told about it,'' Rowe said. ``But I'm
sure there have been.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ With Race 3 at hand and a wind building
over the Hauraki Gulf course Friday, the competing boats _ and the
men who steer them _ headed out for what was a crucial race.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Italians won and been down just one race in the
best-of-nine series, reason to believe in ``Pradamania'' would have
lived. But when Team New Zealand won by 1 minute 39 seconds to take
a 3-0 lead, it became the Force _ inevitable, insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   The skippers, Russell Coutts and Francesco de Angelis, face very
different circumstances, and do so with contrasting styles and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Where de Angelis is quiet and sometimes so calm that teammates
wish he would say more to direct them, Coutts is sometimes brash,
diffident, and even cantankerous to a press corps he finds
irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: After Race 1, Coutts and tactician Brad
Butterworth decided to pass the postrace news conference. Instead,
crew members Simon Daubney and Warwick Fleury appeared before an
outraged press corps that demanded to know where the top guns were.
</P>
<P>
   After Race 2, Coutts appeared with Butterworth and very quickly
snarled at the press for putting such demands on them. ``We are a
team,'' said Coutts, ``anyone from Team New Zealand represents us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The guffaws were audible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, watching from his place on the dais was de Angelis, a
tall, slim figure. De Angelis and tactician Torben Grael have been
at every postrace press conference since the Cup began in October.
But asked later about his thoughts on Coutts's intransigence, de
Angelis would not rise to the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no opinion. He does what he thinks is best for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends _ and the Italian public _ call de Angelis ``Il
Barone'' because of his cultured ways and unflappable style. A
student of biology, de Angelis, 39, did not start sailing until he
was a teenager, and then became fanatical, his friends say.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 27, he won the J-24 Worlds and went on to win
five World Championships. As a young sailor trying to improve his
technique, a coach once told him: ``Train, train, train, and don't
speak. I have achieved goals for 20 years without speaking
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This shows a contrast to American rival Paul Cayard, who in one
race during the semifinals seemed to have shouted the loudest to
the on-board umpires and caused a foul to be called in the Italian
boat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, de Angelis has sailed with Cayard and was working on
his Whitbread round-the-world campaign before Prada syndicate boss
Patrizio Bertelli approached him with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Having never match-raced in his life, he was paired with Grael,
a three-time Olympic champion, and the two have formed an
inseparable partnership in the cockpit of Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, US Cup veteran Rod Davis was brought on to coach
the two on match-racing moves _ a kind of high-speed chess game on
the water between 25-ton yachts. Because he is a perfectionist who
overlooks nothing, Davis said, de Angelis has been a fast study.
But mistakes in this game are glaring. When they come, said Davis:
``It's like watching your kids play soccer. Sometimes you just have
to look away and ask later what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis and wife Corinna have two children attending school
in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts sometimes gets so focused with sailing that he becomes
oblivious to people around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes think I'm deaf,'' he said, ``but I'm just
thinking about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts has been on the radar screen of New Zealand sailing
heavies since he was a child. Twice he was World Youth Sailing
champion, and at age 22, he won an Olympic gold medal. That was two
years before his country's first assault on the America's Cup, then
being sailed in Fremantle, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Coutts was the heir apparent to Chris Dickson,
and moved easily into the backup skipper's role in 1992, then into
the skipper's role in 1995 _ the year Team New Zealand won the most
lopsided America's Cup series in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do a lot of thinking before a race,'' said Coutts.
``I'm not just trying to focus. I prepare for a race by
visualizing. We're a bit older, and I have learned a lot in the
last four years. But I'm a little more tolerant now than I was
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, 37, believes this may be his last Cup. ``Life is not a
training run. I'll do this while I enjoy it. You should only do
things while you're having fun.''

SOX HAVE PLACE FOR TWINS ACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Brad Radke is 27 years old, big, strong,
durable, and dependable. Three years ago, he was a 20-game winner.
In each of the last two seasons, playing for one of the bottom
feeders in the American League, he won a dozen games, and last
season in 218 2/3 innings he had a 3.75 ERA, fourth best in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Radke is eligible for free agency after this season. He and
agent Ron Simon have broken off negotiations with his current
employer, the Minnesota Twins, because the team refuses to allow
Radke the right to demand a trade after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Radke is in Fort Myers, Fla., on the other side of town from the
Red Sox camp, knowing one more veteran starting pitcher might be
the piece to put Boston over the top against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox Nation to Dan Duquette: Make the deal now, if not
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Were it only so simple. For one, the Twins have not abandoned
hope they can sign Radke. The sides reportedly are $5 million
apart, with the Twins' last offer at three years, $21 million, and
Radke seeking three years at $26 million. Twins general manager
Terry Ryan has said he won't budge on the no-trade language; Simon
has said he can't make a deal without it. ``I can't put him with a
team that might be pathetic for four years,'' he said when talks
broke off.
</P>
<P>
   Simon is in Fort Myers, which is just a coincidence, according
to Ryan. ``He has a vacation home and he comes down here every
spring,'' Ryan said. ``But I suspect we'll talk while he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke is not commenting.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Ryan can't get the extension done, he is not tipping
his hand. ``It's not something I wish to discuss publicly,'' he
said. ``There's going to be talk about a guy like Radke who has had
that type of success, but ultimately it comes down to what are we
going to do, and that I'm not willing to discuss publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins are your classic small-market, low-budget team. They
have had seven consecutive losing seasons. They lost 97 games last
season using 17 rookies, often starting six. They had a $16 million
budget, a fifth of what the Yankees spend. Radke gives Minnesota a
legitimate ace, but with an extension, he also would blow the
budget, and gain all the leverage with a right-to-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins have reasons to do a deal. But the Red Sox are hardly
alone in their interest. The Reds, Devil Rays, Rockies, A's, Mets,
and Phillies have been mentioned as suitors. When the Sox talked to
the Twins at the winter meetings, the price for Radke was deemed
too high by at least one Sox official. ``If we had given them what
Terry wanted, we wouldn't have a farm system left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That would suggest the Twins are asking for a Dernell Stenson in
return, or a Wilton Veras or Steve Lomasney, or all of the above.
It probably will take at least three players to make a deal. The
Sox could put together a package that would include one or two arms
out of the Brian Rose/Juan Pena/Tomo Ohka/Sunny Kim mix, plus a
position player or two.
</P>
<P>
   Even that might not be enough to make the deal this spring. Ryan
will play his suitors off one another, knowing he can wait until
the July trading deadline when even more clubs might be in the hunt
for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the silver lining for Sox fans: Everybody wanted Pedro
Martinez, too, and Duquette was able to offer the right combination
(Carl Pavano, Tony Armas Jr.) to Montreal. Can he do the same this
spring? Don't bet against it.
</P>
<P>
   More swap talk
</P>
<P>
   The John Rocker trade rumors won't go away. The latest is Rocker
to the Devil Rays for closer Roberto Hernandez, or Rocker and
lefthander Bruce Chen to the Expos for closer Ugueth Urbina and
Pavano. The Indians, who come into the season projecting Paul Shuey
as the closer _ he's the guy who gave up Troy O'Leary's
tie-breaking, three-run home run in the deciding game of the
Sox-Tribe division series _ are also said to have interest in
Rocker. The sentiment in the Braves' clubhouse is that Rocker will
be dealt . . . The Mariners haven't abandoned their pursuit of
Angels outfielder Jim Edmonds, but may have widened talks to
include Garret Anderson . . . Rockies GM Dan O'Dowd acknowledged
that the Angels called to see if Colorado has interest in Edmonds
in exchange for a starting pitcher . . . The Rangers reportedly
have interest in Mets lefthanded reliever Dennis Cook . . . Looking
the part: Who says the Reds aren't sensitive to the fashion tastes
of incoming players? When Deion Sanders first arrived in 1997, he
coaxed the team into cutting its sleeves and wearing a vest. Last
season, when Greg Vaughn came from San Diego, the team permitted
facial hair. And now, with the arrival of Ken Griffey Jr., earrings
will be allowed for the first time. No danglers, please. Studs
only. Hal McCoy of the Dayton Daily News notes that it was former
Reds owner Marge Schott who once proclaimed: ``Only fruits wear
earrings.'' Catcher Eddie Taubensee, for one, doesn't plan to take
advantage of the chance to get his ears pierced. ``I'm not going to
wear one, even though my wife has some nice ones in her jewelry
box,'' he said. ``It would be hard for pitchers to take a catcher
seriously when he is wearing an earring.'' Meanwhile, new managers
Buddy Bell (Rockies) and Don Baylor (Cubs) are tightening the rules
in their clubhouses. The Rockies once again will wear sport coats
and slacks when they travel. No beards. No jewelry on the field.
Clubhouse games of cards and dominoes must end an hour before
players are to be in uniform. Golf clubs will not be allowed on
road trips, unless there is an off day during the trip. And players
are expected to be on the top step of the dugout when the National
Anthem is played. In Chicago, some of Baylor's rules include no
cutoffs or gym shorts at the ballpark, no scraggly goatees or
beards, and no baseball caps worn backward, a la Griffey. ``This
club is very visible and appearance has a lot to do with things,''
Baylor said. ``To me, it's part of attitude. Look professional.
Look like you're a major league player, not a rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed signals
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Boston's camp, where Duquette and Jimy Williams took
Martinez's late arrival in stride, Baylor is irked by Sammy Sosa's
absence. Sosa said he was stricken with the flu while in Las Vegas
for a home run hitting contest, then returned to the Dominican
Republic. He was scheduled to arrive in Arizona Sunday. ``It is a
big deal,'' Baylor said last week. ``I imagine a lot of guys in
that room probably care. You don't want to put one guy before the
team.'' Yet, Sosa being AWOL didn't keep Baylor from naming
Sluggin' Sammy one of four team captains, joining Mark Grace, Rick
Aguilera, and Kevin Tapani . . . No player heard his name connected
to trade rumors more in the last several years in LA than first
baseman Eric Karros, which is why it came as a great relief last
week when the Dodgers gave him a three-year, $24 million contract.
The deal includes a no-trade clause for the first two years. By
that time, he will be a 10-5 player (10 years in the big leagues,
at least five with the same team), which entitles him to veto any
trade. He agreed to waive that provision for peace of mind. With 34
home runs and 112 RBIs last season, Karros ranked behind only Mark
McGwire, Jeff Bagwell, and Todd Helton among National League first
basemen. Karros has 211 lifetime home runs; 18 more and he passes
Ron Cey as the leading home run hitter in LA Dodgers history . . .
Slump-ridden White Sox slugger Frank Thomas has brought former Red
Sox hitting coach Walt Hriniak to camp to help him break out a
two-year funk. The White Sox also have Paul Konerko taking ground
balls at third. Manager Jerry Manuel says he could play there in
certain matchups. Konerko is a first baseman, but played a full
season at third in the Dodgers' system three years ago . . . With
Darryl Strawberry almost certain to be bounced for at least a year
after his latest drug test, The King, Jim Leyritz, will get more
at-bats as the Yankees' designated hitter. Leyritz had offseason
surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder.
Ideally, the Yanks would like a lefthanded hitter in that spot, but
right now, only switch-hitting Tim Raines, who is 40 and recovering
from lupus, fits that profile. Shane Spencer also figures in the
mix for the Yankees, who are not inclined to rush top first base
prospect Nick Johnson. Johnson hit .345 at Norwich (Eastern League)
last season. The Yankees haven't exactly leaned on their DH the
last two seasons. They ranked 10th in DH RBIs last season, and
eighth the year before . . . Mets pitcher Bill Pulsipher, who had
an unexplained collapse that left him unconscious on his bathroom
floor Wednesday, admitted he takes a dietary supplement without the
team's knowledge. He also said he uses the antidepressant Prozac .
. . San Diego GM Kevin Towers, who helped take the Padres to two
division titles and a World Series, then had to take the team apart
because of financial considerations, has been rewarded with a
three-year contract extension through 2003. Towers's latest deal
was for outfielder Al Martin, who comes from the Pirates and will
be asked to bat leadoff for San Diego. The Pirates dumped Martin's
salary, allowing them to install Wil Cordero in left field and
highly touted prospect Chad Hermansen in right. Hermansen hit 32
home runs for Nashville (Triple A) last season . . . McGwire was
more than happy to see public attention shift from his home run
exploits to Griffey. ``When the (Griffey) trade was done, I
thought, `Now, I can sit back and blend in,' '' McGwire said . . .
Braves manager Bobby Cox didn't know Steve Avery was out of a job
until pitcher John Smoltz mentioned it last weekend. A few days
later, the Braves signed Avery to a minor league deal. Avery
pitched two seasons for the Sox, spent last year with Cincinnati,
and is coming off arthroscopic shoulder surgery . . . The Phillies
are happy that first baseman Rico Brogna, only a month after
arthroscopic knee surgery, has been cleared to play when the
exhibition season begins this week. Less encouraging was the news
that closer Mike Jackson, released by the Indians after last season
because they thought he might break down, had sore knees after two
days of fielding drills.
</P>
<P>
   Good soldier
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, upon arrival in Angels camp: ``I'm excited about this
team. I heard all this stuff about me wanting to get traded, but
I've never not finished something I started. We're going to get
this right here. I'm not about to jump ship. I hope there wasn't a
perception that I'm not happy to be here.'' That may be so, but
former teammate Chuck Finley, for one, says the Angels would love
to dump Vaughn and his $80 million salary. Vaughn told reporters he
wasn't worried about the shaky state of the franchise. ``It doesn't
matter what direction this franchise is going. I have nothing to do
with that,'' he said. ``I'm not a general manager. I'm here to play
the game and that's it.'' . . . Pencil in former Sox pitcher Jamie
Moyer as Pedro's opponent when the Sox open against the Mariners in
Seattle April 4. Mariners manager Lou Piniella already announced
that Moyer is his pick. This will be the first time since Erik
Hanson in 1991 that Seattle's Opening Day starter will be someone
other than Randy Johnson, who started the Mariners' first game from
1992 through '96 and in '98, or Jeff Fassero, who pitched the
opener in 1997 and 1999 . . . Lefthander Justin Thompson, a main
component in the deal that sent Juan Gonzalez from Texas to
Detroit, almost certainly will begin the season on the disabled
list. Thompson had arthroscopic shoulder surgery in August and the
Rangers plan to bring him along slowly this spring . . . The latest
bidder to buy the Royals is Facundo Bacardi, the great-great-great
grandson of the liquor family. Bacardi, 33, doesn't have deep ties
to the community, or to the Royals. He was born in Chicago, grew up
in Florida, lives in Atlanta, and only last week paid his first
visit to Kauffman Stadium. He insists he has no plans of moving the
team if he succeeds in buying the club. WalMart magnate David Glass
remains the front-runner to buy the Royals . . . Orioles second
baseman Delino DeShields came off the top rope with this quote
aimed at fired manager Ray Miller: ``I've played for probably the
best manager in baseball, Felipe Alou,'' DeShields said, ``and I've
played for maybe the worst one.'' . . . The Blue Jays took David
Wells behind closed doors after the irrepressible one was quoted as
saying the club had received ``crap'' in offseason trades,
especially the one in which they shipped former Cy Young Award
winner Pat Hentgen to the Cardinals. Manager Jim Fregosi said he
was concerned at how Wells's comments would affect the fans,
especially with the Blue Jays already taking a PR hit for dealing
All-Star outfielder Shawn Green. Wells had nothing to say after the
meeting. Said Fregosi: ``We did not muzzle him. We don't operate
that way.''

CLARKE GIVES DUVAL A JOLT, AND WILL FACE WOODS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Darren Clarke is the last man standing
between Tiger Woods and another conquest.
</P>
<P>
   After two victories Saturday, including a 5-and-4 pummeling of
Davis Love III in the semifinals of the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship, Woods stormed into Sunday's 36-hole championship
match. Clarke, the No. 19 seed from Northern Ireland, became Woods'
unexpected opponent in the final by beating David Duval, 4 and 2,
in the other semifinal match, spoiling a showdown between Woods and
Duval, the world's top two ranked players.
</P>
<P>
   While Clarke hopes for an upset Sunday at La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa,
he will face a daunting obstacle in Woods, who looked primed to win
for the third time this year and for the seventh time since last
August. After squeaking past Paul Lawrie, 1-up, in a difficult
quarterfinal morning match, Woods showed Love the exit door with a
dominant performance that left Love no chance.
</P>
<P>
   How good was Woods? On the front nine, he had an eagle and four
birdies. And on the back nine, he added another eagle set up by an
extraordinary shot, a 6-iron out of the rough from 221 yards that
he intentionally hooked, working the ball through an alley between
two trees and onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   After making a slight swing adjustment between his morning and
afternoon matches, Woods put on a devastating display, the world's
best performing at his best. And if Woods remains on top of his
game Sunday, Clarke may feel as helpless as Love felt Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tiger Woods is at his best, nobody in the world can beat
him, and the other players know it,'' said Butch Harmon, Woods'
coach, who also coaches Clarke. ``That's not a put-down of the
other players. He's just that much better than everyone else. That
was textbook golf this afternoon. When he plays his best, he's
unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval would have loved an opportunity to beat Woods, but Clarke
did not cooperate, showing why he has been a member of Europe's
last two Ryder Cup teams. Clarke never trailed against Duval,
taking the lead for good on No. 5 after hitting his approach shot
to four feet, which set up a birdie. Clarke went 2-up on No. 10,
hitting another superb approach shot to five feet, then making
birdie. On the next hole, Clarke went 3-up when he made another
eight-footer for birdie, and Duval could see where their match was
headed.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 13, Duval slammed his club into the ground after pulling
an approach shot, and then after missing the following 25-foot
putt, Duval kicked the ground in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between his 5-and-4 victory over Scott Hoch in the
morning and his match against Clarke, Duval lost his sharpness. He
made only one birdie against Clarke, and most of Duval's approach
shots were off target, leaving him long putts for birdie that he
failed to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nobody to blame but myself,'' he said. ``I didn't get
it close enough to the hole.'' Asked if he was looking forward to a
potential match against Woods, Duval said: ``I wasn't foolish
enough to look past Darren. I'm familiar with his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, seeded fourth, was confident entering his match with Woods
after defeating Miguel Angel Jimenez, 3 and 2, in a morning
quarterfinal match. But Love could not elevate his game to Woods'
level.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods felt pressure in the morning, falling 2 down to Lawrie
through 11 holes before be rallied by winning three consecutive
holes to take the lead for good. Lawrie, the reigning British Open
champion, will remember this match for a while. He had a legitimate
chance to oust Woods, who continually missed fairways and was not
at his best. And Lawrie also received a major break on the 10th
hole, when Woods lost the hole on a penalty, the most bizarre
moment of the day.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his drive on No. 10 into the right rough
underneath a tree, Woods clipped the branch on his backswing as he
attempted to hit the ball. Woods stopped in midswing as a pine cone
fell on the back of his head. A rules official arrived, and Woods
explained what had happened. At that point, it would have been
unfair for Woods to take another swing, because the branch that he
hit had been moved. Woods was informed that in match play, the
penalty for his infraction was loss of hole _ a bad break for Woods
and a gift for Lawrie. Already 1-up, Lawrie moved 2-up, fueling the
chance of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods regrouped with a key par-saving putt of six feet on
No. 11, then he won No. 12 with a birdie. At that point, Lawrie
began to stumble, and he made bogey at No. 13 and No. 14, and that
quickly, Woods had the lead again. On No. 17, Lawrie failed on a
late opportunity to tie the match when he missed an 18-foot birdie
attempt that slid just past the hole. The match ended on the par-4
18th hole, when both players made par after Lawrie hit a poor
second shot that sailed into the right rough.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, 31, showed resiliency Saturday, winning a difficult
morning match against Hal Sutton, 1-up, a match in which Clarke was
3-down after four holes. But the 36-hole final will test the
stamina of Clarke, who is overweight. ``All that working out in the
off-season is going to pay off,'' Clarke said in jest, patting his
stomach. ``I better play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon has urged Clarke to lose weight, and he hoped this
encounter would push Clarke toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren is going to be a great player, but he'd be even better
if I could get him to lose 20 pounds,'' Harmon said. ``I think this
experience will help motivate Darren.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke acknowledged that it would take more than motivation
to defeat Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the world; that's pretty obvious to
everybody,'' Clarke said. ``I'm going to have to play particularly
well to beat him.''

NHL HAS LEVERAGE IN THIS OLYMPIC MATCHUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest snag in getting NHLers back to the Olympics in 2002
is a last-minute arm twist by the Russians, Czechs, Swedes, and
Finns to get more money from the league for the players they lose.
If they don't, the Euros are threatening to keep their NHLers out
of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The league says it will be happy to talk money when the
agreement with the international federation ends next year. ``But
we will not be blackmailed,'' said NHL spokesman Frank Brown. ``The
Olympics are the Olympics, and transfer fees are transfer fees.
They're separate issues. There is a left hand and a right hand, and
they will not shake.''
</P>
<P>
   League commissioner Gary Bettman said as much to IIHF president
Rene Fasel when they met in New York earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the NHL doesn't have to give the Europeans
compensation, and both sides know it. And the league has more
immediate leverage: It can keep its players out of this year's
World Championships to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting edge
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A for how goofy figure skating rules have become is
15-year-old Sasha Cohen, who now has to win a medal at next week's
Junior World Championships to compete in the real World
Championships at the end of the month. Because she turned the
minimum age of 15 after last year's July 1 cut-off date, Cohen
needs to fit through the loophole that allows junior medalists to
compete regardless of age (which is how Sarah Hughes was eligible
at 14 last year). The whole point of the age rule is to limit the
physical and psychological demands on young girls. In fact, it
increases the demands by nearly doubling the number of events they
must skate. If the International Skating Union had its way, Cohen
would have been in Japan last week for the Four Continents event
before heading to Germany for the world juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Goofy ISU rules aren't limited to figure skating. The
federation's format for the World All-Around Speedskating
Championships is so bizarre as to be inexplicable. Only 12 skaters
get to compete in the final event (the 5,000 for women, the 10,000
for men), but they aren't necessarily the top 12 after three
events, since the ISU gives extra weight to the results of the
3,000/5,000 to protect Europeans who don't sprint well. That's how
US skater Derek Parra was bumped from this month's final in
Milwaukee even though he ranked 11th. And how Switzerland's Martin
Feigenwinter (who was 24th in two races) and Germany's Frank
Dittrich (22d and 23d) made it. ``That's just the way the rules
are,'' shrugged Parra. ``We knew that coming in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Speeding up process
</P>
<P>
   With Christine Witty back on form after a miserable autumn, the
United States has an outside chance for a medal at the World Sprint
Speedskating Championships in Seoul, where Canada's Jeremy
Wotherspoon and Germany's Monique Garbrecht are favored to retain
their crowns. Odds are better, though, that she'll make the podium
in the 1,000 at next weekend's single-distance championships in
Nagano. Same odds for the short-trackers at Saturday's world team
championships, where the Americans haven't won a medal since 1996.
The US squad includes Brookline's Dan Weinstein, Natick's Caroline
Hallisey, and Arlington's Sarah Lang . . . Harrowing tumble for
14-year-old Naomi Nari Nam, who finished eighth at the US
Championships after finishing second to Michelle Kwan last year.
That not only puts her out of contention for next season's Grand
Prix, it cost her an assumed berth on the US Junior World
Championships team, which will include Jennifer Kirk of Newton, the
best local women's prospect since Nancy Kerrigan . . . It's
rubber-room time for US bobsledder Brian Shimer. After missing an
Olympic four-man bronze at Nagano by .02 seconds, Shimer missed a
world bronze this month by .04. After seemingly having a medal
locked up, Shimer aggravated a calf injury and ended up eighth in
the last of four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the team?
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympic trials in Boston less than six months off, the
USA Gymnastics people still haven't finalized their selection
process for the team. Part of the problem is the Aug. 25 roster
deadline and unresolved questions about how late alternates can be
subbed. ``We want the best team on the floor,'' said federation
president Bob Colarossi . . . The controversial computer-scoring
system used in amateur boxing could be on the way out, as a growing
number of fighters and coaches claim the results often bear little
resemblance to scoring punches thrown. The most recent plaintiffs
are brothers Glenn and Nonito Donaire, who staged a sit-down strike
in the ring at the US Olympic trials in Tampa after both lost to
light flyweight world champ Brian Viloria. ``I know how to use the
computer,'' said Viloria with a shrug. Critics claim the judges,
many of them golden agers, are too slow to push the button that
registers points. USA Boxing agrees and will push to have the
system scrapped. The irony is, the computer was brought in largely
because US light middleweight Roy Jones Jr. got jobbed in the 1988
Olympic finals . . . After sweeping past the Poles and Czechs and
various club teams in last month's European tour, the US Olympic
women's basketball team heads to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro next
month to take on Sydney medal contenders Brazil and Cuba. The
Americans are 26-1 since September, the only loss coming in
November to the Tennessee varsity in Knoxville . . . By his hat ye
shall know him: golfer Greg Norman will be one of the 10,000
bearers for the Olympic torch relay for Sydney, along with
109-year-old Jack Lockett, Australia's oldest man. The Salt Lake
City relay will be the longest in Winter Games history _ 14,000
miles, with 11,000 bearers over more than two months . . . Why is
the international table tennis federation making the ball bigger?
To make the game more telegenic. The difference is from 1.5 to 1.6
inches in diameter.

PITINO PUTS CAP ON TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, sports fans, what you see is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were one of 27 teams that made no moves last week,
and Rick Pitino sounds as if he is going to stick with what he has.
It will go against his history to do so, but he only had to look at
what was happening in the East to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this team,'' he said. ``I don't think we're far away.
We are going to have to add to this team to be a little more
athletic, a little bit better at the defensive end. But I don't
think it's anything major. We do have to make improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   That's another way of saying you're capped out, which the
Celtics are, and don't have many tradeable assets, which also is
the case. The team is painfully young, which is the way Pitino
built it, and the NBA is a league that devours its young.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Celtics simply are not a very good team. The
alternative to making trades is to keep on growing, as Derek &AMP; the
Dominoes once sang, and hope things get better. It will take
patience and perseverance, two of Pitino's favorite words these
days, and that's not even a lock. But that's the course he
apparently has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Celtics) are still a fairly young team,'' Scottie
Pippen said when Boston passed through Portland. ``They're not
going to have the patience to work, thinking they're going to crack
us.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But Portland, like most of the good teams, is in the
Western Conference. As Pitino noted, ``the East is not like the
West. You add one or two players to a team in the East, and you can
make major improvements. Look at what Philadelphia did with (Toni)
Kukoc. Any number of teams can say that. It's a lot better to be in
the East.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent tumult in the conference supports this. The top three
teams are Indiana, Miami, and New York. In two years, those teams
could be falling hard. Milwaukee is in a horrible skid; it has lost
at home to Vancouver and Golden State and plays even worse defense
than the Celtics do. Detroit will have to convince Grant Hill it's
worth sticking around for the long term, and its argument is pretty
skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Philadelphia and Orlando look to be
contenders for some time (provided the Magic hit pay dirt this
summer), and there's always the Bulls, who, lest we forget, are 2-0
against the Celtics this season with basically a CBA roster.
They've got money to spend as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has taken a lot of (justifiable) heat for continually
tinkering with the roster. It's hard to build anything when it's
constantly being taken apart. He made his bed. For once, he's
decided to sleep in it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothin' doin'
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, David Stern is smiling. Somewhere else, David Falk is
not smiling and is thinking, ``I told you so.'' The glacial
movement last week as the trading deadline came and went spoke
louder than any trade talk regarding how teams have their hands
tied by the new collective bargaining agreement. One deal was made:
a third-string point guard (Anthony Johnson) was dealt to Orlando
for a conditional second-round pick. The league wanted an agreement
that enabled clubs to keep their own players. It got that. But with
the restrictions in the document, it also got something else: a
situation in which teams can't move players they don't want.
``David Stern is happy,'' Pitino said after the deadline passed
and, for his first time as el jefe of hoops in Boston, he did
nothing. ``With the cap and the rules, you have fewer people
changing uniforms. That's what he wanted, and that's what he's
getting.'' Restricted player movement is, of course, precisely what
Falk and his minions said would happen with this agreement. Players
who may have had a certain marketplace value in the old system _
Danny Fortson, for instance _ are going to find the money is either
not there or only partly there. In addition to the cap regulations,
there also is the luxury tax on the horizon. Outside of a few
deep-pockets guys, most owners are not going to want to spend money
if it triggers the tax, which is still more than a year away. The
result was the slowest trading deadline in 13 years, reminiscent of
the days when there was no true free agency. There is now, in name
only. But the players aren't the only ones who will find the doors
closed. Teams such as Cleveland (Shawn Kemp) and Washington
(everyone) will find it just as difficult to move players for all
of the above reasons. Not even the wizardry of Michael Jordan is
going to change that . . . Something we didn't think possible might
actually happen: This year's Clippers team might be the worst in
the franchise's illustrious history. The benchmark is the 12-70
unit of 1986-87. Having already won 11 games, this year's squad may
be able to squeeze out two more wins. And if this year's team is
bad, can you imagine next year's? Listen to what two key soon-to-be
free agents, Mo Taylor and Derek Anderson, had to say. Both wanted
out. Neither got his wish. Taylor: ``I was kind of pressing my
luck, relying on the Clippers to get something done. There's no
love lost. I can play the final eight weeks.'' And then there's
Anderson: ``I can't wait to get out of here. Same old story. Things
are so bad right now.'' Taylor was so convinced he was going to the
Knicks as part of a three-way deal that he stayed on the team bus
in Minneapolis until the trading deadline expired. Falk said there
would be ``several teams'' willing to pay the $71 million maximum
for Taylor. We'll see about that. The Clippers and the Bulls were
the two teams significantly under the cap that could have
facilitated things. (Orlando has to wait until August). Said
Toronto coach Butch Carter, ``It doesn't help when the two teams
that can help are impossible to deal with.'' Don't be surprised if
the Celtics make a move for Anderson, who could fit in well and
played for Pitino at Kentucky. They only have the middle-class
exception to offer, but Anderson may have to settle for that . . .
Fortson certainly went from disposable to indispensable in a hurry,
didn't he? The Celtics' excuse of signability in dealing Fortson
was nonsense; how can it be when they haven't even talked? If they
can't re-sign him, it's because of poor budgeting, not Fortson's
unstated demands. But at the same time, Fortson's agent, Raymond
Brothers, needs an introduction to Reality 101, NBA style.
Brothers's main experience is in football; Fortson is his only NBA
client. And while Brothers is absolutely correct about Fortson's
worth vis-a-vis Tony Battie, it's irrelevant. Fortson has no chance
to get that kind of money ($25 million) on the open market. None.
There are three teams with any kind of money to spend: Chicago,
which doesn't need a power forward; the Clippers, who don't know
how to spend their money; and the Magic, who have their eyes on
bigger things. Fortson, basically, is a middle-class exception
waiting to happen. That's not fair. But that's life. He may take a
little less for guaranteed minutes, something he will never have in
Boston. But if he's in it for the dollars, the Celtics may well be
his best _ and only _ shot. In that respect, it's hardly a gamble.
It's just hard to understand why the Celtics felt they couldn't
re-sign him when they know the market, too.
</P>
<P>
   Good guy reward
</P>
<P>
   It was nice to see Miami picked up certifiable good guy Bruce
Bowen. It was the Heat, of course, who gave Bowen his first chance
(one game) at the end of the 1997 season. The Celtics, with general
manager Chris Wallace beating the Bowen drum, brought him to
Boston, and he quickly became one of Pitino's favorites. Of course,
just as quickly, he became expendable . . . The Grizzlies are about
to change ownership in the next couple of weeks, with Chicago
businessman Michael Heisley taking over. Heisley is relying now on
the advice of ``consultant'' Dick Versace, who had a brief stint as
the Pacers' head coach and figures to play a prominent role in the
Grizzlies' organization (he's already assigned scouts for the NCAA
Tournament). That is not good news for current GM Stu Jackson, the
only GM in the Grizzlies' five-year history. Jackson has made
mistakes, but he also has solid support from franchise icon Shareef
Abdur-Rahim. In addition, new coach Lionel Hollins has the backing
of Abdur-Rahim and the other players, so if Versace does come in,
he had best tread lightly. Left unsaid is why Heisley has chosen to
ally himself with someone who's been out of the loop for so long.
There's family history between the two, but this is business . . .
No one was less surprised than Golden State boss Garry St. Jean
when his star player, Antawn Jamison, went down for the season last
week after knee surgery. No team has been hit harder by injuries
than the Warriors, who, incredibly, did not have their projected
starting lineup in place for a single game this season (and still
won't now that Jamison is gonzo). ``I'm just telling the guys to
try to have fun and play hard the rest of the way,'' St. Jean said.
``You never like to use injuries as an excuse, but this season has
been crazy.'' The jinx continued this past week when Larry Hughes
went down with an ankle sprain. He missed the game last Wednesday
in Milwaukee, but the Warriors still won, 91-86, thanks to what may
have been the most remarkable line of the season _ a career-high 37
points and a season-high 21 rebounds from Donyell Marshall. ``He
was an animal. He was a monster,'' teammate Mookie Blaylock said.
``I've been trying to get the animal to come out of his cage. He
did it tonight.'' . . . It took 55 games, but the Portland Trail
Blazers finally got a 30-point game from someone. Damon Stoudamire
took the honors Thursday against Orlando. Prior to that, Portland's
high game was a 27-pointer from Steve Smith Jan. 27 . . . Mike
Bibby on Kenny Anderson: ``He's like Mike Tyson. When he has his
head on right, he's one of the top five point guards in the
league.'' . . . Who said this? ``I think the key is to let these
guys continue to have time together, grow, learn each other, and
try to improve.'' Pitino? Nope. Portland GM Bob Whitsitt. That
sounds like Tiger Woods saying there's still a lot of room for
improvement in his game . . . Keep an eye on the Wizards the last
two months. They get to keep their own draft pick if it is among
the top three, and you know Jordan doesn't want to lose that. But
if it falls to No. 4 or lower, it goes to Jordan's nemesis, Chicago
GM Jerry Krause, who picked it up in the three-way deal involving
John Starks, Kukoc, and Hughes. Can you imagine Jordan having to
surrender a No. 4 pick to Krause? Jordan already is making noises
about going with ``younger'' players down the stretch, which will
undoubtedly improve his chances of getting a top three pick because
the Wizards won't win. Entering the weekend, Washington had the
fourth-worst record behind the Bulls, Clippers, and Warriors . . .
So, Horace Grant, you played for the Bulls and the Magic, the two
key teams that will have the cap room this summer and will come
courting. Which one would you choose? ``The Bulls have some pieces.
But Orlando, those guys play hard every game, and they have cap
room, too. I had a great five years in Orlando. It's a class
organization. I'm still making it my home, and I would never say
one bad thing about anyone down there, not Rich (owner DeVos) or
John (GM Gabriel) or anyone. The whole organization treated me
well. Whoever gets the chance to go there will be very happy.''

THEY'RE STICKING IT TO NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was Marty McSorley thinking? Perhaps the question should
be, was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   When last heard from, the Bruins defenseman said he was
attempting to goad Donald Brashear into another fight. After the
tattooing Brashear gave him earlier in Monday's game in Vancouver,
that should be ample proof that McSorley wasn't of sound mind. But
rather than drop his gloves or apply a gentle tap on the shoulder _
excuse me, Mr. Brashear, would you suggest the rhumba or the tango?
_ he opted for the more direct salutation of a two-hander to the
side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the approach lacked something in, shall we say, subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   With one ugly swipe of his stick, McSorley became the latest,
and perhaps most notorious, NHLer to turn the game into society's
pinata. ``Slapshot'' Redux. Oh, if only the lovable Hanson brothers
could come back and spoof the rest of North America's professional
pastimes, hockey might one day be able to crawl out from under the
talk show and op-ed carpet bombing that erupts every time someone
like McSorley makes real life imitate art.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other sport, hockey, especially the NHL, is a
lightning rod for the politically correct and the quick-triggered
media. I wonder: If Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens engaged in a
high-risk, and potentially lethal, exchange of beanballs this
summer, would a media horde storm Bud Selig's office? I doubt it.
If the NFL sees the likes of Jack Tatum paralyze an opponent again
with an open-field crackdown, will the pundits decry football as a
North American evil, a scourge on society? Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   But hockey is always there for the kicking. Especially in
America. My theory for that is two-fold: (1) Most of America views
it as a ``Canadian'' game and, because it isn't our creation, of
course it is flawed and inferior (this applies to soccer, too); and
(2) the basic rules of the game, especially the minutiae of
two-line offsides and the befuddling icing calls, just don't make
sense (this applies to soccer, too). It's an import. It's a little
confusing. Who wants to invest the time to understand it? And when
someone acts way out of line, it's nothing short of evil.
</P>
<P>
   How did John Rocker ever omit the Rangers, Islanders, and Devils
from his venomous spew? Someone really should ring up ol' RedNeck
and tell him what wondrous opportunities await the next time he
slithers out of the bayou.
</P>
<P>
   There is no defending what McSorley did, and people should be
disturbed and angry for his attack on Brashear. But that ire should
be appropriately directed at one place _ squarely on the chin of
Martin James McSorley _ and left there.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is a great game. And if you're going to throw up its
institutional tolerance for fighting as your foundation to deride
it, then come back to me when baseball eradicates the brushback
pitch, when football once and for all stops the use of a helmet as
a weapon. Personally, I find the NBA unwatchable, but I will admit
that it's probably the cleanest and least dangerous of the bunch.
(Now if that's why I find it so unappealing, maybe I need more
therapy than my multiple personalities believed.)
</P>
<P>
   Allow me this one entertainment crossover. These folks who get
in such a dander over hockey, how do they explain society's
acceptance of the film industry? Pornography and violence (the
latter disguised as the ``action'' genre) make up a huge portion of
the flick biz. It's an industry that thrives on debasing
(especially females) and dismembering (carnage is rarely gender
sensitive). But as a society, we barely blink an eye (perhaps for
fear of missing a single frame).
</P>
<P>
   Is it because film is fantasy? Hey, don't believe for a second
that sports is anything less.
</P>
<P>
   TV wades in the same cesspool of porn and violence, just
slightly toned down, but, on average, every household in North
America must keep one TV warm about 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But think for a second. What's more American than movies and TV?
What's easier to understand? Just sit back and enjoy the show.
</P>
<P>
   Please, go ahead, condemn McSorley. I'll even buy arguments that
the league could have issued a stiffer suspension than the
league-high 23 (at minimum) he received. Mayhem has no place in the
NHL. It has no place anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're worried that your kid might have picked up the
wrong message from what McSorley did, then I suggest you sit down
with your kid (what, you thought Charles Barkley was going to do
it?) and explain that victimizing people has no place in society _
be it the sidewalks, sports, or cinema. Your son or daughter then
probably will say, ``Hey, isn't this the same speech you gave me
about Bill Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   The legal game
</P>
<P>
   McSorley isn't expected to comment until he finds out where the
Canadian legal system takes him. One reason the league acted so
quickly, and refused McSorley's request to delay Wednesday's
hearing for 48 hours, was the hope that investigators in British
Columbia would interpret it as a sincere and speedy measure to keep
the NHL house in order. It has been more than a decade since an NHL
player was put through the paces of due process for a stick
infraction. Dino Ciccarelli, then with the Minnesota North Stars,
was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 for smacking
then-Leaf defenseman Luke Richardson over the head with his stick
in a game Jan. 6, 1988,at Maple Leaf Gardens . . . With no fewer
than eight defensemen, including ex-Bruin Grant Ledyard, the
Senators are expected to do some wheeling and dealing before the
March 14 trade deadline. Two other blueliners expected to be
shuffled soon: Tampa Bay's Petr Svoboda and Montreal's Vladimir
Malakhov. Both become unrestricted free agents July 1. Detroit
probably will make the most aggressive offer for Svoboda, and no
doubt the Panthers would love to place Malakhov behind countryman
Pavel Bure. The Habs reportedly would want Czech defenseman Robert
Svehla in return . . . Toronto general manager and coach Pat Quinn
is expected to relinquish the front half of his title at the end of
the season, and the successor could be either Nick Beverley, now
the club's personnel director, or ex-agent Bill Watters, faithful
front-office employee who now acts as special assistant to club
president Ken Dryden . . . Ex-Bruin Dave Reid, who signed on with
the Avalanche as a free agent this season for a cut-rate $475,000,
had a 2000-01 option worth $500,000 picked up last week . . .
Between them, Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and Ottawa center
Alexei Yashin will have thumbed their noses at a combined $6.5
million this season. Fun with numbers: Someone who makes $50,000 a
year would have to work 130 years to earn that sum. OK, I lost my
head and forgot the 1.7 percent annual cost-of-living bump . . .
Amid the perpetual fire sale on Long Island, it appears ex-Bruin
defenseman/coach/assistant GM Mike Milbury made a steal with the
acquisition of netminder Kevin Weekes, picked up in the swap that
delivered a struggling Felix Potvin to Vancouver. Weekes, who went
into the weekend with a 3-1-1 mark and a 1.77 GAA in his last five
decisions, is considered on ``the fast track to the No. 1
goaltender job,'' according to coach Butch Goring. That would
leapfrog him over highly-touted rookie Roberto Luongo. And don't
forget: Milbury also picked up capable forwards Dave Scatchard and
Bill Muckalt in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables
</P>
<P>
   Many compilations of NHL suspensions published over the last few
days neglected to include the 16 games Eddie Shore was tagged with
following his Dec. 12, 1933, cross-check that nearly killed
Toronto's Ace Bailey at the Garden. On a percentage basis, it
remains the stiffest suspension delivered by the NHL. The league in
those Original Six days played a 48-game regular season, the
suspension therefore leaving Shore sidelined for 33 percent of the
schedule. McSorley's 23-game hiatus amounts to 28 percent of the
82-game regular season . . . In the midst of sizzling rumors that
he'll be traded soon, Montreal netminder Jeff Hackett turned back
27 Phoenix shots last Tuesday for his first shutout of the season.
Now the Habs have two top-flight backstops, Hackett and Jose
Theodore . . . Don't figure on the Red Wings making a play for
Keith Tkachuk prior the trade deadline. But don't bet against
either Philadelphia or the Rangers making a huge play for him. The
Blueshirts would make the most sense. They easily could absorb the
$8.3 million he will make next season, and it would be especially
appealing if New York GM Neil Smith could convince his Phoenix
counterpart, Bobby Smith, to delete one of his higher-priced free
agents (say, Sylvain Lefebvre or Stephane Quintal) in the swap.
More appealing to Smith would be the less-expensive likes of Jan
Hlavac and/or Radek Dvorak _ two forwards with considerable upside
. . . McSorley, who was working for a pro-rated $600,000 this
season, was due about $140,000 prior to his suspension. In
accordance with the CBA, slightly more than 50 percent ($72,000)
will go to a fund benefiting needy players. McSorley, though no
longer able to work, still will receive slightly less than $70,000
between now and the April 9 conclusion of the regular season. Who
says crime doesn't pay? McSorley made millions over his career. He
would earn high marks here if he now designated his remaining pay
to charity, preferably to one designated by Brashear . . . Look for
Montreal's Brian Savage, out some four months now with a fractured
disk in his neck, to return to the Habs just before the trade
deadline . . . Anyone else notice that the Leafs began to slip
right around the time they brought in rent-a-wreck Wendel Clark (2
goals, 4 points, 15 games)? That's not to suggest he's the reason
for the fall, but it underscores, once more, the relative
worthlessness of looking to old guys to supply a character
kick-start. Clark didn't click with either Detroit or Chicago. Why
would the magic come back in a third tour with Toronto? Quinn, last
week to the Toronto Sun when asked about Clark's play: ``It
probably doesn't matter how I feel, in a public sense.'' Now
there's a ringing endorsement . . . When word broke Thursday that
Pittsburgh superstar Jaromir Jagr was hospitalized with a thigh
contusion, every Bruins fan had to think back to the thigh
contusion _ and subsequent ossification _ that sent Cam Neely
spiraling toward retirement. For those who care to remember, the
Neely contusion came courtesy of an Ulf Samuelsson hit delivered at
the Igloo . . . Hey, if Larry Bird would like to buy the Celtics,
how long before Bobby Orr makes a bid for the Bruins?

   LOS ANGELES _ It could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had only won four road games all year,'' said Rick Pitino.
``We won two and we thought we should have won a third in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to indulge in overkill at this point, is there?
We all know the Celtics aren't either the old Big Three Celtics of
the '80s, the old, old Havlicek/Cowens Celtics of the '70s, or the
old, old, old Russell/Cooz Celtics of the '50s and '60s. These guys
are what they are, a lower-echelon team whose big fantasy is to
play one lousy playoff game. Not being all that good doesn't make
them bad people. But it is downright sad and pathetic listening to
the president and coach of the team attempt to put a happy spin on
a club that has lost 12 of its last 16 games, regardless of venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good trip,'' Pitino said. ``It was a good trip
because we played some good ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah _ good. Seattle _ good. Vancouver _ good. But Golden State?
Yuck. Portland? Please. They were down 17-3 almost immediately and
when Portland found itself tied at 29, the Trail Blazers simply
stepped on the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   And as for their first visit to the Staples Center . . . Don't
be fooled by the fact that the Lakers didn't win by 40 Friday
night. In one sense, the Lakers insulted their ancient rival more
by the sheer carefree contempt with which they played the entire
game, throwing up silly shots and just generally playing to the
crowd, secure in the knowledge that the Celtics were present solely
to play the Washington Generals role. So what if the final spread
was only 13 (109-96)? It was a 99.9 percent wire-to-wire triumph
(one tie at 4, lasting 11 seconds) in which the Celtics were never
closer than 4 in the final 45 minutes or closer than 10 in the
final 38-plus.
</P>
<P>
   In the final three games of this six-game Western trip, the
Celtics were an absolute all-or-nothing team, never holding a lead
against Portland, never trailing against a lethargic Vancouver
squad, and then never leading against the Lakers. Granted, the
Trail Blazers and Lakers are the two best teams in the league, but
to see the vast difference between what they represent and what the
Celtics now represent was very sobering.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you don't need to hear Pitino say, ``We played very
well,'' against Portland. Compared to whom? The Connecticut College
of Broadcasting? If that inferior performance is ``playing very
well,'' then the standards of what constitutes basketball
excellence in Boston have sunk lower than the South Station Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's give them their due. The Celtics were positively noble
in the first game of this trip Feb. 15. They went into the Delta
Center, spotted the Utah Jazz a 14-point third-quarter lead, and
then rode the glittering fourth-quarter performance of Kenny
Anderson to victory in a high-level battle of hoop one-upmanship
that excited everyone involved, even the referees.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of show that had you thinking a) ``Hey, maybe
they're better than we thought'' and b) ``Kenny Anderson must think
he's 19 again. It was the kind of performance that had you thinking
that this might turn out to be a very good trip after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. The Jazz game was on a Tuesday. The next game,
against the weak Warriors, was scheduled for Friday, Feb. 18.
Perhaps there was too much time off, time during which the Celtics
might have decided they were a juggernaut. After being handed a
15-point second-quarter lead by a bumbling Golden State squad, the
Celtics crumbled at the first sign of difficulty, going into their
dreadful quick-shot offense, a malady that is invariably coupled
with an inability to retreat on defense. The 36-13 third quarter
was a disgrace to the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency being their official middle name, they played much
better in Seattle the next night, remaining in the game right down
to the final 20 seconds, when Antoine Walker first missed a lefty
attempt and then bricked a layup when the ball came right back to
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland putdown last Monday was followed by a curious game
in Vancover Thursday. The Celtics caught the Grizzlies in the
infamous first game home following a long road trip and received
another break when Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves, who once dropped
40 on them, sustained an ankle injury six minutes into the game.
Playing with reasonable intelligence and cohesion, they ran a
miniclinic, jumping into a 25-11 first-quarter lead and then
slipping into cruise gear for the second win of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and the following evening was another matter
entirely. The Celtics had actually played the Lakers well back on
Dec. 20, utilizing an effective full-court press and forcing the
Lakers to make some big fourth-quarter plays in order to win the
game. The Lakers needed no such late heroics in this game, moving
from that early 4-4 tie to a 30-17 first-quarter advantage that
resisted technical analysis. It just happened. It was a case of a
talented, confident team showing complete, and justifiable,
contempt for a listless foe whose minds had already flown the 3,000
miles home.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino didn't try any verbal razzle-dazzle on the subject of
this game. ``They were kind to us,'' he admitted. ``It could have
been a lot worse, and it would have been without their frequent
substitutions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if the Celtics have any hope of coping with
Shaquille O'Neal, who helped himself to 28 effortless points and 15
even more effortless rebounds against the likes of Vitaly
Potapenko, Tony Battie, and even Danny Fortson, who, at 6 foot 6
inches, had more chance of gaining the Republican presidential
nomination than he had of stopping Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino knew he wasn't going to stop Shaq. What he needed was
an overall team effort that reflected both talent and thought, and
which would be applied at both ends. So what did he get?
</P>
<P>
   ``We took too many quick shots, and they led to Laker
transitions,'' he said. ``We have got to learn how to play more
intelligently. One of these days someone here is going to get hit
over the head and think about what's a good shot and what's a bad
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's more, all right. ``If you want to make the
playoffs,'' Pitino continued, ``you've got to be selfless, you've
got to play like a team, offensively and defensively, and the only
focus on your mind has got to be winning, and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned that his team can't handle back-to-back games,
which, he said ``are what the NBA is all about.'' Ready for this?
The 1999-2000 Boston Celtics have now lost the second game of a
back-to-back situation 16 straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pitino was reduced to saying he is ``optimistic'' about what
lies ahead, partly because his competition (Detroit, Milwaukee,
Toronto, etc.) is currently in a collective funk.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what you want to hear? ``We are the Boston Celtics. We
stink less than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that's where the 16-time NBA champions are as
they come home to face the Dennis Rodman Traveling Circus Monday
night at the FleetCenter.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. New Jersey: The Devils lost only five of their first 32 home
games. No need to ask how important home ice is in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Toronto: Darcy Tucker has given the Maple Leafs some
toughness. A physical defenseman would be the missing piece to a
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia: The Flyers aren't overwhelming anybody, but
what do you expect when they can dress an All-Star team in the
trainer's room, with Eric Lindros and Keith Primeau?
</P>
<P>
   4. Florida: Goalie Trevor Kidd is back; unfortunately, the same
defense is in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   5. Washington: Just in case the Panthers thought the Capitals
would fold, Chris Simon sent a message by scoring the overtime
winner the other night.
</P>
<P>
   6. Ottawa: Senators owner Rod Bryden says the team isn't moving.
He didn't say how long that guarantee is good for.
</P>
<P>
   7. Buffalo: Whatshisname's return in goal has the Sabres
climbing back into a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   8. Pittsburgh: Jaromir Jagr's hamstring pull and thigh problems
might pull the plug on the Penguins' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. St. Louis: The Blues are so good, even enigmatic forward
Stephane Richer looks as if he cares again.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dallas: Goalie Ed Belfour has kept the Stars near the top
despite injuries.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detroit: There might be nothing to the Chris Osgood trade
rumors, but the Red Wings' goalie and the defense in front of him
are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix: The Coyotes have held together despite missing their
best player, Keith Tkachuk, but they need to add a physical
defenseman before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   5. Colorado: The Avs still might have the best talent in the
West, but injuries and seeming lack of control by coach Bob Hartley
are starting to wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   6. Edmonton: Kevin Lowe has the young team higher in the
standings than anyone expected. If the goaltending holds up, look
out.
</P>
<P>
   7. Los Angeles: After a brief slumber, the Kings' offense is
rolling again _ seven goals on 48 shots against Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   8. San Jose: Goalie Steve Shields is starting to make the Sharks
regret they traded Mike Vernon.NO SURPRISES
</P>
<P>
   Florida has been atop the Southeast Division all season but it's
not because of any miraculous comebacks. The Panthers are one of
only two teams that hasn't won a game after trailing after two
periods. Following are the teams who have the best and worst
records after losing the first 40 minutes:
</P>
<P>
   BEST W-L-T WORST W-L-T
</P>
<P>
   1. Dallas 7-15-2 28. San Jose 0-19-2
</P>
<P>
   2. New Jersey 4-10-2 27. Florida 0-14-1
</P>
<P>
   3. Ottawa 5-16-2 26. N.Y. Islanders 1-30-2
</P>
<P>
   4. St. Louis 4-13-3 25. Chicago 1-23-1
</P>
<P>
   5. Phoenix 3-12-2 24 Buffalo 1-21-1
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Canadiens goalie Jeff Hackett: He went 7-1-1 (including a
shutout of Phoenix) in a span of nine starts _ and illogically, is
central to several trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes: A flop in Vancouver, he's 3-1-1
with a 1.77 goals-against in his past five starts, including wins
over the neighboring Devils and Rangers and a tie with the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kings winger Luc Robitaille: So much for slowing down. He had 10
goals and 19 points in a span of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs' Wendel Clark: The Maple Leafs were hoping they
could rejuvenate him. Wrong. After recording only four points in 16
games, he might be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers goalie Mike Richter: He has missed five games with a
knee injury since the All-Star break, which is linked to the team's
dip in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Joe Sakic: He has one goal in his last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   _ Brett Hull became so frustrated the other night with Dallas'
sagging power play that he ripped into his own coaching staff. ``It
doesn't help when you've got power-play units that you practice
with and then you go out in the game and the coach puts different
people with you,'' Hull said. ``You don't know what side you're
working. You don't know who's going where on the breakout. There's
a lot more to blame than the players for the power play.'' Coach
Ken Hitchcock had a meeting with Hull but later attempted to defuse
the comments, saying, ``It's no big deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Sergei Fedorov missed four games while trying to find
a brace for his right thumb, which has ligament damage. Fedorov,
who has missed 12 games with injuries, might need surgery in the
off-season. He has 17 goals this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Center Bobby Holik wasn't concerned when New Jersey went
winless four games in a row. ``That's just part of the season,'' he
said. ``We can lose them now. As long as we don't lose them when
the playoffs start.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Word is that Pittsburgh coach Herb Brooks hates the job so
much he might not make it through the end of the season. If the
``Miracle Man'' leaves, associate coach Ivan Hlinka would be the
Penguins' third boss this season, following the fired Kevin
Constantine. Brooks wants to go back to scouting and his home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ The good news is that San Jose opened a nine-game homestand.
The bad news is that the Sharks opened it with a loss to St. Louis
and fell to 3-9 in their last 12 at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi on Blues defenseman Chris
Pronger: ``He's the equivalent of a Dominik Hasek for defensemen
right now. He can completely control a game in all phases.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Estimates on Jaromir Jagr's return from a hamstring pull range
from 10 days to a month. He also has a thigh bruise from which he
had excess fluid drained on Friday. The Penguins are 1-5-1 this
season without Jagr, 13-17-19 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Constantine, who clashed with some of Pittsburgh's stars
and was fired as Pittsburgh's coach earlier this season, is dealing
with a more flexible bunch these days. Constantine is helping coach
a youth team and plans to run a coaching clinic and youth camp this
summer. ``I know I'm supposed to take this time and not be in
hockey rinks,'' he said. ``But I've got a small addiction.''
Regarding criticism that has been leveled at him from players since
his departure, Constantine said, ``There's no value in (responding
to) any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe Sakic got fed up last week with the Avalanche's lackluster
play: ``I mean, you can talk as much as you want in the locker room
and everybody's prepared, everybody's ready. And then we get out
there and we don't do it. It's very frustrating. Everybody says,
`Well, we have to learn from this.' But school's over. Hey, let's
get going.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   _ One reason Vancouver's Donald Brashear has said little about
Marty McSorley's mugging is that he might file a civil suit. Yes,
there is precedent. In 1975, Detroit's Henry Boucha sued Boston's
Dave Forbes after he was hit in the face with the butt-end of
Forbes' stick and suffered a fractured cheekbone. Criminal charges
were filed, but the case ended in a hung jury. Boucha filed a
$3.5million civil suit, and the matter was settled out of court
five years later. In a similar case, Detroit's Dennis Polonich
successfully sued Kansas City's Wilf Paiement in 1978 and won
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free-agent defenseman Mark Tinordi is close to finishing his
rehabilitation from ankle surgery in October and could be close to
signing. At least three teams have interest _ Colorado, St. Louis
and Detroit. Tinordi has missed 96 games in the last three years
with injuries, but the Thrashers selected him from Washington in
the expansion draft. Atlanta wanted no other players on the
Capitals' unprotected list, and the team will receive a
compensatory pick in the June draft when Tinordi signs with another
team.

 &HT;    GORE HAS STRONG ADVANTAGE WITH HISPANICS IN BIG STATES
 &HT;    740&AMP;add. With HISPANICS-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    With photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Democratic primary voting nears in the four
biggest states _ Texas, Florida, California and New York _ Vice
President Al Gore appears poised to reap the support of the large
Hispanic communities in all four.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has courted Hispanic voters from the very beginning of his
campaign. His original intent was to blunt the Hispanic appeal of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who he expected to face in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bill Bradley has mounted an unexpectedly strong
primary challenge, Gore's groundwork is set to pay extra dividends,
because the former New Jersey senator has done little to court
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore effort has been exhaustive:
</P>
<P>
   His first campaign appointment was Jose Villarreal, a San
Antonio lawyer who is his national treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign set up a Hispanic working group that touted the
economic gains of Hispanics under the slogan, ``Ganamos con Gore,''
or ``We Win with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He lined up endorsements from 521 key Hispanic politicians in
California, Texas, New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His political allies floated rumors of a possible Hispanic
running mate: Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a Spanish version of his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He seasoned his speeches before Hispanic audiences with a
healthy dose of beginner Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House pitched in with periodic events showcasing
administration efforts on behalf of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Hispanic vote tends to be Democrat. Clinton got
61 percent nationwide in 1992 and 72 percent in 1996, and Gore has
tapped into the same network for his campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's extra efforts to cement that vote were sparked by
Bush's success in his 1998 re-election campaign, when he got nearly
50 percent of Texas's Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Gore's strategy is likely to give the vice
president an edge over Bradley next month in the key Democratic
presidential primaries in California, Texas, New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has Bradley actively campaigned for the Hispanic
vote. The day after his bare-knuckles debate with Gore at the
Apollo Theatre last Monday, he visited Public School 24, a new
Spanish-English dual-language elementary school in the New York
working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park.
</P>
<P>
   He used the appearance to question Gore's commitment to health
care coverage, education reforms and economic development. He also
received the endorsement of a local Hispanic city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about him,'' Katherine Cardona said of
Bradley. She knows a little more about Gore, but mostly that he has
been Bill Clinton's vice president for the last seven and a half
years. ``And I like Clinton,'' she added. ``So maybe Gore could do
as good a job as Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardona is the kind of voter Bradley needs if he is to overcome
Gore's lead in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She is 34. Her grandparents moved the family to New York from
Puerto Rico. She is the mother of two children, both in public
elementary school. She works in sales at Manhattan Latin Music
Center, a wholesaler of CD's and videos. Her husband, Silva, works
as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to speak, but nobody was listening,'' Cardona said.
``But now the politicians are starting to pay attention to Latinos.
They see the country is big and is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hispanics currently make up about 11 percent of the U.S.
population, a proportion that is expected to grow to 25 percent by
2050. They will outnumber non-Hispanic blacks by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But only in the 1998 congressional elections did Hispanics start
to wield the influence expected of such a fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotly contested New York Senate race, for example, 82
percent of Hispanics voted for Democrat Charles Schumer, who ousted
Republican incumbent Al D'Amato. Similarly, in California, Gray
Davis received 78 percent of the Hispanic vote to help him defeat
Republican Dan Lundgren in the gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic voters have become a powerful focal point for
candidates,'' said Henry Cisneros, a former Clinton cabinet member,
former San Antonio mayor and now president of the Spanish-language
television network Univision Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A presidential candidate cannot win the election ... without
winning Latino votes,'' said Leo Briones, a Los Angeles political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has made little effort to reach out to
Hispanics. Last weekend, for example, he was the only one of the
major candidates for president who did not send a representative to
the Mexican American Political Association's 41st annual Education
and Endorsement Conference in California.
</P>
<P>
   And while campaign literature in Spanish is available from
Bradley, his campaign Web site has no content in Spanish beyond the
candidate's biography.
</P>
<P>
   Biography may, in fact, be Bradley's problem in the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Few white American politicians have spoken as eloquently as
Bradley about the country's racial divide. And Bradley's commitment
to issues of importance to Hispanics is, at the very least, the
equal of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's perspective is mostly the product of his 10 years
as a professional basketball player, a white man living in a
largely African American world.
</P>
<P>
   As a recent editorial in The Record newspaper in Bergen, N.J.,
suggested, ``had Bradley been a baseball player, and shared locker
rooms with more Latinos, perhaps things might have been
different.''

EX-KNICK MASON IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT IN BAR BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES, revisions thruout)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Mason, the former New York Knick who now
plays for the Charlotte Hornets, was charged with assault early
Saturday after he and a group of friends were involved in a barroom
brawl that left three people injured, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who has a criminal record on assault and other charges in
New York, was arrested with four friends about 5 a.m. Saturday in
Harlem, after the police were called to a Manhattan Avenue bar, law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with third-degree assault after he was questioned
by officers from the 28th Precinct, said Officer Chris Cottingham,
a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned Saturday night and freed on $1,000 bond pending
a hearing March 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets were in town to play the New Jersey Nets Saturday
night at Continental Airlines Arena, but the arraignment delayed
Mason until after the 7:30 start of the game. He played midway
through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's friends _ William Leary, 26; Anthony Kelly, 24; Mason's
cousin, William Duggins, 26; and Paul Boling, 34 _ were also
charged with third-degree assault, Cottingham said. The four live
in Springfield Gardens, Queens, where Mason grew up, the officials
added. Mason now lives in North Carolina. It was unclear if any of
the five were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 33, who arrived in the New York area late Friday, got to
the bar sometime after midnight, the officials said. The officials
said that the fight broke out around 4:20 a.m. after Mason and his
friends began arguing with three other patrons at Perks, an upscale
and often crowded Harlem bar at the corner of Manhattan Avenue and
123rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up the fight, the police determined that Mason
and his friends were responsible, the officials said. They were
taken to the 28th Precinct, about a block away. The three victims,
all men between 30 and 32, were treated at the scene for cuts,
bruises and other injuries, the law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement officials said the fight started when Leary
bumped into one of the victims in an area of the bar where people
were dancing. The victim apologized, the officials said, but Leary
challenged the man to a fight that eventually spilled into the
street.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m., the police had the fight under control and were
questioning victims and suspects, including Mason. He was arrested
after one of the victims accused Mason of punching him, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse at 100 Centre Street in Lower Manhattan, where
Mason was later arraigned, Don Cronson, Mason's lawyer and agent,
said that Mason was talking on a telephone when the fight broke
out. Cronson, who spoke with Mason at the 28th Precinct station
house, said, ``Anthony was trying to separate people and get them
into a limo and away from the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lewis, 44, a longtime friend of Mason's who was at Perks at
the time of the fight, said the basketball player was ``trying to
break up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to get into the limo,'' Lewis said. ``Then a group
of about 25 people started jumping people, I got hit in the face, I
turned around and swung, then I got into the car. Mason went back
in to get my coat.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes a little more than two years after Mason and
Duggins were charged with the third-degree rape of 14- and
15-year-old girls at a party in Laurelton, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who admitted to consensual sex with the girls and called
the rape charges silly, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of
endangering the welfare of a child in June 1998. At the time, the
Queens district attorney's office said that the charges of rape and
sexual abuse were dropped after DNA testing did not link Mason to
the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who had been traded to the Hornets in 1996 and was
visiting New York when the incident occurred, was ordered to do 200
hours of community service with the homeless at the Progressive
Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C. Duggins pleaded guilty to
statutory rape and to endangering the welfare of a child and was
sentenced to five years of probation and 800 hours of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the New York police charged Mason with gun possession
and he was sentenced to probation and community service.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was twice accused of assaults at the China Club, a trendy
Manhattan nightclub. In April 1996, three people filed a $54
million lawsuit, charging Mason with attacking them at the club.
Two weeks earlier, the police had been called to the club after a
New Jersey woman contended that Mason hit her. Charges were not
filed in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, he was charged with assault, menacing and
resisting arrest after a fight with two New York police officers
over a summons. The police said it took 10 officers to subdue
Mason, who, team officials say, is 6 feet 8 inches tall and weighs
280 pounds. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was
sentenced to 120 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Mason was traded by the Knicks along
with Brad Lohaus to Charlotte for Larry Johnson, even though Mason
had averaged a career-best 14.8 points the previous season. Mason
has played in the NBA for 10 seasons, five with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Cronson, his agent, said that Mason had ``been good for a good
while now, but still, he comes to New York and wolves are howling
at the moon.''

WIRING BUILDINGS FOR HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is little doubt what business the Intellispace
company is in. Right at the entrance to the company's offices at
1156 Ave. of the Americas, at 45th Street, there are racks of
telecommunications equipment that stand between the reception area
and the executive desks.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing traditional about the equipment or the
company's approach to the telecommunications business. It is all
related to the development of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intellispace is one of dozens of companies to which building
managers are turning to prepare their properties for the high-tech
future, providing telecommunications services to their tenants.
From Bell Atlantic to the newest startup, each seems to have a
different technical approach and economic model, with most
providing a mix of local and long distance voice service plus video
and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet connections have become increasingly important,
particularly for the young companies, usually referred to
collectively as dot-coms, that conduct virtually all their business
on the Internet. According to figures compiled by Insignia/ESG, the
real-estate services company, 75 percent of all the commercial
leases executed in Midtown South in the month of January this year
were by such technology-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   While most personal-computer users are content to rely on
dial-up modem connections with Internet service providers, despite
the occasional difficulty in gaining access, for companies
developing businesses on the Internet, continuous, reliable, high
capacity connections are essential. Other concerns in the field
include OnSite Access, Allied Riser and Eureka Broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just at the beginning of a technological revolution,''
said Marc Josephson, the founder and chairman of Intellispace. ``It
is very difficult to do both voice and the Internet, so we just do
Internet.'' Not everyone might agree with this assessment, but
Josephson has chosen the Internet-only approach to differentiate
his company from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   He said that designing a system for the Internet optimizes the
connections for Internet use rather than trying to add Net services
to a system designed to carry voices. And, he said, standard voice
and data services may one day be available over the Internet in a
manner less costly than the present system.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson said he became convinced about the commercial future
of the Internet when he connected the building at 55 Broad St. in
the summer of 1995. The building, owned by the Rudin family, had
been sitting empty. It has since filled with Internet-related
tenants and become a leading example of how technology can help
cure real estate ills.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Intellispace has wired Rockefeller Center, the Jacob
Javits Convention Center and 190 other buildings containing over 55
million square feet of space. Recently it reached an agreement with
Hartz Mountain Industries to wire 18 properties in New York and
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Manhattan buildings wired by Intellispace are about 40
managed by Williams Real Estate for third-party owners. But
Williams executives said they are still trying to choose among the
vendors for buildings owned by the principals of Williams. ``We are
still trying to choose the right carrier,'' said Robert Getreu, a
senior managing director of the firm. ``We want the most
flexibility for the tenants and a full package of services.''
</P>
<P>
   As a property manager, he said, he tries to differentiate among
the many companies offering communications services using three
criteria: the financial capability to deliver promised services,
the range of services offered and the technology being used.
</P>
<P>
   Intellispace's approach is to equip a building for very high
speed communications and then sell each tenant the capacity it
needs. It installs a device called a router, which is capable of
handling 100 million bits per second of information and runs
individual optical fiber connections to each tenant.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, a simple voice telephone line can carry
56,000 bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the traffic in a building goes through the same
piece of equipment, Intellispace officials say internal controls
prevent one client from seeing another's messages. Each customer
has its own dedicated fiber connection to the router, they add.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes the installation at no cost to the landlord,
who nevertheless must provide space for the router and space in the
vertical shafts in a building, called risers. Finding riser space
can sometimes be an issue, particularly in older buildings, real
estate executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As building managers we are concerned that we may fill the
risers with so much telecom wiring that when we want to do
something for a building there will be a problem,'' Getreu said.
</P>
<P>
   Intellispace also makes deals on a nonexclusive basis, so other
Internet communications companies can offer competing services to
tenants, easing landlord fears that tenants will be reluctant to
lease space in a building with only one Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The landlords also share in the revenue produced by tenants' use
of the system, typically receiving 10 percent of revenues once a
certain threshold has been reached. After an initial charge of
about $2,000 for wiring a tenant's space and establishing the
connection, a typical monthly fee for 1 million bits of capacity _
which would be typical for a dot-com with about 15 employees _ is
about $1,000, said Bob Froberg, Intellispace's senior vice
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system is flexible and can add capacity quickly if a
company grows or just has a short-term need. If a company using 5
megabits of capacity suddenly needs 50, he said, the change can be
made in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Intellispace executives say they are targeting the dot-com
companies in the buildings they have wired and selling them
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The company runs a minimum of two fiber connections out of each
building and links them to two high-capacity fiber ``rings'' around
Manhattan that connect to long-distance carriers such as Level 3
Communications, Cable &AMP; Wireless and GTE Internetworking. A third
ring is due to go in operation within 60 days, company officials
said, adding to redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed so that if any circuit is interrupted,
all the traffic is switched to one of the backups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although this system bypasses the traditional telephone company
switching system, Froberg noted that Bell Atlantic built the
company's fiber rings in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms live on the Internet so they need high-speed,
dedicated service,'' Froberg said, adding that the ability to scale
up the amount of service is important as well. ``But other
businesses are seeing the need for employees to have access to the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For a company that is selling the future, it is using
well-established marketing techniques. It is mounting a print
advertising campaign on the city's subways and commuter railways.
And it is using a direct sales force _ live people talking to other
live people _ to persuade landlords to allow their buildings to be
wired and tenants to sign up for service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do things like host a breakfast in the lobby of a
building to explain what we are offering,'' Froberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently received a $35 million investment from
Chase Capital Partners, an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Corp., and
Weston Presidio Capital, both venture capital operations.
</P>
<P>
   Intellispace officials say they are using the funds to expand
regionally and, they hope, nationally. The company has opened
offices in Philadelphia and Princeton, N.J., and is preparing to
open offices in Boston; Stamford, Conn.; and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using the investment to expand rapidly,'' Josephson
said. ``In 2000, we expect to be in Baltimore, Richmond, Atlanta,
Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco.''

SCIOSCIA'S STYLE: KEEP IT SIMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- There is no truth to the rumor that when Mike
Scioscia held his first full-squad team meeting the other day, he
preached bleeding periwinkle blue, and paying homage to the big
Angel in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   No, the new Angels manager is his own man. And even though Tommy
Lasorda was his big league manager for 13 seasons with the Dodgers,
Scioscia won't copy Lasorda's or anybody else's style. However, he
has learned much from Lasorda and others who have tutored him over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a little part of a lot of people,'' said Scioscia, 41.
``Roy Campanella, Del Crandall and John Roseboro were big
influences on me at an early age. Not just giving me a foundation
for being a catcher, but what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy magnified it with communication. He'd get a guy to
compete at a level higher than that guy thought he could. And he
made guys love to work hard. Tommy had a tremendous passion for the
game and was a great instructor. He gave you the confidence you
could be better. He was a tireless worker with endless
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's managerial approach is simple -- ``I'm myself,'' he
said. ``I talk to them like you'd want to be treated yourself --
with respect and communication. I'm not going to program myself to
be something I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty simple person, I'm not anything complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia often talks about his ``limited skills'' as a player.
Yet he got the most out of himself and he parlayed it into a
successful major league career. It is what the Angels are hoping he
can do for them -- get the most out of the players he has.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been considered a team with talent in recent
years, but it hasn't translated into any playoff appearances. At
best, the Angels are contenders in August, pretenders in September.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman selected Scioscia from a
group of qualified candidates including some with major league
managerial experience. Scioscia's level of managerial experience
reached triple-A Albuquerque, where he went 65-74 in the Pacific
Coast League last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far he's been great,'' Stoneman said. ``He's an upbeat
person, and that came out right from the first interview with him.
Nothing's changed that. He also understands the game well. And his
thoroughness and preparation are something that's impressed
everybody here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a catcher, Scioscia's ability to work with
pitchers is a bonus. He recalled being a 21-year-old rookie and
having a conversation with Don Sutton, at the time a sage
38-year-old veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I made a suggestion to him he kind of looked at
me like, `Yeah, right,' '' Scioscia said. ``But later on, he
listened to me and began to trust me. He'd ask me, 'What do you
think we should do here?' That's the kind of trust that is the
foundation of an organization. That's what we're putting together
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Angels players agree. Whereas former manager Terry
Collins was a respected baseball mind, he didn't communicate with
his players well. Scioscia, though, seems to be more in touch with
the modern-day player and their egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``His communication skills are great,'' said Matt Walbeck, who,
along with the other catchers in camp, has spent the most time with
Scioscia. ``He gets people loose and laughing and having fun.
That's a big part of his job. But he also demands that you work
hard. There's not a lot of time for idle chit-chat. It's a great
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent time in a totally different business,'' Stoneman said
of his years in the banking business. ``When you're in management,
communication is really important. Baseball is not any different.
Mike is a good communicator. He seems to make the players and staff
feel very comfortable.''

 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the 2000 presidential campaign began, the
Republican and Democratic primaries that will be held in Washington
state on Tuesday were hardly more than blips on the political
horizon, arcane little contests lying somewhere out on the trail
between the first-in-the nation Iowa caucuses and the
could-end-it-all mass of 13 primaries scheduled for Titanic
Tuesday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But because the early months of the campaign have been so
unexpectedly topsy-turvy, the Washington primaries, with their
quirky rules and oft-quirky voters, suddenly loom large, and the
candidates have been forced to change plans and divert scarce
resources and time to compete. The Democrats were in the state
Saturday and they will be joined by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on
Sunday. Sen. John McCain of Ari- zona plans to arrive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is opportunity, and danger, for all candidates in these
contests, but especially for McCain, still trying to forge ahead of
Bush on the Republican side, and for former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, still badly trailing Vice President Al Gore on the
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has no party registration and voters may choose on
primary day to vote in either contest. Both McCain and Bradley have
been going after party switchers and independent voters, McCain
particularly, while their opponents have been concentrating mainly
on the hard-core base within their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Given that an unusually large number of Washington voters, 50
percent or more, claim to be independents (many maintain that
ideology is a private matter), there has often been a lot of voting
flux in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a very tricky state when it comes to politics and
voting,'' said David Brine, the communications director for the
office of the secretary of state, which regulates state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is fixed in stone here,'' Brine said. ``There's a long
tradition of switching around in parties and on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are chasing after independents and party
switchers so hard that they find themselves in competition for some
of the same votes, particularly when they are talking up one of
their favorite issues, government reform. In fact, Bradley has
concluded that Washington not only offers him a big chance to go
after independent voters but also offers what may be his last
chance, with the help of independent votes, to post a victory over
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Such a victory would come in a race that under party rules is
essentially a beauty contest, with no convention delegations to be
won. But Bradley nevertheless is committing huge amounts of time
and money to what amounts to a bet-it-all gamble _ win a contest,
any contest, anywhere, of whatever nature.
</P>
<P>
   The actual choosing of the state's allotment of 75 delegates to
the Democratic National Convention will take place in a March 7
round of caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, comfortably ahead in most recent Washington polls, has
been forced to match the Bradley effort to protect his flank,
something he had not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley were both in Seattle Saturday to address a
meeting of the state NAACP. While Gore attended a state Dem-
ocratic Party chili dinner, Brad- ley held a chili dinner with
support- ers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also committing significant resources to the contest
here and, much to Bradley's frustration, seems to be dominating the
chase after independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like Gore, is responding in kind with money and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest is part beauty contest, part real primary
and, like the Democratic contest, will be followed by a round of
caucuses on March 7. Twelve of the party's allotment of 37
delegates to the Republican National Convention will be chosen on
Tuesday, the rest on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the Bush-McCain competition too close to call,
just as it was too close to call on the eve of voting in several
earlier contests.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, coming off his surprise victory on Tuesday in
Michigan, a Washington victory would add to the momentum he has
been building as he seeks to overcome Bush's huge earlier lead over
most of the country. This would be especially true if he were to
win both the beauty contest and the 12-delegates contest, though he
and Bush very well might end up splitting those contests because of
the complex rules that govern them.
</P>
<P>
   But if a McCain victory here is to have truly significant
meaning, the senator must not only beat Bush but demonstrate in
beating him that he can pull large numbers of conservative
Republican votes _ the ultimate key to the party's nomination _ not
just the votes of Republican moderates, dissident Democrats and
independents, his victory mix so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been very successful in doing that in other states,
no matter how hard he has tried. But now that he has retooled his
pitch _ ``I am a Reagan Republican,'' became his mantra after
Michigan _ he may have a better shot at it, particularly here in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Republicans tend to be more moderate than Republicans
in many other states, though there are plenty of conservatives
here. Certainly Washington Republicans are likely to be more
receptive to the new McCain pitch than Republicans in Virginia, a
conservative bastion and Bush stronghold that also will hold a
primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a McCain kind of state,'' said Kris Wilder, the
director of the McCain effort here. ``More than in most states, the
Washington state voter has a mind of his own, of her own, just like
John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, needs to regain momentum in Tuesday's
voting. He badly needs a success here to twin with a presumed
victory in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a tough one but we feel good about the
outcome,'' said Mike McKay, a chairman of the Bush effort here.
``We feel we have the support and we're confident we have the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are filling the airwaves with a round of
last-minute television and radio advertisements, mailing out
thousands and thousands of campaign fliers and inundating voters
with telephone calls. The senator flew here for a day of
campaigning just hours after his Michigan triumph and will return
for another visit just a few hours before the polls open.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the Democratic contest here could be his last
hurrah, because a loss in Washington would lengthen Gore's string
of victories over him to four in a row. So unlike the other
candidates, who are dipping in and out of the state so that they
can also work the other states in the March 7 primaries, Bradley is
remaining here almost the entire week leading up to Tuesday's vote.
His main pitch: Gore is a conservative whereas he is the true
liberal and Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win this primary or have a very strong showing,'' Mo
Elleithee, Bradley's spokesman, said the other day, ``it will be a
signal to the rest of the country that Bill Bradley is viable and
this thing is not wrapped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, confident momentum on his side, plans to visit the state
briefly over the weekend but otherwise is leaving his campaign
effort here up to surrogates, many of them top labor leaders and
members of the state's Democratic establishment, like Paul Berendt,
the Democratic state chairman. They have kept up a drumbeat of
charges that Bradley is engaging in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking the low road,'' Berendt said, ``and what he's
going to find is that Washington voters are going to punish him for
it.''

A JUROR SUGGESTS PROSECUTION WAS THE REASON FOR ACQUITTAL

   Jurors stood firm Saturday in their pledge to remain silent on
how, and why, they had acquitted the four police officers charged
with murdering Amadou Diallo. But one member of the panel, speaking
generally about how they had reached their decision, pointed to the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The juror, who insisted on anonymity because, she said, she
feared for her safety, said the panel's acquittal of the officers
was based on the evidence and the legal charges as explained by the
judge, and not on personal feelings about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is not happy with the verdict, they need to look at
the prosecution, and that is all that I'm going to say,'' the juror
said in a brief telephone interview. ``If they find fault with the
verdict, that's where they need to look _ at the prosecution. We
could only go on what was presented to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror refused to elaborate on what she found lacking in the
evidence presented by the Bronx district attorney's office, which
had brought murder charges against the officers, who fired 41 times
at Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   She would not discuss what she or other jurors thought of the
defense, nor would she say specifically how much the testimony of
the police officers mattered in their decision. ``I'm not going to
give you what I thought of them,'' she said. ``We went through all
evidence that was presented to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney,
defended the prosecution's handling of the case Saturday. ``We
tried the case to get to the summation with the strongest case
possible,'' the spokesman, Steven Reed, said, adding, ``We felt we
put on the strongest case that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the jury, made up of four blacks and eight
whites, maintained their silence about the deliberations Saturday.
Reached by telephone or at their homes, several said that they had
given specific instructions to the judge, Justice Joseph C. Teresi,
that they did not wish to speak to the news media about their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all decided not to discuss it,'' the forewoman, Arlene
Taylor, said through the screen door of her home in East Berne,
near Albany. ``I'm not going to discuss it. I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, Thomas Knowles, answering the door at his upstate
home, said that the group was considering issuing a statement or
speaking publicly Sunday, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hell,'' he said, referring to the barrage of
interview requests from reporters. He would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Timothy DeTraglia, a juror and the monsignor at
Christ the Light American Catholic Church in Albany, said he would
abide by the jury's decision to remain quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at the church, he said that he had checked with several
of the jurors Saturday, and together, they resolved not to
elaborate on the verdict. ``I do feel it was a fair deliberation,''
he said, adding that the difficulty of making the decision spoke
for itself. ``We spent 21 hours doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And a man who identified himself as the husband of another
juror, Valerie Brown, and answered the door at her home, said that
Brown would not answer any questions. But, he added, ``If you want
to find out what happened, go ask the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror who spoke anonymously said she had been deluged not
only by media inquiries but by numerous callers over the last week
who had just hung up on her. Afraid for her safety, she installed a
caller identification box on her telephone. She did not anticipate
any of this, she said, when she answered the summons to serve on a
jury. ``I went there to serve but definitely not to have my rights
infringed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the verdict, she noted several times that the panel
asked the judge to read back and clarify each of the charges. ``In
a court of law, it doesn't matter what you feel,'' she said. ``I
can live with the decision I made on a legal standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the jury did not concern itself with the potential
public reaction. ``I pray it will never play any part in a jury
deliberating on a case,'' she said. ``That's not what the law
states. You have to go with the evidence presented before you.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``A man lost his life. That should not be
forgotten.''

SURPRISE ENTRY FROM MEXICO TOPS COWTOWN MARATHON RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The spotlight might have shone on Olympian
Keith Brantly in yesterday's Cowtown Marathon, but a 30-year-old
late entry from Mexico stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Santos Ortega, who had been in Dallas since Thursday but who
didn't register until about 10 minutes before the race, erased the
oldest Cowtown record, blazing to victory in 2 hours, 17 minutes,
35 seconds. The record of 2:20:13 had weathered challenges since
1980, when Roger Martindill of Hamilton, Ontario, set it.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortega showed up on a cool, overcast morning at the Fort
Worth Stockyards with the record in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told his manager that he was coming here to break the
record for the $1,000,''said Dallas resident Joe Badillo, who helps
manage Ortega. A $1,000 bonus is awarded for a course record.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega, of Toluca, didn't have a clue that an Olympian was in
the field. In fact, he said he had never heard of Keith Brantly,
the 28th finisher in the 1996 Olympic Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the knowledge could have spurred him to a better
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega started fast and had no serious challenger as he became
the fourth consecutive Mexican runner sponsored by El Conejo (''The
Rabbit'') Bus Lines to win at Cowtown. He took the lead for good
after seven miles, and everyone else became distant shadows when
the sun broke through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Brantly was using the 26.2-mile run as part of his training for
the U.S. Men's Olympic Marathon Trials in May and said he never
thought about trying to catch Ortega. Brantly finished a distant
second in 2:33:46.
</P>
<P>
   Brantly actually was worrying almost as much about a friend
competing in the Women's Olympic Marathon Trials in Columbia, S.C.
He got regular updates on his cell phone during his run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend call me about four or five times,'' said
Brantly, who was carrying his phone in a back pocket. Although his
friend didn't qualify, Brantly was ecstatic with his run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pleased,'' he said. ``This was a great training
run. I can't tell you what a relief it is to run this far and feel
so good. I've struggled the last two years with a hamstring injury,
and I hadn't run a long run of more than 20 miles in almost six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Brantly was feeling good, he knew catching Ortega
was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was getting to 12 miles, I saw him coming down another
street, and he already was past 13 miles. And he looked good,''
Brantly said. ``I think his time is great on this course. This
course is pretty close to being as difficult as Pittsburgh,'' where
Brantly won the U.S. National Marathon title in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega, who also won the eight-mile Turkey Trot in Dallas in
November, said he had received a description of the Cowtown course
by '98 winner and teammate Remedios Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me the first 10 miles were hilly,'' Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   The hills didn't seem to bother Ortega, who reached the halfway
mark in 1:09. However, Ortega said he became confused after looking
at his watch, and believed he was not on pace to break the record.
So, he sped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at my watch again after I got confused,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega didn't know he would break the record until turning the
corner to Exchange Street and seeing the clock at the finish line
almost two-tenths of a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished his fifth marathon, Ortega had almost matched
his best time of 2:17 set two years ago Austin, and had his first
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would do about a 2:19,'' he said. ``I'm happy.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush still No. 1 to GOP voters
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his loss in Tuesday's Michigan primary, George W. Bush
is maintaining large approval margins among Republicans nationally
and in all-important California, polls showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among likely Republican voters in California's March 7 primary,
a Time/CNN poll found the Texas governor leading Sen. John McCain
48 percent to 23 percent. Unlike the Michigan primary, in which
Democrats and independents boosted McCain to victory, the
California contest allows only Republicans' votes to count toward
delegate selection. The state's 162 delegates are the biggest prize
of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek magazine poll found Bush enjoying a 56 percent to 27
percent lead nationally among registered Republicans and those
likely to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Time/CNN poll involved 1,009 likely California primary
voters, contacted Thursday and Friday, and has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Newsweek surveyed 750 people
on the same two days, with an error margin of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says he's a genuine reformer
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to woo independent-minded voters in Washington state,
which holds its primaries Tuesday, Democrat Bill Bradley said he's
a more genuine reformer than Republican hopeful John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is a reformer and I'm a reformer,'' Bradley told a
campaign crowd in Bellingham last week. ``We both want campaign
finance reform. There's no question about it. But when it comes to
the environment, there's a vast difference between John McCain and
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley criticized McCain for calling a West Coast
salmon-recovery effort ``pork barrel'' spending, and said he had an
84 percent vote rating from the League of Conservation Voters,
compared with McCain's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sound bytes
</P>
<P>
   On the stump Saturday in Silicon Valley, Vice President Al Gore
said he will target California's Bay Area as the first place
``anywhere in the world'' that eliminates the disparity in access
to computers and the Internet between the well-to-do and low-income
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who are denied the chance to master computers today
will miss out on opportunities in tomorrow's economy,'' he said in
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore touched on several issues important to the high-tech
industry. ``We need basic research and development, funded by the
federal government, to provide a constant stream of new ideas and
insights that can be used by the high technology industries,'' he
said. ``We need policies to continue the moratorium on taxation of
the Internet. We need to make the research and development tax
credit permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Territories choose Bush
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won the first four of more than two dozen
delegates to the Republican National Convention being chosen in
four presidential contests being held this weekend in U.S.
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands each had four
delegates at stake during separate caucuses Saturday. Bush won all
four in the Virgin Islands. Republicans from Puerto Rico will
commit 14 delegates today at their winner-take-all primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain targets Virginia
</P>
<P>
   With polls indicating a tightening race, Sen. John McCain
increased campaign appearances and advertising in Virginia in an
effort to overtake George W. Bush in Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made a heavy weekend purchase of television time in the
Washington, D.C., area to reach its northern Virginia suburbs, the
state's most populous region. Until now, he had limited his state
TV ads to less expensive markets. Bush has been advertising heavily
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign added a rally this evening in Alexandria to
his plan for a town hall meeting Monday in Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls showed Bush leading by eight to 11 percentage
points, down from more than 20 points a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gives fan an excuse
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore didn't want Melinda Gallien to get in trouble for
playing hooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be at work an hour ago. My pager's been
going off the whole time,'' the young woman, a Hilton nameplate on
her lapel, said as she waited to shake Gore's hand at a San Jose,
Calif., campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wrote a note to her boss: ``To John Southwell: Please
excuse Melinda Gallien for being late. She was with me making our
democracy work. Al Gore.''

   Several hundred supporters, including several as-yet unnamed
members of Congress, are expected to join 90-year-old Doris Haddock
on the final stage from Arlington National Ceremony to the Capitol
for her high noon showdown marking the end of her 425-day,
3,200-mile quest.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief ceremony on the Capitol's east steps, Granny D
plans to traverse the cavernous halls of House and Senate office
buildings to deliver her campaign reform message in person to
lawmakers, said John Anthony, who is coordinating Granny D's
Washington arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A widowed great-grandmother from Dublin, N.H., Granny D set out
on her cross-country trek on Jan. 1, 1999, from Pasadena's Colorado
Boulevard. Denied a place in that day's Rose Parade by organizers,
she brought up the rear of the pageant and then headed east.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Granny D endured dust storms in the Mojave
Desert, rain and snow on the Great Plains and steep inclines in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   She also talked the talk, at venues ranging from state capitals
to biker bars, in her effort to purge the electoral process of
so-called soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to a loophole in the federal law that limits
individual donations to candidates to $1,000 per election. There is
no limit on soft money, which is funneled by corporations, labor
unions and nonprofit special interest groups to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The parties use much of the money on mailers and TV advertising
to tout their stands on major issues. Labor unions and special
interest groups can use their own soft money on advertising for the
candidates they have endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Federal Election Commission records through Feb. 1,
soft money donations had already topped $200 million for this
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't send our young men and women off to fight for a
government of, by and for the corporations,'' Granny D told a Texas
audience during her trek. She has argued that soft money has
corrupted the legislative process, resulting in tax breaks, eased
regulations and other perks for big donors.
</P>
<P>
   Granny D's backers include Republican presidential candidate
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose effort to ban soft money has
been a key element of his drive for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters also include members of Common Cause, a national
group espousing campaign reform, and thousands of individuals
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   During her long march, which covered an average of 10 miles a
day, Granny D was assisted by hundreds of strangers who gave her
food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The activist also rented out her New Hampshire home to help
cover expenses. A small group of backers and relatives served as
her entourage, following her along the highways and byways in a
camper.
</P>
<P>
   Granny D said she was inspired to make the trip by her personal
heroes: President Teddy Roosevelt; who broke up big business trusts
in the early 1900s; Mildred Norman, a pacifist who traversed the
country seven times from 1953-81 as ``Peace Pilgrim''; and the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.

MASON FACING ASSAULT CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 (UPDATES, revisions thruout) 
 (With MASON-ARRESTED) 
(nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Running through drills at their
shoot-around Saturday morning, the Charlotte Hornets appeared no
different from any other team on any other day. But perhaps more
than any other team, the Hornets could handle the latest
development without flinching.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets arrived at Continental Arena before 10 a.m.,
receiving the news from coach Paul Silas that Anthony Mason was in
a Manhattan police station, facing an assault charge and an
uncertain future. Mason, his cousin and three friends were arrested
outside Perks Bar in Harlem about 5 a.m. after a fight that left
three other men injured.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, the former Knick who was traded to Charlotte in 1996
after several run-ins with the police, missed the tip-off for the
Hornets' game with the Nets because of his arraignment in
Manhattan. He was charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor,
and released on $1,000 bond this evening.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mason got to Continental Arena, nearly four minutes
had elapsed in the first quarter. He made it to the bench during
the second quarter and entered the game with 6 minutes 24 seconds
to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of difficulties for the team, the
most visible of which was the Jan. 12 car crash that killed guard
Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the season started, Derrick Coleman wrecked his
Range Rover on Oct. 27 in an accident that left his teammate
Eldridge Recasner with a collapsed lung. Coleman was charged with
drunken driving, but was later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Recasner later was charged with fourth-degree assault at a
Seattle airport ticket counter after his sister and mother were
involved in a car accident and, believing that his sister might not
survive, he snapped at an airport employee.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Hornets' owner, George Shinn, has had his share of
trouble. Shinn was sued over allegations of sexual assault. He was
found not liable in a sordid trial, and two weeks afterward, the
woman's husband committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Silas was asked where Mason's arrest ranked among the team's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of low on the Richter scale as far as I'm
concerned,'' Silas said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman could only shake his head at the news. Despite his own
history of troubles, he had been playing the best ball of his
career. As he bounced his 3-year-old son, Derrick Jr., on his lap,
Coleman struggled to explain how the team has still managed a 30-23
record through the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything that we've been through this year, we've
managed to stick together as a team and that's helped all of us
through it,'' he said before the game. Of Mason in particular,
Coleman said, ``We're more concerned about his well-being than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of Mason's arrest filtered in at the Nets' practice
site, Kendall Gill spoke of how an athlete is often in difficult
situations. He said that athletes had to be aware of that hazard
but that it was sometimes hard to walk away when confronted with
situations almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful when you go into bars, grocery stores,
even when you walk along the street,'' Gill said. ``You never know
when somebody is going to come up and try to start something with
you, say something smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas said he had concerns about Mason's being out so late. The
Hornets arrived in the area late Friday night, and the police said
Mason got to the bar after midnight. The police said the fight was
started by Mason's friends about 4:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very comforting to know that one of my players was
out that late, but they're grown men and you can't put a harness on
them and keep them in,'' Silas said. ``They should know better.
He's got to learn sooner or later that people are out there looking
for him, and regardless of whether he was at fault or not, it's not
a good situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason has a criminal record on assault and other charges in New
York, but Silas indicated surprise at the latest incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all indications, I didn't think that anything like this
would happen,'' Silas said. ``He's a model citizen of late, playing
well, lost a ton of weight, said he wasn't drinking anymore. So you
have to take him at his word. Perhaps he wasn't and he was just out
having a good time and these things happen, but he should know
better. I have to find out exactly what happened and then I'll
either let it go or he'll feel my rage.''

FORGOTTEN DICKSON IS HEALTHY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- His name is Jason ... Jason Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Remember him? The All-Star pitcher in 1997, who led the team in
innings pitched and tied for the team lead in wins and shutouts?
That Jason Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson missed all of 1999 recovering from surgery to repair a
torn labrum in his right shoulder. But he's back now, and healthy.
And out to prove he can be the same pitcher that went 13-9 in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a forgotten man,'' Dickson said. ``There were a lot of
articles written this winter about who would be in the rotation,
but it was like I was non-existent. But I've thrown several times
in camp and they can see how I'm throwing the ball. I think they're
starting to remember me again.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing 203 2/3 innings in 1997, Dickson pitched with a
sore shoulder in 1998, but managed to go 10-10. In the spring of
'99, it was discovered he had a torn labrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed it was tendinitis,'' Dickson said. ``I didn't know
what a torn labrum felt like. But what I thought was tendinitis
never went away. I battled through '98, but in spring training last
year I couldn't throw and I finally said something.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of relief that something was wrong. Because
then I knew it wasn't that I wasn't good anymore or I had lost my
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson said his shoulder is fine now and he doesn't see any
reason why he can't pitch again like he did in '97. But he has to
win a spot in the rotation first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can contribute a lot to the starting rotation,'' he
said. ``I know my arm is solid again and I'm throwing like I used
to throw. I'll do what I can to make sure they don't forget me
again.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Scioscia's philosophies of managing is stablizing the
catching position and emphasizing the importance of the catchers
working with pitchers. It's something he learned with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Dodgers -- they've had Roy Campanella, John
Roseboro, Steve Yeager, myself and Mike Piazza,'' Scioscia said.
``This is what they hammered into us for four decades, and you see
the success they've had in the organization. That's what we're
doing here now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hit 20 to 25 home runs a year, but if you couldn't
catch, they'd give you a third baseman's glove. In order to catch
you had to know the pitchers and work well with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad ''hit the (heck) out of the ball'' Saturday in his
first session of live batting practice, according to manager Mike
Scioscia. Erstad has been bothered by an inflammed left shoulder.
... The Angels will play their first intra-squad game of the spring
Tuesday. Scioscia is expected to announce the starting pitchers for
the game today.

Lakers vulnerable against Rockets
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
One would imagine that after four straight losses, the last team in
the world the Rockets would want to see on their schedule is the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers feature the three-pronged attack of Shaquille O'Neal,
Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice, a trio that averages 66.5 points per
game. And this is the same team that has won 10 straight, including
a six-game sweep of a recent Eastern Conference road swing. Yeah,
those Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they really are playing great,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``I think we're the last team to beat them. They have
a great race going in the Pacific there (with Portland). Shaq's
always a big concern, and there's no way we're going to be able to
stop him. Maybe we can knock down his efficiency a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have Kobe with his athletic plays, and then of
course you have Rice with his outside shooting. I think in the last
couple of weeks he's really exploded a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder if that same Lakers juggernaut isn't just
a bit leery of seeing the Rockets hit town, especially for today's
nationally televised game. After all, the Rockets have beaten the
Lakers in two of three games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try and stop Shaquille, Kobe and Glen,'' said
Steve Francis, who has averaged just under 22 points against the
Lakers. ``That's definitely a big task, but I think we have the
personnel who can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any opportunity that we get, we just have to come out and play
aggressively because they're aiming for the best record in the
league while we're just trying to continue to get better every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if they played the Lakers more often, the Rockets would be
much better. According to Hakeem Olajuwon, the NBA is all about
matchups, and the Rockets seem to give the Lakers problems in that
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bring him (O'Neal) out (from under the basket),''
Olajuwon said. ``That opens the floor so you can create. We have a
lot of guys who can put their heads down, drive and create. If Shaq
comes, then you can kick it out; if he doesn't, then make something
happen (inside). When you open the floor, then you force them to
play defense one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the team (the Rockets) is (built), with Steve
especially and then Cuttino (Mobley), and the way we move the ball
with pick-and-rolls, we make Shaq move. If we are successful in
doing that, then we have a very good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Which they have done twice this season, something only Portland,
which shares the best record in the NBA with the Lakers, has done.
The Rockets lost to the Lakers 89-88 at Compaq Center on Nov. 10,
but came back two days later to rout the Lakers 97-81 at Staples
Center. They played again Jan. 30, with the Rockets pulling out an
89-83 win.
</P>
<P>
   And they're going for win No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to think about the things we did to beat them,''
Francis said. ``We beat them twice, and the one time we lost to
them it was by one point. I think that just as much as we're aiming
for them, they're aiming for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been serious subplots in almost every game
between the teams this season. In the first meeting, Charles
Barkley, hoping to snap the Rockets out of an 0-4 start, bounced a
ball off O'Neal's head, sparking a wrestling match that forced both
to miss the rematch in Los Angeles because of suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing those two games was Bryant, who had broken a bone
in his right hand and sat out the first five games of the season.
But Bryant played in the January game, scoring 17 points. But with
Shandon Anderson and Mobley hounding him all over the court, Bryant
hit just six of 22 shots from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And now Anderson will chase Bryant again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that's just the way it is out here in the West,''
Anderson said. ``These (shooting) guards are always looking to
score, but out here in the West they're really hard to stop, like
Kobe. You have a big scorer every night. I never seem to get a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   And the other part of the puzzle is the defense of Walt Williams
on Rice. Huh? Walt Williams? Defense? But it's true. In the three
games he's played against the Rockets, Rice, one of the top
shooters in the league, has made only 11 of 34 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player who can score from a lot of different
places,'' Williams said of Rice. ``I just try to keep the ball out
of his hands and not let him get into scoring position. That's just
me playing against him for a lot of years and knowing what he likes
to do. I know his tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets know the Lakers' tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tough team, but for us, we just want to go out
there and play as a team, do the best we can and play our own
game,'' Olajuwon said. ``If we play our own game, then we have a
very good chance of winning the game.''

FOCUSED NETS CLOSE OUT THE HORNETS

</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For once, it wasn't the New Jersey Nets
who were embroiled in questions and controversy. Instead, they
played with poise and even exhibited a killer instinct Saturday
night as they pulled away for a 104-93 victory over the Charlotte
Hornets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nets finished the game with an 18-6 run in which the Hornets
struggled even to get a shot off. On the other end, the Nets took
turns slamming in dunks that had Charlotte ducking out of the way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, who have endured a season filled with tragedy and
turbulence, did not blink at the latest news, which came at their
morning shoot-around, that the starting forward Anthony Mason had
been arrested. While he went through processing in Manhattan,
charged with third-degree assault following an early morning bar
fight in Harlem, the Hornets took the floor without Mason at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Ellis was in the starting lineup, but Mason arrived at
Continental Arena midway through the first quarter and took the
floor midway through the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes he'll play,'' Hornets coach Paul Silas had said
before the game. ``That's what he's getting paid to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nets ignored the unusual circumstances and focused on this
game. The Nets improved to 22-33, still believing that they are not
out of the playoff hunt, 4 1-2 games out of the final Eastern
Conference spot, but starting a hard road trip Monday in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, a duel ensued between the Nets' former and
present franchise frontcourt players, Derrick Coleman and Keith Van
Horn. Coleman had 24 points and 10 rebounds, but Van Horn, playing
with uncharacteristic aggressiveness, had 29 points on 12-of-16
shooting and 11 rebounds. He even rose in the fourth quarter to
block a turnaround jumper by Coleman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was a block by the 6-foot-5-inch Kendall Gill against the
6-10 Coleman that helped secure the victory. After Coleman grabbed
a rebound of his own miss and attempted a dunk with just over two
minutes remaining and the Nets leading, 97-90, Gill soared from
behind and swatted away the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws on the other end by Stephon Marbury, who
finished with 21 points and 15 assists, finished off the Hornets,
who are 30-24. Gill added 23 points and nine rebounds for the Nets.
Mason completed his long day with just six points, all from the
free-throw line, missing his only two shots from the field in 28
minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mason finally arrived in the arena with 8 minutes 3 seconds left
in the first quarter, walking to the locker room accompanied by his
agent, Don Cronson. With 8:52 to play in the half, Mason, by then
in his uniform, walked to the bench, and he entered the game with
6:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   But he had little effect. The Hornets trailed, 37-34, when Mason
entered the game and were still behind by 56-50 at halftime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Mason's absence, Coleman carried the Hornets, scoring 16
points and grabbing six rebounds in the first half. Coleman has
sometimes been at the center of turbulence. But in the Hornets'
troublesome season, he has emerged as the star he was expected to
be since his career began as the No. 1 overall pick of the Nets in
1990. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 19 games the Hornets had played before Saturday night
since the death of guard Bobby Phills on Jan. 12, Coleman had
averaged 20.8 points on 50.7 percent shooting, 9.9 rebounds and 2.2
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just been on a tear here lately,'' Silas said. ``All I
know is he's producing and he kind of relishes the fact that we
count on him and he can produce.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, whose numbers had been in decline over the past four
seasons, joined the Hornets last year for a five-year, $40 million
contract, largely on the recommendation of Silas, who was an
assistant during Coleman's time in New Jersey. But Coleman dropped
30 pounds and has played with aggressiveness and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody changes,'' Coleman said. ``It's just growing up more
than anything. I try not to worry about things that I don't have
any control over. I just come out and play the game of basketball
and just enjoy it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has still had his moments. He started the season by
totaling his Range Rover in an Oct. 27 accident in which his
teammate Eldridge Recasner was seriously injured. Recasner
sustained a partially collapsed lung and returned to play only this
week. Coleman was charged with drunken driving, but was acquitted.

   It's one thing to be part of the buffet line that Tiger Woods
picks over at his leisure. At least you have a chance he might drop
the silverware. Or maybe he won't be hungry.
</P>
<P>
   But it's something quite different to get served up to Woods
when he's at his savage best, salivating with confidence, going for
a World Golf Championships Slam of sorts and armed with a margin
for error on top of it all.
</P>
<P>
   That will be Darren Clarke's mission today instead of Duval's.
</P>
<P>
   Woods held up his end of the bargain Saturday, winning his
quarterfinal and semifinal matches at the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship. All he did was go 8-under-par through 12 holes
in the afternoon while dusting Davis Love III 5 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Confident? Just ask Woods' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wakes up in the morning confident,'' said Butch Harmon.
``And he goes to bed at night confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, he just beats the tar out of people in his favorite
format, match play.
</P>
<P>
   And while there will be no dream matchup between Woods and Duval
today, it could be yet another confirmation that Woods has no equal
at this point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Duval fell 4 and 2 to Clarke, the roly-poly Northern Ireland
native, during the semifinals as Clarke made six birdies to only
one for Duval, who earlier in the day had stomped Scott Hoch 5 and
4 in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there seemed a more unlikely person to stop the Woods
steamroller, it is Clarke. He will present a striking contrast to
the slender, strong Woods today as he carries his ample,
apple-shapped body around 36 holes at the La Costa Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Clarke will have to do is negotiate Woods'
bubbling self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (his confidence) is pretty good right now,'' Woods said.
``That pretty much sums it up. This is the best I've played in a
while, which is nice. It was nice to go out there and execute the
golf shots the way I know I can and make a few putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Harmon: ``It's pretty hard to play better than he did
(Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   After two eagles and four birdies in the afternoon, which
followed a less-precise 1-up win over Paul Lawrie in the morning,
Woods could allow himself to smile about getting to the finals of
the $5 million tournament. Today's winner will take home $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods seems to be getting better with each round of this
tournament, he also will have the luxury of playing a 36-hole
final, rather than the 18 holes of the first five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said at the start of the week that anybody can beat anybody
over 18 holes,'' Clarke said. ``Over a 36-hole match, you're more
likely to get the best player to win. And, obviously, looking at
the rankings, Tiger is No. 1 and I'm No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'd say his chances would be increased over 36 holes.
That's the way it should work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's a little pre-emptive gamesmanship. Whatever,
Clarke said he plans on showing his face today despite long odds
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to play particularly well to have a chance
to beat him,'' Clarke said. ``Actually, I'm not sure how I'm going
to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark was in response to a mention of his
less-than-flattering physique. Harmon said he felt fatigue could be
a factor in today's final because of Clarke's lack of conditioning.
``Darren's a little overweight and we've been giving him (grief)
about it all week,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Clarke: ``He's been calling me all sorts of names. I
have to get into the gym, unfortunately. It doesn't appeal to me
much, but I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was going to bed early Saturday night, Clarke
replied: ``No. Just goes to show after all the hard work I've put
in this winter, my right arm is definitely stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   A few pints couldn't hurt against Woods, who obliterated Love on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Love had whipped Miguel Jimenez in the quarterfinals 3 and 2
when Love had five birdies and no bogeys. He had not made a bogey
in more than two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods dismantled Love with an eagle-3 at the second hole and
birdies at the fourth and fifth for a 3-up lead. Love won the sixth
hole with a 15-foot birdie putt, but Woods ended up shooting 30 on
the front nine and never let Love gasp for breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect him to do all that,'' Love said. ``He was
phenomenal. He never got himself in trouble and I never put any
pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Love didn't help himself when he missed a 15-foot birdie putt on
No. 7 that could have cut his deficit to one and may have tightened
the screws on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of game and a lot of confidence right now,''
Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clark was doing a similar takedown of Duval. He took
the lead for good with a birdie on the 10th and made a short birdie
putt on the par-5 12th to go 3-up and send Duval into the
consolation match today against Love.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, he will be going for his third $1 million payday.
Woods won the final two WGC events of '99, the NEC Invitational and
the American Express Championship. A win today would give him three
in a row on the global stage, a roundabout WGC Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I play against the best players in the world, it's
going to be more special than a regular Tour event, just because
normal Tour events don't have the best players in the world,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   None of whom have been able to handle him this week.

DOWNFALL OF A COP

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donning a 99-cent-store disguise, dirty cop Rafael
Perez nonchalantly stole cocaine from an LAPD evidence room for
several months without arousing suspicion, only to be caught
because of his own carelessness and arrogance, the Los Angeles
Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Perez made one severe error in March 1998, following his largest
narcotics heist _ he failed to replace the dope he had taken with
household flour as he had done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   According to confidential transcripts of Perez's testimony to
investigators and several sources close to the corruption
investigation, Perez had used the flour scam at least three times
before, eventually stealing a total about $1 million worth of
cocaine from the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Perez's arrest in August 1998, the LAPD overhauled
its policies governing access to evidence. Cops are no longer
permitted to remove narcotics, guns or money from evidence lockers,
said Lt. Sharyn Buck, a spokeswoman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now only let them take photographs of the evidence,'' Buck
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the changes were made, LAPD officials like those in many
other police jurisdictions allowed all materials to be signed in
and out through a flawed ``honor system,'' according to sworn
statements by Perez and investigators interviewed by the Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been anybody,'' Perez recalled in his first
interview with investigators last September. ``I could have sent a
civilian person in there. ... They don't check I.D. Anybody can
walk in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get a halfway respectable-looking person, put a badge
around his neck and tell him to go check it out. And they're gonna
give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking source close to the widening LAPD corruption
probe said preliminary reviews of the department's former
chain-of-custody procedures confirm Perez's bluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on the honor system,'' the source said. ``It was for
the convenience of the officers going to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who agreed to become an informant in exchange for a
lighter sentence for stealing the cocaine, was sentenced Friday to
five years in prison for the March 1998 heist, in which he scammed
the department out of eight pounds of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   After being credited with time in custody, he is likely to be
released within 10 to 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has told investigators he began stealing dope from the
Rampart Division evidence room in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a ``courier system'' allowed cops to sign out drugs
and other cataloged evidence for use in court cases. Following the
proceedings, the officer returned the materials to the evidence
room and received a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the narcotics which had been tested when
initially booked as evidence were not retested after officers came
back from court, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez tended to request cocaine that was scheduled to be
destroyed in the near future because department policy only
required random samplings of drugs prior to their destruction, said
an investigator who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Perez reduced the likelihood that anyone would pick
up on his thefts by writing other cops' names on the evidence room
sign-out sheet and wearing a low-budget disguise, official
documents reveal.
</P>
<P>
   He told investigators his typical getup featured ``Coke bottle
glasses,'' a ``really big jacket'' and a baseball cap pulled
tightly over his head.
</P>
<P>
   During the March 2, 1998, theft, Perez even left his badge at
home, using only the badge holder to gain entrance into the
evidence room, confidential transcripts obtained by the Daily News
show.
</P>
<P>
   After getting dressed up, Perez said, he would sign out the
drugs, stash the dope at a remote location, and then stuff the
evidence containers with flour and return them to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The clerks in charge of the evidence room never checked to see
whether the drugs were needed in court. Shortly after Perez's scam
was discovered in mid-March 1998, bags of flour were found in the
evidence room, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the details of Perez's scheme, Deputy District
Attorney Richard Rosenthal made an unusual observation during an
interview session with the ex-cop last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily want to say brilliant,'' Rosenthal said,
``but (this) was an excellent idea, if you're going to do something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, however, was not by any measure a master thief.
</P>
<P>
   During his first few thefts, Perez said he meticulously weighed
the flour and cocaine to avoid detection, then grew impatient and
``sort of just guess-timated.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez also refused to settle for just any cocaine and sought out
the best dope being held in the evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dope that I was either familiar with or had some
involvement with,'' he told investigators. ``And I knew that it was
going to be righteous dope.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Believing he would never get caught, Perez said, he failed to
switch the drugs with flour twice. ``I said there's no way they
would ever find out,'' he testified. ``I mean, if you really think
about it ... who would have ever known?''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Perez admitted, he got a bit spooked, and
burned the container he stole from the evidence room, making it
impossible to replace the cocaine with flour. No one noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The second slip-up involved his March 1998 theft, which was a
much bigger operation. Perez told investigators he spent so much
energy trying to figure out how to sign out the eight pounds of
cocaine that he didn't think about how he would get the flour back
into the evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was absolutely an impulsive thing,'' he said. ``It was
just something that like, wow, I can do this. I didn't think about
returning it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bogus name Perez used that day also led directly back to
him. He used the badge number for another Officer Perez, sources
close to the 1998 investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   When that officer was cleared, a full investigation was launched
thatled back to Perez. He was arrested in August 1998 and
investigators eventually learned that he had given the missing dope
to the mother of one of his unauthorized informants, who also
happened to be one of his girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   The mother was tired of using her family members as suppliers;
she felt she wasn't making enough money, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Policies like the LAPD's new, stricter guidelines governing
access to evidence are increasingly common, said Dave Sylstra, a
senior consultant to the California Commission on Peace Officer
Standards and Training.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement departments across the state have abandoned the
practice of letting officers sign out drugs, guns and other
evidence from evidence rooms for use during courtroom testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money, dope and guns are the three things that typically get
people in trouble,'' Sylstra added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the LAPD's former practice of trusting officers with
evidence is not unusual statewide, with some prosecutors and judges
requiring that the actual evidence be presented in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumption that if you book it and take custody of
it, you will maintain the chain of custody and properly handle
it,'' Sylstra said.
</P>
<P>
   Each law enforcement agency in the state is responsible for
setting its own standards to ensure the chain of custody is
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Since Perez began talking to investigators last September, he
has alleged that he and other cops shot and brutally assaulted gang
members, framed innocent people, and lied in court to win
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD has had no greater corruption scandal in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI officially entered the police corruption investigation
last week at the request of LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators initially thought the corruption involved
misconduct only within Perez's former anti-gang unit in the Rampart
Division, but recently have widened the scope of the probe to
include other divisions. To date, the investigation has resulted in
the suspension or dismissal of 20 cops and the reversal of 40
criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 civil lawsuits have been filed against the city,
seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, and an
increasingly public rift has developed between Parks and District
Attorney Gil Garcetti, with the chief and Mayor Richard Riordan
pushing prosecutors to file charges against dirty cops.
</P>
<P>
   While Perez failed a polygraph test, Parks has said 50
detectives working across the country have substantiated enough of
his story to request that the convictions of 99 defendants be
overturned. Thousands of other cases are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   A special LAPD Board of Inquiry, set up by Parks, is expected to
release next week the findings of its investigation into the
management and policy failures that allowed the rampant corruption
to occur and go unnoticed for at least three years. The board's
report is expected to call for sweeping changes in the Police
Department.

   LOS ANGELES _ The ease with which dirty cop Rafael Perez
mishandled evidence in the LAPD's chain of custody is likely to
taint the opinions of potential jurors for years to come, several
legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the stakes even more, defense attorneys are expected to
seize on the Los Angeles Police Department's lax oversight of
evidence before new policies were implemented in 1998, and file a
deluge of motions challenging the validity of materials entered
into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the practical effect of this being known by
future jurors is to make more credible defense arguments
challenging the chain of custody of evidence,'' said USC law
professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who agreed last week to conduct an
independent review of the LAPD corruption scandal at the request of
the police union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that everyone knows how easy it was for an officer to
tamper with or steal evidence, it will resonate with some jurors.
They are going to remember what they heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky predicted that Perez's admitted crimes will prompt
jurors to give greater credence to evidence-tampering theories, as
well as to arguments that suspects were framed by cops.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, dean of Loyola Law School, agreed, adding it
also ``opens up the possibility that defense attorneys will
exploit'' the jurors' impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customarily, defense attorneys don't even go into that area.
It is normally very difficult to challenge the chain of custody of
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levenson said, she's not convinced the argument will get
defense attorneys very far with judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens everything up for some attacks about the chain of
custody. Whether they're fruitful or not we will have to wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   When Perez stole cocaine from the LAPD Rampart Division evidence
room between December 1997 and March 1998, department policies
permitted cops to sign out narcotics for use during court
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD adopted more stringent rules in late 1998, four months
after Perez was arrested. The new regulations require officers to
use only color photographs of narcotics, rather than removing the
drugs from evidence rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the new policy in a Dec. 23, 1998, order, LAPD
officials contended the department made the changes because
narcotics are a ``hazardous material'' that should not be allowed
in court.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the widening LAPD corruption investigation
brushed off that rationale, saying: ``It was done because of
Perez.''

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif._ After lying comatose for a month following
complications from routine hernia surgery, Alan Cronin awoke in his
hospital bed to an unspeakable horror.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't find the words to express, and his family members
couldn't find the words to comfort him over what they all knew that
beneath the thick wrap of bandages, his hands and legs had been
amputated to halt the gangrene that had spread through his body.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since the quadruple amputation, the 39-year-old
father of three, determined to find a path to a fulfilling life,
has remarried and joined a rugby team, and recently, has even taken
his family skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came, he said, when he entered physical therapy
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and roomed with man who had
lost the use of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where I would laugh at him and he would
laugh at me when we couldn't do something during therapy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that sounds terrible, but you realize there is
absolutely no reason to be bummed out about it because you know
that if you do, your life is going to be that much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Now at peace with his loss, Cronin spends his days in grueling
physical and occupational therapy sessions. He spends several
minutes on a floor mat, struggling to put all four prosthetics on
by himself. The devices haven't yet been fitted correctly, and at
times cause him unbearable pain.
</P>
<P>
   Once he is ready, his therapists lift him to a standing position
and he is on his own. Using prosthetic hands fitted with canes that
extend to the floor, Cronin can now walk more than a quarter-mile
without help.
</P>
<P>
   Using hooks attached to the ends of his prosthetic arms, he has
learned to write, hold a telephone, turn pages in a book and brush
his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never complains. He just bites the bullet and gets the job
done,'' said Gary Quist, a physical therapist at Northridge
Hospital. ``He's never felt sorry for himself or really showed a
lot of grieving like people normally would. He's very strong-minded
and extremely positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin's ordeal began a little more than a year ago, when he
contracted a staph infection following routine surgery for a hernia
he suffered while moving furniture at work. Cronin slipped into a
coma as the infection progressed to gangrene in all his limbs _ a
condition that threatened his life unless doctors amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors gave him a 5 to 10 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   He awoke after a month, and his family just didn't have the
courage to tell him what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that he was heavily sedated, he thought his limbs were
there,'' said his wife, Maria, who was engaged to Cronin at the
time of his surgery. ``None of us wanted to have the responsibility
to tell him, `You don't have your legs.'''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and nurses who tended to Cronin told him, but he
said he was heavily sedated and their words seemed to be an
extension of the dreams he had dreamed while comatose.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he reached for the glass on his bedside table
and it fell to the floor that he realized something was wrong.
Although he sensed his hand opening, he could not make it grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking down and not seeing my legs,'' he said. ``I
never mentioned it to anybody. I knew, and I knew they knew. It
almost wasn't necessary to bring it up ... maybe because I didn't
want to talk about it and face it. I felt bad enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin refuses to talk much about the hernia surgery itself,
citing a malpractice lawsuit he has filed against doctors at Family
Healthcare Medical Group and Simi Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mari Zag, director of provider relations for Family Healthcare,
said the group ``believes at all times that we were providing
appropriate care to our patient in this case.'' She declined
additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley Hospital spokeswoman Alicia Gonzalez said she was
pleased to hear of Cronin's progress but could not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial hernia was work-related, all of Cronin's
medical costs are paid by worker's compensation insurance, which
also pays Maria to provide care around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Maria said she never considered calling off her marriage to
Cronin when she realized the extent of his medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not see my life going on without him,'' she said.
``It's like I wanted to be his backbone, to be that person that is
going to help him through this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's disabled but I don't see that. He can't do the things
that he used to do but his mind's there.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple met at Medical Data Electronics in Arleta, and worked
together for nearly a decade. They began dating in 1996, after
Cronin was divorced from his first wife, with whom he shares
custody of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The couple married last August, about eight months after his
ordeal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Their blended family _ Maria's daughters Jessica Ceballos, 22,
and Monica Chavez, 13, and his daughter Kendra, 8 _ had been living
together since spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They moved into another home in Simi Valley last fall, with a
pool, wide hallways and larger rooms so Cronin can deftly maneuver
his manual wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I think it's just a dream,'' said Maria, 41. ``I
never thought it would come to this. I thought he was just going to
be OK. ... Here's a person who is so healthy, he's never been sick.
To see him dying, you go into a mental block.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, who wrestled and played soccer and tennis at North Penn
High School in his native Philadelphia, recently took Maria and
their daughters on a ski trip, and he has joined a rugby team for
paraplegics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cronin's current goal is to get back as much physical
independence as he can, he also is considering activities that will
stimulate his mind and keep him busy.
</P>
<P>
   He's exploring new ways to channel his interest in electronics
and machinery. He knows he cannot go back to working on computers
because it requires dexterity he no longer has.
</P>
<P>
   But that suits Cronin, who's ready to try something different.
He sees few limits to his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can be a UPS driver,'' he joked, ``although
I've taken a few driving lessons.''

DEFYING EXPULSION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla, Md., Cuba, Switzerland) CUBAN ENVOY IS DEPORTED AFTER (UPDATES head, story with Imperatori being taken to Canada) 
(DW) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cuban diplomat ordered expelled last week by
the United States on spying charges gave up his diplomatic immunity
Saturday and challenged U.S. officials to arrest him so that he
could prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI thwarted the attempt by the diplomat, Jose
Imperatori, to argue his case from a jail cell by taking him
straight to Ronald Reagan National Airport for a flight to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the State Department, James Rubin, said that
Imperatori would be flown to Cuba from Canada on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori, who was not handcuffed, did not say anything as he
was escorted from his apartment by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary confrontation _ coming at a time when the
United States and Cuba are embroiled in a dispute over whether to
return a Cuban boy to his father in Cuba or allow him to stay with
relatives in Miami _ broke the normal standards of diplomatic
conduct, by which diplomats who become entangled in charges of
espionage and are told to leave the country would depart
voluntarily. Imperatori had said earlier through his lawyer that he
would not voluntarily leave the United States by Saturday
afternoon, the deadline he had been given. As a result, Rubin said
Saturday night, Imperatori ``has been expelled from the United
States for not voluntarily departing by the appointed time.''
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was identified by the Cuban interests section, which
represents the Cuban government in the United States, as the
diplomat who was accused of having been in contact with the
American immigration official charged last week with spying.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has insisted that Imperatori did nothing wrong and met with
the official on routine business.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori's lawyer, Kurt L. Schmoke, a former mayor of
Baltimore, said at Imperatori's apartment in Bethesda, Md., that
Imperatori would cooperate with any investigation and would be
willing to return to the United States to testify in the spy case.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Cuban interests section, Fernando Remirez de
Estenoz, said at a news conference Saturday that the arrest of the
American immigration official and the expulsion of Imperatori were
connected to the custody battle over the Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez.
The State Department has called such a link ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest and expulsion order, Remirez said, took place just
days before a court case concerning the boy, although the United
States contends that the charges involving Imperatori and the
American official ``went on for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration agent, Mariano M. Faget, is a senior official in
the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Remirez said that the accusations made against Imperatori and Faget
were false.
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori said in a letter to the head of the diplomatic
mission, Remirez:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am addressing you to submit my resignation, as of this
moment, to my position and functions in our beloved interests
section and to the prerogatives therein. I have decided to stay in
America, assuming all the necessary risks and consequences, to
struggle against the slanders that hurt my honor, and that of the
interests section in Washington and my own homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by Felix Wilson Hernandez, the deputy chief
of the diplomatic mission, Imperatori said: ``I have become the
victim of a major slander. I have been wrongly accused of doing
intelligence work in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one factor compelling him to waive his diplomatic
immunity and stay in the United States was his wish to disprove the
accusations against Faget.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government had issued an expulsion order for Imperatori
last Saturday, giving him until 1:30 p.m. Saturday to leave or face
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could have avoided arrest by staying inside the
interest section _ an embassy in all but name that operates under
the auspices of the Swiss Embassy in Washington _ he chose instead
to spend Saturday at his apartment, where it would be easy to
arrest him. Schmoke pointedly gave out the street address and
apartment number at a televised news conference saturday .
</P>
<P>
   Imperatori was first accused of espionage after the FBI arrested
Faget and charged him with espionage on Feb. 17

 MANY SNITCHES STILL DOING CRIME  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND PAT FLANNERY 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Phoenix) - Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia underboss turned
government snitch, may be the most notorious example of a growing
problem for America's justice system: protected witnesses who
return to crime under the noses of law-enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano joined the federal Witness Protection Program nine years
ago after his arrest in connection with 19 murders, loan-sharking,
illegal gambling and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony put Gambino family boss John Gotti and 39 others
behind bars, making heroes of FBI agents, federal prosecutors and
Gravano himself.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now believe his transition from mobster to mole did
not produce a model citizen. They say the former hit man directed a
syndicate dealing in Ecstasy, a designer drug, with the help of a
suburban White supremacist gang.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't officials know?
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's 1991 plea agreement says he is subject to prosecution
for all past crimes if he engages in future illegal activities. It
also provided for Sammy ``the Bull'' to get a new name (Jimmy
Moran), a new home (Tempe) and a new life as a construction
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, the judge praised the mobster for a ``commendable
and remarkable contribution'' to society and for his commitment to
a crime-free life.
</P>
<P>
   After Gravano's release from prison five years ago, he helped
convict Vincent ``the Chin'' Gigante, and he agreed to testify in a
jury-tampering trial scheduled to begin this April.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in return sought to protect Gravano and his secret life.
In July, after The Arizona Republic discovered Gravano in the
Phoenix area, agents in New York and Phoenix pressed the newspaper
not to publish a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano agreed to an interview in which he boasted of a
friendship with government agents. Gravano said he was being
monitored by U.S. marshals, and he spoke of regular phone contact
with FBI agents. He said that was a reason he felt safe despite a
purported $1 million price placed on his head by La Cosa Nostra.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNMENT WITNESS &QL; 
Joe Valiquette, spokesman for the FBI's New York office, said it
would be a mistake to think agents were overseeing Gravano despite
their contact. Valiquette stressed that Gravano had left the
Witness Protection Program, was no longer on parole and was not on
the bureau's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has not been protecting Mr. Gravano,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Gerard Gravano told a judge his dad was still
``dealing with the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Gravano lawyer Larry Hammond said his client has been
``punctilious in the performance of his duties'' for federal
officers but would not comment on his relationship with the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Morrissey, former chief U.S. marshal in Phoenix, rejected
the notion that agents have befriended Sammy Gravano or visited him
on vacation, as Gravano has claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' said Morrissey, who retired while
Gravano was in prison here. ``I would say that's absolute bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who once headed the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Arizona, said he doubts that anyone ``looked the
other way'' or gave the former mobster immunity. Rather, he said,
it is likely that Gravano's ``semi-secret role'' with the
government created confusion and communication breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't know a snitch is dealing,'' Arpaio added.
``He's making cases and working on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another unusual aspect to the arrest of Gravano, his
family and about 30 others: The FBI did not take part in the
eight-month investigation or the raids.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite Gravano's ongoing role as a federal witness,
Justice Department officials were not apprised of the operation
until three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis K. Burke, special assistant attorney general, said
Gravano's fate would hinge, in part, on ``his further use within
the federal system.'' Burke also acknowledged that it was odd that
FBI officials had not been given an early call.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Napolitano insisted that she never had
misgivings about the FBI's links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we followed standard operating procedure,'' the former
U.S. attorney for Arizona said. ``I was not concerned that the FBI
or any other federal agency would do anything inappropriate with
the information they had.''
</P>
<P>
   CORRUPTED JUSTICE? &QL; 
Critics point to Gravano as the most infamous evidence of a system
corrupted by unholy alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the FBI could not observe any of these illegal acts right
under their watchful eyes _ while they're protecting their (top)
informant _ just doesn't pass the smell test,'' said James Ridgeway
de Szigethy, a writer who runs a Mafia Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Elliot Weinstein described Gravano as a
``high-profile example of our government's misuse of cooperative
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad guys lie, cheat and steal until they get caught, he said,
until they get ``flipped'' by the government. Then they lie about
other bad guys in court. And, when it's all over, they go back to
lying, cheating and stealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the bright line between sanctioning criminal
misconduct and not pursuing criminal misconduct?'' Weinstein asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cutler, a New York lawyer who represents Gotti, said
Gravano is typical of informers who have committed crimes that were
as bad or worse than those they informed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) make sweetheart contracts with ambitious prosecutors
(who) must put their man in jail,'' he said. ``In order to do that,
they'll make a pact with anyone for whatever they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said government agents give the cooperative witness a
lenient sentence, then ``relocate him in some unsuspecting
community and absolve him of what he did wrong. . . . They are true
to no one but themselves. Greed is their idol. But then, when
they're called before the man, they say, `Who, me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could change the policy, he said, but
prosecutors don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he plans to appeal Gotti's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Hochheiser, a Brooklyn lawyer, said he expects his
client to beat the government on charges of jury tampering in
Gotti's 1987 trial, because the prosecution's chief witness is
Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   Hochheiser said he doesn't believe the authorities allowed
Gravano to commit crimes in Arizona. Rather, he expects to use
Gravano's deception of the FBI as proof that Gravano has no
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muller, an executive assistant U.S. attorney in New York,
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   A ROGUES GALLERY &QL; 
Michael Black, a Phoenix lawyer, said he believes it is not
uncommon for law-enforcement officers to look the other way when an
important snitch violates the law.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A hidden crime wave ignored or allowed by
authorities. Some examples, here and nationwide, are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega sold narcotics information to
U.S. officials even as he protected major cocaine cartels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, informer Michael Sanders helped convict Timothy Ring in
the robbery-murder of a Phoenix armored-car driver. Ring was an FBI
informer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sanders was arrested with others who, posing
as bounty hunters, killed two Phoenix area residents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, ``Hurricane'' Maria Polkowski arranged at least 50
drug buys and was paid $560,000 by the DEA. The fact that she
routinely perjured herself came out when a corrupt agent cut a plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, a Phoenix pilot, was on the DEA's payroll for
eight years before anyone learned that he had laundered $75 million
in Colombian drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents admit that the use of paid snitches and
``flipped'' criminals can be treacherous but insist that the
practice is a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies have strict policies that prohibit fraternization
with snitches and prohibit any crimes except those performed to
further an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, rules quickly become gray. Informers are capable
liars and actors. Many are bright and charismatic. They work with
law officers who rely on them to bring down criminals.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTED BY THE FEDS One of the most glaring examples involves
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifle'' Flemmi, longtime
Boston Irish mob members indicted in 1995 on charges ranging from
racketeering to extortion.
</P>
<P>
   They worked for years as top informers until their handler, FBI
agent John J. Connolly Jr., retired in 1990. Connolly was indicted
in December for what prosecutors say was granting criminal carte
blanche to Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolfe's ruling condemned the
FBI's overall informer policies and practices in the bureau's
Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf traced the problem to then-Attorney General Robert
Kennedy's fixation with infiltrating La Cosa Nostra in the
mid-1960s, when Flemmi was recruited as an informer. For the next
25 years, he and Bulger ran their rackets while the FBI turned a
blind eye to it. &QL;

MARCHERS RALLY AGAINST DIALLO VERDICT, TAUNTING THE POLICE ALONG
THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
   (With NYPD-DIALLO, DIALLO-JUDGE, and DIALLO-JURY) 
(rk) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a day of relative quiet, a Midtown Manhattan
rally to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo turned into a fast-moving march
Saturday, with more than 2,000 protesters sweeping down Fifth
Avenue and one large group marching about four miles to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The group of sometimes angry but mostly peaceful demonstrators
grew along their meandering route as some bystanders, saying they
were troubled by the verdict, joined the march. The roughly
five-hour trek, marked by taunts directed at the police and a few
scattered scuffles, began shortly after 3 p.m. at 59th Street and
Fifth Avenue across from the Plaza Hotel, where some protesters
climbed onto the dry Pulitzer Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   One group that later marched to City Hall was met by a cordon of
hundreds of helmeted officers who formed a line behind the
wrought-iron fence that rings City Hall Park. There, the
protesters, standing on the broad sidewalk, directed their anger
and frustration at the officers who stood between them and City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some held their wallets in the air, yelling, ``This is not a
gun,'' referring to testimony by the four officers who said they
shot Diallo because they mistook a wallet he held for a gun. The
four, who fired 41 bullets, hitting Diallo 19 times, were acquitted
Friday in the Feb. 4, 1999 shooting of the 22-year-old immigrant
peddler from Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd chanted ``Impeach Giuliani.'' One man
screamed, ``19 times, you sick murderers, you should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Takiya Stewart, 24, of Brooklyn, said she had just bought a
sweater for herself and a hat for her son at a Gap store on West
Fourth Street in Greenwich Village when the protesters marched by.
``We were shopping in the Village and we saw the protesters and we
decided to join them,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Galinsky, 35, who works for an Internet company, said
that he received an e-mail message last week that simply read,
``Four officers acquitted. 59th and Fifth. 3 p.m. Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel, like as white person I had to show up to show that
it's not just a racial issue, it is a human issue,'' he said.
``There needs to be accountability and as a white person, I wanted
to show that I support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, as the mostly young, multiracial crowd
marched down Fifth Avenue, hundreds of officers stood shoulder to
shoulder in front of stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   The large procession filled the avenue, prompting the police to
shut down traffic, and some groups of demonstrators broke into a
run. The move forced a column of police vans, patrol cars and
motorcycles, lights and sirens blaring, to race ahead of the crowd
to halt traffic so protesters did not mix with moving cars.
</P>
<P>
   With their numbers eventually climbing as high as 2,500, by some
estimates, the demonstrators tried to turn west at 42nd Street and
march to Times Square. But their path was blocked by a phalanx of
police officers, standing shoulder to shoulder, that stretched
across the thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few scattered scuffles, including one at Bryant
Park, when some someone in the park hurled something at the police.
The police said Saturday night that 87 protesters were arrested,
mostly for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the demonstrators appeared well organized, with walkie
talkies equipped with headsets that they used to communicate with
one another and keep track of the police and different parts of the
protest group.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the city Saturday, residents reacted mostly with
calm, sadness and, in many quarters, a determination to take
constructive steps so that the death of Diallo would not be in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem Saturday morning, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had
escorted Diallo's parents through the events of the last year,
spoke to a gathering of about 300 peaceful but shaken people,
urging them to use the verdict as a rallying cry in the fight
against police brutality. At his side was Kadiatou Diallo, Diallo's
mother, who thanked the crowd for its support and said it was time
for her to return to the people who need her most, her three other
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something has to be done, because people have to live
together with the police,'' Diallo said. ``We don't want to see
this happen ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference Saturday morning, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani praised New Yorkers for remaining calm after the verdict,
which cleared the officers of all crimes, from murder down to
reckless endangerment of bystanders. Accompanied by Police
Commissioner Howard Safir, the mayor called on the Department of
Justice to decide quickly whether it would bring federal civil
rights charges against the four officers, insisting that no such
federal charges were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try these men a second time for charges they have been
found not guilty, you would have to find a gross miscarriage of
justice in the way the trial was carried out in Albany,'' the mayor
said. ``I have watched a good deal of the trial myself, and
listened to lots of impartial experts, and it seems to me this was
a full, complete and fair trial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Largely, it was a day like any other Saturday, with most New
Yorkers, even along Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, where Diallo had
lived and died, going about their regular chores and activities.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors and the police officers in the case continued their
vow of silence, for the most part refusing to talk with reporters
and staying out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   As he had after the verdict was announced on Friday, Giuliani
appeared somber, speaking in an uncharacteristically soft voice,
and repeating his earlier condolences to the Diallo family. But he
devoted more of his comments Saturday to a defense of the police,
and praise for the jury trial system.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said a departmental investigation of the Diallo shooting,
which had been prevented until now by the criminal case against the
four officers, would begin. All four officers will remain assigned
to desk jobs and will not be allowed to carry firearms until the
investigation is concluded, said Marilyn Mode, a department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could lead to the dismissal of one or all of
the officers if they are found to have violated departmental
guidelines on discharging weapons. Safir refused to say how long
the investigation would take, but Mode said she expected it would
be completed in a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Sharpton said the verdict was a new beginning in the
fight against police brutality. He called for a federal
investigation of the case and said the verdict was simply a detour
on the way to justice.
</P>
<P>
   At the headquarters of his advocacy group, the National Action
Network, as he gave his weekly radio address, Sharpton told the
crowd that excessive force had been used when the four officers
fired 41 bullets at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Rodney King multiplied by lead,'' he said, referring
to the 1991 beating by Los Angeles police officers of a black
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton spoke of the need for a federal review of the case, to
see whether the prosecution had been properly conducted and whether
the jury had received proper instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou Diallo and all of us have the right to stand in the
vestibule,'' he said. ``And what this verdict said is that we don't
have the right to stand in our own home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton urged concerned citizens to meet at the United Nations
at 1 p.m. Sunday, calling the shooting death an international
rights violation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Sharpton and Diallo have called for crowds to remain
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who want us to take to the street so other
reckless cops can take target practice on our children,'' Sharpton
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo thanked those assembled for their support. She said that
for her, the most painful part of the four-week trial had been
listening to officers recount how her son had remained standing
after they fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the bullet has no effect on my son's body, that they say
he was standing still after they fired 41 bullets at him, that was
the most difficult time for me,'' she said, ``because even if
someone slaps your son, you would be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1157 Wheeler Avenue, where Diallo was shot, about 50
demonstrators held signs and passed out fliers denouncing police
brutality. They represented a variety of groups, including a
Marxist group, the Spartacist League, the New Black Panther Party
and a group calling itself Refuse and Resist. One group,, the
Rising Voices Coalition, called for the Bronx district attorney,
Robert Johnson, to resign for failing to win convictions against
the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The police, meanwhile, milled about on the corner of Wheeler and
Westchester Avenues, a bustling thoroughfare in the Soundview
neighborhood of the Bronx, where Diallo was killed. The
demonstration was decidedly calmer and less eventful than protests
in the neighborhood on Friday night, after the verdict had been
read.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Newark, 200 people rallied at the corner of Broad
and Market Streets, sponsored by the People's Organization for
Progress, and later marched to the Peter W. Rodino Federal
Building. Lawrence Hamm, coordinator of the group, called for a
general strike on May 19, the birthday of the slain Muslim leader
Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri Baraka, the Newark poet and editor of Unity and Struggle,
a monthly newspaper, criticized the verdict, and the decision to
move the trial to Albany. ``That's the Klan's court,'' he said.
``The Klan have gone indoors. The Klan wears blue uniforms now.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officers acquitted in the shooting _ Sean Carroll,
37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27 _
did not speak publicly about the case Saturday.

   LOS ANGELES _ The obstacles from Oregon have been removed. The
path to March Madness is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal has to be the biggest game of the season - we (begin
ital)have to(end ital) win that game,'' UCLA senior Sean Farnham
said. ``They beat us here, and now we have to take one back. It'll
be another test of our character. We passed the first two this

   UCLA dispatched Oregon State 69-59 Saturday before 9,759 in
Pauley Pavilion, thus placing the weight of its postseason on
Thursday's showdown at Cal.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of qualifying for the NCAA Tournament, it's probably
the most important game the Bruins have played since the final
weekend of the 1980 regular season, when Larry Brown's 15-9 team
swept Cal and Stanford on the road, secured a last-minute bid, then
charged to the NCAA title game.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: The Bruins (15-11, 6-8) must win three of their last
four games to reach the 18-victory plateau that probably would
secure a tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   If they defeat Cal and the lowly Washington schools in Pauley
(March 9 and 11), they'll have their 18.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose in Berkeley, they must either beat No. 1 Stanford
in Maples Pavilion (unlikely) or snare a bid with 17 wins (also
unlikely).
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal will be a big-time game,'' said Bruins guard Ray Young, an
Oakland native. ``As long as we keep our focus like we did this
week, we'll be OK. We have a sense of urgency to make the
tournament by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Urgency won't be the only thing in UCLA's luggage. After their
first back-to-back wins this month, the Bruins have a speck of
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   They played with poise and control against both Oregon schools.
They executed their offense in late-game situations, they limited
turnovers (27 in two games) and they shot 50 percent from the field
(two games ).
</P>
<P>
   Guard Earl Watson was the best player on the court Thursday and
again Saturday - his weekend totals: 41 points, 14 rebounds, six
assists, four turnovers - but his support came from varying
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jason Kapono, who scored 15 points and made several
critical jumpers Thursday, had seven points Saturday - his lowest
total since Dec. 22 against Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins survived without Kapono's typical production
because guard Ray Young played smothering defense, because forward
Matt Barnes was quietly effective (three assists, three rebounds),
and because guard Ryan Bailey played one of the best games of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey scored a season-high 11 points, he did not miss from the
field, and he drained two 3-point baskets during UCLA's decisive
15-0 surge midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have been laying off me,'' Bailey said. ``I know I can
shoot them. I had to make the defense honor me.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Dan Gadzuric was effective against Oregon (11 points,
seven rebounds) but played sparingly against Oregon State (eight
minutes) _ in part because of sore knees, but mostly because coach
Steve Lavin simply didn't use him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that he couldn't play,'' Lavin said. ``I was
searching for combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Given UCLA's horrific rebounding and post defense in the first
half, benching Gadzuric was a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins jumped to a 25-15 lead, then shifted into neutral as
Oregon State scored 11 consecutive points. Center Jason Heide did
what he pleased in the low post, and the Beavers, the worst
offensive rebounding team in the league, grabbed 14 offensive
rebounds to UCLA's 10 defensive.
</P>
<P>
   OSU shot 38 percent in the first half but held a 33-32 lead
because it had 11 more field goal attempts than UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot of buckets in the red zone (low post), and
coach Lavin went after us about it,'' Young said. ``In the second
half, our guards pressured the ball so they couldn't make easy
passes into the post, and our big men played in front of their
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Heide didn't score in the second half, and the
Beavers grabbed just four offensive rebounds. With forward Jerome
Moiso playing his best game in weeks (16 points, eight rebounds),
the Bruins didn't need Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last eight minutes of the first half, when we took the
lead, we got the ball inside on every possession,'' Beavers coach
Eddie Payne said. ``In the second half, they did a better job
taking that away. Their defense in the post was the area they
improved the most.''

VISIT TO DEFENSE LAWYERS TESTS EVENHANDED IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (With NYPD-DIALLO, DIALLO-JURY, DIALLO-PROTEST) 
(rk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In the hours after their sweeping courtroom triumph on Friday,
the lawyers who defended the four police officers in the Amadou
Diallo case gathered at the Albany bed-and-breakfast that has been
their home for the past month. They soon had an unexpected guest:
the trial judge, Joseph C. Teresi.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers would not comment on the visit to the
bed-and-breakfast, the State House, but a person familiar with it
said that Teresi, of the state Supreme Court, had thanked the
lawyers for their cooperation during the trial and said they were
welcome to try a case in Albany any time. The person said the
lawyers had not invited the judge, and the officers, who were with
their families, were not present.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi made no similar overture to the prosecution, according to
Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office,
a fact that is certain to raise eyebrows, and perhaps ire, given
the widespread criticism of the verdict. The Rev. Al Sharpton and
others have cited the wide latitude the judge gave the defendants
in claiming legal justification for their actions as one possible
factor in the trial's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said, ``We find it hard to believe, but if it's true it's a
matter that should be reviewed by the Commission on Judicial
Conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresi could not be reached for comment Saturday night. But an
Albany official who has known the judge for many years said, when
told of the visit, that it was in keeping with his character. ``He
is a really compassionate guy, and once it was no longer
prohibitive to do that I guess he would like to express some
emotion to the officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the judge's visit was not unethical _ but
rather ill-advised. ``There is no judicial ethics rule that was
violated by talking'' to the defense lawyers, said Stephen Gillers,
a vice dean and professor at the New York University School of Law,
``but it creates a bad taste so soon after the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was one of several actions by the judge on Friday that
seemed to undercut the even-handed and even-tempered reputation he
had established during the course of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   He began the morning by announcing that he had barred a
reporter, Julia Campbell of FoxNews.Com, from the courtroom and
courthouse because a court officer found a tape recorder in her
bag. Teresi announced in court that he would return the tape
recorder only if Campbell's supervisor came up from New York City
to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Refet Kaplan, managing editor FoxNews.Com, said Saturday: ``It
was an honest misunderstanding. We realize that in these kinds of
high-profile trials officers of the court often work under a great
deal of pressure. Judge Teresi called us yesterday afternoon before
the verdict came in to discuss the situation. We appreciated his
call and we consider the matter closed.'' The tape recorder was
returned without a trip to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi demonstrated no love of the media during the trial. He
refused, for example, to allow reporters to view the exhibits in
the trial, which are normally considered part of the public record.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Teresi refused to allow David Bookstaver, the
communications director for the Office of Court Administration, to
leave his chambers for about a half-hour after the jury reached a
verdict, and before it was announced in the courtroom, according to
a courthouse official. The official said he believed the judge had
been worried that the verdict would leak before it was read in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Two sheriff's deputies took away Bookstaver's cellular phone and
would not let him leave the judge's chambers until about 20 minutes
before the verdict was read, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstaver would not comment on the incident except to say it
was ``unacceptable,'' and that he was seeking legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the verdict leaked out anyway. The courthouse
official said that an Albany law enforcement official gave at least
one member of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association who was in the
back of the courtroom a heads-up on the verdict before it was
announced.

CANADA FACES COLOMBIA IN FINAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Canada, ranked 85th in the world by FIFA, will try
to finish its incredible run when it meets South American finalist
Colombia in the Gold Cup championship today at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum beginning at noon, with only a few thousand
expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, guaranteed a spot in the next FIFA Confederations Cup as
the champion of the North, Central America and Carribean region,
earned a date to the finals after opening group play with
back-to-back draws, then winning a coin flip over South Korea to
reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Canada then went on to defeat three-time Gold Cup champion
Mexico in the quarterfinals, before defeating Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 1-0
Thursday to advance to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Craig Forrest, named to the Gold Cup, ``Best 11,''
team Friday, has been Canada's most dominant figure. Canadian
defender Jason DeVos and striker Carlos Corrazin were also named to
the Gold Cup all-tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians, having had their share of disappointment in
recent years, advanced to the championship by defeating the United
States in penalty kicks, and a 2-1 victory over Peru in the
semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian midfielder Jorge Bolanos will miss the final after
collecting his second yellow card against Peru. Defender Carlos
Fernando Asprilla left the team to join his club team back home. He
will be replaced by Manuel Alexander Fernandez. &QL;

DE LA HOYA WINS IN KNOCKOUT OVER COLEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derrell Coley did a lot of talking before his fight
against Oscar De La Hoya Saturday night at Madison Square Garden.
He fumed that he had been ignored. He said he was going to destroy
De La Hoya, because De La Hoya had made him wait so long for a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But anger and talk can get a boxer only so far. Ultimately it
comes down to talent, skill and punching power as De La Hoya proved
Saturday night by knocking out Coley with a crushing left hand to
the body at the end of the seventh round before a crowd of 13,814
at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (32-1) controlled the fight almost from start to
finish and it became evident that Coley (34-2-2) was in over his
head. The victory sets up the possibility of a rematch with Felix
Trinidad, who handed De La Hoya his only professional loss in a
controversial majority decision in Las Vegas on Sept. 18. Trinidad
will fight David Reid, the World Boxing Association
superwelterweight champion, in Las Vegas on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the beginning,'' De La Hoya said. ``I said my
plans for me were four fights, four knockouts. No disrespect to
Coley, he was the first. I've got three more knockouts coming this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley was tentative to start, and in the first couple of rounds
it seemed he could not figure out what he wanted to do. De La Hoya
was not using his jab, but he was putting his punches together in
combinations, and he was landing effectively to Coley's body. De La
Hoya was catching most of Coley's punches on his gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Coley woke up in the fourth round and landed a straight right
hand that rocked De La Hoya. The crowd went wild. But De La Hoya
came back and wobbled Coley with a left under the chin. De La Hoya
continued the barrage, but he could not finish off Coley. By the
sixth round De La Hoya had found his jab and was putting it to good
use. Coley's right eye had begun to swell from the constant
pounding of De La Hoya's jab. It ended in the seventh round with De
La Hoya's powerful shot to Coley's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me with a body shot right down the middle,'' Coley
said. ``He didn't do anything that surprised me. But I wasn't as
strong as I thought I was going into the fight. I could have got
up, but I didn't have it in me. I was too weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley said he could not see out of his right eye and he could
not breathe. The bout against Coley, the World Boxing Council No. 1
contender, was an eliminator for the championship. If Trinidad wins
the bout against Reid, he will have to vacate the WBC welterweight
title or fight De La Hoya in a rematch. Under the framework of a
deal that was worked out between Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter,
and Don King, Trinidad's promoter, De La Hoya could keep the WBC
welterweight title if he won or lost the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Coley had trained for about three months for this bout and he
had promised to make De La Hoya pay for making him wait 19 months
for the opportunity to fight him. The question was whether Coley
could harness that anger and use it to fuel him to victory. He
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-feature bout of the night, Arturo Gatti (31-4) lived
up to his nickname, Thunder, with a devastating knockout of Joey
Gamache (55-4) at 41 seconds of the second round in a
junior-welterweight bout. Gatti had knocked down Gamache twice in
the first round, sending him through the bottom rope with a hard
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti landed a vicious left hook to the jaw after the bell
sounded. Gamache came out shaky in the second round and Gatti
nailed Gamache with a left hand that backed him up. Gatti threw a
right uppercut that snapped Gamache upward, then he followed with a
left-right combination that sent Gamache falling backward to the
floor. The back of Gamache's head hit the canvas as he fell and
Referee Benji Estaves waved the fight off as soon as Gamache hit
the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, who officially weighed in at 141 pounds on Friday,
entered the ring weighing 160 pounds. According to CompuBox punch
statistics, Gamache landed just 12 punches in the short fight.
Gamache walked out of the ring, but was taken to St. Vincent's
Hospital for a precautionary CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect the fight to end that quickly,'' Gatti said.
``I feel stronger than ever. After the first round I knew I was too
strong for him. The jab opened up opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti said he wanted to fight for a world championship at 140
pounds by November, possibly against Kostya Tszyu, the WBC
140-pound champion.  &QL;
