<HEADLINE> World Bank Concerned About Women's Education In Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is concerned
about girls' and women's limited access to education in
sub-Saharan Africa, it said in a study conducted recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of "World Bank News" reaching
here today, the study, called "Girls and Schools in sub-Saharan
Africa: from Analysis to Action", provides an exhaustive summary
of current knowledge concerning the obstacles to girls' schooling
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It also presents practical ways of using this knowledge to
design projects that can reduce the gender gap in education.
</P>
<P>
Promoting female education remains the biggest challenge
because it is becoming increasingly clear that educating girls is
crucial for social and economic development in Africa, it says.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests more schools be built, more female teachers
be trained and gender bias in textbooks be removed.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Recalls Its Ambassador to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today recalled its
ambassador to Greece, Umit Pamir, for consultations over
Turkish-Greek relations, recently strained over territory in the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the Foreign Ministry accused Greece of
adopting a hostile attitude against Turkey and attempting to
distort Turkey's image in the European countries.
</P>
<P>
"If Athens will continue its hostile policy, it will take the
responsibility of any negative outcomes," said Turkish Foreign
Minister Deniz Baykal in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey staged a military confrontation at the end
of last month over the disputed islet of Kardak, or Imia in Greek,
in the Aegean Sea. A conflict was prevented after U.S. President
Bill Clinton mediated between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's move came in response to Greek efforts to secure
European Union's endorsement of its position in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted on taking the case to the International
Court of Justice while Turkey has advocated settling the dispute
through bilateral negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Appeals For Support In Dispute With Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today urged
international organizations and personalities to prevail on
Cameroon to "stop unnecessary attacks on the Nigerian soldiers".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Director of Nigerian Defense
Information Fred Chijuka said "all well-meaning bodies and
individuals all over the world should appeal to Cameroon to learn
to live as a good neighbor".
</P>
<P>
He declared his country to be always showing "the desire to
maintain cordial relationship with all her neighbors, including
Cameroon".
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman, however, emphasized that Nigeria took
exception to the "unprovoked attacks" on its troops in the
disputed Bakassi Peninsula, which he explained necessitated the
recent counterattack from the Nigerian military.
</P>
<P>
He accused Cameroonian forces of continuing "to harass and
attack" the Nigerian soldiers stationed in Bakassi, where troops
on both sides suffered casualties in clashes early this month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Nigeria and Cameroon met in northern Togo
on February 16-17 and agreed to stop fighting in the potentially
oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to hold talks in early March to
prepare a summit between the heads of state of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Orders Halt of F-14 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The crash of a U.S. Navy
F-14 fighter in the Gulf region today caused the Pentagon to order
all of the high-performance military planes worldwide to stop
flying for at least three days.
</P>
<P>
This was the third F-14 crash in less than a month. Just last
Sunday, a Navy F-14D fighter during exercises crashed into the
Pacific Ocean about 120 miles off the southern California coast,
killing its two crew members. The other crash happened on January
29, with an F-14A slamming, shortly after takeoff, into a
residential area in Nashville, Tennessee, killing five people
including its two crew members.
</P>
<P>
In today's crash involving an F-14A, its two crew members were
pulled from the sea by rescue teams and taken to the aircraft
carrier USS Nimitz about 30 miles away. They received minor
injuries, a U.S. Navy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Because this marked the third crash of an F-14 in less than a
month, the Navy decided to call a "standdown" for all F-14s around
the world, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three days, during which all F-14s in the U.S.
Navy fleet will be grounded, a special team of Navy safety and
engineering experts will review all aspects of the three recent
crashes and report to the Navy Chief of Operation, according to
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Today's crash was the 32nd F-14 to go down since 1991. The
F-14, also known as "Tomcat" built by Grumman Corp. to replaced
the F-4 Phantom II, is U.S. Navy's first-line, carrier-based
fighter aircraft designed to attack enemy aircraft in all weather
conditions. It has been in service for 25 years and the number of
accidents involving this sophisticated military plane has
increased since the 1990s. The aircraft has three models, with the
"A" model being the most heavily used. There were 212 F-14As in
service before today's crash. Also in service are 79 "B" models
and 47 "D" models of the F-14.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Denies Suspending Loans To Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
denied suspending loans to Swaziland because of political unrest
in the kingdom, Swazi Finance Minister Derek Von Wissel said
today in Mbabene, capital of Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report last week quoted the World Bank employee
Hassan Imam as saying that the bank had indefinitely suspended
its assistance to Swaziland due to uncertainty following a recent
national stayaway.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Von Wissel said the report had brought some
bad effects to the Swazi economy.
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions last month called a
nationwide strike to demand for a lifting of 23-year ban on free
political activity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day strike caused the kingdom's economy to a
standstill, with the complete closing of factories and business.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, the only southern Africa country where political
activity was banned by a royal decree, is a small land-locked
kingdom surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Iran Proposes Compromise Draft Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati proposed here today a draft text for a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which he described as a
possible compromise that could help move the ongoing talks
forward.
</P>
<P>
The 63-page draft text was introduced this morning by Velayati
to the Conference on Disarmament, the single multilateral
disarmament forum which seriously started negotiating a nuclear
test ban treaty in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Velayati urged the conference to continue to
search for ways to start negotiations in a bid to reach an
agreement for a total elimination of all nuclear weapons within a
time-bound framework, which is a common ground of all Non-Aligned
Movement countries including Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of conditioning the entry into force of a
nuclear test ban treaty to the start of nuclear disarmament talks,
which has been insisted by some Non-Aligned countries but rejected
by the United States and other Western countries, Velayati
proposed to declare the achievement of an agreement for the total
elimination of all nuclear weapons as a "principle aim" and
include it in the preamble of a future test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reasonable compromise in this context," Velayati
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the main sticky point of the negotiations, namely
the scope of a nuclear test ban,, Velayati said the treaty should
ban all nuclear tests in any place and at whatever yield, and it
should halt the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Regarding peaceful nuclear explosions, Velayati said that as
the test ban treaty was intended to be unlimited in time, "it
would seem reasonable to envisage, exceptionally and under
stringent conditions, the possibility of peaceful explosions if
the real benefits of nuclear explosion for the sole purpose of
purely peaceful scientific research and civilian applications are
demonstrated in the future."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian draft text envisages that countries may then be
allowed to conduct peaceful nuclear explosions when a specific
request for such an explosion is approved by a four-fifths
majority of the parties to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister stressed that by introducing the
draft text, Iran is not intended to divert the current course of
the negotiations, but rather to help countries involved to find a
balanced compromise.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Velayati said the
draft text does not represent a new policy of Iran. "We follow the
same direction we have since 10 years ago, but now we have
decided to be more active," he added.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Indonesia, Myanmar, Morocco, Sri Lanka,
Australia, Egypt and Mexico who spoke after Velayati at today's
meeting expressed their support for the Iranian draft text.

<HEADLINE> Israel-PLO Steering Committee Meets In Jerusalem </HEADLINE>

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry
Direct General Uri Savir and Palestinian negotiator Abu Ala met
here this afternoon in the framework of the Israel-PLO Steering
Committee overseeing the implementation of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions dealt with a series of issues of mutual
concern, including Palestinian airport in Gaza, confiscation of
Palestinian land in the West Bank, building by Israel of five
by-pass roads for Jewish Settlers and Israel's redeployment from
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place amid a press report that Yossi Beilin,
Minister at Prime minister's Office, and Abu Mazen, Member of the
PLO Executive Committee, held secret talks and reached a final
status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of the meeting, both Savir and
Ala dismissed the report as pure speculation. Ala said there is no
reason to hold secret talks because negotiation on permanent
status is part of the Oslo agreement. He added it is the main
issue of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with Israel Radio this evening,
Beilin admitted that he has held talks with PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat and many other Palestinian officials including Abu Mazen,
but no secret agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, through exchanges of views the two sides
have come to understand each other better. He said there exist
common denominators concerning different problems and it is
possible to find a final solution acceptable to both
sides.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Accepts Resignation Of Corruption-Charged Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today accepted the resignation of former Welfare Minister Abe
Williams charged with corruptive practices.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told a press conference in his Cape Town residence
that the resignation does not mean Williams admitted guilt.
</P>
<P>
Williams, National Party's highest-ranking cabinet black
member, handed in his letter of resignation last night after his
offices and houses in Cape Town and capital Pretoria were raided
by the anti-corruption police forces earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The former minister promised to cooperate fully with the
police authorities but denied that he had acted "in an improper
manner."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police said the search of Williams' offices and
houses does not mean he was guilty of any offence.
</P>
<P>
The police said the investigation is still going on into his
case, which would probably take some time.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Williams' resignation, Democratic Party leader
Tony Leon said inefficiency, dishonesty and corruption was
dogging South Africa's Government of National Unity.

<HEADLINE> Gender Gap Shrinking in Economy, not in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- American women now make up
almost half of the nation's work force, but they still lag behind
men in education and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
There are more women doctors, more women lawyers and more
companies owned by women than ever before, according to a report
of the "Investor's Business Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1960, the percentage of single women in the work force
has jumped from 58.6 percent to 66.4 percent. The portion of
married women who work climbed from 31.9 percent to 59.4 percent
in that time.
</P>
<P>
Today they hold more than two in five management jobs. That's
up from just 14 percent in 1960, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the news for women isn't all good, it said. According to a
report of the federal Glass Ceiling Commission, only 5 percent of
senior managers at Fortune 1,000 firms are women. Other reports
said the number should stand between 7 percent and 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though still not great, it's a huge increase from just the
mid-80s, when women held only 1.5 percent of those jobs.
</P>
<P>
The paper forecast that women would gain 15 percent of the top
posts in these elite firms within a decade.
</P>
<P>
Women in the U.S. now own about 7.7 million firms, up 43
percent since 1990, according to the report. And woman-owned firms
had a total 1.4 trillion U.S. dollars in sales last year. That's
up 40 percent since 1990. If trends continue, it said, women
should own almost half of all firms within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Some activists claim there is still bias in the workplace
against women. They point to government data that says women earn
74 cents for each dollar a man does, a big difference.
</P>
<P>
Women also lag somewhat behind men in education. They are more
apt to take their higher degrees and work in lower-paying fields
than men.
</P>
<P>
The paper said one gap that appears to have widened over the
years is political. Men and women split on the two major parties
and on what the nation's political priorities should be.
</P>
<P>
There is a substantial gender gap in political knowledge,
according to the report. A poll did by the Barnard College showed
that 53 percent of men know that the first 10 amendments to the
Constitution are called the Bill of Rights, but only 39 percent of
women knew that.

<HEADLINE> India's CBI Absolves PM of Bribery Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) today absolved Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao of charges that he had taken money from hawala dealers in
1991, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
S.K. Jain, the key hawala dealer involved in the hawala bribery
scandal, confessed to the CBI in March last year he had paid 3.5
crore rupees (about 960,000 U.S. dollars) to Rao, godman
Chandraswami and former minister of state for urban development
R.K. Dhawan.
</P>
<P>
The CBI told the Supreme Court today that despite its best
efforts and probe, it had not found any "reasonable basis" to
proceed against "two persons" whose names figured during
interrogations in the 18-million dollar scandal, locally known as
the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The investigative agency did not disclose the names at the
hearing of the Supreme Court which is reviewing the hawala case
for the second time since January 16.
</P>
<P>
Because the CBI today filed charges against 14 politicians
including Dhawan, the "two persons" could only be Prime Minister
Rao and godman Chandraswami.
</P>
<P>
The apex court responded by making it clear that the CBI cannot
close the investigations till they were complete as "later on you
may come across something you don't have now."
</P>
<P>
During its previous review of the case on January 30, the
Supreme Court had urged the CBI to probe into every allegation in
the hawala case against anybody quickly, fairly and thoroughly
regardless of the person's status and position.
</P>
<P>
The court decided to review the case again on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Mayhew Urges IRA to Restore Cease-fire Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew urged the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
this afternoon to return immediately to its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster secretary insisted in parliament that any cease-fire
would have to be "credible" for Sinn Fein to take its place around
the negotiating table of the future all-party talks on the future
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a debate on how to push forward the damaged peace process,
differences remained between the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) which
defends British rule over Ulster and the Social Democratic and
Labor Party (SDLP) which favors reunification of the whole island
of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble once again blamed the IRA and its
political wing Sinn Fein for not committing themselves to a
peaceful means to settlement of the conflict, while SDLP leader
John Hume once more urged the British government to make all-party
talks "its top priority."
</P>
<P>
A white ribbon campaign was launched in the House of Commons
this afternoon, in which parliament members wore white ribbons to
show their support for an end to violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
As a non-sectarian, non-party and cross-party initiative, the
ribbons acted as peace symbols calling for resumption of
cease-fire, reported BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory Northern Ireland Committee,
was quoted as saying that the ribbon was a "sincere gesture."
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring launched a
similar white ribbon campaign in the Irish Republic and Northern
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Vows To Fight Rural Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African states
today vowed to fight rural poverty at the end of a four-day
international conference in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-sponsored by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) and the World Bank, adopted the "Declaration
of Approaches to Rural Poverty Alleviation in Southern Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Unless issues of rural poverty were solved there was little
change of Southern Africa surviving," World Bank's Southern
Africa Director Katherine Marshall told the conference, with some
160 government and non-government delegates from the SADC member
states attended.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperative actions have to be taken by governments in the
sub-region against the most serious socio-economic problems," she
said.
</P>
<P>
They include the creation of an environment for working out
economic policy, and cooperation in the area of social and
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the IFAD today, around 80
percent of Southern Africans are living in poverty-stricken rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
SADC Social indicators, including health, education, safe
water and fertility rate, were similar to those low-income
Sub-Saharan African countries, according to a World Bank report
made available to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the poor people in the urban and metropolitan
areas of the sub-region, rural poor suffered higher unemployment,
lower education, poorer access to water and electricity and
productive resources.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still embarrassed to see conditions of abject poverty in
the sub-region in spite of some development," said SADC Executive
Secretary Kaire Mbuende at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
SADC groups Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Wins Carlsberg Cup HK Lunar New Year Soccer Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sweden won a hard-fought
battle against Japan to take the 50,000 U.S. dollars Carlsberg Cup
Lunar New Year soccer tournament here tonight.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier match, Poland edged hosts Hong Kong 1-0 to take
the third place.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish victory came only after they out pointed their
Japanese counterparts in the penalty-kicks, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played a scoreless first half and the 90-minute
regular play ended 1-1. The goals were scored by Sweden's Mattias
Jonsson and Japanese Kazuyoshi Miura.
</P>
<P>
An expected "sudden death" did not come in the extra time as
the teams tried by every means though they still failed to score
any more.
</P>
<P>
As Japanese team's third attempt shot by its star forward
Takuya Takagi hit the upper part of the bar, the game was actually
over.
</P>
<P>
Amidst the woos by a near-capacity crowd in the 38,000-seat
Hong Kong Stadium tonight, the Swedes, third placers at the 1994
World Cup finals in the United States, cooled themselves down and
put in just goal after goal in an accurate manner in the penalty
kicks.
</P>
<P>
"The play went into extra time and then penalty-kicks. The
Swedish team won the game. I have nothing to say," an apparently
disappointed Japanese coach Shu Kamo said at the post-match press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Kamo should be proud of his players as the Asian champions lost
in such an impressive way.
</P>
<P>
"I' just satisfied with my players for what they did in the
tournament," he later said. "The Swedish team played a
well-organized and better game today," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for Swedish coach Tommy Svensson, it could hardly be
something pleasant.
</P>
<P>
"I have a big problem of injuries. I had four forwards before
the tournament and no I have none," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the first half of the extra time, we had some problems as
the Japanese team played very well," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
"We deserved to win. The Japanese team is a very tough team
and we had to play really hard," he said. He also praised the
Japanese mid fielders who, he said, had more ball possession
during the game.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish team will leave here for Australia where they will
play two games against the Australian national team and in April,
the team will visit Northern Ireland for pro matches there.
</P>
<P>
And then the Swedes will host Byelorrusia for their World Cup
qualifying tie early June, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreak Threatens Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of cholera
epidemic was declared today in the Somali capital by the Joint
Health Authority (JHA) of both South and North Mogadishu despite
General Mohamed Aideed's denial of its existence.
</P>
<P>
According to the JHA report, the JHA reported 51 cases in
Mogadishu's eight treatment centers where 10 patients died since
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mohamed Ali, health coordinator of South Mogadishu, said
the joint health authority planned to minimize the seven
treatment posts to three isolation camps in a bid to keep close
watch on the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The JHA has already opened a temporary isolation camp in the
Forlanini Hospital in North Mogadishu to deal with worsening
cases of cholera.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the disease has already spread to Mogadishu's
neighboring town of Afgoye where 26 deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a JHA source said some influential banana
exporting companies, being worried about their exporting
business, have exerted pressure on the South Mogadishu Health
Authority, asking it to refrain from declaring the existence of
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Mogadishu government's health authority
called the cholera epidemic as a mere "acute diarrhoea".
</P>
<P>
Some local doctors urged relevant authorities to practice a
household disinfection program on all the houses where the
disease persists.
</P>
<P>
A huge number of cholera cases were reported in Jowhar, 90 kms
north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
About 300 cases were treated among whom 45 were children under
five with 55 others being adults.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ahmed Abdullahi who had just completed an assessment on
cholera, said 70 percent of the Jowhar's inhabitants drink river
water while others use the only 16 hand-dug wells.
</P>
<P>
The doctor also complained about the shortage of chlorine
supplies and the subsequent dilemma of coping with the river
water.
</P>
<P>
The first Cholera case of the year had been discovered in the
port of Kismayo in southern Somalia last month when an outburst
of the disease in Kismayo resulted in about 300 deaths.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Hopes Weakened by Drop in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- High street sales fell in
Britain last month for the first time since August, dealing a blow
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's hopes of a
consumer boom this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) said Wednesday that retail
sales volumes fell by 0.6 percent between December and January.
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised the City, where economists expected the
revival in retail spending over Christmas to continue into the new
year.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales make up only a part of total consumer spending but
the figures, which follow recent evidence of weak activity
elsewhere in the economy and low inflationary pressures, bolstered
expectations of another cut in interest rates soon.
</P>
<P>
Economists blamed the latest monthly fall on special factors
which they said were likely to prove only temporary.
</P>
<P>
Unusually bad weather in January may have kept shoppers at home
while record spending on the National Lottery could have diverted
money away from retail consumption, they said.
</P>
<P>
The CSO said that despite the fall in sales last month, overall
volumes remained on an upward trend. Sales between November and
January were up by 1.2 percent on the preceding three months, and
by 1.8 percent on the same period a year previously.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the poorer-than-expected January figures
cast doubt on the government's forecast of 3.5 percent growth in
consumption during 1996.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Government Adheres to Economic Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni Government has
earmarked 100 million U.S. Dollars in the 1996 state budget to
consolidate the social security network for the limited income
groups, and to increase the salaries of state employees by 20
percent with retroactive effect starting last January.
</P>
<P>
This Government decision has been taken in an effort to absorb
the people's angry reaction to the enforcement of the second stage
of the economic reform program which has begun at the new fiscal
year, in implementation of an agreement concluded in January of
last year with each of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the economic reform program in Yemen,
enforced last month, entails the lifting of subsidies on flour and
wheat, a rise in prices of fuel and public services, the
devaluation of the national currency, the amendment of the
structure of custom tariffs, and commencement of privatization of
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The hike in prices introduced by the Government is the second
such move since 1995.

ATHENS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Public transportation and

24-hour nationwide civil service and labor strike in demand of
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
Buses, trains, trolleys, banks, post offices, public utilities

aircraft personnel staged a three-hour work stoppage starting
12:30 local time.
</P>

Strikers are demanding salary and pension increases and
protection of workers from planned changes to public corporations
and the consequences of restructuring in industry. They are also
calling on employers to be more flexible in negotiations on the
new collective labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
Describing today's strike as "the most successful strike in
the last five years," GSEE President Christos Protopapas warned
that more strikes will take place if the demands are not met.

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A raging wild fire that
charred 23,000 acres of grassland in southern U.S. was still
burning out of control today, destroying dozens of houses and
injuring at least 18 people.
</P>
<P>
The grass fire, fanned by strong winds and fueled by record
high temperatures, started to spread Tuesday on top of 25,000
acres of grassland in northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
The blaze destroyed at least 45 houses, 12 trailer homes and
injured at least 16 firefighters and two residents as it advanced
to Poolville, a small town about 35 miles northwest Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
"We've lost houses. We've lost trailers. We've lost barns.
We've lost deer camps," said Parker County Sheriff Ben Whiteman.
</P>
<P>
State officials said the fire was 40 percent controlled early
this morning, but it was still burning out of control near
Poolville.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor George W. Bush made state workers, National
Guard helicopters and heavy equipment available to fight the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
State officials banned outdoor burning across about a fourth of
the state, warned of automobiles sparking dry grass, motorists
tossing cigarettes or matches, as temperatures in parts of the
state soared to over 90 degrees, breaking 70-year-old records.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Zimbabwe's largest
merchant bank today accused the government of "misusing" scarce
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
In an in-depth commentary on the economy, First Merchant Bank
Chairman Roy Lander said the government spending was so high that
it now amounted to about 50 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
At least 90 percent of the spending was on consumption items,
such as wages, salaries, rents, vehicles and other expenses
"unrelated to critical social issues".
</P>
<P>
Lander, who is also chairman of one of Zimbabwe's largest
companies, Anglo American Corporation, said Zimbabwe, with a
population of 10.5 million people, had one of the largest
governments compared to bigger, wealthier and much more developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This amounts to misuse of scarce resources and it translates
into development potential that might never be realised," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government borrowing was absorbing a large
proportion of the country's resources, with most of it being used
for consumption rather than investment.
</P>
<P>
He also warned high interest rates, a direct result of the
government borrowing, were frustrating investors and affecting
the viability of many companies.

HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading economist said today
the greatest political challenge facing the government is dealing
with the chronic unemployment crisis in Zimbabwe where over 1.5
million people are jobless.
</P>
<P>
Consultant economist John Robertson said Zimbabwe's
unemployment rate of 60 percent was "too high" for a country with
a population of only 10.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
"Total unemployment, excluding peasant farmers and their
families, now exceed 1.5 million people. In addition, we have
about 300,000 young men and women reaching the legal age of
majority entering the job market every year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Out of that, only about 15,000 might find work while the rest
either proceed to university or resign themselves to looking for
non-existent jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, since 1980, more than 820,000 young
people have completed four or more years of secondary education,
while less than 100,000 jobs have been created during the same
period.

<HEADLINE> Italian EU Representative Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- There are prospects for some
progress towards efforts to begin negotiations on the Cyprus
problem, European Union's envoy Federico Di Roberto said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after an hour-long meeting with Cyprus'
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, during which he was briefed
on the latest developments in the Cyprus problem and Cyprus' bid
to become a full member of EU.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were any real prospects for some progress,
given the political situation in the region, Di Roberto told the
press that "the fact that I am here, I believe and people in Rome
and in Brussels believe, there is a prospect."
</P>
<P>
"That is why we are trying our hand at it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Di Roberto, an Italian diplomat, was appointed last month by
the EU Council of Ministers to represent the current (Italian) and
next (Irish) EU presidency on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here last night, saying that his mission to Cyprus
was "an attempt to find solutions and formulate useful
suggestions to the EU Council on the best approach the EU could
take on the question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Di Roberto's current visit to the island,
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said today that the
Italian diplomat's mission of "solution seeking" and putting
forward "useful suggestions" to the EU Council fell within his
competencies.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Italian diplomat has undertaken duties
to coordinate all EU moves on pushing ahead with efforts for a
Cyprus settlement and "he will suggest ways in which the EU can
intervene in this direction."
</P>
<P>
Di Roberto, who met this morning with President Glafcos
Clerides, is due to have another meeting with the Foreign
Minister on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the EU representative will see Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Di Roberto's visit is part of the international community's
peace efforts to seek solution to the Cyprus problem, which has
remained unsolved for the past 21 years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cannot Stop NATO Expansion, Says Hungarian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Foreign Minister
Kovacs Laszlo said today Russia should know that it cannot prevent
the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
NATO's enlargement eastward is not aimed at countering Russia's
influence in the former communist bloc, but bringing stability and
security to eastern and central Europe, Kovacs told a local
newspaper in comments on the recent meeting between German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Kohl in the Kremlin on February 19, Yeltsin
said Russia "firmly and toughly" opposes the "expansion of NATO
towards Russia's borders." Yeltsin said Kohl, his "dear friend,"
had proposed putting off discussion of NATO expansion to avoid
heightening tensions with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs said Hungary backs the NATO position of minimizing
conflicts with Russia on its eastward enlargement. But he said
NATO's expansion program is continuing, although its pace had
slowed as presidential elections approach in the United States and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs said Hungary expects to open a dialog with Russia and to
reach an agreement on the issue, but doing so, he said, would be
"to help Russia understand Hungary's position of joining NATO,"
not to "get Russia's permission."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Starts Search for Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A team including members of
the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) has ventured into Indonesia's
Irian Jaya jungle to locate the 13 hostages abducted by the Free
Papua Movement (OPM) on January 8, according to an Antara report
today.
</P>
<P>
The team, set up by the Indonesian military, also includes the
country's community leaders, tribal leaders and members of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Trikora Military Command Maj. Gen. Dunidja today
confirmed in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya, that the team is
already in Mapunduma, the village where the kidnappers and their
hostages were last seen.
</P>
<P>
Dunidja said that the team is in the village to approach leader
of the kidnappers Daniel Yudas Kogoya and to negotiate the release
of the hostages, including six foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to settle the case without spilling any
blood," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 people, including seven foreigners who
were on a scientific expedition in the area, in early January and
later released 13 of them, including one foreigner, in exchange
for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The military has not been able to determine the whereabouts of
the OPM and the hostages since the kidnappers cut off radio
contacts and reportedly left Mapunduma on January 25.
</P>
<P>
The OPM demands the recognition of a West Papua state in Irian
Jaya in return for the release of their captives. The Indonesian
government has rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
The team is carrying two messages from Maj. Gen. Dunidja, who
is leading the operation to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Dunidja assured OPM leaders that the military personnel around
Mapunduma are seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and will
try to avoid bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the OPM members would not be prosecuted
if they voluntarily surrender to the military authorities.
</P>
<P>
The military also pledged to do their best to guarantee the
safety of anyone who carries out scientific research in Irian
Jaya.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last
Saturday's earthquake in Indonesia's Irian Jaya Biak Numfor
Regency has risen to 96, with 49 still missing and 44 critically
injured, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 buildings, including houses, clinics, places of
worship, village halls and shops, were destroyed, the reports
quoted sources from the Relief Aid Coordination Unit in Biak as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The same sources also reported continued aftershocks in the
area and the latest one occurred this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the number of victims and the extent of
damage could be much larger, as details were sketchy about the
quake-stricken areas because communications were cut off.
</P>
<P>
Relief workers reported a severe fuel shortage, which threatens
to cripple the power supply and the transportation system in the
Biak area.
</P>
<P>
The relief operation has been hampered by the bad weather since
last Saturday when the areas were hit by a major earthquake
measuring 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale and tidal waves as
high as three to four meters.
</P>
<P>
Biak Numfor Regent leader Amandus Masnembra expressed concern
that relief supplies and medical aid were not arriving fast enough
from Jakarta, according to an Antara report today from Jayapura,
capital of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The meteorology office in Jayapura has recorded 204 aftershocks
measuring between three and five on the Richter scale since
February 18.
</P>
<P>
The frequent aftershocks have triggered fears of another major
earthquake in Biak, where residents have already spent six days in
tents.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office today arrested three former officers who were involved in the
military mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The three are Park Jun-byung, former commander of the Army
20th division, Chang Se-dong, former commander of the 30th

Province, in which about 150 people were killed and 2,000 others
wounded.
</P>

been indicted for treason, insurrection and bribery.
</P>
<P>

NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Delhi Chief Minister
Madan Lal Khurana resigned today over the multi-million dollar
bribery scandal, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Delhi Governor P.K. Dave, Khurana said he did
not consider it proper to continue in office since the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought sanction to file charges
against him in the scandal, or the "hawala case".
</P>
<P>
Khurana said the allegations leveled against him were baseless
and politically motivated. "I will prove it in the court," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Khurana is the highest ranking office holder of the major
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
He offered to resign last month. But his request was turned
down by the BJP leadership which insisted he not resign unless the
CBI files charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The bribery scandal involves some Indian politicians who have
allegedly received money from some illegal foreign exchange
dealers (hawala dealers).

<HEADLINE> New Chemical Found Responsible for Addictive Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified chemical in
cigarette smoke may be responsible for the addictiveness of
cigarettes, researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in
New York reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The substance, found among some 3,000 components of tobacco
smoke, cuts the level of a brain enzyme, known as monoamine
oxidase B.
</P>
<P>
The enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of a signalling
molecule called dopamine which plays an important role in the
brain's "reward pathway".
</P>
<P>
The pathway is used to reinforce survival behavior, notably
the urge to eat and have sex.
</P>
<P>
Smokers have been found to have lower concentrations than
non-smokers of monoamine oxidase B, which in turn increases the

HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks plummeted

<P>
SHENYANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of
northeast China's Liaoning Province is working on a proposal that
the site of a Japanese war criminal trial in World War II be used
for educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by Liu Minglun, a retired member of
Shenyang's People's Court, who took part in the trial as an
assistant judge 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A special court martial in the Supreme People's Court for
Japanese war criminals was held in Shenyang, the capital of
Liaoning Province, on June 9, 1956.
</P>
<P>
A new building, more than 1,000 sq m in size, was built for the
event, where as many as 36 Japanese war criminals were tried.
</P>
<P>
The building was then converted into a cinema in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Along with an exhibition hall commemorating the incident which
led to the China's War of Resistance Against Japan and the
monument to the liberation of northeast China from Japanese rule,
the restored courtroom will be another means of educating people
about patriotism, aggression, and safeguarding world peace.

<HEADLINE> Planets Close to Sun Older Than Previously Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Some of the planets in the
solar system may be much older than previously believed, according
to an American scientist at California's Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ian Hutcheon estimates that the formation of the inner
planets -- Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury -- took place 50 million
to 100 million years after the formation of the Sun, the central
star in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
It was previously thought that the formation of these planets
may have taken as long as 300 million years after the Sun's
formation.
</P>
<P>
The earlier date was established by analyzing several
meteorites that fell in France at the end of last century after
having flown through interplanetary space for millions of years.
</P>
<P>
The meteorites came from asteroids which are believed to have
been created after carbon dioxide reacted with water within some
10 million years of the formation of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
As the inner planets of the solar system were formed through
collisions between large asteroids, the planets must have been
created very soon after the asteroids themselves.
</P>
<P>
The fallen meteorites have been found to contain carbon
compounds similar to those found on Earth.
</P>
<P>
"Their carbon compounds were formed from carbon dioxide and
water in the same way as the carbonate compounds found in
stalactites in caves (on Earth)", said Dr Hutcheon.
</P>
<P>
"Ice, which existed in abundance in the debris from which the
solar system was formed, was melted in primordial meteorites as
they collapsed."
</P>
<P>
Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there are hundreds of
thousands of asteroids which are the remains of the primordial
debris from which the solar system was formed some 5,000 million
years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts and officials from 19
countries today called for the establishment of an international
anti-terrorism network to effectively combat terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In a communique released today from an international conference
against terrorism held on February 18-21 in Baguio city, the
Philippines, participants urged a strengthening of multilateral
and bilateral coordination of policy and action against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to enhance the international cooperation and
coordination in law enforcement, intelligence sharing, and
preventing illegal trafficking and use of explosives, weapons, and
nuclear, chemical and biological materials.
</P>
<P>
The proposed network will develop international means of
intelligence exchange to facilitate the flow of critical
information on terrorists and their movement and funding, and also
information needed to protect life, property and security of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The participants also urged all countries to take joint efforts
to ensure prompt apprehension, investigation, bringing to justice
or extradition of terrorists by means of bilateral or multilateral
agreements or other arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorism experts expressed their concern over the
practice of some countries to grant sanctuary to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The experts and officials stressed in the communique that
terrorist acts are crimes and that all legally available means
should be used to counter them. There must be no sanctuary for
terrorists, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the ease with which international terrorists
transfer money across countries through the international banking
system.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed to use all legally available means to
intercept the transfer of terrorist's funds passing through
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The conference was initiated by Philippine President Fidel
Ramos after the arrest of several international terrorists in the
Philippines who had been involved in the explosion of the New York
World Trade Center and the plot to kill visiting Pope John Paul
II.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) - The oil tanker Sea Empress was
pulled from rocks and towed to a safe place in Milford Haven
Wednesday night after it had spilled some 65,000 tons of crude oil
along the Welsh coast.
</P>
<P>
Six days after the tanker ran aground on St Ann's Head, the
western headland at the mouth of Milford Haven estuary, it began
to move at six p.m. Wednesday as a dozen salvage tugs slowly
dragged it free.
</P>
<P>
The 100-man salvage team succeeded in pumping air into the
vessel's tanks to float it off the projection of rock which
penetrated its hull on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that the vessel was still disgorging oil, but
coast guards confirmed that the spillage has been stopped.
</P>
<P>
A coast guard spokesman said the Sea Empress was being towed
towards Herbranston jetty to be tied up while officials draw up
plans to pump out the remaining 60,000 tons of oil. A smaller
tanker, the 35,000-ton Star Bergen, was standing by to receive
some of the oil.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft resumed spraying oil slicks which have spread down the
Bristol Channel and threaten to cause an environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
Patches of oil were reported along 96 kilometers of the Welsh
coast and have encircled the bird sanctuaries on Skomer and
Skokholm islands. Some 520 sea birds were reported to be
contaminated inside the Milford Haven waterway. Fishermen have
imposed a voluntary ban on catching fish in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Marine engineers will make a full damage assessment of the
vessel Friday in preparation for offloading the remaining cargo of
oil.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Rid Shipping Register of Substandard Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will take firm action
to rid the country's shipping register of substandard vessels in
order to preserve the credibility of the Cyprus flag, according
to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by Minister of Communications and Works,
Adamos Adamides, at the annual general conference of the Cyprus
Shipping Council, opened in Limassol Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Adamides said he had tabled a bill to the House of
Representatives which would empower the minister to order the
deletion of ships, which do not fulfill the safety standards,
from the Cyprus ship registry in order to preserve the
credibility of the Cyprus flag.
</P>
<P>
Supplementary measures designed to make the system of
inspections of Cypriot-flagged vessels more rigorous would also be
 adopted. These, the minister said, would include a network of
independent surveyors, which would cover all principal ports.
</P>
<P>
Adamides added that April has been selected as the launch time
for the scheme. In all, a total of 42 inspectors will be posted
at 53 ports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has the fourth largest ship registry and the largest
third-party ship management center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Shipping has made great contribution to the economy of the
island. According to the Central Bank estimate, in 1994
government revenue from taxes on ships and offshore shipping
companies plus expenditure on local goods and services reached 42
million Cyprus pounds (about 85 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) today filed charges against 15 prominent
politicians for their alleged involvement in a bribery scandal,
the Press Trust of India said.

received money from illegal foreign exchange dealers (hawala
dealers).
</P>
<P>
The CBI, the premier investigating agency, sought sanction for
prosecuting Delhi Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana in the hawala
case. Khurana is the highest-ranking office holder from the major
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> King Fahd Resumes Full Powers after Recuperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
officially resumed full powers as of Wednesday after recovering
from fatigue that compelled him to hand over the task to Crown
Prince Abdullah on January 1, according to the Saudi Press Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
The Monarch addressed a message to Crown Prince Abdullah, also
Deputy Prime Minister and Chief of the National Guards, notifying
him that the royal decree to put him in charge had expired.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd expressed thanks and appreciation to the crown
prince for his dedication and sincere efforts in undertaking the
state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old king spent a week in hospital after his
indisposition because of "exhaustion." He was treated by a team
of American doctors.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the crown prince, King Fahd said he was glad
to serve the country for the sake of its prosperity, stability and
security.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince, who wrote back to the king, reaffirmed his
loyalty and dedication to the homeland and its people.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that King Fahd had empowered the crown
prince to run state affairs because of his health problem since he
came to power in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince, during the temporary absence of King Fahd,
headed an official delegation to a summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council that was held in Oman in December.
</P>

He also delivered the annual Royal speech to a session of the
consultative council on behalf of the king and received several
visiting Arab heads of state.

<HEADLINE> Good Future For Special Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, FEBRUARY 22 (Xinhua) -- China's special economic
zones, according to one official, have strong prospects and will
continue to play a pivotal role in the country's modernization.
</P>
<P>
"The position and role of these zones will not be weakened,"
said Huang Tai, an official at the SEZ Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The zones include Shenzhen, Shantou, and Zhuhai in Guangdong
Province, Xiamen in Fujian Province, and the island province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, these zones are leading the country in
economic expansion through 15 years of development. "Their
historical mission has not yet been completed under the socialist
market economic development. President Jiang Zemin once said that
neither the Central Government's determination about the SEZs, or
their basic policies and positions will change."
</P>
<P>
China has changed some policies relating to the special
economic zones to increase national reforms for establishing a
market economy and international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that taxes on enterprises in the zones are still 15
percent, in contrast to 30 percent in other parts of the
country. The zones are exempt from customs duties on imported
materials for their own use.
</P>
<P>
Their rate of development was higher than the national average
in 1994 and 1995, and is expected to be 15 percent over the next
five years, which is still higher than the average.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that the zones will continue to try out the central
government's new policies before they are applied nationwide, and
they will be encouraged to improve their market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The five zones plan to expand investment in infrastructure.
Shenzhen and Xiamen plan to spend 270.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the Pudong New Area in Shanghai is subject to
central government policies for SEZs, and has 3,500
overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment of 14 billion
US dollars so far.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa mends fences With Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Algeria
have cleared up a misunderstanding over Algeria's outlawed
fundamentalist group, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), said an
official statement reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
This followed a telephone conversation between South African
President Nelson Mandela and Algerian President Liamine Zeroural
on Tuesday night, and a briefing by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo
to ambassadors of Arab countries to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz
Pahad would visit Algeria at the weekend to deliver a message
from Mandela to Zeroural.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Algerian government issued a strong protest after
Mandela met exiled FIS leader Anouar Haddam last week at his
presidential residence in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The FIS was banned after the military in Algeria canceled the
January 1992 general elections which the FIS was reportedly
poised to win.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told the Arabian ambassadors it was unfortunate that South
Africa's good relations with Algeria had been affected by what
was called a "misrepresentation" by Haddam.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government supports the move toward
democracy in Algeria as evidenced by the recent presidential
elections," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting between Mandela and Haddam, Nzo reiterated
South Africa's stance on democracy and human rights, the foreign
ministry said, adding it was in that context that the meeting
took place.
</P>
<P>
Algeria on Wednesday reportedly canceled a decision to recall
its ambassador to South Africa Said Kitouni in protest against
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman said on Wednesday that Haddam had asked
for South Africa's help to involve the Organization of African
Unity in the search for peace in Algeria, where an estimated
50,000 people have died since January 1992 when the army-backed
government canceled elections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Currency Rand In Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's currency
Rand has dipped sharply against the U.S. dollar since last
Thursday at Johannesburg Stock Exchange, with traders warning
that South Africa could be on the road to a Mexico-style
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The great sell-off on the financial markets entered its fifth
consecutive trading day on Wednesday, with sickly Rand dropped to
a record low of 4.0250 to the dollar as speculators continued to
bail out of South African financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is in total disarray. The market is completely
dependent on Rand's every move," said one trader, adding "market
nerves are shot."
</P>
<P>
South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Chris de Swardt
said on Wednesday the central bank had been active again in the
market "with the purpose of ensuring changes as orderly as
possible, not with the intention of guarding an exchange level."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank's General Manager of gold and foreign
exchange reserves Bertus van Zyl said Wednesday the Bank had been
active in the local market again "to support its functioning" and
had lost dollars in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Rand began falling last Thursday owing to a widespread
rumor about President Nelson Mandela's ill-health and the talk of
an imminent lifting of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates at an investment conference on Tuesday,
Mandela said: "The lifting of the exchange control regulations is
now only a matter of time and detail."
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg and Reserve Bank
Governor Chris Stals moved on Tuesday to soothe the nerves of the
financial market, insisting the government would hold to its
policy of gradually easing exchange controls and would not
attempt to peg the Rand.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg said South Africa would not fight the foreign
exchange market to defend the Rand or target its exchange rate,
while Stals said the bank had no intention of fixing the exchange
rate at any predetermined level.
</P>
<P>
Stals and Liebenberg both confirmed that the monetary
authorities would be committed to a gradual abolishment of
exchange controls, saying it was impossible to decide on what the
equilibrium exchange rate for the Rand should be.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Swardt reiterated that the market would have
to find a new equilibrium level for the Rand.
</P>
<P>
On the bond market, key yields vaulted another 40 points to
their worst levels in three months.
</P>
<P>
South African government bonds fell to their lowest level at
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Wednesday since October last
year, before regaining some lost ground by the local close.
</P>
<P>
South African shares were also hit by gold's fall below 400
U.S. dollars an ounce at the international market.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the uncertainty of the local currency,
economists said the recent market turmoil, triggered by selling
overseas funds, was a salutary reminder that the foreign capital
which had flooded into South Africa in the past two years could
just as easily flood out.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts, though agreeing that the currency had been
overvalued, said the Rand would remain volatile in the coming
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nationals in Southern
African countries living illegally in South Africa will not be
repatriated if they fulfill certain requirements, the cabinet has
decided.
</P>
<P>
Those who would qualify included illegal aliens who could
prove they had resided in South Africa for five years, and who
were engaged in productive economic activity, the local daily
"the Citizen" quoted Cabinet Secretary Jakes Gerwel as saying.
</P>
<P>
Illegal aliens involved with a long-term South African partner
or spouse, or those who had dependants in the country could also
qualify.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, those who qualified would have to
apply for the necessary exemption within the prescribed period.
</P>
<P>
He said the details would be announced by the Ministry of Home
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, exemption would not be granted if an applicant was
guilty of certain criminal offenses, Mr. Gerwel said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's decision on Wednesday had been in response to a
request from Mozambican President Joachim Chissano for a
moratorium on Mozambican repatriations.
</P>
<P>
But the Ministry of Home Affairs which probed the matter had
developed a more structured approach, which covered illegal
aliens from all member states of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, more than three million eastern
and southern Africans are staying in South Africa, and the
majority of them are Mozambicans.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, Thai Officials to Hold Talks on Border Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Ministry Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said today he would
hold informal talks with his Thai counterpart in an effort to iron
out disputes arising from Malaysia's construction of a border wall
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamil told the press here that he hoped the informal
meeting could be held during the Asia-Europe summit scheduled for
March 1-2 in Bangkok, capital of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamil said this when asked to comment on a statement by
Thai Foreign Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri, who said there was no
valid reason for the construction of the 27-kilometer wall.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has said it plans to build the wall to check
smuggling, drug trafficking and other illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
As co-chairman of the Malaysia-Thai Joint Commission, Ahmad
Kamil said its main task is to solve any problem between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The commission did not meet last year because the Thais were
having their national elections," Ahmad Kamil added.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, three groups from Thailand have visited the
border area at Kangar, the site of the wall construction.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday that
Malaysia is ready to resolve the border wall dispute with Thailand
through diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Rebels Refused Entry Into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian troops
manning the Tanzania-Burundi border have during the past week
refused over 100 Burundian anti-government forces, Perepahutus,
to enter Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Ngara District Commissioner, Brigadier Sylvester Aggrey
Hemed, told reporters in the town of Ngara on Wednesday that the
border situation including that of inside Burundi was highly
explosive, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the over 100 Perepahutus pleaded to the Tanzanian
soldiers patrolling the border to be allowed to cross into
Tanzania, saying that they had given up fighting against the
Burundian government for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government forces gave up fighting partly because
they had run out of ammunition and their supply system of all the
necessities was no longer in place, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Hemed said that the Perepahutus, who appeared before the Tanzanian
soldiers at different points along the border without any guns,
claimed that they had abandoned their weapons in the bush to be
picked by anyone interested in making use of them.
</P>
<P>
He said that after being refused entry into Tanzania the
Perepahutus were spotted loitering along the border at times
making attempts to cross the border without success.
</P>
<P>
Hemed disclosed that the situation inside Burundi was reported
to be highly explosive as gun fire was heard daily.
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, over 20,000 Burundian and Rwandese
nationals were permitted entry into Tanzania on humanitarian
basis after the situation in Burundi became unsafe for them to
continue living there.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa has stressed the need for the international community to
cooperate in fostering peace, love and harmony in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 300 international youths from 13 countries, who
are on world tour on a peace promotion-mission, the President
said here on Wednesday that peace in the world would only be
achieved through collective efforts.
</P>
<P>
He told the youths, who arrived in the Dar es Salaam Port on
Wednesday from South Africa aboard "a ship for the world youth",
that youths, who were tomorrow's leaders, had the noble task of
advocating for global peace to make the world a good place for
future generation.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa commended the Japanese government for
initiating such a unique program saying that it did not only
promote peace but gave opportunity to global youths to learn each
others cultures.
</P>
<P>
The ship christened Nippon Maru, took off from Japan January
19, this year, and was scheduled to make stop-over at four
selected countries of Sri Lanka, Tanzania, South Africa and the
United Emirates.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has been to Sri Lanka, South Africa and tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's
Vice-President Omar Juma has called upon all Muslim Sheikhs and
heads of other religions to join the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an Idd Baraza to mark the end of Ramadhan here on
Wednesday, on behalf of President Benjamin Mkapa, the
Vice-President said that the Third Phase Government, which had
taken the lead in the fight against corruption, needed full
support of every Tanzanian including the Muslim Sheikhs.
</P>
<P>
He said people were denied justice because of rampant
corruption. They were denied their right, like education, because
of corruption and the people were forced to pay for social
services more than what was supposed to be paid because of
corruption, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Your Third Phase Government is fully committed to the fight
against corruption as promised by the President. But the
government needs your full support," he told hundreds of people
who had gathered for the Baraza.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President also discouraged divisions among Muslims.
He said Tanzania needed unity among its citizens to build a
country that was free from racism, tribalism and religious
fights.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Take Part in Joint European Arms Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruhe said here on Wednesday that Britain must participate in
collaborative European arms projects if it wants to join the new
Franco-German arms agency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times, Ruhe said London
would be excluded from the new arms agency if it decided not to
join the new Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle (MRAV) program.
</P>
<P>
Ruhe met with his British counterpart, Michael Portillo, here
on Wednesday, but no progress was reported in resolving the
impasse over the MRAV program.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany established the new arms institution in a
bid to co-ordinate their weapons procurement policies.
</P>
<P>
Ruhe said that Britain could not "go through the door" of the
Franco-German agency without participating in any common projects.
</P>
<P>
He warned that collaboration between Germany, France and
Britain was the only viable course for Europe's leading defense
industries.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Britain, France and Germany cooperate, you will have no
European defense industry in 10 or 20 years from now," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ruhe said that he was optimistic that Britain would
eventually decide to join the joint project.

<HEADLINE> Sheikhs In Zanzibar Urged To Stay Away From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Zanzibar
President Salmin Amour has advised sheikhs to differentiate
politics from religion, noting that failure to do this would
plunge the country into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Sheikhs must draw a line between politics and religion," the
president said at the Zanzibar House of Representatives when
addressing an Idd Baraza to mark the end of Ramadhan in the Town
of Zanzibar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that sheikhs were important figures in shaping the
society, advocating peace and unity and that they should never
use their positions to mix up religious issues for political
ends.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president said doors were opened for sheikhs
wishing to joint politics but advised that it was wrong for them
to use religion as a shield to hide their agenda or as a shortcut
to their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Amour warned that any people or a group of people, who would
behave in a manner likely to disturb peace, would face the rigors
of the law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were some people going around to propagate
seeds of division among Zanzibaris under the pretext of
multi-party democracy. Much of this divided the people, and
increased hatred threatening peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the people to contain their emotions to
avoid confrontation. He said the people had an obligation to
observe the law and be obedient to the government and its
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Islanders to strengthen national solidarity and
unity. He stressed the need to observe the law saying people
could only preach social advancement where there was peace and
unity.

<HEADLINE> Survey: American Jewish Support for Peace Process Upswings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
support for the Israel-Arab peace process has increased
significantly among American Jews, reported Israel Radio today,
quoting the American Jewish Community as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey conducted last month, 75 percent of
the American Jews said they support the handling of the peace
negotiations with the Palestinians, as compared with 64 percent
in September 1995. In addition, 70 percent said they supported
the handling of the talks with Syria, compared with 61 percent
last September.
</P>
<P>
A large majority said they had a favorable impression of Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, while their impressions of opposition
leader Binyamin Netanyahu were evenly divided, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
However, as was the case with previous surveys, American
Jewish views of Israeli leaders had to be qualified by the fact
that 53 percent were unaware that Peres and Netanyahu are in
different parties.
</P>
<P>
The survey was the fourth in a series on American Jewish
opinion about peace between Israel and the Palestinians, which
began in September 1993, immediately after the signing of the
Israel-PLO accord. A demographically representative national
sample of 1,013 self-identified Jewish respondents was interviewed
by telephone January 10-16.
</P>
<P>
While a majority of American Orthodox Jews continue to oppose
the peace process, the level of opposition among the Orthodox has
declined. In January, 56 percent of the Orthodox said they
opposed the government's current handling of the peace
negotiations with the Arabs, compared with 64 percent in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are some 6 million Jews in the U.S., the largest Jewish
community in the world. As such, they have considerable influence
on the politics of Israel and the U.S.

He ruled out an early exit at this point since "we are already
beyond the halfway mark."
</P>
<P>
The three criteria successfully hurdled by the Philippines are
the public sector borrowing requirement, the external borrowing
approvals and base money.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo also admitted that even though the growth rate was "a
few shades below six percent (the target was between 6.5 percent
to 7.5 percent), it does not cause anyone a significant degree of
consternation."
</P>
<P>
In the ongoing discussion with the IMF, he said that the
Philippine government is likely to maintain its growth targets of
6.5 percent to 7 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, he hinted that there may be a revision in the
inflation target which has been set at 6.5 percent and assured
that the revised target would still be single digit.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Steps up Security Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has stepped up
security measures around key locations in the capital city of
Doha after the announcement of an aborted coup Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Military and security forces have been placed on "stand one"
alert, a report reaching here today from Doha quoted a Qatari
military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari military sources said that planned naval exercises
with the United States and other maneuvers separately with
Britain and France will go ahead in March.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem again met with
Ambassadors of the U.S. and Britain in the morning of Wednesday
following Tuesday's meeting with the ambassadors of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council for informing them
of the aborted coup.
</P>
<P>
The British government said in a statement Tuesday night that
it was most concerned to hear of a plot to assassinate the Emir
and other senior members of the government. It condemns such
actions against the government of Qatar, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were arrested in connection with a foiled
coup which aimed to "undermine Qatar's security and stability."
</P>
<P>
At least 40 soldiers and policement led by their officers
were to open fire on the Emir's palaces as well as the foreign and
interior ministries with rocket propelled grenades and automatic
rifles, the report quoted Qatari sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani Wednesday
received members of the ruling family and explained details of
the "vile conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem
accused former Emir Sheikh Khalifa of masterminding the aborted
plot.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa was replaced by his eldest son Sheikh Hamad in
June 1995, but the former Emir, who is living in exile in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), has been seeking to return home and to
be ruler of Qatar again.
</P>
<P>
"The first confessions show that the plotters were
foreigners. We know the limits of his (Sheikh Khalifa)
team. That's why he needed help from foreigners and we hope the
(plotters) don't come from brother countries," the Qatari foreign
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Files Case Against Brazil in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Manila has filed a formal
complaint against Brasilia in the World Trade Organization after
Brazil repeatedly junked appeals to scrap a countervailing duty
(CVD) of 121 percent on Manila's desiccated coconut exports.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Department of Trade and Industry, Special
Trade Representative Antonio Buenoamino said that the Geneva-based
arbiter was forming a panel to investigate Brasilia's charges that
Manila subsidizes the coconut industry.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had imposed a provisional CVD of 14.10 percent for four
months starting March 28, 1995 on claims that Manila grants
subsidies to the coconut industry.
</P>
<P>
Manila contends that the loans provided by the government to
coconut farmers are meant to enhance livelihood and support
replanting and do not constitute a form of subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Manila also refutes charges of dumping, citing that the price
of desiccated coconut in the domestic market is way below the
export price of two US dollars per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The CVD is a special duty imposed to offset subsidy given,
directly or indirectly, to the manufacture, production or export
of any merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the Philippines' third largest market for desiccated
coconut.

<HEADLINE> Green Scheme Helps Save Office Paper in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong civil servants
used a quarter less office paper in the first half of 1995 over
the same period of the previous year, thanks to the a Green
Manager Scheme aimed at reducing paper consumption.
</P>
<P>
The local government managed to get by with 219 million sheets
of paper in the first six months last year, 73 million less sheets
or a 25-percent drop from the same 1994 period. That means 6,200
trees would be saved from being chopped down for making paper.
</P>
<P>
Under the Green Manager Scheme, civil servants achieved the
paper reduction by printing on both sides of a sheet whenever
possible, cutting down on photocopying and using the clean side of
a piece of used paper for note-taking and drafting.

Mombasa-Nairobi-Eldoret-Malaba road, which links Kenya and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
President Moi urged American Businessmen to seriously invest

<HEADLINE> Investors Assured Of Political Stability In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and local investors
have been assured of continued political stability in Uganda, the
local daily ''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given on Wednesday by the Minister of State
for Finance and Economic Planning, Mathew Rukikaire, when opening
a workshop here to launch the World Bank-funded private sector
competitive project.
</P>
<P>
Rukikaire said the government measures to liberalize and
privatize the economy were sustainable and irreversible.
</P>
<P>
The government had maintained peace and stability without
which no economic activity would be possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured all the investors that the government would do all
in power to ensure continued political stability.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda private sector competitive project will cost 20.9
million US dollars over a period of four years. It will be funded
by a soft loan from the International Development Agency (IDA),
an affiliate of the World Bank which will inject 12.3 million
dollars while the rest will come from the private sector, the
Ugandan government and international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The project is to make the Ugandan private sector more
competitive in the international market.
</P>
<P>
It will be managed by the private sector through the Private
Sector Foundation established in August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Gov't to Promote Jewelry Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government aims to
increase gem and jewelry exports to 53 billion baht (2.12 billion
US dollars) by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The target for this year will be a 3.8 percent rise over last
year's 51 billion bath (2.04 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In line with the target, the Department of Export Promotion has
adopted a new offensive policy to promote Thai exports on a
continual basis in the competitive international environment.
</P>
<P>
Gems and jewelry are among the export items listed for strong
promotion, with the public and private sectors joining forces to
develop Thailand into a regional gem and jewelry trading center.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on improving the quality of Thai gems
and jewelry, research and development and craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
To promote exports, the Commerce Ministry is organizing fairs
twice a year, In March and September, for gems, jewelry, watches
and clocks.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand's main disadvantage, compared with some major
competitors, is production costs, with local labor costs
relatively high.
</P>
<P>
Another disadvantage is that although the country is rich in
raw materials for gem and jewelry production, they are becoming
depleted so the country is seeking high-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
The public sector has moved to introduce measures to eliminate
obstacles to trade and investment, enhance the country's
competitiveness and seek new markets for the industry.
</P>
<P>
Major markets of Thai gems and jewelry include the United
States, Japan, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Fair organizers believe that the local gems and jewelry
industry has great potential for further growth. They expect
exports of these products to reach 100 billion baht (4 billion
dollars) in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Imports Protests In S. Africa Criticized In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions Secretary-General, Morgan Tsvangirai, has criticized South
African trade unions of their protests against textile and
clothing imports from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai said yesterday that the protests were unfortunate
since Zimbabwean textile exports were only a tiny fraction of
South Africa's consumption.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that South African trade unions had
organized mass protests throughout South Africa against textile
and clothing imports from such countries as Zimbabwe, Tsvangirai
said these demonstrations were, in fact, in conflict with the
whole idea of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zimbabwe was in fact, losing its labor force in
this sector. The situation worsened when South Africa, which had
for many years been the main export market for Zimbabwean
clothing and textile products, in 1992 slapped punitive import
duties of up to 90 percent to protect its own industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, 15,000 jobs in Zimbabwe were lost in the
sector as many firms closed down.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the trade talks now going on between South Africa
and Zimbabwe, Tsvangirai said that it should be speeded up to
benefit the two countries. He said if regional integration was to
be achieved, all regional countries should have equal
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
finalize the implementing rules on fiscal incentives for exporters
next month, trade officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The Export Development Act, signed by President Fidel Ramos in
December 1994, lists down five fiscal incentives, including tax
credits, for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said that the incentives were estimated to push
the country's export revenues by 20 percent in 1995, or 2.5
billion US dollars over the previous year's figure, and create
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, financial officials said that the tax breaks would
reduce total tax revenues by six billion pesos (240 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
To avail of the incentives, exporters must first be accredited
by the Bureau of Export Trade Promotion.
</P>
<P>
They are also required to submit a sworn statement that they
comply with the requirements of the minimum wage and social
security system laws.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they must submit an affidavit that the items they
import are used primarily for the production of export goods.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Balm -- Best Relief For Headaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An ancient Chinese herbal
ointment, called Tiger Balm, provides faster tropical pain relief
than paracetamol, a new study has found.
</P>
<P>
Australian Family Physician, the journal of the Royal
Australian College of General Practitioners, reported in an
article in its latest issue that the ointment provides immediate
relief and pain-dulling effects over three hours.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the study provide evidence that Tiger Balm is
effective for tension headache, with a small amount applied to the
temples providing strong and effective relief to the majority of
patients who tried the product," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75 percent of the patients said they would use Tiger
Balm again, although several noted that the ointment produced a
warm or tingling sensation when applied to the forehead.
</P>
<P>
The study compared 57 patients -- 22 used Tiger Balm, 15 took
paracetamol and 20 were given a fake pain killer. Tiger Balm was
found to contain camphor, menthol clove oil and other medicinal
herbs.
</P>
<P>
The study could not determine why Tiger Balm was effective.
"The physiological basis for treating headache with Tiger Balm, or
any of its ingredients singly or in combination, is unknown."
</P>
<P>
The Victoria State government has commissioned a study into
Asian medicines, and Chinese herbal remedies in particular,
following an increase in the number of people turning to alternate
therapies in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Possibility To Put off Israeli-PLO Final Status Talks under Consideration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Informal consultations have
been held between Israeli and PLO officials on the possibility of
postponing the start of final talks until after the Israeli
elections, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Officials here are confident that Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat will agree to do so, but no formal
decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, those talks are to begin on May
4 and conclude no later than May 1999. Some believe opening the
talks before the election on May 29 could provide Prime Minister
Shimon Peres and his government with an unwanted
photo-opportunity, since Israel has agreed to negotiate the future
 of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Arafat said Wednesday night, "This issue of
when the talks begin is a non-issue. It should not matter when
the talks begin, as it is known to Arafat and others that there
will be no progress on the eve of an Israeli election."
</P>
<P>
The same source also denied that the Palestinians have made
any decision on whether they want the final status talks to start
on time or not.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Uri Savir
and Palestinian negotiator Abu Ala are due to meet in Jerusalem
this afternoon in the framework of Israeli-Palestinian Steering
Committee. The two men are expected to discuss matters of mutual
concern including Palestinian complaints about expansion of Jewish
settlements and confiscation of Arab land.

</P>
<P>
-- Unable to resist mounting pressure from the leadership,
Indian Minister of State for Urban Development R.K. Dhawan quit
his post Wednesday.
</P>

have resigned during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Indian Express
</P>
<P>
-- Dhawan too bows out.
</P>
<P>
-- The CBI is understood to have absolved Prime Minister Rao of
charges of taking money from S.K. Jain by saying it "found the
allegations devoid of truth and aimed at hampering investigations
into the main hawala case."

According to one study done by a congressional office, the
United States did tests of nuclear and chemical weapons that
involved as many as 500,000 people, 200,000 of whom were later
affected by radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
Aided by an institute of the Department of Health in 1970,
Johns Hopkins University did genetic experiments using blood from
7,000 male children (95 percent of whom were from poor black
families) in the Baltimore, Maryland area, under the guise of
doing research on anemia. Similar experiments were also carried
out on an additional 6,000 teenagers, 85 percent of whom were
black orphans.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Reuters on January 13, 1994, nearly
120 mentally retarded children were fed food with radioactive
materials in an experiment conducted by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology under the auspices of the federal
government. Senator Edward Kennedy admitted in 1994 that
experiments on children were hardly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
These facts show that the US has a very poor record on social
protection of children. "We hope the US government can take
measures to improve its record," the article says. It
is, however, unfortunate that there are some people who have
turned a blind eye to the terrible plight of children in their own
country but have been keen on fabricating sensational stories on
children's conditions in other countries, the article says.

The article says that the number of crimes and suicides
committed by teenagers has been on the rise in the US in recent
years as a result of poverty, unemployment, divorce, and violence
in movies and on tv, audio and video tapes.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the number of murders involving male teenagers 14
to 17 years of age increased by 165 percent from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The number of violent crimes were up 68 percent from 1984 to
1993, and 156 out of every 100,000 teenagers from the age of 10 to
15 had been sent to juvenile correction centers. In Florida alone,
700,000 people were jailed for various crimes in 1992, 87,000 of
them teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Another study has shown that between 50 and 70 percent of
juvenile delinquents were imprisoned twice within 12 months and 75
percent of the juvenile delinquents in a correction center for
juveniles in Washington committed crimes again after being
released.
</P>
<P>
The number of American teenagers committing suicide is also on
the rise. In the years from 1960 to 1990, the number of teenagers
who committed suicide increased by over 300 percent. The death
figure of teenagers and young adults who committed suicide in
1991 was greater than the number of deaths from cancer, heart
attacks, AIDS, infant mortality, pneumonia, flu, strokes and
chronic lung diseases combined, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to point out that the United States is one of those
countries which have conducted large-scale experiments using human
beings.

At present, the US has between 1.5 million and 2.5 million
migrant farm workers, many of whose children have also become
farm hands doing work that is dangerous because of poor
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The US National Child Labor Committee estimated that there are
at least 100,000 children doing illegal farm work every year, and
one million legal violations of related laws.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the United States is the world's largest
market for narcotic drugs, which kill 500,000 people annually.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, on average, 176 children are arrested
each day for drug use and one-third of the students 13 years of
age in the eighth grade have used drugs.
</P>
<P>
About 11 percent, or 375,000 infants were already affected by
drugs before birth because their mothers used crack cocaine, many
of them referred to as "crack babies" because they were suffering
from serious problems as a result.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has also become a serious social problem which threatens
the lives of many Americans. By 1995, the United States had about
500,000 cases of AIDS reported, and at least 330,000 people had
died of the disease. The virus that causes AIDS has not only
killed people but also affected following generations.
</P>
<P>
One report in Journal of The American Medical Association says
that one-third of the babies whose mothers suffer from AIDS will
be infected and ultimately die of AIDS, while the others will
become orphans when their mothers die.
</P>
<P>
The number of children whose mothers die from AIDS is expected
to rise to 125,000 by the year 2000, and that the number of
persons aged 18 or above who lose their mothers to AIDS will grow
to 64,000.

The article says that one half of the babies in the US are born
to single-parent families, and about 500,000 are brought up by
other people or in child-care facilities every year. Under such
adverse and abnormal family and social conditions, it is common
that children are maltreated and receive improper care.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Carnegie Foundation in 1991,
one-third of the Americans who are physically abused are
children.
</P>
<P>
A report said the number of cases involving child abuse by
parents in the US rose by 13 percent from 2.4 million in 1989 to
2.7 million in 1991, and more than three million in 1993. An
average of three children died from abuse every day in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Another report released by the Federal Center for Disease
Control and the University of Missouri revealed that 2,000
children under the age of 17 die of mistreatment and improper care
each year, and one-third of the women and children suffer from
some form of sexual or other abuse.
</P>
<P>
A US national center for missing children estimated that 1.5
million children in the United States are reported missing every
year, and that one million run away or are abandoned by their
parents, many of them ending up in desperate circumstances. Fifty
percent of all the homeless women and children end up this way
because of trying to escape family violence.
</P>
<P>
The head of the US Bar Association said in 1993 that
children in the US were in dire peril as their legitimate rights
and interests had often been encroached upon or neglected.
</P>
<P>
An article in the April 1993 issue of "Fortune" magazine said
that employers in the United States had universally disregarded
the law on hiring that protects children between the ages of 7 and
17 from long hours or heavy labor and dangerous work conditions.
</P>
<P>
The problem of illegal use of child laborers has grown
considerably. A report by the Department of Labor shows that
there were 1,944 such cases in 1992, twice 1980's figure, and an
estimated 300 child workers die and 70,000 are wounded each
year.

A direct consequence of a high divorce rate and a high
out-of-wedlock birth rate is the widespread existence of
single-parent families in the US, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the US now has 10.9 million single-parent
families, at least one third of all families with children, and
some 90 percent of single-parent families are headed by mothers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1950 the number of single parents has increased 200
percent, i.e., rising from four million to about 12 million. The
number of children living in single-parent families headed by
mothers has shot up by 300 percent, that is, increasing from five
million to 20 million.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of children born in the US live in
single-parent families headed by mothers. At least half of
American children live in such families before they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the US is becoming a "fatherless society".
</P>
<P>
Single-parent families headed by mothers are becoming a
principal source of poor people in the US as a result of the
crisis of the absence of fathers, it points out.
</P>
<P>
There are 180 communities in the US where at least 90 percent
of families have no fathers, and most such families are poor ones.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate of single-parent families headed by mothers is
34.3 percent, and such families have a total of 18.6 million
people living below the poverty line, at least 47 percent of poor
people in the US.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that because of poverty and the lack of good
care, the possibility of children from single-parent families
playing truant, dropping out of school and encountering
psychological problems is three times that of children from
double-parent families.

The article says, "The teen-age pregnancy is a serious national
problem in the US."
</P>
<P>
The "New York Times Magazine" and a US newspaper reported in
late 1995 that on average 2,756 girls drop out of school every day
because of pregnancy and that on average 1,340 under-age girls
give birth every day.
</P>
<P>
The US currently has about one million unwed girls aged 13-19
who become pregnant, the article says, adding that half of them
give birth before dropping out of school and becoming "welfare
mothers" relying on social relief for a living.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate of unwed teen-age girls in the US is double that
in Britain and six times that in France and Italy. The US ranks
first among all developed countries in terms of pregnancy,
abortion and giving birth by unmarried teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
Even US President Bill Clinton conceded on January 29, 1996
that the teen-age pregnancy is a universal phenomenon in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
This is not a question of morality only, but an economic and
social problem as well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years the out-of-wedlock birth rate in the US
has increased 500 percent. In 1991 children born to unmarried
women accounted for 30 percent of all new-borns, and 57 percent of
such children were born to black women.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Carnegie Foundation in 1990 said that
as infants born to unmarried women and especially unmarried
teen-age mothers lack a basic social environment in which they can
grow up healthily, American children under the age of three are
living in a "silent crisis".
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality in the US is higher than that in 19 other
countries, the article says, adding that the mortality of infants
in Jonestown in the State of Misissippi is as high as 86 per
thousand.

The article says that the United States now has seven million
homeless people, and children account for a large part of
them. Half of the black children have experienced life in urban
shelters. U.S.A Today says that poverty has become the top killer
of children.
</P>
<P>
The death toll for children living in poverty each year is more
than the number of death children dying from traffic accidents and
suicide combined, and three times the number of deaths from cancer
and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the United States has the highest
rate of divorce among industrialized countries, a figure which has
quadrupled within the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the article says, 2.39 million people got married,
and 1.16 million people divorced, giving a rate of 50 per
cent. High rate of divorce has disintegrated American families,
dealing a severe blow to women and children and doing a lot of
harm to them.
</P>
<P>
According to a study of American families done since 1968, the
average income of divorced women drops by 30 per cent within the
first year after divorce. In 41 per cent of the cases of single or
divorced women who had children below the age of 21, not a penny
of child support or alimony was given by their former husbands,
and the rest got only a minimal amount.
</P>
<P>
The break up of families has not only lowered the standard of
living for children, but caused irreparable psychic damage to
them. According to statistics, in the 20 years up to 1992, there
were one million additional American children affected by divorce
every year, and nearly half of all black children were born to
parents who had separated.

<P>
The article goes on to say that the United States is the
world's richest country, but also the one with the highest
proportion of impoverished children among developed Western
nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued at the end of 1994 by the U.S
Children's Defense Fund, the country has 15 million children
living in poverty, who have no access to health care or education.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the number of impoverished children rose to 15.7
million, 23 per cent of the total number of children, the highest
recorded in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Children account for 22 per cent of the population of the
United States, but those living in poverty account for 40 per cent
of the nation's poor people. One out of every four children is
living in poverty on average, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The condition of black children is even worse, the article
points out. According to a report in US News and World Report, the
poverty rates for black children and illegitimate black children are
44.8 and 63.7 per cent respectively, while those for white children
and illegitimate white children are only 15.9 and 14.9 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty means hunger," says the article. According to
estimates of a congressional study, 30 million people in the
United States didn't have adequate food in 1994, and 12 million of
them were children.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by one organization, one out of five
American children don't have enough food, and one out of seven
live on subsidies. In 1995, 301 out of 1,000 children below the
age of 12 went hungry.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1995 report by a public health school of a
university in California, one out of six people in the state were
suffering from hunger. If this tendency continues, it points out,
one out of three children would be suffering from hunger by the
year 2000.

Children are some of the main victims of violent crimes.
According to an article in the newspaper "USA Today" in 1995, the
number of child victims of violence had increased by four times in
1995 as compared with 1985.
</P>
<P>
And the proportion of child victims aged between 10 and 14 had
increased by 62 percent over 1985.
</P>
<P>
On average, 40 children were killed or injured every day in the
US in 1995, and 70 out of every 100,000 juveniles aged between
five and 19 died while killing others or by committing suicides.
</P>
<P>
The number of juveniles under 16 injured by arms doubled from
1987 to 1990, and that for those killed by guns increased by 40
percent from 1984 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
"Violence has swamped the streets and has even intruded into
schools," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in US public schools 522,000 incidents
involving physical attacks and theft take place every month. In
1994 alone, more than 80,000 violent acts took place in New York
schools, an increase of 27.6 percent over 1993.
</P>
<P>
One out of every five US middle school students goes to school
carrying some type of weapon, and 135,000 children take guns
into their classrooms every day.
</P>
<P>
In addition, every day 1.2 million latchkey children have to
live with family members who possess guns, while 160,000 students
stay away from school owing to blackmail or worry about physical
injury.
</P>
<P>
In southern Chicago 47 percent of the students (aged between 12
and 18) have been injured by guns or knives, and 45 percent have
had the experience of witnessing killings.
</P>
<P>
It is becoming more common for parents living in slum areas of
cities to lock their children in their homes, afraid of the
violence in schools and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
For children, the US has become a dangerous place, a fact that
has even been admitted by the head of the National
Education Association of the US, the article says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A signed article to be carried
in tomorrow's "People's Daily" says that ill-treating and cruelly
injuring children take place every day in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The article, signed by "Ren Yanshi", says that recently some
human rights organizations in the US have been unwarrantedly
blaming and attacking China for its children's conditions by using
the so-called "orphanage" issue.
</P>
<P>
The mean trick they played can be called "pouncing on one point
and ignoring all others", and their charges are mere fabrications
and exaggerations, it notes.
</P>
<P>
Their statements have been refuted by Chinese departments
concerned, as well as by United Nations bodies and US adoption
agencies and people who know the real conditions of Chinese
children.
</P>
<P>
However, what is quite strange is that those Americans who seem
to care about the conditions of Chinese children, are totally
indifferent to the plight of children in their own country, the
article notes.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the world's only superpower that the social
tragedies of ill-treating and cruelly injuring children, as well
as of hurting them physically and psychologically in various ways,
take place every day," the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that children are under the threat of
violence in US.
</P>
<P>
The US has the worst record of violent crimes in the world,
with 35 million crimes taking place annually on average, of which,
two million are violence-related.
</P>
<P>
Each year six million people become victims of violent crimes;
among them 24,000 are killed, it says.
</P>
<P>
About 220 million guns are held by private US citizens. In the
US, one million shootings take place every year, which take more
than 20,000 lives.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Former world number one
Andre Agassi of the United States crashed out to fellow Luke
Jensen in the ATP St. Jude Classic in Memphis, Tennessee, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jensen, who was better known for his doubles skills with bother
Murphy, secured the competition with a straight set win 6-2, 6-4
over third ranked Agassi in the second round clash.
</P>
<P>
Agassi enjoyed a first-round bye at the 683,000 dollars event.
</P>
<P>
The loss shattered Agassi's hope of reclaiming the top position
from Pete Sampras, who passed Thomas Muster and held off Agassi
for the top spot by beating his U.S. rival 6-2, 6-3 in Sunday's
San Jose final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras upset fellow American Richey Reneberg 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today requested 820 million dollars from Congress to support the
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the speaker of the House and president of the
Senate, Clinton indicated that he would use the amount of 820
million dollars rescinded from the Pentagon budget to "support the
Bosnia peace implementation force."
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in a statement that
620 million dollars of the total request would be used to cover
the military cost of deploying 20,000 U.S. troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 200 million dollars will be used over several
years for economic reconstruction and reform, deployment of
international police monitors and removing landmines, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Meets with U.S. Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma today held talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton and signed with Vice President Al Gore an agreement
regarding commercial space launch services.
</P>
<P>
A White House statement said that in his meeting with Clinton,
Kuchma reaffirmed his "strong commitment to economic reform,"
while Clinton assured Kuchma that the United States "will continue
to mobilize international support as Ukraine continues its bold
advance toward a market economy."
</P>
<P>
Both presidents applauded their "growing cooperation on
European security," the statement said, and Clinton "welcomed
Ukraine's active role in the Partnership for Peace and its
contributions to peacekeeping in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Vice President Gore "outlined a
package of 330 million dollars in grants and 860 million dollars
in trade and investment programs."
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed today allows Ukraine to enter the
commercial satellite-launch market and provides it with the
opportunity to win contracts for five launches to geosynchronous
earth orbit (GEO) and 11 more GEO launches for a U.S.-Ukrainian
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement paves the way for Ukraine to enter the
international space launch market in a non-disruptive fashion,"
and it stipulates that prices provided by Ukrainian space launch
services will be "comparative to those offered by the United
States or other market economies."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after emerging from the White House
talks, Kuchma said that the most important thing for Ukraine is to
make the year of 1996 "the turning point of our reform."
</P>
<P>
His country "needs political support and economic
assistance. We are very open about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described his second Washington tour as "a very fruitful
one." "we hope that the results will show very, very shortly," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the U.S. is fulfilling its commitment to compensating
Ukraine for removing tactical nuclear weapons from its territory,
Kuchma said that Washington had reaffirmed its readiness to abide
by its commitment.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Ukraine would become a non-nuclear state as
promised this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president also met with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Kuchma told Christopher there would be
a limit to Ukraine's involvement in the Commonwealth of
Independent States. This is seen as a promise pleasing the
U.S. which appreciates Kuchma's efforts to maintain his country's
independence without aggravating relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Perry praised Ukraine for its "truly bold and historic decision
to go non-nuclear."
</P>
<P>
"They can count on the United States being a friend and having
a strong defense relationship with them into the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president is scheduled to meet with leaders of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund during his stay
here.

<HEADLINE> France Remodels Defense Industries to Compete With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- France launched a drive to
modernize its defense industries Wednesday by announcing plans to
privatize electronics giant Thomson SA this year and merge plane
makers Dassault Aviation and Aerospatiale in two years.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of defense industries, decided by President
Jacques Chirac, is expected to be accompanied by moves to
professionalize the armed forces and to end conscription within
five years, to be unveiled by him Thursday night in a television
interview.
</P>
<P>
After a regular weekly cabinet meeting, government spokesman
Alain Lamassoure said the government wanted to set up two major
groups, one around Thomson and the other around Aerospatiale and
Dassault.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim was to adapt French military industries "to the
present needs of our national defense," and quoted Chirac as
telling the meeting that France "must achieve a profound reform of
its military and defense machine."
</P>
<P>
The government had for long been pushing for a marriage of the
two plane makers to facilitate joint ventures with other European
defense industries to counter American competition.
</P>
<P>
Serge Dassault, whose family holds about half of the capital of
Dassault, worth some 4 billion francs (800 million U.S. dollars)
on the Paris Bourse, had for long opposed any merger with the
mainly civilian Aerospatiale.
</P>
<P>
Dassault manufactures the costly Rafale fighter aircraft,
together with Mirage 2000 fighter bombers and the luxury business
jet Falcon, while Aerospatiale, worth about 3 billion dollars, is
the French partner in the European Airbus consortium and maker of
major elements of the European rocket Ariane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chirac will announce Thursday night his plans for
the future of the French army, likely to include a slashing of its
size and the end of universal conscription.
</P>
<P>
Details of the revamp will be decided at a meeting of his
defense cabinet Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Responds to Opposition's Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said late Wednesday that his government had
deputized three ministers to deal with the demands by the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML).
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency RSS, Deuba also asked
the UML Party to deputize three representatives in order to find
mutually acceptable solutions through dialogue with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party Wednesday handed over a 30-point
memorandum to the government asking for the fulfillment of its
demands within one month.
</P>
<P>
It warned that a peaceful people's movement would be launched
if the government does not initiate necessary measures to fulfill
these demands.
</P>
<P>
While accepting the memorandum, Deuba said Wednesday that the
government would make efforts to solve the problems raised in the
memorandum by utilizing available resources.
</P>
<P>
The UML memorandum demanded that the government should check
the rising market prices, restore the public welfare programs
introduced by the previous UML government and initiate steps to
solve bonded labor and landless problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy front, the opposition asked the
government to safeguard national interest when implementing the
recent border river development treaty with India, and to stop
anti-China activities probably being fostered at present.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the latter, Deuba said that the present coalition
 government has not allowed the Nepalese territory to be used
against China and is committed to preventing such activities if
any.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday while presenting the memorandum to the prime
minister, UML President Man Mohan Adhikari said his party hoped
the government would consider these demands positively as they
were in the interest of the nation and the people.

BONN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Troubled German shipbuilder
Vulkan Verbund AG said today that it would file for protection
from creditors to avoid bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Vulkan, Germany's largest shipbuilder with a workforce of

marks (688 million U.S. dollars) and it did not expect to receive
fresh funds immediately to bail itself out.

<P>
"After extensive negotiations with the board, politicians, the
European Union and banks, the board has to take the step of
beginning composition proceedings since many of its units are
insolvent," Vulkan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Composition proceedings are aimed at rehabilitating an
insolvent business by scaling down its debts. Creditors are asked
to forgo a certain percentage of what the company owes them over a
specified time period.
</P>
<P>
At company plants in Bremen, thousands of workers demonstrated
for their jobs and occupied the shipbuilding plant in protest.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says CIS Integration No Threat to Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Moscow regards the
integration it seeks in the CIS as "a very natural process" which
does not constitute a threat to other countries' interests,
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Russia views other member countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States as its closest and equal partners and will not
harden its policies toward them, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has tried to push economic and defense
integration among the CIS, will not change its policies on
integration, said Primakov at a joint news conference with his
Kazakh counterpart, Kasymzhomart Tokayev.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, a priority for Russia's foreign policy, is a main
partner of Russia among the CIS, which groups all 15 former Soviet
republics except three Baltic states, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The new Russian foreign minister admitted that some differences
including the status of the Caspian Sea do exist between Russia
and Kazakhstan but added that they should not be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Tajikistan, he said both Russia and
Kazakhstan are concerned about the renewed tension in the central
Asian state and the two countries shared the same opinion on
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
A stable Tajikistan can only be realized through an extension
of the current fragile ceasefire and serious dialogue between the
Tajik government and the exiled Islamic opposition in Afghanistan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here this morning at the invitation of Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev and will leave for Uzbekistan this
evening.

<HEADLINE> hke - Scientists in Germany Create New Element 112 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Finland, Germany,
Russia and the Slovak Republic have created element 112 at the
Heavy Ion Research Center in Darmstadt, their third new element
in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
The new element, created at 10:37 p.m. (21:37 GMT) on February
9, is the heaviest yet atom discovered by the human being. Due to
its weight, element 112 was unstable and only had a lifetime of a
thousandth of a second, said Hans Specht, the research center's
chief.
</P>
<P>
Research team leader Peter Armbruster said the new element was
created by smashing zinc atoms into lead atoms with the help of a
universal linear accelerator, also called Unilac.
</P>
<P>
The combination of lead, with 82 protons, and Zinc, with 30,
created the new element, which carries the designation 112 for the
number of protons it contains.
</P>
<P>
Until the atomic age, uranium was believed to be the heaviest
element with 92 protons.
</P>
<P>
Atomic physicists believe the entire material world of the
universe comprises a maximum of 200 elements. Discovering how many
elements actually exist has been a continual challenge to
scientists, because it sheds light on how the universe evolved and
the makeup of atoms.
</P>
<P>
The Darmstadt center produced elements 107, 108, and 109 in the
early 1980s. Element 110 was created on November 18, 1994, and
element 111 on December 8 the same year.
</P>
<P>
All of the six elements discovered by the Darmstadt center are
unstable under the natural conditions on earth. However, the team is
striving to reach element 114, which they hope will have a firm,
stabilized composition.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A judge Wednesday committed Jon
Idigoras, leader of the separatist Basque coalition Herri Batasuna
(HB) in Northern Spain, to prison after he refused to answer
questions about alleged collaboration with an armed group.
</P>
<P>
Idigoras, an HB parliamentary deputy as well as a national
parliamentary member since 1980, allowed the the ETA terrorist
group to propagate their anti-government views on video-cassettes
distributed during HB election rallies.
</P>
<P>
ETA has been blamed for killing more than 750 people in its
27-year fight for a separate state made up of four northern
Spanish provinces and three southwestern French departments.
</P>
<P>
Under the request of a prosecution organ, Judge Baltasar Garzon
of the National High Court banned the video tapes which advocate
violence and Basque separation. These tapes were also believed to
have a negative impact on the upcoming general elections scheduled
for March 3.
</P>
<P>
Idigoras ignored Garzon's order to appear in a court hearing,
for he would not obey any judicial orders of a "Spanish Nation."
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Wednesday morning near Bilbao, capital of
Vizcaya Province, and will face trial in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
The HB, also People's Unity, achieved legal recognition in
1986. It is considered to have close ties with the separatist ETA
organization, which advocates Basque separation and have committed
many terrorist actions, including bloody murders.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- President Ernesto
Samper said today that the Colombian government will submit a bill
to Congress to amend the national constitution and establish
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"We will not give a centimeter to violent criminals. We are
going to combat them on behalf of all Colombian children and
teenagers," Samper said in Villavicencio, eastern Colombia, where
he attended a religious ceremony praying to the children and
others kidnapped in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Society has to respond vigorously to the challenge presented
by violent criminals," Samper said. He called on Colombians to
"overthrow the evil forces that are trying to overpower Colombia."
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for death penalty for crimes such as
kidnapping, massacres and homicides and calls for amendments to
the 1991 constitution that eliminates death penalty in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
President Samper's proposal sparks broad controversies among
legal experts, church leaders and human rights defenders.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party leader Jaime Arias said that the death
penalty is "unnecessary" and "these kinds of measures will lend
themselves to injustice until justice has been reformed."
</P>
<P>
About four people were reportedly kidnapped in the country
every day. Genocides and mass killings were also committed in some
regions.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has one of the highest rates of violence-related
deaths in the world with an average of 130 and 150 deaths for
every 100,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
According to 1995 statistics, Medellin, the home of the
disbanded drug cartel commanded by Pablo Escobar who was killed by
Colombian army in December 1993, was the most violent city with
407 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants.

<P>
SAN JOSE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 15 million boxes of
bananas were lost in the wake of the flood that affected much
of the Costa Rica last week, especially in the Atlantic area
which is an important banana-growing region.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures provided today by the National Banana
Company show that the flood cost the South American country 15-20
percent of its banana exports.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the national company, Jorge Sauma, said
today that despite the strong negative impact of the overflowing
water in the banana fields, the disaster did not have the
magnitude as was feared at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The central province of Limon was cut off from the outside
world for two days and several localities suffered even more due
to the rising waters that cut off highways, destroyed bridges and
caused several landslides.
</P>
<P>
Aerial photographs showed that in several plantations,
completely covered with water, the water level apparently dropped
after the rains stopped.
</P>
<P>
The national company estimated that the country will be able to
export between 115-120 million boxes of bananas with each box
weighing 18.14 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains left nearly 100,000 people homeless and
about 100 destroyed in Costa Rica, according to figures released
today by the National Emergency Commission.

The Dow Jones industrial average, the gauge of the performance

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Promises to Cooperate on Prosecuting  War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the ruling
Socialist Party of Serbia Ivica Dacic said today Yugoslavia would
actively cooperate with NATO in prosecuting war criminals on
grounds of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, he said, however, that it was
not acceptable that "Yugoslavia's state sovereignty be violated"
in the process, since its domestic "courts will try Yugoslav
citizens for the war crimes they had committed."
</P>
<P>
Dacic pointed out that the Dayton peace accord clearly states
that all sides are obliged to cooperate with the Hague tribunal
for crimes committed in former Yugoslavia in prosecuting war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will actively cooperate
with NATO and forces of the international community in
implementing the peace accord," Dacic said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests and indictment of war criminals are key but
difficult issues of the peace process in the Balkan region. The
Hague international war crimes tribunal has indicted 52 war
criminals in Bosnia, 45 Serbs and seven Croats, including Serb
President Radovan Karadzic and Serb army commander Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
But the recent arrests and indictment of two senior Serb
officers has sparked a crisis in the country, prompting the Serb
authority to suspend contacts with the Muslim-Croat federation and
the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the slow-paced war criminal prosecution, the
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia has recently distributed a
"wanted" poster with 17 grainy photographs to its soldiers to help
them spot and capture suspected war criminals.

<HEADLINE> Danger of Retaliation by Loyalists Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The danger of retaliatory
attacks in the Irish Republic to be launched by Ulster Protestant
loyalist paramilitary groups is looming, according to reports both
from Belfast and Dublin.
</P>
<P>
With the latest bomb attacks of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
in London, the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), the arch
foe of the IRA, which groups two main armed groups, the Ulster
Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), would
discuss how to react the IRA bombing campaign and whether to
avenge it with their own attacks.
</P>
<P>
Leadership of the UVF has through a third party suspended its
contacts with the Irish government and the Progressive Unionist
Party, which politically represents the UVF, has indicated that it
would no longer be taking part in meetings with the Irish
government or politicians of Irish opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UVF is the only loyalist paramilitary
group which has shown a capacity to make and detonate bombs. It
was responsible for the bomb explosions in Dublin in May, 1974, in
which 28 people were killed, the worst single outrage during the
25 years before the ceasefire in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The UVF is due to meet leaders of other loyalist armed groups,
such as the UFF, the Ulster Defense Association and the Red Hand
Commando in the coming days in a bid to map their strategy in
response to the escalating IRA bomb campaign.
</P>
<P>
But representatives of fringe Protestant political parties on
behalf of these paramilitary organizations are lobbying the CLMC
to maintain its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party, said
that they would do everything in their power to avert a breakdown
of the loyalist ceasefire because they did not want loyalist
paramilitaries to get drawn into a conflict of the IRA's making.
The IRA must be isolated, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, said
that he would be urging the CLMC to do nothing and to let the
security services deal with the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Ervine believed two options could be considered. The CLMC could
set a three-to Six-month deadline for both the British and Irish
governments to bring the IRA under control. If the deadline was
not met, the loyalist campaign would restart.
</P>
<P>
Another option was dropping the word "universal" from the
loyalist ceasefire declaration to permit a rolling resumption of
violence.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Urged To Speed Up Quartering Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The former Angolan rebel UNITA
movement should speed up the quartering of its troops to ensure
the success of the process, British Minister for Overseas
Development Lynda Chalker said today.
</P>
<P>
Chalker said during a meeting with Jonas Savimbi, she had put
pressure on the UNITA leader to make him realize the importance
of accelerating the quartering process.
</P>
<P>
The British minister made the remarks at a press conference
here at the end of her three-day official visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in the country, she said, she had held
fruitful discussions with leaders of the Angolan government and
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka Protocol signed by the Angolan government and
UNITA in November, 1994, to end nearly two decades of civil war,
UNITA is to disarm all of its estimated 62,500 fighters.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has accused UNITA of
holding back its real soldiers and sending children and elderly
men into assembly camps. UNITA has denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Resigns After Police Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Welfare
and Population Development Minister Abe Williams resigned tonight
after his offices and houses in Pretoria and Cape Town were
raided by the police from the Office for Serious Economic
Offenses (OSEO) early in the day.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town tonight, National Party
(NP) and Deputy President F. W. de Klerk said Williams, the NP's
most senior black member, had tendered his resignation with
immediate effect in the interest of the party and the government
of national unity.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela had accepted the resignation of
Williams, said Presidential Spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe.
</P>
<P>
The raids took place soon after 9 a.m. while Williams was at a
cabinet meeting chaired by Mandela and de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
However, OSEO declined to say what charges, if any, would be
brought against Williams.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the initial stages of the investigation. It could
take a long time. Eventually the attorney-general will have to
decide whether anyone will be prosecuted," said OSEO spokesman
Advocate Jan Swanepoel.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said in the statement he had held an "in-depth
discussion" with Williams after the raids.
</P>
<P>
After that discussion, Williams decided to resign with
immediate effect from the cabinet in the interest of the NP and
the government of national unity, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Williams' letter of resignation had made it clear that the
resignation should not be interpreted as an admission relating to
any crime or irregularity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Williams denied acting "in an improper
manner" and undertook to cooperate fully with the authorities.

<HEADLINE> Two More Children Become Child Abuse Victims in  New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A 2-year-old boy was beaten
to death by his father and a 2-year-old girl was raped by her
uncle on Tuesday after they were returned to their parents from
New York's city custody, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Both victims recently had been under the care of the city's
child protection agency, but both had been returned to a natural
parent within the last year," the paper quoted city officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The boy, Kevin Mikell, was found dead in an apartment in Bronx,
New York City, with a dislocated arm, bruises and cigarette burns
on his body, police said.
</P>
<P>
Bronx detectives said the father, Anthony Mikell, 43, had
forced the boy to sit for more than 12 hours on the toilet as part
of a grotesque training exercise. At about 11 p.m. on Monday
night, the father beat the child until he collapsed on the
living-room floor, detectives told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Boy was officially placed in the city's care 10 days after
he was born in 1983 because his mother, Gwendolyn, had a history
of drug abuse. The mother lived in a shelter.
</P>
<P>
In the other case also in Bronx, Melissa Julius and Joseph
Julius were arrested on charges of the rape and molestation of
Melissa's 2-year-old daughter. Police said that Joseph, 26, had
raped and abused the child and that Melissa had known of the
assaults and not taken action.
</P>
<P>
Melissa, 34, is the mother of seven children, all of whom have
been placed in foster care at one time or another. The listed
reasons for the placements are neglect or abuse, and appeared that
the mother's drug problem was the underlying reason, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two cases were the latest in a series of abuse incidents
that have come to light since the death last November of Elisa
Izquierdo, a 6-year-old child whose mother was charged with her
slaying.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Scoppetta, the Commissioner of the Administration for
Children's Services, said investigations of how the city handled
both the cases were under way.
</P>
<P>
The city's Public Advocate, Mark Green, whose office conducted
a year-long examination of the city's child protection system,
said the rash of recent cases indicated the problem of child abuse
appeared to remain out of control.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Launch Campaign Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police have
embarked a campaign against terrorism and urged its people to be
security conscious.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was made public in a special publication titled
"Fight Terrorism In Nigeria" issued by the police headquarters
here today.
</P>
<P>
The police catalogued cases of terrorism in the country, from
the hijack of the Nigeria Airway's airbus to Niamey on October
25, 1993, to the explosions in the northern Nigerian cities such
as Kano and Kaduna recently.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is an act of political instability, but terrorism
is also a crime against innocent citizens, individuals and
constituted authority," the publication noted.
</P>
<P>
The police urged members of the public not to allow anyone to
abandon luggage at their premises.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Columbia Lifts off on Tethered-satellite Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- NASA launched space shuttle
Columbia today on a complex and riskier than usual mission to
unreel a tethered satellite.
</P>
<P>
Columbia thundered into hazy sky at 3:18 p.m., right on the
schedule time.
</P>
<P>
Seven astronauts, four Americans, two Italians and one Swiss,
will attempt to unreel a half-ton satellite at the end of a
20.5-kilometers cord. The satellite is supposed to hover over the
shuttle for two days, generating electricity while sweeping
through Earth's magnetic field at 5 kilometers per second.
</P>
<P>
Scientists expect 5,000 volts of electricity to be generated by
the satellite and its braided copper, nylon and Teflon Tether.
</P>
<P>
Current will flow from the satellite down the tether to Shuttle
Columbia, where electron guns will shoot the electrons back into
space and thereby close the electrical circuit.
</P>
<P>
If shown to be feasible, tethered satellite could be used to
generate power and provide lift for future space stations.
</P>
<P>
It is the second tour into space for Italy's tethered
satellite, which got no farther than 256 meters out and generated
a paltry 40 volts in a 1992 shuttle mission and almost had to be
ditched.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela might invite Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) leader
Clarence Makwetu to his scheduled meeting with Kwazulu/Natal
amakhosi (traditional chiefs).
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said in Cape Town
today Makwetu had asked the president whether he could join him
at the meeting scheduled for March 15.
</P>
<P>
"The president is considering the request and whether he
should invite other political leaders," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi are also expected to attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled meeting is expected to discuss the possibility
of holding an imbizo (a national gathering of Zulus).
</P>
<P>
The imbizo, proposed earlier by Mandela, is widely considered
an urgent step to bring an end to the increasing violence in the
strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that political violence in the province between
supporters of the IFP and the African National Congress has
claimed about 20,000 lives in the past few years.

KAMPALA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni this evening met United States Secretary of Commerce
Ronald Brown, who arrived here hours ago for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, President Museveni told the American
delegation that his government would ensure the forthcoming
elections are held on schedule and will be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the president also appealed to American
investors to address their investments mainly in areas of roads
construction, establishment of industrial estates and power
generation.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is on a five-nation African tour, said that the
United States is pleased about the progress made in political and
economic reforms in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He described his visit to Africa as a mission to set a base
for and encourage the American private investors in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
But he observed that the American businessmen complained to
him this morning of discriminatory laws against foreign companies
as well as bureaucratic inertia and bottlenecks in handling
investment applications in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni assured Brown that the bottlenecks in processing
investment applications will be done away with.

LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has pledged to work
towards Nigeria's return to the Commonwealth, saying the
situation in Nigeria requires understanding and dialogue instead
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano made the remarks in
Maputo while receiving a special message from Nigerian leader
Sani Abacha from visiting Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi,
Radio Nigeria reported this evening.
</P>

Chissano criticized the suspension of Nigeria's membership

international organizations, such as the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Following the November 10 hanging of nine Ogoni activists for
murder in southern Nigeria, the Commonwealth summit in New
Zealand decided to suspend Nigeria's membership. The country
then came under sanctions from some western countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Foreign Minister Ikimi pledged Nigeria's continued
commitment to the strengthening of the OAU, saying that Africa
remains the central piece of Nigeria's foreign policy.
