<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, maybe it's too early for that, but fans tonight should get
a nice sample of what could be one of the most heated rookie races
of all time when the Los Angeles Clippers meet the Rockets at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, basketball isn't supposed to be about individual matchups,
but how can we resist the temptation to measure the Clippers' Lamar
Odom against the Rockets' Steve Francis?
</P>
<P>
   It is a matchup that could rival the 1995 rookie race, when
Jason Kidd, then with Dallas, made a fast finish to catch Detroit's
Grant Hill at the wire to share co-Rookie of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in NBA history that two rookies
shared the award, the other time being in 1971, when Boston's Dave
Cowens and Portland's Geoff Petrie were co-winners.
</P>
<P>
   And when you mix in other first-year players like Chicago's
Elton Brand, Charlotte's Baron Davis, Minnesota's Wally
Sczczerbiak, Phoenix's Shawn Marion and Boston's Adrian Griffin,
you figure things could be mighty close when it comes to the final
rookie vote this season.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Francis nor Odom claims to be much interested in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not really a race, because those guys are being
asked to do something different,'' Francis said of his rookie
competition. ``They are being asked to go out each game and put up
30 shots. That's not my job on this team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The (very) early favorites in the rookie race:
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom, Clippers _ A 6-10 swingman who has played all five
positions this season, Odom has to be the front-runner not only
because of his numbers (16.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists
per game) and incredible skills but, perhaps more important,
because he has been given a light that is the brightest shade of
green.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis, Rockets _ Francis has faced perhaps the most
difficult transition of the league's top rookies. The 6-3 point
guard had to adjust his game early to fit in with Hakeem Olajuwon
and Charles Barkley, only to see both go down with injuries. Now
Francis (16.8 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.4 assists per game) is
being asked to make his teammates, not himself, look good.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand, Bulls _ Brand (16.7 points, 9.5 rebounds per game)
has the same green light Odom enjoys, but his teammates seem to
have a red light when it comes to getting him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Griffin, Celtics _ He's a bigger long shot than Francis
the Talking Mule in the Preakness, but at this point you have to
include Griffin, a Continental Basketball Association refugee who
is averaging 10.3 points and 7.9 rebounds, because he and Odom tied
for Rookie of the Month honors for November.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, a question mark before this year's draft, has been the
most impressive overall, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what piece they are missing, but they're missing
one right now, and it's probably just some experience,'' Indiana's
Mark Jackson said of the Clippers. ``But when you put a guy like
Lamar Odom out there, you're going to have a chance, because he's a
special basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares about winning, and that's rare with a lot of these
young guys these days. He has a tremendous future ahead, and I
would love to have a piece of stock in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even former NBA great Magic Johnson, whose allegiances lie with
the cross-town Lakers, sees Odom as something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still looking for someone to take up where Michael
(Jordan) left off,'' Johnson said of the league's search for a
player the public can embrace. ``It's actually just waiting to be
grabbed. (Toronto's) Vince Carter is emerging as someone who could
be the one. Maybe it's Kobe (Bryant) on our team (the Lakers).
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's someone like Lamar Odom. I don't know who it is
going to be, but whoever it is has to win championships. That's
important. Fans really are attracted to winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing that's not the criterion for Rookie of the Year,
since the top three contenders _ Odom, Francis and Brand _ play for
teams that are a combined 20-63.
</P>
<P>
   But those teams won't be down like that for long with talent
like this around, and none of these first-year players is about to
back down from any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best part about playing in the league,'' Odom said.
``Every night you're going against somebody that's going to make
you bring it.''

PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT TOPS MILLENNIUM RESOLUTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Harrison Sheppard 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- With not just any new year only hours away, the
personal improvement industry is doing a box office business.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness gyms, stop smoking clinics and dating services are being
flooded by people making resolutions to themselves as the
once-in-a-lifetime millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been our busiest December in history,'' said Dennis
Durante, chief executive officer of video dating service Great Exp
in Los Angeles, including Encino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is millennium-hyped. It's like, I'm going to
have balance in my life and I'm going to make these adjustments and
this is a good time to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The change of millennium, he said, serves as a benchmark for
people. ``Is it going to take you another millennium, or are you
going to take some action in your life? We've seen a real personal
commitment. This has been our best year.''
</P>
<P>
   Geri Berger, a jewelry store owner from Calabasas, is one of
those who sees the new millennium as an opportunity, and she plans
``to try to live every day to the fullest and try to make every day
count.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said she has seen too much hype about disaster striking
in Y2K, from terrorist attacks to computer outages, but she doesn't
buy any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's going to be a new beginning, not the end of the
world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium change may be motivating more people to seek
personal improvements, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just seeing the year 2000 as a year of new
beginnings,'' said Lynn Jarvis, a Glendale psychologist. ``They are
trying to clean up past wounds and hurts and make things right.''
</P>
<P>
   For some perennial resolution makers the change of the
millennium is just another new year, another chance to resolve to
lose weight or quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Hawksby, a 28-year-old waitress from Van Nuys who has smoked
for 10 years, pointed to her pack of Marlboro Lights and said her
resolution is ``the same one I make every year quit smoking.'' She
also hopes to go to the gym more often and cut out fatty foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's is a trip,'' Hawksby said. ``Mentally it sets aside
a whole new perspective on something to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dempsey, manager of Independent Fitness Consultants in
Sherman Oaks, said he has seen a lot of people come in with
ambitious goals for the new year, only to be told to scale them
down to more achievable steps, or face disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people don't realize how much work and effort
is involved, because it didn't take them very long to get out of
shape,'' Dempsey said. ``They think the reverse is the same Give me
a few weeks and I'll get back to how I was in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan was out of town Wednesday, but a
spokeswoman said the mayor has resolved to focus on children in the
last full year of his term, and has declared 2000 The Year of the
Child in Los Angeles. At his year-end press conference last week,
Riordan said he wanted to improve education and health care for
children in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward into the 21st century, we must ensure that
no one is left behind and that everyone, especially children,
shares in the prospect of a better future,'' Riordan said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Others have yet to make a resolution or don't plan to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never make a New Year's resolution because I can never keep
it,'' said Marci Bogusz, a 38-year-old Woodland Hills resident.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bogusz said, the pressure of trying to keep them
creates too much stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for my kids, it's different,'' she added, laughing. ``They
have to clean up their room.''

SOME EMPATHIZE WITH PARENTS WHO LEFT DISABLED CHILD AT HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs for rewriting throughout) 
(sw) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXTON, Pa. _ Parents with disabled children reacted with sad
recognition on Wednesday to the news that a wealthy couple in this
Philadelphia suburb had been charged with leaving their severely
disabled 10-year-old son at a hospital after saying they could not
care for him.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who knew the couple, Richard and Dawn Kelso, told
the police and hospital officials that the family's schedule of
visiting nurses had fallen apart over Christmas, leaving the Kelsos
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a handicapped child is overwhelming enough by itself,
without being able to find help when you need it,'' said Beth Gage
of Elizabethtown, Pa., who has a 17-year-old son with several
disabilities who did not know the Kelsos. ``People put up a good
front in public, acting like everything's hunky-dory, but behind
closed doors they fall apart,'' Ms. Gage said. ``I can't tell you
how many time I've felt like quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos were charged on Tuesday with child abandonment and
conspiracy after, the police said, they left their son, Steven, who
has cerebral palsy, at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children
in Wilmington, Del., on Sunday. Hospital officials said Mrs. Kelso
told an emergency room receptionist that she could not care for
Steven and left him in his wheelchair along with his diapers,
medication, toys and a folder containing his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos are free while awaiting court action, but are
forbidden to send letters or gifts to Steven or to phone him.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who breathes with the aid of a ventilator, has been a
frequent patient at the DuPont Hospital, and he will remain there
in the custody of the Delaware Department of Family Services while
it investigates ``the child's needs and the parents' abilities to
parent,'' said Trish Hearn, a spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kelso, 45, is just finishing a three-year term as a
volunteer board member of the Pennsylvania Developmental
Disabilities Council, a position to which she was appointed by Gov.
Tom Ridge. The council advises the state on issues affecting
disabled persons. Kelso, 62, is president and chief executive of
the PQ Corp., a chemical company in Valley Forge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents of Shallow Springs Court, where the Kelsos
have lived for about three years, said they did not know the
couple. But Pat Mastricola, who lives a few doors from them, said
she had seen Steven on Halloween last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought him out to go trick-or-treating last year, and he
could ring the doorbell himself, so that was something,'' Mrs.
Mastricola said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had round-the-clock nurses,'' she added. ``That pretty much
kept him indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Savitz, the Kelsos' lawyer, did not return telephone calls
on Wednesday. John Reed, a spokesman for the PQ Corp.,would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsos' situation was clearly recognizable to other parents
of disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that this family cares for this child,'' said
Jackie Golden, program coordinator for the National Parents Network
on Disabilities, an advocacy group for disabled children, ``but you
reach a breaking point. People assume that you have all kinds of
options, but you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't abandon him _ they were trying to get help,''
added Ms. Golden, whose retarded son is 18. ``You cannot judge this
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Susanmarie Trout, a Philadelphia mother of a disabled daughter
who said she had lobbied state agencies with Mrs. Kelso, noted that
because of her volunteer work, Mrs. Kelso probably knew of the
services available to parents of disabled children. Ms. Trout said
the fact that Steven required mechanical help to breath was one of
the most severe burdens his parents had to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children with ventilators are often denied access to
programs,'' Ms. Trout said. ``They train us parents to operate
those things, but when it comes to your child being involved in the
community they say, `No, no _ this child needs a nurse at all
times.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lilliam Rangle-Diaz, a member of the National Council on
Disabilities, a federal advisory panel, was less inclined to give
the Kelsos the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to judge this family, but abandoning a child is
simply not acceptable, so this certainly sounds like an extreme
case,'' Ms. Rangle-Diaz said from her home in Florida. ``He is not
the only child on a ventilator.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Let's get real. Gary Mallen doesn't really
think he can bring the Internet to its knees on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the Leawood, Kan., ad man from setting up a
Web site called www.crashtheweb.com for a New Year's weekend
promotion that pokes a little fun at all the hype surrounding Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to let the air out of the tire a little bit,''
Mallen said.
</P>
<P>
   For $1.29, visitors to the Web site can download and print an
``official participation certificate'' for the Crash the Web
Millennium Celebration. Two local businesses are offering discounts
to certificate holders.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Mallen's tongue-in-cheek promotion hopes for a
midnight electronic onslaught that will knock out the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought people were tired of the Y2K scare,'' said Mallen,
owner of Mallen &AMP; Friends. ``This was our way to let people say,
`These are just machines, and we're going to take control of
them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad firm, Muller + Co., helped line up two FM radio
stations as sponsors. The stations started running spots promoting
crashtheweb.com on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The spots prompted calls from readers who wondered whether
crashtheweb.com could really ``crash the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. The worst that could happen is that visitors would
knock out the server that houses the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe if we got a gazillion hits...'' Mallen said.
</P>
<P>
   Mallen said he had received calls from radio stations in
Oklahoma City and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Mallen doesn't really expect a whole lot of people to log in and
hit his Web site at midnight Friday. He figures they'll have other
things to do.
</P>
<P>
   But until New Year's Eve, and on Jan. 1, Mallen figures it's an
inexpensive way for people to get a Year 2000 souvenir. He says the
$1.29 only covers expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I thought, `Wouldn't it be cool if my
grandmother had left a remembrance from 1900,''' Mallen said.
``This lets people be part of a millennium event they can have a
record of.''
</P>
<P>
   YEAR 2000 SALE
</P>
<P>
   Psssst. Hey mister ... wanna buy one of the hottest Web sites on
the Net?
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, a Canadian computer programmer who generally is
recognized as the man most responsible for making Y2K a household
word, is selling his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. www.year2000.com, one of the most visited sites on the Web,
is on the auction block. De Jager listed the Web site on eBay Dec.
22. Bidding starts at a cool million.
</P>
<P>
   No bids yet, but bidding doesn't close until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the Year 2000 Information Center in 1995 for a
single purpose _ to create awareness of the year 2000 computer
problem and to get people to take the problem seriously,'' de Jager
said. ``To the best of our ability, we achieved that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   To help spark the sale, de Jager is offering a $10,000 reward to
``the first person that suggests someone that actually ends up
buying the domain.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 ideas have been sent along so far, with the
most-often named buyer being either Bill Gates or his company,
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very useful to them when Windows 2000 comes out in
late 2001 or early 2002,'' according to one pundit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates will buy your domain. Simply because he can,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   But here's our favorite of those suggestions sent in so far...
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps eBay should...use the domain name as an online auction
site for those survivalists who wish to unload their unused
generators, canned and bat sastereria

</P>
<P>
   By Victor Whitman and Mike Goens
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   One Haleyville man is dead and another is in police custody
following an 11-hour standoff that ended at noon Wednesday with the
release of a female hostage, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Bridgeman, 42, was killed nearly 15 hours before the
standoff was resolved at a small, one-story house near the
Marion-Winston line just southwest of Haleyville.
</P>
<P>
   The man whom authorities say shot Bridgeman 33-year-old Rodney
Foster was held Wednesday night in the Marion County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage, Jenny Davis, 25, was released unharmed at 11:57
a.m., authorities said. Foster surrendered three minutes later, as
he earlier promised hostage negotiators he would do.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers spokesman Cpl. Terry Windham said Davis was
``romantically involved'' with Bridgeman and Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Sheriff's Chief Deputy Tommy Wooten said charges likely
will be filed against Foster later today. The charges could include
murder and kidnapping, Wooten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get statements from everyone involved before any
charges are made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster previously has been charged with about a dozen felonies,
according to law enforcement sources. They said the charges led to
jail time in some cases that involved theft, burglary and drug
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten said authorities have recovered a .380-caliber handgun
that they believe was used to kill Bridgeman.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said Bridgeman was killed just after 9 p.m. Tuesday and
his body was dragged to the back yard of the house, which is about
four miles southwest of Haleyville on Alabama 129.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the body was removed from the house several minutes
before the standoff with law enforcement began about 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, Foster and at least two other men gathered at the house
Tuesday night for a party, according to the sources. They said
Bridgeman showed up and demanded that Dennis return to his house
and remove her belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say investigators believe a lengthy argument followed
and Bridgeman was shot at least once in the living room area of the
house. The sources say Foster took Dennis hostage at that time and
asked two friends at the party to go to a local store and buy
kerosene, which was needed to burn Bridgeman's body.
</P>
<P>
   When the friends returned, they gave the fuel to Foster and are
believed to have left the residence as Foster dragged the body to
the backyard, sources added.
</P>
<P>
   They said the two men who bought the kerosene then drove about
20 miles to Double Springs to report the shooting to an officer
whom they knew.
</P>
<P>
   The Double Springs officer contacted Marion County officials
about midnight, nearly three hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A Marion County deputy arrived 30 minutes later and knocked on
the door. Foster told him to get off his porch, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the officer that everyone in the house was fine, but
that he had a gun and would kill the woman if he (the officer) did
not leave,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Backup units, including Alabama Bureau Investigation hostage
negotiators, were dispatched to the scene moments later.
</P>
<P>
   After being told that Foster likely was intoxicated as a result
of drinking about three pints of whiskey, authorities opted to
allow Foster to ``sleep it off'' since the woman did not appear to
be in immediate danger, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators did not establish contact with Foster until 8 a.m.,
Windham said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Foster was ``very cooperative'' when talks resumed
and told officials that he would release the woman and surrender at
noon.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly gave up about 9:30 a.m., ``but recanted and he told
them that he was a man of his word and that he would wait until
noon,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, no one else got hurt,'' Wooten said. ``The
hostage negotiators were patient and did a great job of resolving
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis requested to be taken to Haleyville Hospital but had no
serious physical injuries, Windham said.

AS MANKIND LEFT THE FIRST MILLENNIUM, PROBLEMS ABOUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THEO the SMUDGED  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ital)Editor's note: Any peering around the corner of time can
be a bit unsettling. Yet, uncertainty about where we may be headed
today cannot be compared with mankind's trepidations as it emerged
from the first millennium. Channeled through another gray-bearded
scribe, Kansas City Star National Editor Darryl W. Levings, Theo
reminds us that while the only bug worrying him was the flea in his
cowl, he and his contemporaries had Y1K problems aplenty.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I sit here in this miserable cell high on the rocks above a gray
sea and under a gray sky, a most lowly monk in the small Hiberian
monastery of Skillheda.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us copy the great manuscripts, but because we are about
to add a fourth digit to the worm of history, Brother Ferdomnach
has required me to compile all that is known about our time, so
that it may be passed down to future generations. Privately, I
question the task. To most men of my day, time is almost
meaningless, except to judge by the sun when to eat and by the
seasons when to plant. The year 999 is hardly different than the
year 777. Besides, if the Day of Judgment is to arrive soon, as
some say, who will be left to read it?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, I wonder if Brother Ferdomnach may simply wish me away
from the precious stock of parchment. Not for nothing am I known as
``the Smudged.'' But I cannot help my shaking hands. It is so cold
here at the end of the year, and one never knows when a Norse sail
might round the point. Ah, but it needs a high wall to keep out
fear, as the saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Poor Theo. He is at the very end of what some call
Europe's Dark Ages, considered to have lasted from the fall of the
Roman Empire _ from about A.D. 476 to around 1000. ``Dark'' only
hints at the never-ending warfare, lawlessness, barbarism, disease
and depthless ignorance of most of his contemporaries. But, while
much of Europe is backward and isolated, empires are prospering
around the globe. In China, the Sung Dynasty is not exactly secure
behind the Great Wall and must pay tribute to the Khitan horsemen
to the north. Yet, it is so stable that it is about to print paper
money and give civil service exams.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running Byzantine Empire, waxing once again, is pushing
back into Syria and the Balkans. The power of Islam, though
beginning to fracture, still stretches from Persia to southern
Spain. In India, the Chola Empire is conquering Ceylon and will
soon be challenging Indonesia's Kingdom of Srivijaya for control of
sea trade routes. In Africa, the kingdom of Ghana is enjoying a
thriving gold trade. _ DWL.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   These devilish Norsemen have long ravished our coasts,
consigning our good works to the flames and putting many protesting
brothers to the sword. Although High King Brian Boru has reclaimed
much of Ireland from the Danes settled in the south, he cannot stop
a vengeful raid from the sea. Back in my home of England, King
Ethelred ``The Unready'' cowers before Forkbeard, even buying peace
with 24,000 pounds of silver, what they call Danegeld.
</P>
<P>
   The Norse are cunning, it is true, even in trade. They enjoy a
thriving commerce in slaves, furs and amber with corrupt
Constantinople, even with the infidel Saracens. There seems to be
no sea they will not sail and one, Bjerne Herjulfsson, is said to
have seen a strange forested land over the waters to the West about
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)``From the wrath of the Northmen O'Lord, deliver us,''
said the ninth century Frankish liturgy. No one in Northern Europe
could feel safe from the Danes, Norsemen or Vikings, as they are
better known. The word ``Russia'' may be rooted in the word
``rower,'' which gives us an idea of the extent of their river
trade routes. (They do NOT wear horns in their helmets, by the
way.) Their vigor as invaders is about spent, with the exception of
Forkbeard (Danish King Sweyn), who will soon conquer all England.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1000 will be a notable one... MORE
</P>
<P>
   (ital)...who will soon conquer all England.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1000 will be a notable one for Leif Ericsson, son of
Eric the Red, who colonized Greenland. Leif lands in ``Vineland,''
either Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, where he runs into
``Skraelings.'' Yet he would know nothing of the thriving Indian
cultures far to the south. There, the Mayan city-state civilization
has already peaked and is under pressure from the Toltec Empire
pushing down from central Mexico. In a few years the Pueblo culture
known as the Anasazi will make its mark on the American Southwest,
while new mounds and Woodhenges are rising in what will soon be a
thriving city south of where the Missouri and Mississippi rivers
meet. _ DWL.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   No protection has been afforded us. We sent pleas to Sylvester
II, the Holy Father in Rome, but to no avail. He is The Sun of our
time, and Emperor Otto, the moon. Together they have called for
bringing unbelievers into the Church in time for Judgment Day. (It
is hard to take faith in these conversions when in Iceland the
so-called Christians in the All Thing will allow pagans to continue
their horse sacrifices.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, not even the Pope, especially a reforming Pope, is
safe in these times. (You do not forget that he is the first from
France and a former tutor of Otto). His German predecessor, Gregory
V, was driven out by the rabble clans of Rome, who installed their
own usurper. The emperor dealt harshly with them, gouging out the
eyes, severing the tongue and cutting off the lips of the antipope,
John Philagathos, before parading him backward on a donkey. Severe
treatment, yes, but what was Otto to do? Even if Philagathos was
his godfather, Gregory was his brother-in-law and one must have
stability in the church.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Otto III, son of a Saxon king and a Byzantium princess, is
no Charlemagne and has his hands full as the Holy Roman Emperor.
Although a dreaming, bookish teen-ager, he is trying to contend
with the Slavs to the east, consolidate his hold on Rome and deal
with civil conflict back home in Germany. His idea of reuniting the
eastern and western wings of Christianity is coolly received by
Basil II, the Byzantine leader known as the ``Bulgar killer.''
Believed poisoned by his Roman mistress, Otto and his idea of mass
conversions will soon die.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity, nevertheless, is taking root among the Slavs and
the Norse. One powerful believer, Norway's King Olaf, has
enlightened one recalcitrant countryman by forcing the pagan to
swallow a live viper. The All Thing, by the way, is Iceland's
ruling parliament, begun in 930 and continuing through the 20th
century. _ DWL.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   We ink the great books, copying them by the light of the sun,
sometimes by light of dripping, stinking tallow. It is a great
tradition, one that keeps alive the words of our Lord, the saints
and the great thinkers. But I look at this next generation and
wonder where the scribes will come from. The young men of good
houses seem more interested in the violent arts and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Fingers cramped from years of copying and decorating
manuscripts page by page, Theo would be encouraged to know that
movable type will soon be invented by the Chinese. But for the
wealthy or pious wishing for a wider distribution of Bibles in
Europe, it will be more than 400 years before Gutenberg develops
his own press. A classic will soon be available; 1000 is the year
when ``Beowulf'' _ sung in castle halls for two centuries _ will be
first be written in Old English. Paper will not reach England until
1300, although it was found in China as early as A.D. 105. By
Theo's day, a Chinese encyclopedia of 1,000 volumes already has
been completed, and the first novel, The Tale of the Genji, is
being written by a Japanese baroness. _ DWL(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   How I itch to leave this benighted island and its miserable
Irish villeins. So poor. (It must be true that Satan has exempted
them from hell because of their smell.) Almost all were born here,
and surely all will die here without traveling more than a few
miles from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)About that itch. Theo, just like many far richer than he,
is wearing only coarse woolens without underwear. It is his only
change of clothing and he almost never takes it off his
dirt-encrusted body. People here long ago forgot the Roman habit of
bathing. Which is why skin conditions were so prevalent in this
age.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation is nonexistent. Glass is an extreme rarity in the
windows of Northern Europe, and warmth is so hard to find that
people wear more clothes inside their dwellings than out. Privacy
is a rarity unless you're a hermit. The households of commoners are
dominated by one large bedstead, covered with vermin-ridden straw
pallets, on which the whole family slept, often with their farm
animals and even passing strangers, for warmth. There may or not be
a table.
</P>
<P>
   The great roads built... MORE
</P>
<P>
   ...may or not be a table.
</P>
<P>
   The great roads built by the Romans have crumbled away in many
areas, but if a peasant should decide to strike out on one, he
knows he probably would not find his way back. But to leave home,
one would have to be half mad. The priests preach of monsters, of
bad things happening in the night (not surprising when you
understand that wolf packs will still be snatching children off the
streets of Paris 400 years later).
</P>
<P>
   Theo is part of an agrarian society, with few market towns in
Ireland (and those established by the Danes he so hates). A
Christian European city with 10,000 residents is a rare thing. Even
Rome, which numbered 750,000 in Caesar's time, is down to about
50,000. But Europe is about to experience major population growth,
and the Black Plague is not due for more than 300 years. _ DWL(end
ital).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my eyes water, and the growls from my stomach drown out the
droning of my brother monks. It is the smells (and smoke) from
abbot's kitchen. Meat! I wonder if they are using a spice. I have
tasted too little of these wondrous substances: pepper, cloves,
nutmegs, mace and others of which I do not even know the names. A
high churchman, of course, can afford such a thing, which helps to
disguise the fact that he sometimes serves the guests salted beef
that has been in the cask too long. For we scribes, it will be
pulse again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, hard as it is here, it is said to be worse in the land of
the Franks. Why, I have heard stories of gallows being torn down by
men eager to get at the still warm flesh. But perhaps, Brother
Ferdomnach would not wish me to dwell on such unhappy tidings.
</P>
<P>
   (ital)While a man of rank might be served from 15 to 20 dishes
at dinner, the general population is often hungry. Famine strikes
about one year out of four, and then peasants can be reduced to
eating bark and selling every last stitch of clothes to survive.
Bread made of wheat is a luxury, although beer consumption is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperous carry a dirk, for eating as well as
self-protection. Almost everything is finger food, including the
pulse, a kind of lentil, on which Theo will sup. Forks are far off
down history's plank. The smokiness can be explained by the fact
that fireplaces with chimneys will be an outlandish luxury for a
few hundred more years. But the days of Georgian chants are
numbered; do-re-mi-fa-sol is just around time's corner.
</P>
<P>
   Living conditions for most of mankind is poor across the world,
although for many non-Europeans food is not such a problem. The
Tiahuanaco of Peru are enjoying excellent yields of maize and
potatoes _ which Theo's people will not see for 500 years. Crop
rotation among the Mayans has yielded crops of avocados, tomatoes,
squash and peanuts. There is also tobacco to be enjoyed, devoid of
health warnings. Arabs have brought the lemon to Spain. In China,
double and even triple cropping of rice mean that one fourth of the
world's 280 million live here. _ DWL(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Let me think of something to amuse you and to divert my
seditious stomach. Ah yes, I grew up with a frydman's son who also
became a monk. It is said that he built a gliding machine, leapt
with it from a high place in Malmesbury Abbey and flew for an
astonishing 600 feet. I believe the devil made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of strange things, I am reminded that The Holy Father
Sylvester has just imposed something called the Arabic numerical
system, of which many good Christians are suspicious. I, for one,
do not understand this new concept of ``zero.'' Why should it be
considered if it is worth nil?
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Some of the most significant technological advances to
canter into Theo's tale are the horseshoe, saddle, stirrup and
horse collar, all appearing in over the last 100 years or so. They
will revolutionize agriculture and transportation. Meanwhile,
Arabic astronomy is setting the standard for coming centuries. In
southern Spain, where Jewish intellectuals advise the Moors,
universities are thriving. In India, the mathematician Sridhara is
expounding on the importance of ``zero,'' a concept the Mayans may
have had for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   If Denys the Diminutive had been aware of it when he counted
back to the years to the birth of Jesus (which he probably
miscalculated by six years, anyway) we wouldn't have this confusion
about when the new millennium begins. Although the brilliant
Sylvester II was familiar with the abacus, astrolabe (a navigation
device) and water clocks, such wonders were little understood in
Europe. In China, canal locks and the crankshaft are being used to
advantage, and they have just invented gunpowder, but use it for
fireworks, not weapons. In Ecuador, the natives are smelting
platinum, although how they achieved such high temperatures is
still a mystery. _ DWL.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful stories of beautiful things in other lands (warmer
ones, especially) slowly reach our eager ears. In Venice, a port
rich from the trade with Asia, they have been building a new Church
to house the bones of St. Mark. It is doubtful they will be ready
in time for Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, who will be? For sure, the good Sylvester. Perhaps
Otto, who has spent weeks preparing in a hermit's cell. Certainly
not the bishop, who has had more concubines than I have nits. I see
little sign of sinners repenting, although there may be an increase
in the burning of heretics.
</P>
<P>
   If some sermons are to be believed, the Antichrist will be here
on the last day of 999, or is it the last day of 1000? There's
those devilish zeros again! Could they be another warning of doom?
Some see signs in such things, such as the earthquake that
destroyed the cupola of St. Sophia in Constantinople or the sea
monster Brother Fergil saw beached on the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, tremulous earth and dead orcas are hardly new, and, for
good or evil, the world is still here. So I wonder if too much is
being made of this date.
</P>
<P>
   Time will reveal all. Or naught.

THE TRUTH BEHIND THE BONUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ About one-third of Kansas City employers are
plumping up their employees' end-of-the-year paychecks with some
kind of bonus.
</P>
<P>
   It may not arrive now, at the end of the calendar year. It may
come 60 to 90 days after the end of the company's fiscal year,
whenever that is.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final days of 1999, a lot of people are thinking
about the amount they'll report to Uncle Sam on April 15. Slowly,
more area workers are factoring in pay-for-performance bonuses that
a few years ago were mostly the province of management.
</P>
<P>
   Don Feltham, a principal in the management consulting firm of
Burgess &AMP; Associates and the source of the one-third estimate,
recently completed a survey of 50 Kansas City area employers
representing 117,000 employees. Thirty-four percent offered what's
called ``variable pay'' to non-exempt hourly as well as to
non-exempt salaried and exempt salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking million-dollar bonuses for Wall Street
wheeler-dealers. The local survey found that variable-pay awards
represent only 2.6 percent of the average hourly worker's pay. But,
hey, that's 2.6 percent more than would have been earned from base
pay alone.
</P>
<P>
   Variable awards for local non-exempt salaried workers amounted
to a fairly paltry 1.34 percent of their pay. Exempt-level managers
and executives fared better, getting variable add-ons worth 5.48
percent of their base.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of annual raises that hugged the 4 percent mark _
and will continue to do so next year, according to several national
salary surveys _ bonuses of any size are welcome additions to
income.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many jobs have long been pay-for-performance. In sales,
for example, individual production almost always influences pay.
But in many other jobs, workers are paid a set amount, regardless
of their individual production or the organization's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gain-sharing or bonus plans that are designed well are the
ones that reward people for moving the organization where it wants
to go,'' Feltham said.
</P>
<P>
   Those designs can include individual awards for star performance
and collective awards for team, divisional or full company results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incentive systems are very powerful,'' Feltham observed.
``They do move people.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, performance-based pay also helps organizations
keep a lid on payroll. The sustained economic growth and tight
labor market theoretically should be pushing wages and salaries
higher. They have not.
</P>
<P>
   Investor pressure on management to cut costs is one reason why
pay increases for most workers have stayed barely ahead of the rate
of inflation. Compensation consultants also believe the growth in
variable pay has flattened base-pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're not in the ``lucky'' one-third of bonus-prone
employment, you may not want to pine in envy. Even if you earned a
bonus it might not be very big, and it may be siphoning off from
whatever base raise you otherwise might have received.
</P>
<P>
   It also could be delicious gravy. And it's human nature to
appreciate even modest recognition rewards.

Y2K EVEN AFFECTS AMISH _ IT BOOSTS SALES AT THEIR SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMESPORT, Mo. _ At times it appears that some residents are in
no hurry to jump into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Amish people roll down Main Street in horse-drawn buggies. Dusty
roads meander to farmhouses with no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the New Year approaches, city folks are turning to Amish
merchants for provisions and advice about how to survive possible
Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people think that we're the best place to go, because we
know how to live without electricity and things like that,'' said
Sue Beechy, whose family owns H&AMP;M Country Store.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, including many from Kansas City, have stocked up on
100-pound bags of pasta and beans. Beechy said it was hard to say
how much business had increased, but ``it has made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the bulk items, the shelves at H&AMP;M are filled with
homemade pastries and powdered food.
</P>
<P>
   And Beechy says shoppers also are curious about the family's
appliances. The cash register is powered by a 12-volt battery. The
refrigerator operates on kerosene. And the ventilation system is
run by the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Jamesport, about 80 miles northeast of Kansas City, draws
tourists and shoppers from all over the Midwest who are eager to
visit Amish shops and browse through downtown's antique stores.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from Beechy's shop, Tobie Ropp has been dispensing
tips for months about his field of expertise: wood-fired stoves.
</P>
<P>
   His father sold stoves for decades. And Ropp's Country Variety
remains one of the area's best sellers of the stoves.
</P>
<P>
   Business took off in fall 1998 and this spring. Many customers
have waited until this fall to hook up their stoves, however. Most
out-of-towners said they were preparing for possible Y2K power
outages, Ropp said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back in his chair and stroking his gray beard, Ropp said
with authority, ``Nothing works like a wood-fired stove.''
</P>
<P>
   The safeguards are not cheap. A stove just for heating costs up
to $800. A dual-purpose stove, for heating and cooking, costs up to
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Ropp realizes that shoppers can buy the stoves at farm-supply
stores and other commercial centers. He figures customers feel more
at ease if they can talk with someone who entrusts their own home
to the same stoves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that come here know that's what we use, day in and day
out,'' Ropp said. ``I guess they have confidence that I can answer
any question. I've been in and around these stoves all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to some of these other stores, and they'll tell you,
`If you have a question, just read this pamphlet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the best advice is no substitute for common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will buy a stove and only then realize that they
need a chimney, too,'' Ropp said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Amish merchants say they have enjoyed the extra business brought
on by Y2K, even if it is hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't tell you why they're buying something,''
said Anita Flory, owner of Country Acres, a general store. ``If
they buy a lot of food, you don't know if they're storing it or
eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flory said she had noticed a slight increase in kerosene sales
but stressed she was unsure whether Y2K fears were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Flory did say that sales in her greenhouse were up this spring,
with many shoppers citing Y2K preparation. They bought organically
grown vegetables, such as tomatoes, to can later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Y2K glitches will not affect Amish residents
in Jamesport and throughout the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Amish shun the moral corruption of modern society by
swearing off involvement with it. That means a life that stresses
hard work, a devotion to God and family, and a rejection of modern
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Amish merchants say the only way that Y2K might become a
problem is if the computer bug hampers a supplier or bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several merchants say they have no idea what Y2K will bring. But
they expressed hope that the glitch would not hurt too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Y2K is going to create a problem for people, the
increase in sales isn't a benefit,'' Ropp said. ``It isn't worth it
to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a person doesn't know what's going to take place. No
person does. When the new year comes, I only hope it goes
smoothly.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Be prepared: It's going to be an upside-down,
inside-out Y2K weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will be half-partying on New Year's Eve while
monitoring computers at their offices, while many partyers will be
half-working.
</P>
<P>
   And over the weekend, some offices that normally would be closed
will be busy, and some normally open to the public will be closed
for Y2K testing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this New Year is likely to be historic if only for its
strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some parties could be less festive than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Workers not on duty Friday night at Johnson County (Kan.) Water
District No. 1 have been required to sign pledges promising not to
drink alcohol. They also must leave telephone numbers where they
can be reached in case the call comes from the water treatment
plant's emergency command center that they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But then, work won't exactly be like work either.
</P>
<P>
   At many command centers _ Kansas City Power &AMP; Light,
Southwestern Bell, UtiliCorp, Sprint, Missouri Gas Energy, American
Red Cross and a host of municipal services _ workers will do their
best to remember that Friday night is New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Some will be on double time and drawing Y2K bonus checks while
eating catered holiday meals at the office. Others will be staring
blankly at a 15-inch computer monitor with a handful of cashews.
</P>
<P>
   At Commerce Bank, the technology team will monitor the bank's
branches while trying to celebrate a historic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take Y2K very seriously,'' said President James Reardon,
who put a moratorium on holiday vacations because of the computer
bug. ``But when the coast is clear, horns will be blowing, and
we'll celebrate with nonalcoholic fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely the party won't begin until 1 a.m. Jan. 1 when it
becomes clear there have been no widespread computer disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   At UMB Bank, a fleet of Y2K workers will be served a fancy ham
and turkey dinner on New Year's Eve. Those working the next morning
will be treated to eggs Benedict. Work shifts will be staggered
throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   While bankers are eating eggs, 7-Eleven clerks in 23 Kansas City
convenience stores will get a shot at hourly cash drawings for
those pulling Y2K duty. Top prize? A Volkswagen Bug. (Get it?
Computer bug? VW Bug?)
</P>
<P>
   At the law firm of Lathrop &AMP; Gage, a few souls will trudge in to
the office before midnight to monitor computer systems. For the
effort, they will be treated at a later date to dinner and a swanky
night in an upscale hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., may top any local
efforts. Three hundred programmers, developers and managers will
spend the evening partying with President Steve Ballmer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will supply champagne, dinner, a disc jockey and child
care. Spouses are welcome, and time capsules will be given out.
</P>
<P>
   But before they party, some computer network administrators are
planning to turn off and tune out.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 5 p.m. New Year's Eve, 40 persons at Hallmark Cards
Inc. will work for six hours to shut off nonessential computers and
disconnect from the Internet as a Y2K safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yardeni, a New York economist with Deutsche Bank who
continues to predict a 70 percent chance of worldwide recession
because of Y2K, also is looking for a safety cushion. He plans to
shut down his Web site for 24 hours from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1 to avoid
any Y2K fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton University will close its buildings for 48 hours over
New Year's, fearing possible blackouts and computer problems. It
also will disconnect its computer system from the Internet for
seven hours around midnight Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, some 11,000 students in the Independence School
District will get an extra day of winter vacation while district
officials scan for bug bites on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel comfortable about our Y2K plans,'' says Doug Allen,
the district's technical coordinator. ``But this just gives us an
added cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at least two area banks will open on Saturday
as a show of confidence in the financial sector's Y2K preparations.

STARS GO OVERTIME TO WIN AS HULL DENIED 600TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars fans came to Reunion Arena last night waiting to
cheer Brett Hull's 600th goal. They left cheering No. 57. Stars
winger Jamie Langenbrunner scored the 57th goal of his NHL career
3:17 into overtime to give the Stars a 4-3 victory against the New
York Rangers. ``On my way to 600?'' Langenbrunner repeated,
incredulously. ``Try 60.'' Langenbrunner's wry sense of humor comes
from a season that has been annoyingly lacking in goals. He feels
like a poster child for Dallas' scoring struggles. He had six goals
in 30-plus games before his game-winner. Unfortunately, his numbers
rank him behind only four Stars players for Dallas' scoring lead.
Yes, scoring has been harder to come by than a Cowboys victory away
from Texas Stadium for Langenbrunner and Co. So scoring has become
pressurized. Guys begin clutching sticks a little tighter.
Langenbrunner has. ``Frustrating? Definitely,'' Langenbrunner said.
``Any time you're not capitalizing on opportunities and the team
isn't necessarily scoring the goals it needs to, it is
frustrating.'' He led a charge of unlikely goal scorers against New
York. Ironically, an a four-goal night, Hull was denied his 600th.
Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk had his 21st career goal to
slice New York's lead to 2-1 with 17.6 seconds remaining in the
second period. Stars captain Mike Modano registered his 325th
career goal to tie the game at 2-2 at 4:38 of the third period.
Stars winger Juha Lind scored the fourth goal of his short NHL
career for a 3-2 lead at 7:47 of the third period. The Stars banged
and bumped and fought for this victory, throwing 36 shots and
another 26 missed shots at Rangers goalie Kirk McLean. ``You build
confidence with the way you play, and when you put the passion in
that we did today, we're a real good team,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Regardless of who's in and who's out, we're a
competitive team. It's a big win for us.'' Dallas looked to have to
settle for a tie and a single point as Rangers forward Theo Fleury
scored at 12:02 of the third period. Adam Graves had attempted the
wrap-around on the right side and Fleury wrapped around the other,
poking the puck in during the process. But the Stars had numbers on
their side. Three goals is better than a Jimmy Johnson prediction
for the Stars. Put it in three-inch headlines, when they score
three or more goals, they win. They're 13-0 this season when
reaching the magic number. ``He seemed shaky all night,'' Modano
said of McLean, spelling Mike Richter after he had played 18
consecutive games. ``We finally had some luck go our way.''
Matvichuk had flung the Stars back into last night's game on sheer
will. First, he kept the play alive by diving to keep the puck
onside. Then, he launched a shot past McLean. Stars winger Mike
Keane took a shot that bounced off Blake Sloan's behind to
Matvichuk, who was pinching in. He launched a drive past what had
until then been a seemingly impenetrable McLean with 17.6 seconds
remaining in the second period. Dallas had been getting chances all
period. McLean had been stifling them, and he had a little bit of
luck, too. Referees ruled that the only other shot before that to
squib by him had come after a whistle, signaling a Kevin Hatcher
penalty. So instead of a goal, Dallas got a power play. Not a good
swap for the Stars, who were 0-for-5 with a man advantage until
Modano scored a power-play goal to kick off the third. Lind
followed with another lucky goal that found its way past McLean.
Meanwhile, both of New York's goals were a result of letting
Rangers players roam free in the slot. John MacLean took his gift
at 9:40 of the first period. Kevin Hatcher followed 4 minutes, 16
seconds later. ``I don't know what happened in the first 15
minutes,'' Hitchcock said. ``We were just stuck in mud.'' Suddenly,
the Rangers had a 2-0 lead against what hasn't exactly been a
scintillating Stars offense lately. Matvichuk, Modano, Lind and
Lagenbrunner. Together, they don't have 600 goals. They barely have
400. But, after last night, they're gaining on Hull. ``Scoring
goals is a lot of confidence,'' Langenbrunner said. ``I think this
game will go a long way toward that.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ The Big Shootout II? Indeed. But it's not a Texas vs.
Arkansas thing this time around. No, the real battle royal will be
a fraternal one, waged within the Longhorns' family.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the disclaimers to the contrary, and everyone offers
his own politically correct spin, it's not Horns vs. Hogs that
figures to capture the true fancy of the burnt orange-filled
sections of the Cotton Bowl on Millennium Saturday. Arkansas'
comin'-atcha defense will merely serve to provide a point of
reference, a basis of comparison, for judging the relative merits
of Texas' two quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the Forty Acres faithful, the Big Shootout II is Major
Applewhite vs. Chris Simms, the super sophomore vs. the freshman
phenom. Opie vs. Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   May the best man win. And may the second-best man not stomp off
in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the old saying, `When you have two quarterbacks, you
don't have one,''' concedes the Longhorns' offensive coordinator,
Greg Davis, beating the rest of us to the punch (line). ``Except I
really don't believe that's an accurate assessment of our
particular situation. We just think we have two quarterbacks, two
good quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   And both of them, as you know, will receive quality minutes
against the Razorbacks in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl
Classic. Applewhite, the Big 12's Offensive Player of the Year,
will start. Simms, last offseason's No. 1 blue-chip recruit from
coast to coast, will spell him in both halves as Texas attempts to
begin sorting out a most complicated yet _ in theory, anyway _
enviable situation.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the Longhorns figure to contend for their first
undisputed national championship since the last one was achieved
(never mind a measure of dispute emanating from Happy Valley, Pa.)
with the Big Shootout defeat of the Hogs in Fayetteville three
decades ago. As to whether Applewhite or Simms will ultimately lead
UT on a return expedition to the mountaintop, coach Mack Brown
begins answering that question New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   A given: Whatever happens against the Razorbacks will create
some sort of controversy. Brown knows it, though, and he seems
comfortable with the prospect, having twice posted 10-1 records
while alternating quarterbacks at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chris Keldorf nor Oscar Davenport, however, came to
Carolina with Simms-sized potential _ never mind a famous
football-slinging, Super Bowl-winning daddy _ nor had they been
called the best quarterback at their school in more than half a
century, as Applewhite has.
</P>
<P>
   But Major finished the latest season poorly as the Texas offense
went scoreless over the final six quarters in consecutive losses to
Texas A&AMP;M and Nebraska. A severe case of stomach flu cost him the
start against the Aggies, and Simms had the Longhorns ahead at
halftime. The moment the freshman faltered, Applewhite was
summoned, but a savior he wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nebraska completely thwarted him in the Big 12 title game.
Soon thereafter it was announced Simms would have his chance
against Arkansas, albeit only to better prepare him for a second
season of understudying Applewhite. Brown insists Simms can't win a
starting job no matter what he might do Saturday or, for that
matter, during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   What Simms can win, nonetheless, is a seed of doubt about
Applewhite's upper hand in the coaches' minds. As good as Opie can
be when he's at his best, he doesn't look as good as Golden Boy in
a uniform. In terms of physical presence, Major is clearly the
minor partner. Hence, he has more to lose than he has to gain when
the hard-hearted Hogs start swarming his slight personage in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite's staunchest supporters insist Simms' daunting
specter will only make their guy that much tougher to defeat. His
6-1 frame and baby-faced countenance hide a heart as big as Dallas.
But 6-1 is 6-1 is 6-1, and that makes him vulnerable to the
defensive behemoths who want to block out the sun around him.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State intercepted Applewhite thrice, as did Nebraska the
second time around. If national glory is to be achieved, the Kansas
States and the Nebraskas have to be more efficiently dealt with.
Previously, Applewhite was a convincing 2-0 vs. the Cornhuskers,
but his is a what-have-you-done-for-us-lately profession.
</P>
<P>
   Had Brown considered Applewhite, a John Mackovic recruit, as the
be-all, end-all answer to Texas' longstanding quest for another
Bobby Layne, would he have brought in Simms?
</P>
<P>
   And would he risk losing him? It has been suggested that Chris'
father, erstwhile New York Giant Phil, wasn't pleased with his
son's being yanked from the A&AMP;M game. But Davis says he hasn't
spoken with Simms pere since before fall practice began, and Brown
insists he doesn't speak to any parents, period, during the season.
Simms fils, for his part, promises to stay the course at Texas, no
matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Davis contends the key buzzword for everyone here is trust. The
two kids have to trust each other and keep pulling in the same
direction. They must also trust the coaches to do right by them and
the Longhorns at large as Texas bids to roll the clock back 30
years to the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   But these are selfish times. Trust is a lot to ask, considering
the stakes.

DEVILS TOP BRUINS IN OT

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ No matter how it goes for the Bruins the
rest of the season, Pat Burns will be the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, president/general manager Harry Sinden flew from
Boston with the sole purpose of addressing his team in an effort to
end speculation that the Bruins' slump has put Burns's job in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Bruins, the slump continues. Patrik Elias
scored 19 seconds into overtime, as the Devils handed the Bruins a
hard-to-swallow 5-4 overtime loss at the Meadowlands Wednesday
night, stretching Boston's winless streak to five games (0-4-1).
The Bruins have won only twice in 14 games (2-8-4).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins rebounded from a 2-0 deficit on power-play goals by
Ray Bourque and Andre Savage, but surrendered a power-play goal to
rookie Scott Gomez at 3:59 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk tied it at 3 at 9:07 of a wild third period, but
Peter Sykora gave New Jersey a 4-3 lead at 12:34. Joe Murphy
answered for the Bruins, tying it with 2:11 left.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was a bitter disappointment for the Bruins.
Bourque and Don Sweeney collided in the defensive zone, resulting
in a two-on-none for the Devils. Elias cashed in on a slick
cross-ice feed from Sykora from the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you thought you'd seen it all,'' said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went with the criss-cross,'' said Burns, ``and it had a
Keystone Kops effect. It's a basic play they do every day. What are
you going to do? I'm still happy with the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Sinden was candid about his coach, his team,
and the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things have a life of their own and many times they come
from (the media) and there's no basis for it,'' said Sinden. ``What
it does is it causes a lot of concern and a lot of upheaval on the
team. If you don't get it stopped in the most firm way and in the
most affirmative sense, then you'll be defending it the rest of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he saw what has happened with speculation involving
Patriots coach Pete Carroll, and said he wasn't going to allow that
to happen to Burns. He also didn't want his coach and players
distracted. ``I can't leave Pat and I can't leave the team out
there wondering how I feel about this,'' said Sinden. ``I watched
it happen with the Patriots. The team was 6-2, they lost the third
game and it started. He was 6-3 and it began and it never stopped
and you couldn't put it to bed. Nothing is going to happen here _
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Burns said he thought it was possible the
players had been affected by the rumors and he thought he had to
make a point of quashing them. ``What I told the coach and I told
the team is, `We're not going to fire Pat Burns.' It's as simple as
that. Do you understand. It's not going to happen. If it's a
distraction, now you know it's not going to happen. It's no longer
a distraction,' '' said Sinden. ``If Pat's worried about it,
there's no need to worry because it's not going to happen. This is
his team. He has total autonomy here. He picks the players, he
picks the lines, he says who plays and who doesn't. He has as much
autonomy as a coach can have. Whatever way he wants the team to
play, that's his way and he's been pretty damn successful at that.
It never crossed our minds and all of a sudden it becomes an issue
that I have to come down here and talk to Pat and talk to the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he doesn't believe the rumors are the reason the
Bruins are having such a tough time. ``To the point that it
translates into the way they're playing, no. It's way down the list
of what's wrong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he doesn't see one specific thing, instead it's a
multitude of problems. ``Obviously, I've watched so many games and
I can see things I don't like about it as Pat does,'' he said.
``Pat has complete authority to do whatever he wants, to play
whatever way he wants. His way of playing is pretty damn
successful. That's the way he wants the team to go, that's the way
it's going to have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been disturbed recently by the fact that some of his
players have drifted from the system. ``You've got to gather up the
sheep,'' said Sinden, ``and put them back in the pen.''

GLENN FIGHTS SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Terry Glenn's voice was full of shock and disbelief
as he recounted his illness and how he wanted to play last Sunday
against Buffalo, and how he wanted to practice Wednesday only to be
told that he had been suspended for violating team policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad,'' said Glenn from his Walpole home Wednesday
night. ``I'll probably stay away. It's obvious I'm not wanted by
some of the players on the team. I don't understand how they could
attack me without knowing what happened. How could they do that? I
had respect for some of them, but why didn't they bother to know
that I was told by a higher authority that I couldn't play Sunday
when I told them I wanted to play. It shows what kind of leadership
we have around there.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will try to have coach Pete Carroll's decision overturned
by an arbiter. Glenn's agent, James Gould, has asked the union to
set up a hearing in Boston between the union and the management
council so Glenn can play Sunday against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, Glenn was suspended for not showing up for
a meeting at the Milford Radisson Saturday night and for not
showing up Monday and Tuesday for treatment for his respiratory
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he was in constant contact with trainer Ron O'Neil
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for the illness he claims sent his
body temperature to 102 degrees. ``I showed up to the locker room
on Friday and I asked (O'Neil) to take my temperature and he said
it was 102,'' said Glenn. ``He said to me, `You've got to go home.'
They didn't want me infecting the other players, so I left. On
Saturday it worsened. I talked to Ronnie and he said just to lay in
bed and take the medication and get better. Nobody ever said to me
to show up to the hotel. . . . On Sunday, I called Ronnie and I
said I was coming in to play the game. That's when Ronnie told me I
was already inactive and not to bother coming in, but just to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he did not speak to Carroll through this process;
Carroll said he spoke to Glenn Saturday night and Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who took a lot of criticism from teammates for not
showing up Sunday, came in Wednesday morning and immediately met
with Carroll and was informed of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a series of team guidelines that I asked Terry to
take care of and that was to show up Saturday night at the hotel so
we could take care of him so he would be all right for Sunday. He
didn't do that,'' said Carroll. ``On Sunday, we told him to stay
home because he was sick. Then on Monday his unwillingness to come
in and allow us to check up on him and again on Tuesday showed a
lack of willingness to communicate on the whole issue. The timing
is that he's not with the right attitude to be with us this week.
It's unfortunate, but that's the way it is. It wasn't any one
thing. It was a number of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he didn't say a word to Carroll. ``I just listened. I
couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``He came to me with this look, and
he said, `You're suspended. Go home.' I had no idea where that came
from.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Carroll spoke to the team about Glenn's punishment.
Carroll said he and Glenn have spoken on a number of issues in
their three years together. ``This is an attitude situation that
wasn't right. We've worked together on a lot of situations over the
years. This one just came at the wrong time,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said he talked to vice president of personnel Bobby Grier
three times on Tuesday to tell Grier that Glenn not only wanted to
play last Sunday, but that he was ready to return to practice
Wednesday and play against the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   After Glenn met with Carroll, he walked to his car in spot No.
130 at 1:33 p.m., trailing Patriots public relations director
Stacey James, who carried his locker belongings in a green trash
bag that was placed in the back seat of Glenn's Range Rover. Glenn,
wearing a yellow leather jacket, a cap, and sunglasses, got into
his car and left without speaking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Carroll's) going through a lot right now, but at the
same time I feel like the whole season is being blamed on me,''
Glenn said. ``I'll take it on my shoulders because I do take this
personally. I'll work hard this offseason and come back better than
ever. This will motivate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said of teammates who attacked him, ``I call them `pocket
leaders.' They had no right to take shots at my character. There
are some guys who feel they have to be the leader, but you don't
see it on the field as much as you see it from their mouths. They
have no right to attack me.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he ever play with those guys again? ``I can forgive them.
Everybody makes mistakes,'' said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn knows of mistakes. A Dorchester woman accused him of
groping her in a Saugus nightclub parking lot after a team function
the night before Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving morning, he was
stopped for speeding and driving to endanger through the streets of
Walpole, then was three hours late for a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holidays are very hard for me,'' said Glenn, who lost his
mother in a shooting when he was 12 years old. ``I have nobody to
turn to this time of the year, nobody I can be with. That's why,
even though some of my teammates don't realize it, they're like
family to me. I went out with a bunch of them that night. I drank
too much. I was hurting inside and I wanted to get rid of that. My
remedy was to drink. I went overboard. I had no intention of
missing the team meeting the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he rushed to get to the meeting, which was an hour
earlier than normal. He got caught for speeding in Walpole and when
he got to the stadium, faced Carroll. Glenn said Carroll was ready
to suspend him, but that he talked him out of it because ``I asked
whether missing a practice was worse than missing a meeting. I made
the practice. He agreed.'' That's when Carroll kept him out for the
first quarter against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Gould was not notified of the suspension by letter, so he has no
idea whether there's money involved. If there is, it appears that
Glenn will lose a week's pay. The wide receiver was to be paid
$2.66 million with bonuses this season. His base salary is $1.84
million, so a game check is worth about $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe said: ``I think Terry can be a
great player. And I will remain true to him forever. I care about
him as a person. And I think he can be an excellent player.
Obviously he's got (some maturing to do). He's run into some bumps
in the road, but he can be one of the best who ever played the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he really wants the suspension overturned because he
says there's no fairness involved with the punishment. ``I really
want to be out there for the final game,'' said Glenn. ``I owe it
to the season ticket-holders who have supported us all year. I want
to show them I'm dedicated and that I care. That's what really
bothers me, that people don't understand that I really care. This
is my life. I go beyond caring. This is a part of me. It's what I
am.''

everywhere and nowhere on the streets of his hometown. As if
summoning a phantom, his neighbors point to the narrow sidewalks
where he used to scamper about with his friends or to the roof
where they often saw him flying his kite. They cling to his memory
almost as dearly as Elian himself held on to the inner tube he was
strapped to when a boat carrying him, his mother and several other
Cubans capsized as they tried to flee to Florida last month. By

said about Wisconsin's crusade to end welfare _ whether one judges
it kind or cruel, whether one thinks it left the safety net
stronger or in shreds _ the effort has achieved two things. It left
far fewer people on welfare, and it put more of them to work. Yet

order forcing the artists to stop using the Internet address

   GERMANY-INDUSTRY (Frankfurt, Germany) _ At first, it seemed
unlikely, perhaps even a little preposterous: a tax break that
would allow Germany's banking and industrial conglomerates to
untangle more than $100 billion worth of cross-shareholdings. It
did not enhance the idea's credibility that it came from a
left-of-center government with sometimes frosty relations with
business. Or that the government buried it as a footnote in a much
larger tax plan, two days before Christmas. Yet now, nearly a week
after the proposal was circulated, it appears to have a serious
chance of becoming law. If it does, Germany's corporate landscape
may never be the same. By Edmund L. Andrews.

house is not going anywhere, if we can help it.'' On the cusp of
the year 2000, it is hard to imagine what would shock him more:
that houses are going into orbit, or that architects are helping
design them. Certainly, Wright would be wary of the required
synthetic materials and the enormous artistic restraint placed on
designers. But for the small and growing cadre of architects
bravely designing for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, such conditions present interesting, and entirely
new, challenges. ``No problem we are trying to solve has a
predetermined answer,'' said Garrett Finney, one of four architects
in NASA's new Habitability Design Center in Houston. By Florence

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Clint Stoerner will leave the University of Arkansas as
the most prolific passer in school history. Not bad for a guy who
wasn't a varsity quarterback at Baytown Lee until his senior
season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stoerner is proof positive that life's path is rarely
predictable and often surprising. He was an outstanding high school
athlete but not good enough to beat out Jermaine Alfred for the
starting quarterback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played on the junior varsity my sophomore year so I could
start at quarterback,'' Stoerner said. ``In the spring, I battled
with Jermaine for the starting job, and he beat me out. At that
point I just wanted to be on the field, so I moved to split end.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, who was one year ahead of Stoerner, became one of the
best passers in Texas high school history, throwing for more than
5,000 yards as a three-year starter. He was named the Player of the
Year by the Chronicle and the Houston Touchdown Club in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred moved on to Baylor in 1995, and Stoerner finally got a
chance to start at quarterback. He had a strong season, passing for
2,418 yards and 28 touchdowns, but it was too late to get the
attention of college coaches in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any Texas schools that recruited me, but I don't
blame them,'' Stoerner said. ``I was a one-year varsity
quarterback. I was lucky to be recruited by anybody. I didn't think
I would get an opportunity at a big school, so I feel fortunate
that I got in such a good program.''
</P>
<P>
   When they left Baytown, it appeared Alfred was headed for
stardom while Stoerner was hoping to prove he belonged in a
major-college program. But things don't always turn out as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred didn't become a full-time starter until his senior year
at Baylor, closing out his college career this year as the Bears
suffered their fourth consecutive losing season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the Cotton Bowl against Texas, Stoerner will end his
college career by starting at quarterback in his second consecutive
New Year's Day bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising career paths of Stoerner and Alfred, who remain
friends, often have crossed Stoerner's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine was a great high school player who had a tough time
at Baylor,'' Stoerner said. ``I look at Jermaine, and I know we
were headed down that same road before coach (Houston) Nutt came
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing how things have gone for both of us has taught me that
you never know what's ahead in your life, so you have to give it
everything you have every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner, who turned 22 on Wednesday, now gets a chance to end
his college career in his home state against a Texas team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of playing for the national championship, I can't
imagine a better way to end my career,'' Stoerner said. ``I wasn't
around when the big rivalry between these schools was going on, but
I can tell you this is going to be a special game for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner (pronounced Stir-ner) will leave Arkansas with school
records for pass attempts (1,023), completions (528), touchdown
passes (57) and passing yards (7,422). Since he became the starter
in 1997, the Hogs are 20-14, including 16-7 the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clint is a fierce competitor,'' Nutt said. ``He's a guy you
always can count on. He's going to be there. He takes a big hit,
and he keeps going. He's done a lot of great things for the
University of Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner's toughness has allowed him to stay on the field when
other players would have gone to the sidelines. At 6-2 and 215
pounds, he has been strong enough to play with sprained ankles and
broken fingers. But this year he really showed his grit by playing
with a separated throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   One week after suffering the injury in the Louisiana-Monroe
game, Stoerner threw a school-record 52 passes in a 35-28 loss at
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The film of that game was impressive to Texas defensive
coordinator Carl Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoerner is a savvy playmaker who can scramble and make things
happen,'' Reese said. ``He has strong lower legs, which is why
people bounce off him a lot of times. And he throws the deep ball
as well as anyone we have faced. He has a real gift for putting the
deep ball in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner questioned whether he was in the right spot after
back-to-back 4-7 seasons under former Arkansas coach Danny Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would dread going to practice, and I was starting to
question whether this is what I wanted to do,'' Stoerner said. ``I
never considered leaving, because I was taught growing up that you
never quit and always finish what you started. But it wasn't fun
anymore, and I got the same vibes from the other players. Then
coach Nutt came and changed all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Nutt's new offense, Stoerner prospered in 1998 and led the
Razorbacks to a 9-3 season that included a trip to the Citrus Bowl.
He completed 167 of 312 passes for 26 touchdowns and 2,629 yards,
suffering only eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a season of dreams except for one nightmarish moment.
Arkansas was 8-0 when it went to Tennessee to face the top-ranked
Volunteers. The Hogs led 24-21 late in the game, but a fumble by
Stoerner led to the game-winning touchdown for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there has been more than three days since then
that someone hasn't asked me about it,'' Stoerner said. ``It's
something I will carry with me the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner earned some redemption earlier this season when
Arkansas upset Tennessee 28-24 at Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be lying if I told you that wasn't a big day for me,''
Stoerner said. ``We just wanted it more than they did that day.
That game turned our season around. We had lost a couple of games
we should have won, so beating Tennessee proved to us what we could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner hasn't put up the numbers this season that he had as a
junior, but Arkansas had four new starters on the offensive line,
and Stoerner played through the pain of his shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   He will tie former Arkansas quarterback Quinn Grovey's school
record by making his 35th consecutive start on Saturday. That's
roughly three times as many starts as Stoerner made at quarterback
for Baytown Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe,'' he said. ``I didn't know what to
expect when I first came here, but I've been blessed. I'm so
grateful NO CARRIER

CHECKING CENTURY'S BEST SPORTS 'NET CREATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of us have sneakers older than the World Wide Web. That
brings up one of two points: One, someone needs new sneakers; or
two, the Web is so young that it barely has a history.
</P>
<P>
   And with everyone compiling lists of the century's bests, it
might be a bit out of perspective _ seeing as how the Web was
invented in 1993 _ to list the century's top sports Internet
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But here goes anyway ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Multimedia saves the day: Remember the old days when, if you
wanted to find a broadcast of your favorite college football team,
you had to get in the car, drive to the highest mountain and fine
tune the AM radio only to get a static-laden, ham-radio-type
signal?
</P>
<P>
   Indiana University graduates Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban
encountered the same dilemma in 1995 when they were trying to
follow their beloved Hoosiers' basketball games from Dallas.
Instead of kicking their radios, they parlayed $4,000 in equipment
and Cuban's spare bedroom to start the 'Net's premier streaming
audio and video programming company.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dallas-based Yahoo! Broadcast Services operates out of a
28,000-square-foot converted warehouse equipped with satellite
dishes that pull in television and radio signals from around the
world. Wagner and Cuban's brainchild offers not only Hoosiers'
games, but has grown into a company that features game broadcasts
and other programming for more than 450 college and professional
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   As broadband technology evolves and integrates audio and video
even further, Yahoo! Broadcast Services should make even bigger
strides with e-commerce opportunities tied to its cybercasts.
</P>
<P>
   However, depending on Web traffic and the quality of the
computer, users can expect some static, but at least you don't have
to go find a big hill.
</P>
<P>
   2. Simulation applications: A few years ago, anyone who sat in
an office had to call in sick to hear their favorite football or
baseball team play a day game. Through all the brick and mortar and
hard-nosed bosses, it was tough to get radio broadcasts to come in
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the big-media companies recognized that problem.
Companies such as CBS SportsLine, Go.com, TotalSports, The Sporting
News and MSNBCSports.com created real-time Java-powered
applications that follow sports events, especially daytime events
for those chained to a desk.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime sports fans can launch one of these applications on
their desktop, pretend to busy at their workstations and follow
major league baseball games, professional golf tournaments or
NASCAR races.
</P>
<P>
   GO.com and ABCsports.com took it a step further with their
Enhanced TV feature. Enhanced TV enables computer users to access
interactive content that is synchronized with the game telecast.
Enhanced TV was in use during ABC-TV's Sunday and Monday night NFL
telecasts and it is scheduled to be used for Tuesday's Nokia Sugar
Bowl and Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fantasy watchers go hi-tech: Back in the old days, fantasy
sports leagues and followers had to track the results in the next
day's newspaper or on TV. Now, fantasy sports hobbyists can not
only access real-time statistics, but have the data sent to them on
their personal computer or through mobile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sites can track the scoring systems for fantasy leagues for a
fee or for free. Users of personal digital assistants (handheld
computers such as Palm VIIs) or pagers can have fantasy sports data
sent to them anywhere. That has greatly reduced the number of phone
calls to newspaper sports departments from stats-starved fantasy
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, that might be the 'Net's greatest sports
innovation.

RANGERS SIGN KENNY ROGERS FOR 3 YEARS, $22.5 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Left-handed pitcher Kenny Rogers agreed to a
three-year, $22.5 million contract with the Texas Rangers on
Wednesday, ending a four-year odyssey that took him to New York,
Oakland and back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who turned 35 Nov. 10, will get a base salary of $5.25
million for each of the next three seasons and a signing bonus of
$6.75 million that will not be paid until 2002, which protects
Rogers in case of a work stoppage after the current baseball labor
agreement expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and his agent, Scott Boras, said they were confident that
they could get a longer and perhaps more lucrative contract
elsewhere. But a more important consideration was pitching in a
place where Rogers and his family would be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers pushed Boras to get something done with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew what my priorities were, that my family came
first,'' Rogers said. ``I know they'll be more comfortable in these
surroundings rather than traveling across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' signing came after the Rangers lost third baseman Todd
Zeile, who decided to sign with the New York Mets after Texas
management believed it had worked out a deal with his agent. The
club also has been waiting on Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele to respond
to its contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   Upon signing Rogers, the Rangers said they withdrew a four-year,
$28 million offer to Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the look of our rotation with Kenny at the top,''
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``It gives us better pitching
than we had at this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1995, pitching a
perfect game against the Angels in 1994 and making the American
League All-Star team in 1995. But he turned down a four-year, $17
million offer from the Rangers after the 1995 season to sign for
$19.6 million with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, who returned to the Rangers last year after
five years in Baltimore, was among those who urged Rogers to come
back. Palmeiro also lobbied Melvin and Tom Hicks hard to bring him
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffy told me a year ago we needed to keep an eye out for
Kenny Rogers,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was 5-3 with a 4.30 ERA in 19 starts with the Oakland
Athletics in 1999 before being traded to the Mets on July 23. He
helped the Mets to the National League wild-card playoff spot by
going 5-1 with a 4.03 earned run average in 12 starts. The Mets
were 10-2 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   He joins a pitching rotation that includes left-hander Justin
Thompson and right-handers Rick Helling and Esteban Loaiza. Rookie
left-hander Matt Perisho and veteran right-hander Mark Clark are
the leading candidates for the fifth spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who spent most of his first four seasons with the
Rangers as a reliever, is 93-57 with a 4.24 ERA in 217 major league
starts. He has sometimes been considered one of the top
left-handers in baseball, but his postseason record has been poor.
</P>
<P>
   He is 0-3 with a 9.47 ERA in eight playoff appearances with the
Yankees and Mets, and he reached a low point in October when he
walked in the winning run against the Atlanta Braves in the sixth
and final game of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to this team to be in the playoffs, especially with the
new ownership,'' Rogers said. ``I've never been averse to going out
there, failing, and then coming back again. I just want to get
another shot at it; sooner or later, I'll come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are counting on that. They have won three division
titles in the past four years, but Hicks has made it clear that
winning division titles is not good enough. Hicks and Melvin
decided after the Rangers were swept by the Yankees in the first
round of the playoffs in October that changes were needed to reach
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Rogers is part of a heavier emphasis on pitching, a
change that was demonstrated when Melvin traded outfielder Juan
Gonzalez to the Detroit Tigers for a package that included
Thompson, a highly-touted starter, and relief pitcher Francisco
Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with pitching and we just haven't had the
pitching staff to get us into the World Series,'' said Hicks, who
spent 2 1/2 hours meeting with Rogers privately Wednesday. ``I
think our pitching is much improved.''

HOSPITALS ADJUST TO NEW OVERTIME LAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Takenouchi 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Hospitals across the region are scrambling to
cut the wages of some non-union workers so a new overtime law won't
affect their bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, which goes into effect Saturday, requires that most
workers get overtime pay for every minute they work over eight
hours in one day. For hospitals where 12-hour shifts are
commonplace the change could cost employers millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Several Southland hospitals have responded with plans to cut
base wages on or before Jan. 1, hoping to pay 12-hour-day workers
th overtime requirement is included. Industry officials say the
adjustment, called a factored rate, cannot be done after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Health care officials say the factored rates are needed to make
12-hour shifts economically viable. If nurses and other workers w
popular shifts, they say, factored rates may be the only answer for
some cash-strapped hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   At Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, an independent medical
center in Santa Clarita, officials say base hourly wages will be
reduced by about 14 percent on Jan. 1 for non-union employees who
work 12-hou overtime is added to the last four hours of the shift,
the total daily pay will equal workers' current daily rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give employees the flexibility to remain on a
12-hour day but not break the bank to give them that flexibility,''
said Lisa Foust, a spokeswoman for Newhall Memorial. ``Paying the
overtime w hospital something in the neighborhood of $600,000 extra
(annually), which is something we don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   But some workers across the state are unhappy with the changes
because base pay, not total pay, goes on their resumes if they
apply for other jobs. And despite guarantees to the contrary, some
worry that hospitals may later cut 12-hour shifts but leave lower
base wages intact.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kean, organizing director for the California Nurses
Association, an independent union, said several hospital nurses
have called her in recent weeks to voice their concerns about the
base salary cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about it is we're in the midst of an
incredible nursing shortage right now,'' Kean said. ``For hospitals
pay down, even if it ends up being relatively cost neutral, is a
pretty incredible thing to do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The new overtime rules are part of Assembly Bill 60, a
union-backed bill that reversed overtime regulations that were
implemented during the administration of former Gov. Pete Wilson.
Under the old rules, employers only paid overtime for work
extending beyond 40 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-hour standard itself a reversal of a long-standing
overtime policy in California was in line with most other states in
the country and was strongly supported by business interests across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   AB 60 applies to all businesses, but hospitals are especially
affected because as much as 50 percent of caregivers currently work
10- or 12-hour shifts. At Newhall Memorial, the Santa Clarita
hospital, 230 to 240 non-union employees about one-quarter of the
hospital's patient care staff will be affected by the overtime
change.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations do not apply to unionized workers. Those
workers can bargain for 12-hour shifts at regular pay, as many
unionized hospital workers have done.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has forced hospitals to either eliminate 10- and
12-hour shifts, pay out significant overtime wages or cut base
salaries, said Jim Lott, executive vice president of the Healthcare
Association of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the shifts could drive away nurses who are in very
short supply, Lott said. The second option overtime wages would
cost thousands or even millions of dollars that some hospitals
cannot afford, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the third option, cuts in base salaries, is illegal after
Jan. 1, according to Lott.

NOT LOOKING LINE UNDERDOGS, HUSKIES EARN NATIONAL RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As the last major event of the Seattle sports
century wound down, no objections were heard regarding continuing
this Holiday Bowl matchup into another millennium or two.
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmaker-forecasted blowout did not occur. What transpired
was an entertaining joust between two well-matched college football
teams, pickled with stellar plays, college-kid screwups and no
conclusion apparent until the final 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It could have easily gone on a while longer. OK, the players
might have been a little tired. But, hey, who isn't tired during
the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   A little more time might also have worked in favor of the
Huskies, who didn't resemble 11{-point underDawgs. For the longest
time that role better fit Kansas State, the Big 12 entrant whose
10-1 record and high national ranking wasn't especially obvious
most of last evening at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Wildcats stitched together the difference-maker, a
season-best, 92-yard, 20-play drive that lasted most of the fourth
quarter and provided the winning touchdown in a 24-20 victory than
was more survival than conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not our finest hour,'' said Bill Snyder, the
ever-dour Kansas State coach. ``We're not jumping up and down over
the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither were the Huskies. But considering the circumstances not
only of the game but of the season, going wire-to-wire with an
alleged top-10 team was a worthy deed, if for no other reason than
it was not a repeat of UW's 45-25 Oahu Bowl loss to underdog Air
Force last year, when the Huskies came out with little plan and no
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely can be prideful over the fact that no
one expected us to be within earshot of these guys,'' said wide
receiver Dane Looker, who had four catches for 72 yards. ``We put a
game together that put us in a position to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously a great team, but we showed the Pac-10 and
the University of Washington can compete with anyone in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies can indeed compete. But finishing is another story.
The defeat was Washington's fifth in its past six bowl games.
Wednesday night, the Huskies also had trouble finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes remained after K-State scored the go-ahead
touchdown, and the Huskies had two more possessions. But despite
some legerdemain by quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, it was obvious
that he again had insufficient support. A big catch, a key block, a
breakaway run, and the Huskies would have had a substantial shot at
the upset. Instead, the final two drives were compromised by
multiple drops, sacks and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that will haunt us,'' said Neuheisel. ``But
if you listened to the analysts before the game who said this was
going to be an avalanche, I think they learned the Huskies were a
formidable opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' shortcoming Wednesday was a principal one during
the regular season _ an inability to pressure the passer and force
mistakes. A small part of that was due to a suspension of senior
defensive tackle Mac Tuiaea, who was ordered to sit for the first
half for a team-rule violation that Neuheisel wouldn't specify.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem was K-State's Jonathan Beasley, a 6-1
quarterback of extremely modest passing skills who nevertheless
escaped serious consequences for his limitations. A 44 percent
seasonal passer, Beasley managed to complete 15 of 31 Wednesday
night, then rushed for 48 yards and all three Wildcats touchdowns
and was named the game's most valuable offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   After he fired a few back-footed wobblers and showed average
running speed, it was remarkable that the Huskies couldn't corral
the guy, particularly after K-State's breakaway threat, senior
running back Frank Murphy, sat out the second half with a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't impressed by anybody out there,'' said UW linebacker
Lester Towns, always a hard man to please. ``They're a good team,
but I think we have as good of athletes as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   That point is debatable, particularly on defense, where the
Wildcats' speed was superior and decisive. The Huskies' 75 net
rushing yards was a telltale stat that demonstrated K-State's
effectiveness in bottling up the Tuiasosopo-led option.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're one of the best defenses I've ever seen,'' Tuiasosopo
said. ``They have a lot of speed, a lot of skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were qualities the UW defenders lacked this season. Yet
Neuheisel and his staff papered over the defensive deficiencies and
ordinariness of much of the offense to cobble together a 7-5
season.
</P>
<P>
   The results will not light up the New Year, but in a Pac-10
season that was otherwise a reversion nearly to Y1K, disaster
avoidance was a creditable accomplishment.

LAKERS CONTINUE WINNING WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For their pre-Y2K party, the Los Angeles Lakers
adopted the spirit and lingo of the new-millennium hoopla. Their
philosophy: Y Not 10?
</P>
<P>
   As in 10 consecutive wins to close out the 10th year of the 10th
decade of the 10th century of the old millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, the Lakers had to navigate a few bugs in the
system, but they overcame their own rash of human errors and pulled
away for a 103-87 victory over the injury-depleted Phoenix Suns at
Staples Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers closed out the year having won 17 of their past 18
games, with a winning streak that matched their best effort of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they were not exactly in a party-like-it's-1999 mood
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we finished the year off the way we wanted to,'' said
coach Phil Jackson, before quickly adding, ``I wasn't totally
pleased with this ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   He had good reason. Twenty turnovers, many of them careless, let
the Suns stay close throughout, as the Lakers squandered a series
of double-digit leads.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was playing without three starters _ Tom Gugliotta,
Penny Hardaway and Shawn Marion _ yet it took a 3-point play from
Shaquille O'Neal and a late scoring burst from Glen Rice to put
Phoenix away in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's impressive line included 27 points, 19 rebounds, seven
assists and five blocked shots. Kobe Bryant added 18 points, six
rebounds and six assists as the Lakers enjoyed one of their better
passing nights.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, they also enjoyed one of their worst, and the Suns cashed
in the miscues for 18 points, leaving the Lakers anything but
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a little frustrated,'' Derek Fisher said,
``especially during the game, during certain stretches of play
where we've either allowed the lead to be taken down from double
figures to single digits or just making life really hard (on
ourselves). That's something we've always been really good at, but
we really don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been nights where we come in (the locker room), and
it seems as if we lost, but that's just because I think everybody
understands that this season is not a sprint or a quick race. It's
a long season. We have a lot of games to go and everybody's on our
side and fans are screaming right now, but it may change later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns got 24 points from Clifford Robinson and 18 from Rex
Chapman and scratched to within six points of the lead with four
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neal finished them off by himself. He completed a 3-point
play with 3:46 left to make it 93-84, then suffocated the Suns at
the other end by swatting away two Robinson jumpers in five
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal went to the bench with 2:55 to go, and Rice, who scored
just two points in the first half, took over from there. He scored
seven points in less than a minute, capped by a back-breaking
3-pointer to make it 100-86 with 1:08 left. Rice finished with 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, who rediscovered his shooting touch earlier this
week against Dallas, kept up the pace with 15 points, eight
rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, steadily, the Lakers seem to be heading in the right
direction, minus the occasional in-game missteps.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal already had 16 points and 12 rebounds by halftime, but
the Lakers committed 10 turnovers and had to settle for a modest
57-52 lead. And the margin was only that big because Rick Fox hit a
3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 wins and an NBA-best 25-5 record is as good a way to ring
in a new year as any.

BEASLEY DRIVES K-STATE PAST HUSKIES IN HOLIDAY BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kansas State quarterback Jonathan Beasley isn't
pretty. His myriad critics have loudly and frequently reminded him
of that this season as he struggled to replace playmaker Michael
Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop lost his final two games last year and left the
Kansas State faithful sucking on a lemon through a long off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley isn't graceful when he tosses a football, but he scored
three rushing touchdowns in K-State's 24-20 Holiday Bowl victory
over Washington Wednesday night and finally put a happy face on a
program that has been pretty grumpy lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Beasley) was the difference in the game,'' Washington
coach Rick Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley's best moments came on K-State's 20-play, 92-yard,
go-ahead drive that chipped nearly 10 minutes off the clock. The
Wildcats converted four third-down situations, including a 22-yard
completion from Beasley to Quincy Morgan on a third and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, named offensive player of the game, ran in from 1 yard
for the touchdown on an option keeper. He rushed for a team-high 48
yards and, though he completed just 15 of 31 passes for 216 yards,
every completion seemed critical.
</P>
<P>
   The game-winning march was the Wildcats' longest drive this
season in terms of yardage, number of plays and time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' Huskies defensive end Jabari Issa said.
``He made all the plays when they needed them the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which led at the half, 13-10,had jumped ahead,
20-17, in the third quarter with its own impressive drive. Maurice
Shaw's 5-yard run up the middle capped a 12-play, 73-yard march
that took nearly six minutes. That's impressive, considering the
Wildcats had not allowed a single point in the third quarter this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (7-5), an 11{-point underdog, gave the seventh-ranked
Wildcats (11-1) all they could handle, managing to move the ball
effectively against K-State's vaunted defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us some motivation for the off-season,'' Huskies
quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo said. ``We came in unranked and we
played four quarters with a team that's ranked seventh in the
country with the best defense in the nation. When it comes to next
season, we can be up there with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies piled up 272 total yards (4.9 yards per play),
including 197 yards passing. K-State had been allowing just 13.1
points, 235 total yards and 124 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did lose the time of possession battle by 6 minutes
and 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo completed 18 for 27 passes and rushed for 30 yards, a
deceiving total because the Wildcats sacked him four times.

   His lone interception was critical, however. It came at the end
of the third quarter when the Huskies were on K-State's 32 after a
brilliant punt return reverse from Joe Jarzynka to Todd Elstrom
gained 29 yards. Washington had a perfect opportunity to add to
their three-point lead.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What's going to be big in 2000?
 &HT;    (For release Jan. 2, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so the hyperbole of Y2K and the millennium is beyond us _
for a while. As I write this, it is not yet 2000; therefore I am
unaware if we survived. I suspect we did.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have to find something else to get all hyped up about.
</P>
<P>
   This will come quickly for sports fans. The Super Bowl, that
almost-private, corporate-patronized happening, where ticket costs
rise almost as much as a share of Qualcomm, is just four weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   Straightaway, newspapers, radio and TV operatives will switch
from hounding Y2K specialists, stockbrokers, astronomers and the
so-called man on the street to asking people if they're enjoying
being in Atlanta for the Super Bowl, then overflowing media rooms
to catch every word said by every player about everything but the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The American public and media has to have a dominant story at
all times. If it is not Bill Clinton, it is Monica Lewinsky; if it
is not O.J. Simpson, it is the Columbine killings. If it is not
skyjackings and other terrorism, it is the advent of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium and century sendup likely reached remarkable
heights in that billions of dollars were spent on naming the 100
best of this, 100 best of that and, sometimes, the 1,000 best of
something else _ most of which created controversy, a sign that the
gimmick worked.
</P>
<P>
   Books were published, television specials were created, fears
that computers would fail infected the entire world and the airline
industry took a pounding when wary people decided not to fly Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   It was (and is) a good story.
</P>
<P>
   But what next _ after the Super Bowl? Judging by the 1990s
identification of El Nino and the subsequent outlandish weather
that caused (over the last 18 months of this century, more than
50,000 deaths) there is more to come.
</P>
<P>
   When El Nino departed, La Nina took over; a wicked couple, those
two.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the emphasis on storms, earthquakes, mudslides,
fires and avalanches will carry well into this year and beyond. And
why not? Weather is a threat to us all.
</P>
<P>
   But still there needs to be something to write about, to
televise after the Super Bowl festivities close on Jan. 30. The
event to facilitate that likely hasn't happened yet, whatever it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be a controversial new book, authorized or not,
that exposes a prominent person to scrutiny or ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we've got a presidential election this year and, it will
turn out, men like George W., McCain, Bradley and Gore will make it
interesting, particularly with the slip of a tongue, a rumor of
illegal substance use or falling victim to the fangs of those who
base their votes on single issues rather than the broader campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, the search for new hyperbole also will revert to the
resuscitation of century/millennium argument over which it really
is: 1999 turning into 2000 or 2000 turning into 2001? It's still a
burning argument but frequented only by those who prefer to deal in
facts _ a fading element of our civilization, now more interested
in show business than world business.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-worlders will have another full year to make fatal
predictions. Having missed so many other dates, including
yesterday's, I would imagine that they would look beyond the
immediate future and select a date well past our anticipated life
expectancies so as not to face the almost-certain ridicule of yet
another failed foreboding.

 &HT;    Lessons my dad taught me still ring true
 &HT;    (Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.)
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Things I learned from my dad:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to sharpen a pencil with a utility knife so that the lead
is long and pointed, but thicker than what you'll get from a
standard sharpener. My dad made his living as a sign painter, and
his love was drawing pictures, so he used pencils all the time. I
doubt he ever used a pencil sharpener in his life, preferring
instead to whittle until the point was as he liked it.
</P>
<P>
   He's long retired now, disabled, and many of his signs are long
gone. But the best example of his work still exists in Longview, at
a little city park called Safety City. I drove by there the other
day. It's a miniature town, with a newspaper office, a railroad, a
few stores and such, and it's used to teach children about basic
safety. My dad donated the work to hand paint all the signs, which
10 years or so later still gleamed in the winter sun.
</P>
<P>
   My dad was quite simply the best sign painter around in his
prime. He was contemptuous of computers, which were just starting
to take over his business when he had to quit working. He still
maintains that no computer could duplicate the single-stroke
technique of a master sign painter. Now, artisans are making a
comeback as customers tire of the sameness of computer-generated
signs with their standard typefaces. Too bad my dad isn't able to
cash in on this wave of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parallel parking. He taught me at a young age how to back in,
make one forward move and at most one more in reverse and have the
vehicle 12 inches from the curb, perfectly parallel. This is one of
my few driving skills, and one I'm inordinately proud of. I will
look for an excuse to parallel park just to prove I haven't lost my
touch. I haven't, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making lists. I come from a long line of short males unable to
remember what they were sent to the store to buy. I live by lists.
My printer buddy Sam Malone keeps me supplied in ``Things to Do''
note pads, which I use religiously.
</P>
<P>
   I seriously considered buying one of those fancy little
computers you keep in the pocket to keep track of appointments,
take notes, make lists of things to do, etc. A lot of my friends
have them, and I noticed at meetings and other gatherings that they
spent most of their time fiddling with the machine. I fiddle with
machines, especially computers, far too often as it is, so I opted
for a Y2K-ready pocket calendar that cost me eight bucks. All it
needs is a pencil, which I'll of course sharpen with a razor blade,
and I'm in business. My anthem is Randy Travis' song, ``I'm Going
To Find Me A Better Class of Losers.'' My favorite line goes that
he's looking for ``friends who don't pay their bills on home
computers and buy their coffee beans already ground.'' I'm there,
Randy. And I don't have a pager, either.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My dad taught me how to shoot a rifle, and how to handle one
safely. He taught me out at the county dump with a single-shot .22
Remington that he still owns. He could knock the head off a match
with it at 50 yards. I never got that good, but I learned how to
fire a weapon, and how to treat it with respect, and I've spent
many enjoyable hours shooting skeet or plinking at beer cans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I inherited my lack of enthusiasm for hunting from him. He
used to hunt a lot and lost his taste for it fairly young. I never
really acquired that taste, though I tried halfheartedly. Neither
of us has anything against hunting or hunters. It just never became
a pastime in which we had much interest.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a weird deer story. I went outside to take a break from
writing this piece and to steal a peek at the brightest full moon
in my lifetime. I glanced over at the lighted Christmas cutouts of
Santa Claus and the elves, and three deer were grazing on my lawn,
next to the cutouts. My first thought was, I don't remember having
any cutout reindeer in this display. Then they saw me and took off.
Without hunters, deer would be nearly as plentiful as squirrel in
these parts, so I'm glad someone enjoys that hobby. Just stay out
of my yard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My dad taught me to enjoy sports, how to catch a baseball,
throw a spiral pass and make a two-handed set shot. He also taught
me that sports don't matter much in the big picture of things. I
haven't lost a moment's sleep in my life agonizing over who won or
lost a game in which I wasn't a direct participant. Play hard, root
hard, and then get back to the important stuff of life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finally, he taught me to be adaptable, to learn to roll with
the punches, and to keep a sense of humor. And to remember that in
the end what matters is who you loved, and who loved you.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad lesson, I figure.

 &HT;    Yet more amazing factoids
 &HT;    (Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.)
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Last week's column on ``little-known facts''
generated enough calls and letters to prompt me to offer more of
these nuggets of information sent to me via the magic of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   So, here for your consideration are more facts than you can
shake a stick at:
</P>
<P>
   _ Because metal was scarce, the Oscars given out during World
War II were made of wood.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of possible ways of playing the first four moves
per side in a game of chess is 318,979,564,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine are brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chocolate kills dogs. Chocolate affects a dogs' heart and
nervous system; a few ounces is enough to kill a small dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daniel Boone detested coonskin caps.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money isn't made out of paper, it's made out of cotton. Before
the 1950s it was made from hemp _ the stem and leaves of a
marijuana plant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most lipstick contains fish scales.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orcas (killer whales) kill sharks by torpedoing up into the
shark's stomach from underneath, causing the shark to explode.
</P>
<P>
   _ Donald Duck comics were banned from Finland because he doesn't
wear pants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ketchup was sold in the 1830s as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Upper and lower case letters are named 'upper' and 'lower,'
because in the time when all original print had to be set in
individual letters, the 'upper case' letters were stored in the
case on top of the case that stored the smaller, 'lower case'
letters.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are no clocks in Las Vegas gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are no words in the dictionary that rhyme with: orange,
purple, and silver.
</P>
<P>
   _ The numbers ``172'' can be found on the back of the U.S. $5
dollar bill in the bushes at the base of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   _ The name Wendy was made up for the book Peter Pan, there was
never a recorded Wendy before.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leonardo Da Vinci invented scissors; also, it took him 10
years to paint Mona Lisa's lips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bruce Lee was so fast that they actually had to slow a film
down so you could see his moves. That's the opposite of the norm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bubble gum contains rubber.
</P>
<P>
   _ Human birth control pills work on gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first CD pressed in the U.S. was Bruce Springsteen's
``Born in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By raising your legs slowly and laying on your back, you can't
sink in quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Casey Kasem is the voice of Shaggy on Scooby-Doo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cat urine glows under a black light.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celery has negative calories. It takes more calories to eat a
piece of celery than the celery has in it to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chewing gum while peeling onions will keep you from crying.
</P>
<P>
   _ An elephant can smell water three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guinness Book of Records holds the record for being the book
most often stolen from Public Libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Astronauts are not allowed to eat beans before they go into
space because passing wind in a spacesuit damages them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Babe Ruth wore a cabbage leaf under his cap to keep him cool!
He changed it every 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bats always turn left when exiting a cave.

</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's `sinful' past
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vieira's Sin in Soft Focus:Pre-Code Hollywood (Abrams) is a
scrumptious book that is too heavy on content to be considered a
coffee-table book, although that's undoubtedly the niche it will
fill.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Hollywood's down-and-dirty era, before the
installation of the Production Code in June of 1934, when nearly
every star appeared in slinky lingerie, and all manner of things
were shown that wouldn't appear on movie screens again until the
early '60s _ overt lesbianism, extramarital sex, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira previously wrote a very good book about Hollywood glamour
photographer George Hurrell. His new book is full of luscious, rare
images of such stars as Clara Bow, Claudette Colbert and Constance
Bennett in various stages of undress. Vieira obviously has done a
lot of research in the files of the Production Code at the Academy;
there's some amusing back-and-forth negotiating on various
censorship issues regarding some very famous films. Recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In the same category but a different niche is Stanley Kubrick,
Director, the presumably last edition of Alexander Walker's book
that's considerably enriched by Walker's friendship with Kubrick
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was the movie critic for the London Evening Standard for
years, and it shows.as ``The Theory of Killing,'' followed by ``The
Practice of Killing.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, however, is weakest on Eyes Wide Shut, as if his
deadline didn't give him enough time to pull his thoughts together
on one of the deepest of Kubrick's movies. Walker also adds a
lovely memoir of Kubrick as he knew him that concludes with the
director's funeral, his coffin carried by his grandchildren before
he was interred on the grounds of his country house.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other editions of Walker's book, the stills, both in
color and black-and-white, are extraordinary. Highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Soon to a Bookstore Near You
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flatley, the reputed egomaniac who created Riverdance
and Lord of the Dance, is writing his autobiography for Warner
Books. In what is obviously an homage to Joseph Conrad, Flatley's
book is called Victory.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you haven't gotten enough of Anne Perry yet, you'll
still have a chance; she's signed to do five more books for
Ballantine.
</P>
<P>
   Quote Unquote
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime of book purging is that it involves a rejection of
the word. For the word is never absolute truth, but only man's
frail and human effort to approach the truth. To reject the word is
to reject the human search.''

   Proof that dysfunctional families can be funny
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Eyman
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Books Editor
</P>
<P>
   You know a family is not on terribly intimate terms when a son
addresses his father by his first name, and the father addresses
his family as ``you people.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker (a dreadful title that doesn't do the
book justice) does not have a particularly original premise _ it's
another family comedy/drama with a precociously screwed-up teenage
narrator.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirn, in spite of the fact that he's a book critic _ for New
York _ is a real writer, with a light, airy touch that conceals a
gift for communicating intimations of authentic pain and
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a firm center of need or accomplishment, the Cobb family
is likely material for a cult. They spend the book drifting in and
out of uproariously transient enthusiasms that never quite disguise
their careening desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, the father, is a frustrated jock and bowhunter who runs a
sporting-goods store. He's never quite been able to climb off the
cross he mounted when he blew out his knee and disappointed his
beloved father-figure coach at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   It is the early '80s, the family is stuck in Minnesota, and Mike
believes that the country has been sliding downhill since Nixon was
hounded out of office by the eastern elite.''We have to stop
eating,'' he screams after examining the grocery bills. ``We're
going under.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey _ also addressed by her first name _ is the mother, a
nurse. She finds herself for a few months working at an expensive
drug clinic that caters to show-biz junkies and is thrilled by her
proximity to TV stars.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is named Justin. He is very smart and, like
everybody else, wound too tightly for his own good. Even Justin's
grandparents, who make a couple of guest appearances, are loopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just learned something,'' Grandma tells her grandson apropos
of nothing. ``If you're being assaulted in a lonely place and
there's no one around to hear you scream, scream anyway. It breaks
the attacker's momentum. Assault is a crime of momentum. And it's
not just the blacks you have to be afraid of. It's the Europeans
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma watches The Price is Right and guesses a gas barbecue
costs a thousand dollars. Obviously, Grandpa does all the shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Kirn's subject, as with so much modern fiction, is drift _ the
search for true north in a cloud-covered moral sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobbs go on mountain hikes, but Mike gets lost and almost
perishes; they join the Mormon church, mostly because the Jehovah's
Witnesses didn't get to them first, and throw away every bottle of
booze in the house, every cigarette, every copy of Field &AMP; Stream,
every poker chip and playing card.
</P>
<P>
   The washer and dryer are next, but Mike relents. He forces
Justin to go away for a fishing weekend, a time of father/son
bonding, but the mood is ominous from the beginning and only gets
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Published, for no apparent reason, as a trade paperback, Kirn's
novel comes perilously close to being a rueful masterpiece.
Thumbsucker avoids the trap of most of its genre brethren by
refusing to make Justin a repository of wisdom. Although he's a
little smarter than his mother, and a lot smarter than his father,
he's every bit as screwed up as they are, only in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Mormons send Justin on a mission to New York,
but on the plane he strikes up a conversation with a cute girl and
begins to contemplate options that have nothing to do with Joseph
Smith. Celibacy _ not something he has rigorously observed _ and
the Mormon church clearly aren't going to last long with Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Just like a fictional counterpart of many years ago, he's
lighting out for the territory.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ Last week's column on ``little-known
facts'' generated enough calls and letters to prompt me to offer
more of these nuggets of information sent to me via the magic of

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ In marked and disturbing contrast to our
forebears at the turn of the last century, we are entering the 21st
century and third millennium vaguely ill at ease, if not downright
anxious. How, given the experience of this century, could we
possibly delight at the prospect of the next? Not easily, to be
sure, but cautiously after all. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED WEDNESDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ OK, so the hyperbole of Y2K and the
millennium is beyond us _ for a while. As I write this, it is not
yet 2000; therefore I am unaware if we survived. I suspect we did.
Now we have to find something else to get all hyped up about.
(Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED FOR

</P>
<P>
   A STAR CALLED HENRY, by Roddy Doyle. Viking; 343 pages; $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is Ireland, old Ireland, new Ireland. Father figure to his
brother, 5. Almost a son to the leaders of the rebellion. A lover
of good whiskey and the ladies. All this by age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy Doyle (left), author of The Commitments, is one of
Ireland's top writers.
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Reid
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   What A Star Called Henry does is hit your gut fast and hard like
two shots of Jameson's for breakfast. Fast and hard like the big
barman after you tell him you've got no money for the Jameson's.
And it keeps on hitting, pummeling, keeps coming at you.
</P>
<P>
   It's the literary version of the urban guerrilla warfare created
by Michael Collins and his flying squads of IRA gunmen during the
Irish Revolution of 1917-21: Gun and run, then gun again. You don't
know where Doyle's taking you, but you know where you've been.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy Doyle wrote The Commitments and Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,
stories of struggle, of the little guy vs. institutions: state,
church, and the often oppressive and relentless power of culture
and history. Think of Cormac McCarthy, Mark Twain and the best of
Norman Mailer and John Updike, and you get a partial profile:
Details, setting, character, metaphor and allegory, stories with
attitude. And heart. Genius.
</P>
<P>
   The McCourt brothers he 'tisn't, thank the good Lord. No
pasteurized, Americanized feel-goodism with Doyle. When his Ireland
bleeds, you bleed.
</P>
<P>
   A Star Called Henry is a story of Ireland and the Irish,
refracted through the lenses of the 1916 Easter Uprising and the
subsequent rebellion, as witnessed by Henry Smart, a youthful
character of gigantic literary dimensions. Huck Finn meets Billy
the Kid. In lesser hands, Henry would collapse of his own
weightiness. He is transcendent, sometimes purely symbolic, often
outrageously unbelievable. But Henry works.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is Henry the urchin, and Henry is Ireland, old Ireland,
new Ireland. Henry is Superman and Bertrand Russell, killer and
saint. He is father figure to his 5-year-old brother. He is almost
a son to the leaders of the rebellion. He's a lover of Guinness and
good whiskey and the ladies _ and do the ladies ever love Henry.
All this by age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's father is a peg-legged romantic who works two jobs: as
bouncer for a brothel and as hired killer for a mysterious
employer. His favored manner of dispatching victims is to pop off
his wooden leg and beat them to death. The tap-tap-tap of his
father's approach is music to the ears of little Henry. For others,
the tap-tap is the last thing they hear. Henry Sr., too, is Ireland
at the turn of the century: crippled, moral compass spinning,
limping toward disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The family is poor; the mother, Melody, is sliding toward
insanity, mostly due to the death of her babies. They're born, they
die. Henry, in fact, is named for his older brother as well as his
father: the older brother who died. The Smarts move from hovel to
hovel, down from the second floor to the first, finally to a
water-soaked basement, where the rats are big, and TB is in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Henry reflects on his father's practical take on the death of
his children: ``He wasn't being callous, he wasn't being cruel. The
last sounds of his dead children were in his ears; he could measure
their weight in his arms. But they were dead. Gone from him and
Melody. He didn't believe in heaven or after-life reunions. His
children were gone. Naming me Henry would take the pain and weight
away; it would let them start again.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can never start again. It's not the way of nature. Or
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   So the family descends, hell-bound, into the sewers. The father
extinguishes his pain by killing. The mother cannot even say
Henry's name, the pain of losing the first Henry is so great. Her
dead children become stars, she tells Henry. Henry looks skyward
and sees only lost hopes, lost dreams, lost brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He grows _ handsome, clever, brave. He's a survivor, a fine
specimen among the human detritus of Dublin. He takes to the
streets at 7, takes to the barricades in the Post Office at 14.
When the shooting starts during the Easter Uprising, Henry hefts
his old rifle and shoots at store windows that contain all the
shoes and candy, baked breads and fresh meat he and his brothers
never had.
</P>
<P>
   Then begin the lessons in politics, the hypocrisy of bookish
revolutionaries who send boys out to die, the deadly double-dealing
of pseudo-patriots who are in the fight for future payoff. Doyle's
examination of his characters' motives, of religion, politics, of
turn-of-the-century Ireland, never descends into polemics, never
strains the credibility of his fiction. Like Henry, we learn
without being aware we are learning. We are simply swept along and
away by the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Henry mounts a .45-caliber submachine gun on his bicycle and
pedals through the battlefield that is Ireland. He murders and
maims, just like dad. He ponders, too. The veils lift. He sees _
sees that he's been used and abused by Irishmen as much as Ireland
had been used by the British. He vows to find a better way, a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   But he has one more score to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Word is, A Star Called Henry is to be the first of a trilogy.
May the sequels arrive with the speed and power of Henry Smart's
wit and fists.

 &HT;    Starring Hollywood's `sinful' past
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mark Vieira's Sin in Soft Focus:Pre-Code
Hollywood (Abrams) is a scrumptious book that is too heavy on
content to be considered a coffee-table book, although that's
undoubtedly the niche it will fill.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Hollywood's down-and-dirty era, before the
installation of the Production Code in June of 1934, when nearly
every star appeared in slinky lingerie, and all manner of things
were shown that wouldn't appear on movie screens again until the
early '60s _ overt lesbianism, extramarital sex, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira previously wrote a very good book about Hollywood glamour
photographer George Hurrell. His new book is full of luscious, rare
images of such stars as Clara Bow, Claudette Colbert and Constance
Bennett in various stages of undress. Vieira obviously has done a
lot of research in the files of the Production Code at the Academy;
there's some amusing back-and-forth negotiating on various
censorship issues regarding some very famous films. Recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In the same category but a different niche is Stanley Kubrick,
Director, the presumably last edition of Alexander Walker's book
that's considerably enriched by Walker's friendship with Kubrick
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was the movie critic for the London Evening Standard for
years, and it shows.as ``The Theory of Killing,'' followed by ``The
Practice of Killing.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, however, is weakest on Eyes Wide Shut, as if his
deadline didn't give him enough time to pull his thoughts together
on one of the deepest of Kubrick's movies. Walker also adds a
lovely memoir of Kubrick as he knew him that concludes with the
director's funeral, his coffin carried by his grandchildren before
he was interred on the grounds of his country house.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other editions of Walker's book, the stills, both in
color and black-and-white, are extraordinary. Highly recommended.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ Last week's column on ``little-known
facts'' generated enough calls and letters to prompt me to offer
more of these nuggets of information sent to me via the magic of
e-mail. So, here for your consideration are more facts than you can
shake a stick at. (Ernest Murray is managing editor of The Lufkin

</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ In marked and disturbing contrast to our
forebears at the turn of the last century, we are entering the 21st
century and third millennium vaguely ill at ease, if not downright
anxious. How, given the experience of this century, could we
possibly delight at the prospect of the next? Not easily, to be
sure, but cautiously after all. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED WEDNESDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ OK, so the hyperbole of Y2K and the
millennium is beyond us _ for a while. As I write this, it is not
yet 2000; therefore I am unaware if we survived. I suspect we did.
Now we have to find something else to get all hyped up about.
(Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED FOR
SUNDAY

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ All the talk about how the new

bureau.) MOVED FOR SUNDAY

THIS AFRICAN-AMERICAN COWBOY ISN'T JUST HORSING AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   African-Americans have almost run out of things that they can be
the first representative of their cultural and genetic category to
do. And it has become unfashionable to make much ado about such
achievements because they have become so commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fred Whitfield's singular accomplishment this
month cries out for highlighting, both because of who or what he is
and because of the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's millennial achievement was to win what amounts to
the heavyweight championship of cowboying in the 1900s' last
edition of professional rodeo's biggest annual showdown.
</P>
<P>
   By earning the title of ``Best All Around Cowboy'' at the
National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Whitfield added a fitting
exclamation mark to the rising call of African-Americans for
recognition of their contribution to the heritage of the American
West.
</P>
<P>
   That victory automatically qualifies Whitfield for induction
into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, making him only the fourth
African-American to be included in that list. He, of course, is the
first to do it by winning the national all-around.
</P>
<P>
   The other three black cowboys who have been accorded that
recognition are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Pickett, the inventor of the rodeo sport that was
originally called bulldogging and now is known as steer wrestling.
Pickett, called by some old-timers ``the best sweat-and-dirt cowboy
who ever lived,'' was the star attraction of the 101 Wild West Show
that toured the country, Mexico and Europe during the early part of
this sunsetting century.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett died in 1932. But he was not inducted into the Hall of
Fame in Oklahoma City until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jesse Stahl of California, whom many regarded as the best
saddle bronc rider of his day. Few black cowboys were allowed to
compete against white cowboys in the early rodeo. When Stahl was
permitted to ride, he was never allowed to win more than
second-place money, even if he deserved the winner's share. To show
his contempt for one of those decisions, Stahl mounted another
bucking bronc and rode it backward, carrying a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl died in 1938 and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   _ Myrtis Dightman, who has been called ``the Jackie Robinson of
rodeo.'' In 1966, Dightman, a bull-rider, became the first black
cowboy to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo. For five of the
next six years, Dightman's pro-rodeo winnings qualified him for the
big show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dightman never won a national title, he provided an
inspirational model to the increasing numbers of black cowboys
competing in professional rodeo. He was the mentor of bull-rider
Charles Sampson, who in 1982 became the first black cowboy to win a
world championship in one of the five major rodeo sports.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, a Houston native who now lives in Hockley, took up
calf-roping at age 7 and began entering competitions in his teens.
He burst onto the national rodeo scene in 1990, winning ``Rookie of
the Year'' honors. He won world champion honors for calf-roping in
1991, 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the national all-around cowboy championship,
Whitfield also grabbed all-around championships at the San Angelo
Stock Show and Rodeo and the Walker County Fair and Rodeo in
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Whitfield also won the calf-roping event at the
Southwestern Exhibition and Live Stock Show and Rodeo in Fort
Worth; the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo; La Fiesta De Los
Vaqueros in Tucson, Ariz.; Spring Pro Rodeo '99 in Medicine Hat,
Alberta, Canada; and the Rodeo Royal in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Whitfield has stated emphatically that he
intends to do his utmost to defend his all-around title in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although winning the national all-around was a crowning
achievement for him, Whitfield said, ``I'm nowhere near done
rodeoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitfield's triumphs in the rodeo arena are stellar
accomplishments for an individual, they are more than that. They
call attention again to one of the glaring shortcomings of American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Until the past two decades, black cowboys were for all practical
purposes nonexistent in standard presentations of the saga of the
American West. That was particularly true of western movies when
that genre was at its acme of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that about a quarter of the cowboys who made the
trail drives to the cattle markets were African-Americans. They and
those who stayed home on the range keeping the ranches going
practiced the skills that have been stylized into the competitive
events of professional rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Whitfield has built upon their legacy and done them proud.

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IN JFK'S CAR NOW DEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Are the two Secret Service agents who were in the car with
President Kennedy on that tragic day in Dallas still alive?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.D., North Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Agents William Greer and Roy Kellerman both died in the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who was driving the president's car when he was
assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, died of cancer in February 1985 at a
Waynesville, N.C., hospital.
</P>

   Greer was 75 when he died. He retired on disability from the
Secret Service in 1966, due in part to a stomach ulcer that
worsened after the assassination.

   Q: What happened to Ken Bode, who formerly headed ``Washington
Week in Review'' on PBS?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.J.M., Eclectic, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bode, dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism, left the show in February after disagreeing with
producers about changes they wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry over his departure convinced the producers at WETA
in Washington not to change the program, Bode told the Daily
Northwestern in March. ``Sometimes you can't save the job, but you
can save the program,'' he said.

<P>
   In October, former NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill, 44, took over
as moderator of ``Washington Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the movie ``She's Having a Baby,'' what song is playing
while Kevin Bacon is in the waiting room and his wife is in labor?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.N.R., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The song is ``This Woman's Work'' by Kate Bush, and you can
find it on her 1989 album, ``Sensual World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Woman's Work'' also was featured on the TV series
``Felicity'' and on a soundtrack CD for the show. Another fan of
the song is Maxwell, who rerecorded it for ``Unplugged'' in 1997
after hearing it on ``She's Having a Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Woman's Work: 1978-1990,'' an eight-CD boxed set by Bush,
is a collection of 96 of her songs.

&HT;     HOME COMPUTER USERS FACE FEW Y2K ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Graphic designer Claire Edwards is doing
basically nothing to prepare for the much-hyped Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried,'' said Edwards, who believes her
computerized art files will not suffer from the transition of 1999
to 2000. ``But then again, I'm not stockpiling water or PowerBars
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology experts agree that the 33-year-old San Francisco
woman's strategy is probably not the optimal way of dealing with
any potential Y2K computer problems, but she is very close.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts say there is the potential that computers and
software originally programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the
machines will assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Although businesses have spent millions to safeguard their
larger systems, the anticipated effect of the bug on home computers
is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting a widespread plague of problems for
personal computers for individuals,'' said Jim Balderston, an
analyst with McAfee.com, a Santa Clara publisher of computer
maintenance software. ``I'm not worried about the status of my
personal PC, and most of them should operate just fine after the
new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers purchased in the last five years should generally be
free of Y2K problems. Most hardware and software now used in the
home were not written in the older codes that could misinterpret a
1999-2000 rollover.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, here are some steps to take to squash any potential
Y2K critters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Back up all important files, including checkbook and tax
records, on discs or other data storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine if computer hardware is vulnerable. Y2K problems
will usually reside in something called the BIOS (short for ``basic
input/output system'') chip. The chip holds some basic settings for
the machine, including the computer's date and time. Computers that
are 5 years old or older are especially vulnerable to BIOS
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have posted free software that will test
system BIOS, such as Symantec
(www.symantec.com/sabu/n2000/n2000_ret/) and the computer utility
software publisher McAfee.com (www.mcafee.com).
</P>
<P>
   _ Check operating systems. The operating system is the base
software that lets the computer, its memory, keyboard and monitor
all work together. It also runs other programs. Microsoft Windows
OS will require some tweaking to be totally Y2K bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.microsoft.com and click on the Y2K logo. Microsoft,
true to form, puts a dizzying array of explanations, cautions and
other stuff that just gets in the way. Windows 95 users can
shortcut to the Windows 95 Update page
(www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads) to find fixes. Windows 98
users can go to the Windows Update (windowsupdate.microsoft.com/)
site.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative operating systems, including BeOS, Linux and Apple,
say they have no Y2K issues. For an explanation of Apple Y2K
issues, go to www.apple.com and click on the Apple and Year 2000
link.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check software programs. Those that use dates in making
calculations could experience errors in those calculations, such as
spreadsheets and checkbook programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most software makers have posted fixes on their Web sites. Keep
in mind, however, that if the software doesn't use dates to make
calculations, then a fix probably will not exist and probably isn't
needed.
</P>
<P>
   EDS publishes an extensive guide to software publishers' Web
sites (www.vendor2000.com). Search by company, not by software
title. For instance, the popular Quicken checkbook program is made
by Intuit Inc.

<P>
   By now you must be thinking about getting decked out for New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, you're just itching to pull out that tux or gown from the
closet, break out the top-shelf jewelry and head out to that
elegant evening that will ring out the decade, century and, if you
insist, the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What? No? What do you mean no?
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, me neither. And we are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Television executives from New York to Hollywood are giggling,
as the night heralded for years as the Party to End All Parties
looks more and more like the Night to Scan All Channels.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have consistently shown that seven out of 10 people
will be at home _ theirs or someone else's _ for the final
countdown of the 1900s. Big-budget events have largely been a bust.
People have chosen the Barcalounger over the luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, cruise to the equator. Hello, Dick Clark. And Peter
Jennings, Tom Brokaw, David Letterman ...
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will be home, some with friends, watching to see if
Jennings can complete his quest to anchor a 24-hour ABC broadcast
solo (with help from correspondents ranging from Barbara Walters in
Paris to Diane Sawyer in New Zealand).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the networks _ even Pax! _ will be doing millennial
coverage, with an emphasis on what is happening throughout the
world. CNN is looking to trump everyone with 100 hours of global
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But the most inspired scheduling comes out of WSBK Channel 38 in
Boston, a UPN affiliate: a ``Three Stooges'' marathon. There is
something deeply artistic about this programming choice. (No, I
don't know what it is. But I like it.)
</P>
<P>
   We will watch TV tonight, even in houses where there are
parties, even in houses where parents wittters are helpless
to prevent toddlers from pilfering cookies behind our backs, going
into sugar-induced mass hysteria and embarking on a rampage that
will make the Huns look like Girl Scouts. ... Wait, wait. Sorry.
That will just be my house. Let's start again.
</P>
<P>
   We will watch, even in houses where there are parties, because
that is what we are trained to do. We want to see the ball go down.
We want to see other people in tuxedos and gowns.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see the millions in Times Square, half-wishing we
were there, more than half glad we are smart enough not to freeze
our ... noses off for the off-chance of getting our mugs on
television for one-eighth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   And we will watch for one reason more, one more serious, serious
reason.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what is going to happen. Forget the ``Y2K: The
Movie'' scenarios of nuclear meltdowns and chaos in the streets as
the result of computer screw-ups. My home computer is dead meat,
but widespread failures _ at least in the United States _ are not
that likely.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the terrorists and lone nutbags? Seattle has already
canceled its New Year's celebration out of security concerns. Could
terrorists possibly strike _ where? New York? London? Jerusalem?
Moscow?
</P>
<P>
   If something happens (I want to remain optimistic enough not to
use when), television will be all over it, instantaneously. We no
longer wonder at the live report from any corner of the globe; we
expect it. Hopefully the stories will be about celebrations in the
street, of fears unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, come midnight we will watch. Joyous and
apprehensive.

GRIER DEFENDS HIMSELF, SAYS HE DID JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After working in this town for years, Bobby
Grier said he understands the mind-set of New England fans and
media. But the Patriots' vice president of personnel isn't about to
agree with the thought that he should be fired for the team's
downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to go back and find someone who has done this the
same length of time I have and has done it as well or better than I
have,'' Grier said Wednesday. ``Then you can come back to me and
tell me that you think I ought to be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he and owner Robert Kraft, who is due back Friday
from his vacation in Puerto Rico, have not discussed his future or
that of the coaching staff. ``Robert and I haven't talked about
it,'' said Grier. ``We'll sit and talk after the season. I'll be
evaluated like everyone else after the season is over. I don't
think there's a time frame for anything to happen. I don't know if
it'll happen after the game or a week from now. There haven't been
any discussions on what will happen to me, to Pete or the coaching
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Kraft's fondness for Grier, it's been suggested Kraft
would never fire him, but possibly move him aside. ``My job is
personnel,'' said Grier. ``I'll get to that if and when it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've got a contract. What I'm saying is if Robert
came to me and told me he didn't want me to be here . . . forget
the contract . . . if he didn't want me to be here I wouldn't want
to be here. This is a profession where as one guy once told me,
`We're all part-time employees.' I'm not sitting here worrying
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he's never been one to comment on other teams' drafts
and situations, but given all that's happened, he says his
curiosity has been piqued by what's going with teams in similar
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at how others build there teams,'' he said. ``I
hear it though. I hear this guy is a guru . . . or you should hire
this guy because he's done great things. For the first time I've
compared some teams. I've compared the Green Bay club. Their record
is the same as ours. They've lost some players. Now their QB (Brett
Favre) is going through what our QB is going through. He's throws
22 or 23 INTs. This was the player of the year in football for two
years. I look at some of their picks and they aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he's heard the talk that the best teams are the ones
who have the coach with personnel power. ``Last year the big thing
was the coach had to have power to do this and do that, and I look
at those guys and they're not in the playoffs and they've made
mistakes like everybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an exact science. I know people are on me about Chris
Canty, but the biggest mistake I made here was Sedrick Shaw. That's
because he stood for everything our scouting department looks for
in a player at his position: size, speed, and he was from a big
program. He'd been productive. He ran for 4,000 yards and he was
durable. He carried it 55 times in a game one time. He was here to
be a backup to Curtis Martin, if anything happened to Curtis. But
it didn't work out, we had to draft Robert (Edwards) and we had to
draft Kevin Faulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier disputes the prevailing theory that his draft picks
haven't been productive. `The picks haven't made an impact? That's
not true. When we've needed a guy to step in and start, we've
produced those players. Robert Edwards stepped in and played. We
needed and played Damien Woody at the toughest position (center).
Andy Katzenmoyer moved inside and played and Faulk has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask about Chris Canty and whether he's a bust.
Personally, I don't think he was. What got Chris Canty in trouble
here was his personal life and off-the-field stuff. He was the 29th
pick, which is basically the top of the second round. He was
supposed to be a nickel and dime guy for us after we had signed
Steve Israel to be our starter. Chris is in Seattle playing very
well as a nickle and dime guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he drafted players for depth in 1997 and 1998 knowing
none of them could supplant the starters. ``When we drafted Rod
Rutledge, there was no way he was replacing Ben Coates,'' Grier
said. ``Greg Spires wasn't going to take Willie McGinest's spot.
Vernon Crawford wasn't going to beat out Chris Slade. We tried to
get depth. . . .If you look at this year, when Zefross Moss was
injured (second game vs. Indianapolis), Ed Ellis went in and played
tackle. When Zefross went back and Ellis went to the sidelines and
wasn't able to play. Tebucky Jones had a chance to play the last
couple of games. He's made progress and he's starting to look like
a cornerback. Kato Serwanga is starting to play well, and Tony
George, but it took injuries to get these kids on the field,'' said
Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Grier disputed that he tried to undermine Pete Carroll on a
radio segment he did Monday on WNRB. Grier was defending his draft
when he asked how could anyone know how good the picks were because
they didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't name or blame Pete Carroll at all,'' said Grier. ``I
said these players didn't play until there was an injury. I didn't
mention anyone's name. It's not my job to tell the coach who to
play or how to play. I've never done that. That's his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he pared for the barrage of daggers thrown his
way based on what's happened to other people in his position around
town. ``What I try to do is study all the franchises in town from
the top,'' he said. ``I'm a big Dan Duquette fan. I watched the hit
he was taking at first. He's not a media type. What he's done is
built a successful system. They brought Jimy Williams in and
everyone said he couldn't coach, worst guy we could have gotten. I
see how quickly things can change here.''

CELTICS ARE ROAD WORRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ On the road, the end of a two-hour-plus workout does
not mean the Celtics are finished expending energy. They may be
dressed in matching black sweatsuits and ready to leave the Pepsi
Center, but the players cannot rest their minds along with their
bodies. It's hard work putting a streak of 11 road losses behind
you and keeping a positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In the Denver locker room, Kenny Anderson slumped back into a
black leather chair and practically mumbled when discussing
Boston's road woes. Antoine Walker spoke so softly about the
subject matter he had to repeat himself. Paul Pierce, who was
sidelined with a sprained ankle for most of the slump, did not
waver in his determination to break the streak or in his criticisms
of the Boston defense.
</P>
<P>
   As the losing streak continues, the Celtics struggle to deal
with the mental baggage that now comes with each game away from the
FleetCenter. They try to keep their eyes on the larger prize: a
trip to the playoffs. But each time the players return to their
hotel rooms, they are acutely aware of their desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's always in the back of your mind,'' said Anderson,
``but you've got to go out and play hard each night and be
professional about your job. You've just got to play. When you hit
the road, it's on your mind . . . You can't let it get the best of
you. You have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has moved on, but each stop has brought the same result.
The streak that started in Indiana has kept pace with the Celtics
across the country and back again. With each new city and fresh
defeat, the frustration mounts.
</P>
<P>
   But before Boston can start stringing together victories, it has
to find a way to notch its second road win of the season. After
losses to Los Angeles and Sacramento, the team's leading scorer now
has a different outlook. ``Without question, the pressure builds to
break the streak,'' said Walker. ``But our main thing right now is
trying to get a win any way possible. We feel like we can make the
playoffs. If we want to make the playoffs, we have to find a way to
win on the road. Whatever it takes as a collective unit, we've got
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver does not exactly present the best of situations for
Boston to walk into with a slump. The Nuggets have compiled a 12-3
record in their plush new home and are in second place in the
Midwest. A 25-point blowout by Boston in the FleetCenter the last
time the teams met should only increase Denver's motivation. Just a
few more things that can weigh on the Celtics' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Denver is going to be really pumped to play us,''
said Walker. ``So we've got to be prepared to play. We've got to do
the little things (today) and weather their storm because they're
playing real well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the streak and the history between the Nuggets and
Celtics, Pierce remains an optimist. He believes adjustments on
defense, not expensive therapy sessions, will solve Boston's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to take personal pride in defending night in
and night out,'' said Pierce. ``Right now, we're the worst
defensive team in the NBA and we're not going to go to the playoffs
until we improve.''

SNOWMAKING A MATTER OF DEGREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, N.H. _ Jay Gamble, like most good ski country types,
dreads the ``r'' word. Rarely, perhaps never, does he let it pass
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is snowmaking in this slow-to-start winter and
Gamble is listing five ingredients to make the all-important white
product _ cold temperatures, water, equipment, expertise to run the
equipment, and then this: ``How hard are you willing to work during
the recovery period when those New England weather events come in
and in 36 or 48 hours you want to turn the mountain back around and
have good conditions again?''
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, the dreaded ``New England weather events.''
</P>
<P>
   That would include _ say this four-letter word quietly _ rain.
And don't even whisper it around Gamble, the general manager at
Mount Sunapee. Or Skip King at the American Skiing Company, who
speaks for the largest ski resorts in Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont. Or general manager Tom Day at Waterville Valley. Or the
ski folks at Okemo or Loon or Sugarloaf or any point in between. Or
to most anyone else in the snow business _ especially in a mostly
snowless winter.
</P>
<P>
   This year's early ski and snowboarding season turned into a case
of so many trails, so little time. It was not so much even rain _
which combined with a freeze can throw a ski area out of whack for
a couple of days in the winter _ that was the biggest culprit. It
was more another New England weather event _ unseasonably warm
temperatures. A question: Can you have a thaw when you have barely
had a freeze?
</P>
<P>
   And while ski areas _ especiallythe larger areas that are
loaded with snowguns and other snowmaking equipment _ can cover
ground in a hurry, they do need cold temperatures to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a couple of marketing types at Loon Mountain in
Lincoln, N.H., sat in an office just before Christmas and noted how
ski area operators don't even bother watching for snowstorms these
days. They're much more interested in watching their thermometers.
And snowmakers and ski area operators finally found something to
get excited about when it finally turned cold the weekend before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take a 15 degree starry night, and once we get terrain
we'll let Mother Nature sprinkle nice soft stuff on top,'' said Tom
Day, general manager at Waterville Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the region, snowguns, idled through much of December,
were turned on and turned brown slopes and trails white in the days
and hours leading up to Christmas, and the trail counts climbed
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Loon went from 12 trails open on Dec. 20 to 25 a week later. Mt.
Sunapee went from 10 to 24; Okemo, 39 to 62; Sunday River, 31 to
60.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday River in Newry, Maine, which built its reputation and
basically the American Ski Company on its ability to make snow and
prepare skiing surfaces, there are 1,200 snowguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be fair to say at Sunday River alone it costs
well over $1 million just for electricity to make snow,'' said
King. ``That doesn't include any of the capital costs; it doesn't
include the labor costs. There are significant capital costs, too.
We did calculations not too long ago that if Sunday River's entire
snowmaking system was abducted by aliens and we came in and found
everything gone, it would cost somewhere between $20 to $25 million
to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be a world in which art and technology meet. The art of
creating fluffy stuff to supplement or even supplant Mother Nature
and make the hills pretty-white and skiable and snowboardable and
having the technology to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world in which snowmakers talk of wet bulb temperatures _
a function of the dry bulb temperature on your thermometer and
relative humidity _ and Boyle's Law and computer readouts, and
forcing air and water through pipes to end up with snow. Throw in a
dollop of brute force for the snowmakers who trudge up and down
frozen mountains of a winter night checking and moving hoses and
nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a hydrant is frozen and you've got to lug propane down to
it and thaw it out, it can be pretty tough,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, snow can be made when temperatures are as warm as
the high 30s, but it can be made much more efficiently at 19
degrees than at 26.
</P>
<P>
   The temperatures of late have been ideal, and some places,
including Loon, actually have more terrain open now than they did
at the same time last year, according to Loon mountain manager Dan
Bourassa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a bit ahead of last year; we're actually amazed,'' said
Bourassa. ``It's been such a push lately. The weather has been just
phenomenal and we've taken good advantge of it. It's been a bit
below zero at night and the highs have been in the mid-20s. It's
just great for snowmaking, and we've been making it around the
clock. We don't back off a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a world in which tower guns are the current rage because
they use less air and can crank out snow when it is colder
especially, and they are friendlier to skiers during a run because
the soft falling snow they produce does not smack them in the face
as happens with lower guns. However, tower guns are far from ideal
when it's windy, which it often was this early winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made plenty of snow in the woods,'' according to more than
one operator.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world in which the resort with the most snowguns tends to
win the races to recover from ``New England weather events.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Sunday River cannot churn out snow from its 1,200 guns at
once, nor can Waterville Valley from its 700-800.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday River, with one of the more powerful systems around, can
run only 180-205 guns at a time, and Killington, said King, can
operate about 220.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is always limited by the amount of water you can
pump and the amount of air you can compress,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   So why 1,200 snowguns?
</P>
<P>
   Ski areas can ill afford the down time it takes to move hoses
and guns from one trail to another. Sunday River has a couple kinds
of guns, including tower guns, on some popular trails so it can
specify the type of snow it offers its skiers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a world with a little mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on temperatures, said King, the American Skiing
Company resorts are usually set up to make 10 different types of
snow _ from heavy and wet to help build a base to light and fluffy
for a fine finish.
</P>
<P>
   The specifications of which will not be divulged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of our more closely guarded secrets,'' he said. ``It
would be like giving away the recipe to Coca-Cola. Anybody who
really wanted to could probably figure it out. It's not rocket
science.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is snow science _ designed to handle New England weather
events.

FAA PLANNING NEW YEAR'S FLIGHT AS SAFETY DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do leaders in the Mormon church know something that Jane Garvey,
the nation's top aviation official, doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
announced earlier this month that they were prohibiting air travel
for their 60,000 missionaries and employees from midnight Dec. 30
through Jan. 5, 2000, because of the possibility that computer
glitches could wreak havoc with the nation's air system.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, the administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, announced two years ago that she would fly across
the country on New Year's Eve to show the country that the nation's
air system is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the FAA has spent some $368 million _ and the
domestic airline industry another $700 million _ to make sure that
flying on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 is just as safe as any other day.
</P>
<P>
   But vast amounts of money are not enough to persuade some
travelers, including Garvey's husband, Hampshire County Sheriff
Robert Garvey. Asked if he would accompany his wife on the trip,
his response was direct. ``No,'' he replied. ``But I'll drive her
to the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Bob know something Jane doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly weak demand for air travel on New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day has nearly eradicated flight schedules, but airline
officials uniformly say the cancellations were not prompted by
safety concerns. But as airlines cancel flights by the hundreds,
the intrepid Garvey, some of her staff, and a handful of reluctant
reporters (including this one) will take to the skies Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt has earned her a trivial celebrity: The trip was a
question on the television game show, ``Jeopardy.'' (The answer:
Jane Garvey, the head of this agency, will fly across the country
on New Year's Eve to show the nation's air system is safe. The
question: What is the FAA?)
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's New Year's Eve flight surely is designed to give the
thousands of FAA employees and millions of airline passengers
significant shots of confidence. And Garvey has ample reason to be
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   First, Garvey created a Y2K office that reports directly to her
and has oversight of all FAA operations, from air traffic to
aircraft certification.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 628 computer systems used by the FAA, 424 were
mission-critical, and, of those, 152 required retooling. There were
only 65 mission-critical air-traffic systems that had to be
repaired, far fewer than FAA officials expected. But the
air-traffic system is geared to operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, and is not as date-dependant as many other computer systems.
Ninety-one of the FAA's noncritical systems needed to be updated.
</P>
<P>
   Following the repairs _ which included bringing some retired IBM
personnel back to work on embedded code in aging mainframes _ the
systems were checked and deemed compliant. A major live test of the
air-traffic system was conducted in Colorado in April. In the test,
air-traffic systems were split into two groups: one tracked traffic
in real time, and the other operated with its computer clocks set
forward to Dec. 31. When the computers rolled over to Jan. 1, 2000,
the systems continued to function as designed, and no data was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials say another benefit of the air-traffic system is
that a day does not go by without some piece of equipment failing.
As a result, the FAA has contingency plans that are well tested.
Indeed, the FAA expects some equipment to fail on New Year's Eve;
the question officials will have to determine is whether the
failures are Y2K-related.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the air-traffic command center in Herndon, Va.,
will have about 100 more personnel on duty than normal.
</P>
<P>
   All major US airports, the FAA insists, are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, the picture is less clear. The FAA said that of
the 185 member nations in the UN International Civil Aviation
Organization, 36 have fully implemented Y2K programs and 44 more
are expected to complete their remediation programs by midnight
Friday. Another 34 nations have programs under way, but it is not
certain when they will be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two countries have programs, but their status is not
certain. Two nations did not provide enough information to
determine their status. More information can be found at
www.fly2k.dot.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers such as Boeing have been working to check on-board
computer systems that do much of the flying of modern airliners.
Boeing engineers found three systems affected: Two were in the
flight-management computer, and one was in the inertial navigation
sytem. All were manufactured by subcontractors, and each system has
been repaired, said Jim Huffaker, an engineer with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded chips were not a problem, he said, because they were
designed specifically for the airline industry and do not have date
data stored on them.
</P>
<P>
   So airplanes are safe, analysts say, and the air-traffic system
fixes are in place. If something does go wrong, the FAA has its
tried-and-true contingency plans, which it relied on to develop a
massive battle plan for Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Volume I, version four, of the plan, which was finished this
month, comes in at a lean, aerodynamic 99 pages, not including
appendices A through E. And then there is Volume II, the tome that
contains all the risk matrices of the various problems the agency
may face.
</P>
<P>
   But that document, which details what precise action would be
taken in the event of a crisis, is classified. Does middle
management at the FAA know something Jane Garvey doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, say FAA officials. The document is classified
because it contains sensitive information, including data on
security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Garvey hopes to prove that the nation's skies will
be at least as safe in the next century as they are in this one.

A FAULTY CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though I'm no fan of the deceased rap musician Biggie Sma'd never recoil in horror at the very sight of him. But my
computer does. One glimpse of the man, and the system locks up.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens with my childhood role models, the Three
Stooges. If I seek out Internet images of their old movie posters,
my PC throws a fit. The machine has even developed an allergy to
the work of Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I can't display pictures of naked women on
this computer, either. And that's what really matters, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you think so, just shell out $29.95 for Eyeguard, a
flawed but fascinating piece of British software that takes this
Internet porn-filtering thing a wee bit further.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for known smut sites, or even scanning for
dirty words, Eyeguard tracks the images that appear on your
monitor. The software tries _ not always successfully _ to figure
out whether these are porn pictures. And if they are, Eyeguard
protects your mind from corruption by blanking out the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success on hitting pornography, on our tests, is more than
98 or 99 percent,'' says Jonathan Scott, technical director at
Eye-T Technology Ltd., which developed Eyeguard. I believe him. The
trouble is that Eyeguard only attains this high batting average by
weeding out a variety of harmless stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It's the classic problem with all Internet filters: the curse of
the ``false positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Early word-scanning programs would reject Web sites that used
the word ``breast'' because the software wasn't smart enough to
notice that the next word was ``cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The word-sniffers are much smarter now, but still far from
infallible, a fact often touted by libertarian types who oppose all
efforts to tidy up the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a libertarian. I loathe Web porn and welcome efforts to
shield our kids from the filth. So I'm inclined to look kindly on
Eyeguard. Then there's my love for clever technologies. And for all
its failings, Eyeguard is about as impressive a program as I've
seen in 1999. Just think what this program must do.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of compressed-image data, mixed with text and sounds
and who-knows-what-else, comes flooding into your computer.
Eyeguard must wait until the video data are dumped into the
computer's video display system, which has its own separate
processor and memory bank. Eyeguard scans the contents of the video
memory, in search of image pixels that appear to be human skin. It
must decode the pattern of these pixels to decide how much skin is
showing, and then it must decide at what point the image crosses
the line from PG-13 to XXX.It's a miracle it works at all.
</P>
<P>
   Right out of the box, it locked me out of the official
``Baywatch'' Web site, which ought to be renamed Silicone Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeguard is tunable, so you can make it less sensitive. The
higher the setting, the more skin you're allowed to see. Eyeguard
starts at a stingy 20 percent, far too strict for ``Baywatch.'' But
jump it up to 50 percent, and say hello to Pamela Anderson. And at
this looser setting, the software still thwarted my fumbling,
shamefaced efforts to visit some true smut sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 50 percent, though, I found myself locked out of some
harmless Web pages. Biggie Smalls's picture was on a page at the
CNN news site, describing the dead musician's new album. Smalls is
shown fully clothed, but there must be something about his face.
Oh, well. I never much cared for him, either.
</P>
<P>
   But what's wrong with the Three Stooges? Curly occasionally wore
drag, but he never did a nude scene. As for Michelangelo, maybe
it's a testament to his genius that one of his statues of a
reclining nude seemed disgracefully lifelike to Eyeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Scott admits the software isn't perfect, but says it's mainly a
deterrent. When a child looks at a forbidden image, Eyeguard saves
a copy in a special file, so Mom and Dad will find out. The same
feature is built into the $299 version for corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the product's most powerful feature is a sheet of bright
yellow warning stickers to be glued to computers. Scott said one
company stopped using Eyeguard after two weeks; workers cleaned up
their acts once they realized the firm had an automatic porn
detector.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Eyeguard is also a rap-star detector, a
Renaissance-art detector, even a stooge detector. It's too prudish
even for my tastes. Nice try, though.

FOR HASSELBECK, BUFFALOES WERE THE HOME TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ For as long as he can remember, Tim Hasselbeck
and his brothers, Matthew and Nathanael, always rooted for the
University of Colorado football team. Growing up in the Hasselbeck
household it was hard not to be a fan. After all, their father, Don
Hasselbeck, was a former Colorado football player who never missed
an opportunity to watch his beloved Buffaloes on television with
his sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't a family that watched a whole lot of TV,'' Tim
said. ``But if Colorado was playing Nebraska or Oklahoma, that's
the one time we weren't out raking leaves or doing something like
that. So, my fondest memories of Colorado football was getting out
of yard work.''
</P>
<P>
   When Boston College culminates its football season Friday
against Colorado in the Insight.com Bowl, Don Hasselbeck will find
himself in the awkward situation of rooting for his son Tim, the
Eagles' starting quarterback, against his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, for me, is a little strange,'' said Don Hasselbeck,
whose trip to Tuscon and the foothills of the Santa Catalina
Mountains has transported him back to his college days in Boulder,
Colo., and its majestic Flat Iron Mountain backdrop. ``I don't
think I've ever cheered against Colorado. In fact, I know that I
haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his father's split allegiance, Tim said, ``I think
he's excited to see some people who are associated with the program
when he was there, but he's a BC fan and he's going to cheer for
the Eagles on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he sure about that? ``At least that's what he's saying,''
Tim said with a laugh. ``So as long as I don't see him standing on
the other sideline with a CU hat on, I think we're going to be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of his son's comments, Don replied, ``Well, I always pack
my BC hat, but I kept teasing him, `Tim, you'd better play well, or
else I'm going to wear my (Colorado) jersey under my coat and I'll
put that on.' It's going to be neat, but I'm going to be looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hasselbecks might not have faced this dilemma, however, had
Tim been recruited out of Xaverian to play for Colorado, which was
what he had hoped. But when then-Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel
intimated to Don Hasselbeck that the Buffaloes were interested in
Adam Bledsoe, the younger brother of Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, Tim focused his attention elsewhere. One of the schools
that entered the picture was Northwestern, which was then coached
by Gary Barnett, who this season succeeded Neuheisel at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Tim said he's never visited Boulder, but that older brother Matt
was born there when his parents were at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad claims that if I was ever out there, I'd never leave,
because its so awesome with the whole backdrop of the mountains and
everything,'' he said. ``I was basically trying to get recruited by
them, but they were really the only school that wasn't pursuing me.
It's kind of ironic how that all worked out, with my father being
there. I don't know, maybe if Coach Barnett had been there, things
might have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   When Northwestern recruited him, Hasselbeck said his father and
Barnett developed a strong rapport.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, that's probably who my father really
felt most comfortable with,'' Tim said. ``I think he was
disappointed when things didn't work out, because my father got to
meet with him and they kind of have that Boulder connection and I
think my dad really liked that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really said to me, `This is where I want you to go to
school,' but you could tell by the way he asked questions that he
really liked Coach Barnett. I think he's going to try and see him
this week, because I know my father thinks a whole lot of him and I
do, too. He's done a really nice job, coming in the first year of
the program, and I think it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hasselbeck was quick to note, ``That's how it worked out
and I'm happy here at BC. I feel like I'm part of a pretty neat
turnaround with this program.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 25 Eagles went 8-3 this year to earn their first bowl
berth since a trip to the 1994 Aloha Bowl. Hasselbeck, who
completed 145 of 260 attempts for 1,940 yards and 11 touchdowns,
was an integral part of that turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I've led this team to a bowl,'' said
Hasselbeck. ``I think we got some guys who have . . . I mean,
everyone's been pulling their weight. Personally, for me, yeah it
is a lot of fun to be the quarterback on this team and its
something I've always in the back of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew at some point that I was going to go to a bowl
game during my time at BC. I'm just glad that it was now, and I'm
just glad that it's with the guys who are on this team.''

THE END OF THE WORLD IS UPON US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIDEOUT HQ _ So, all I can tell you is that I am somewhere in
Arizona, trying to avoid them. You know who they are. They are the
ones who are playing ``Taps'' on our end-of-1999, apocalyptic
insecurities. In the past several days, they have been trying to
convince us all that the end of the sports world is near.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, they've already done a damn good job of convincing me.
So say goodbye to the Holley Lama; the Holley-in-Trauma is more
like it. That's why I'm here hiding out, with army blanket and
canteen in tow. Either the past week in sports has been an illusion
or the end is coming. Since I'm here, you already know what I
think.
</P>
<P>
   Am I paranoid? Before I answer that, let me explain how I was
forced into this position, hiding out somewhere between the Grand
Canyon and a very suspicious-looking cactus.
</P>
<P>
   There is no beginning or ending, really. Just a lot of things
piling up. Wednesday was a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn was suspended by the Patriots with one game left in
the season. He missed Sunday's game with what the team called the
flu but, in my mental state, I don't believe that's the whole
story. He also missed a couple team buses, a couple team meetings,
and a couple Walpole traffic signs while speeding through town on
Thanksgiving. Maybe that film starring John Malkovich should have
been entitled ``Being Terry Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, don't you wonder what the talented receiver is thinking?
And while we're at it, don't you wonder the same thing about Pete
Carroll? This suspension is redundant because if you were to put
the polygraph on every Patriot this morning _ with the intention of
finding out if players were focused on Sunday's game with the
Ravens _ I'll bet 10 guys would flunk it.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, several miles away, the Red Sox were announcing
a raise in their ticket prices. But they aren't really ``raising''
their prices. A ticket raise is when a $35 ticket becomes a $37
ticket. Since the old $35 seat is now $45, it was more
``reinvention'' than ``raise'' on Yawkey Way. General manager Dan
Duquette explained that the higher cost is necessary because the
Sox have to stay competitive with the Yankees. So if the team is
out of the pennant race by August, does that mean fans get a
refund?
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, I think the Sox raised their prices so they can
contribute to their current players' retirement fund. They recently
courted Orel Hershiser, Dwight Gooden, and Chuck Finley before the
latter signed with the Indians. Average age of those three: 92.5.)
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a week, Michael Bishop went from aspiring to be
the next Willie Mays to the next Kurt Warner. The Bruins'
disappointing season got worse when Jason Allison's wrist injury
was found to be more severe than anyone thought. The Celtics lost
their 11th consecutive game on the road, but even more disturbing
were the words of Rick Pitino. The coach said he wasn't going to
make any trades. This is frightening. Pitino without trades is
Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder without the angst. It's the Pokemon crew
without Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino made his comment in Sacramento, some 80 miles away from
the San Francisco restaurant where his friend, P.J. Carlesimo, was
holding a press conference. Carlesimo is the pro coach best known
for his neck. That's because on Dec. 1, 1997, that neck was in the
captivity of Latrell Sprewell's hands. Carlesimo was fired by the
Golden State Warriors on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day I really began to think about hiding out,
especially after learning that Warriors forward Donyell Marshall
said Sprewell beat his teammates to the punch (or, in this case,
choke) in '97. Marshall said most of the Warriors were on the verge
of choking Carlesimo, but Sprewell outran them to the spotlight.
Even crazier is that Carlesimo said he wants to be a head coach
again. In the NBA. That's not going to happen. The moral of the
story, obviously, is to find a middle manager at your place of
employment and choke that person. It might get you a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell since he choked Carlesimo: A trip to the NBA Finals, a
new commercial, and a five-year, $62 million contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo since he was choked: Zero trips to the playoffs, one
trip to the unemployment line, and 100 losses.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe you don't have your own hiding place, too. Look
at the headlines. Boxer Oscar De La Hoya is being accused of rape.
His lawyer says the suit is bogus and stems from his client calling
police and requesting the removal of three people from his home. If
he is found guilty, of course he should be punished. But what if
the suit is baseless? Think about it: You ask people to leave your
house and they accuse you of raping them.
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine waking up and finding an NFL running back in your
house. Miami running back Cecil Collins allegedly broke into his
neighbors' home _ after trying to date his neighbor's wife. Never
mind the pregnant girlfriend and 3-year-old daughter in his own
home. Apparently, more women are coming forward, charging that
Collins exposed himself to them.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am in an Arizona bunker, a shortwave radio attached to
my ear. All I can hear over and over, is the first 10 words of an
old REM song: ``It's the end of the world as we know it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Please help me. I'm scared. I don't know whom to call. I thought
about calling the Globe . . . but I think something strange is
going on there, too. My radio briefly picked up the news that Bill
Russell finished second on the paper's list of Top 100 New England
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell? Second? Did someone mistake the Celtics center for the
former Dodgers' second baseman? Russell finishing second. How crazy
is that?

HAMILTON'S STARS NOW SHINE ON ICE TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was 13 years ago, just two years after Scott
Hamilton had won a gold medal in the Winter Olympics, when the
skater realized his career was spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of a triple axel that had gone awry. But because he
wasn't sure where he could show it off.
</P>
<P>
   Just after he won the medal in Sarajevo (which came after taking
national and world titles the two previous years), Hamilton decided
to turn pro. He was immediately courted by all the major ice shows.
He decided on the Ice Capades, which signed him to two-year
contract. That was just beginning, he figured.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Capades cut Hamilton loose after the two years, deciding
that the future of ice skating was not in male superstars but in
female ones.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 41, now sounds pragmatic when he talks about the
decision. ``They were going though a sale, and thought the
tradition in skating has always been with the women,'' Hamilton
said. ``They were not interested in continuing my relationship with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, neither Hamilton nor his agent, Robert
Kain, were ready to surrender. ``I wanted to continue skating,''
Hamilton said. ``I had been an amateur for 16 years, and had just
turned pro. And I am a performer.''
</P>
<P>
   So, taking a cue from those movies where ideas are hatched while
daydreaming and plays are performed in garages, the two got to
work. ``Bob said we had to get creative,'' Hamilton said earlier
this week from Greensboro, N.C. ``And out of desperation comes a
lot of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   After he and Kain brainstormed, they came up with the idea of
producing a show of their own. The result is the touring ``Stars on
Ice'' that Hamilton brings to Boston this week. What he and Kain
began as a five-city, nine-person show called ``America Tour'' has
evolved into a tour with a cast of 14 skaters that travels to more
than 60 cities from the end of November to the middle of April.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of former Olympic, national, and world champions
includes Tara Lipinski and Ilia Kulik both 1998 gold medalists;
Kristi Yamaguchi, '92 gold medalist; Ekaterina Gordeeva, '94 gold
medalist in pairs with her late husband Sergei Grinkov; four-time
world champion and Canandian champion Kurt Browning; 1995 world
champion Lu Chen; three-time US champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand;
1992 Olympic gold medalists Elena Bechke and Denis Petrov; two-time
US dance champions Renee Roca and Gorsha Sur; and Olympian, world,
and national champion Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   But the cast of all professional, post-Olympic skaters are just
some of the changes. When the tour first started, the rehearsal
period lasted five days, all the skaters stayed with families of
friends, and the performers traveled by bus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the tour is sponsored by Target stores and begins with five
weeks of rehearsal _ two weeks alone devoted to the technical
aspects, said Hamilton. The skaters stay in hotels, and now they
fly in a private jet from venue to venue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of performing in small college arenas and paying
students $20 to help hang lights, lighting designer Ken Billington,
who won a 1997 Tony Award for ``Chicago,'' works with Emmy Award
costume designer Jef Billins to make the show look like a Broadway
production. Musical director Michael Dolgay handles the music that
includes Ricky Martin, Santana, and Chris Isaak.
</P>
<P>
   Also pulling the strings are choreographers Sandra Bezic
(five-time Canadian champion) and world ice dance bronze medalist
and 1984 Olympic champions Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamilton would not take direct aim at any of the other
skating shows that feature characters from movies or fairy tales,
he does make it clear that he thinks his show stands apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a family show that's geared at kids and the
parents endure it,'' said Hamilton. ``We've broken new ground with
entertainment that people want to come back to.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the show is more likely to resemble the avant-garde
Cirque du Soleil than the traditional Ringling Bros. circus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there won't be judges scrutinizing the skaters'
every turn and jump, Hamilton assures that the skaters look as good
as they do when they're going for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who won 18 consecutive championships from 1981 up to
the world championships in 1984 and underwent surgery for
testicular cancer in 1997, acknowledges that he might be slowing
down some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do a lot of things, but I don't compete like I used
to,'' said Hamilton.

<P>
   At the dawn of the 1990s , cable industry executives enthused
about the coming age of digital cable. In the future, they
proclaimed, cable subscribers will have 500 channels to choose
from.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the folly of those dreams is becoming all too clear.
Future cable subscribers won't need 500 channels to choose from,
they will need precisely one channel: the Internet. And on that
single channel, viewers will be able to display whatever they wish
to see.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ways to watch video on your home PC today. The
easiest, and probably the least interesting, is to buy a video card
that has a built-in television tuner, like the ATI's All In Wonder
video card. These cards let you display the TV signal either in a
little window on your desktop or on the full screen of your
computer monitor. You also can use this card to capture pictures
from television _ to put on your Web site, perhaps _ or to record
entire television broadcasts onto your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to watch video on your home computer today is to buy
a DVD player, and then rent or purchase a trendy digital video disc
from the local store. A few months ago, my wife and I sat around my
computer's 17-inch monitor while we watched a DVD of the movie
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Romantic it wasn't. Fortunately, newer computer systems now have
S-Video outputs, so you can play the DVD on a conventional home
theater TV system.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with either of these two approaches, techniques for
watching video pulled down from the Internet are still in their
infancy. Called ``streaming video,'' these systems require a fast
Internet connection, some special software, and a fairly fast
computer. But if you have a cable modem or a fast DSL connection,
there's already a world of video waiting for you on line.
</P>
<P>
   News clips are the most ubiquitous form of video on the
Internet. CNN's Web site (www.cnn.com), for instance, has a little
section at the bottom labeled ``Video on Demand.'' When I checked
it earlier this week, it had a three-minute segment about
television advertisements that the presidential candidates were
running. CNN also has put its 24-part series about the Cold War on
line (cnn.com/coldwar). And I have seen video clips on Yahoo's
financial Web site (finance.yahoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in movies, check out Kanakaris
Communications (kkrs.net). The company has put 223 full-length
movies on line. Most of them are old movies that you never would
voluntarily rent from a video store _ such as ``They Came From
Beyond Space,'' the 1967 sleeper starring Robert Hutton and
Jennifer Jayne, or the 1959 production of ``Hercules,'' with Steve
Reeves in the leading role. On the other hand, there are some
classics available on line, such as ``39 Steps'' and ``Dressed To
Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, all of Kanakaris's movies are free, uncut, and
advertisement-free. Eventually, though, the company hopes to make
money by selling access to movies and books. Customers might pay
for a single viewing, pay per minute, or pay for unlimited access
over a few weeks (or a few years).
</P>
<P>
   Or, customers might subscribe to an unlimited service: as many
movies as you can watch, any time you want to watch them, for a
single monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of free movies is Yahoo's Broadcast.com. Alas,
its selection is even more limited than the one at Kanakaris. For
instance, there are just three movies in the science fiction
category: ``Giant Gila Monster'' (1959), ``Killers From Space''
(1954), and ``Phantom From Space'' (1953).
</P>
<P>
   One problem with both Kanakaris and Broadcast.com is that you
only can view the movies if you have a Windows-based PC. That's
because the company only makes its movies available in the Windows
Media Format, which plays only on the Windows Media Player. This is
a compression technology developed by Microsoft. Although the
Windows format has good video and CD-quality sound, it locks both
providers and subscribers into Microsoft's Windows technology.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Microsoft system, there are several other formats in
use today, including Apple's QuickTime and Real Networks's
RealVideo. All of these systems rely on complicated mathematics to
take the video signal and compress it into something that can be
transmitted over the Internet. The program that you run on your
home computer then takes the compressed video stream and displays
it on your computer's screen.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors determine just how good the video signal will
look, the biggest being the speed of your Internet connection.
Full-motion video requires anywhere from 4 million to 10 million
bits of information per second. With compression, it is possible to
shrink the bandwidth requirements down to somewhere between 500,000
bits and 2 million bits of information per second. Alas, most cable
modems can deliver little more than 300 kilobits of information,
and by the time you factor in other Internet delays, you're lucky
if you can get an 80 kilobits per second between you and the video
site.
</P>
<P>
   On-line movie sites deal with the bandwidth limitation by
turning down the quality and shrinking the size of the video
signal. Watch a news clip or a movie on the Internet, and you're
likely to be sitting a few inches from your screen, staring at a
box that's roughly the size of a floppy disk. The image is sure to
get bigger over time as people get faster Internet connections, as
well as the faster computers necessary to display full-screen
video.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm sad to admit it, Microsoft's standard generally
looks and sounds better than the competition's. But that advantage
is likely to diminish over time, both as the competition develops
better algorithms and as faster Internet connections make the
differences less important.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, once higher-quality movies are available on line,
they probably won't be free. So if you have a high-speed
connection, there's no time like the present to start catching up
on these 30-year-old flicks.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The telltale signs of illness were obvious when Ana
Lucia Merida Perez arrived at the emergency room of Children's
Hospital five weeks ago, clutched tightly to her mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   There were her spindly arms and legs, unable to grasp a rattle
or crawl across a floor. There was the long, dark scar stretching
across her stomach, a stinder of the hours she spent on an
operating table. And on the back of her tiny scalp, there was the
bald patch in an otherwise wispy, wavy tangle of thin brown hair,
the result of having spent nearly six months lying in a hospital
crib in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, hospital officials anticipate, a much healthier
Perez will be discharged from the hospital with her mother, Mariana
Perez de Merida, who has lived and slept by her 9-month-old
daughter's side since the pair appeared at Children's the day after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   As a medical mecca, Boston draws ailing pilgrims from all over
the world, many of whom come to the city's teaching hospitals with
little more than the clothes on their backs _ and a burning hope
that a life can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Perez and her mother, who traveled here
to seek treatment for the infant's intestinal disorder and cystic
fibrosis, a chronic inherited disease that causes a range of
respiratory and digestive problems. The conditions had been
diagnosed by Guatemalan doctors, who advised Merida and her husband
to simply wait for their child to die.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the infant was admitted to Children's Hospital, she
had already endured two intestinal surgeries and two incidents of
cardiac arrest, battled bronchial pneumonia, and been catheterized
eight times. For all those reasons, she had failed to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Perez taken when she was 3 months old shows a plump,
double-chinned baby with fat cheeks, chubby thighs and a full head
of hair. Today, there is a sharpness to her facial features, and
her lean, scarecrow-like limbs are dwarfed by a Winnie the Pooh
sleeper speckled with little yellow bees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Perez, who was born on March 5, now weighs nine pounds _
four less than she did six months ago, but two more than last
month. With her mother's help, she can finally stand. And
Wednesday, in a hospital room filled with balloons, stuffed animals
and Christmas cards, she gripped a small toy dog firmly while
nibbling intently on its rubber ears.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perez, who was suffering from malnutrition when she
arrived in Boston, faces a lifetime of dependency on medication and
supplemental enzymes. For now, an intravenous tube inserted in her
chest pumps antibiotics into her fragile body. A tube in her
abdomen sends food directly to her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for her daughter's medical bills, Merida, 25, has
applied for financial assistance through the hospital's free-care
program, which will provide $28 million in public subsidies this
year. And hospital social workers are trying to secure specialty
services that will help the family build a temporary life in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Merida and her husband have appealed to family
members, friends and charitable organizations for aid, and mother
and daughter will stay with a relative in Revere once they are
discharged from the hospital. Their flight to Boston was paid for
by the company where Merida and her husband have worked for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Merida, who has a 10-year visa and speaks little English, hopes
to stay in the United States permanently, where advanced medical
care will be readily available if her daughter's condition worsens.
She would like her husband, Jose Francisco, 31, and their two other
children to join them eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have plans to come here,'' said Merida, speaking
through an interpeter. ``I know a lot of people think we may want
to stay to take advantage of the situation, but I just want to take
care of what's necessary.''

PRIVATE SECTOR LURES GOVERNMENT STUDENTS

<P>
   When Steven Rahman applied to Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government last year, he made sure to emphasize his interest in
pursuing a career in government.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the 29-year-old international finance major is on
track to graduate in June, he has decided to delay his entry into
the low-paying federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like an increasing number of students at the nation's
top public policy schools, Rahman plans to enter the more lucrative
private sector. A London firm has already offered him a six-figure
salary to tell Fortune 500 companies how to boost their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a long-term goal of working in government, maybe in 15
to 20 years,'' Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for top government jobs with private-sector
experience, he believes, are more qualified than those who have
only served in government. ``It's a quicker way to a higher level
position,'' Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's because of fewer government jobs, the flush
economy, or the changing definition of public service, institutions
such as the Kennedy School _ which has long prepared students for
policy-making positions in places like the State Department or the
Environmental Protection Agency _ are graduating fewer bureaucrats
but more and more investment bankers and management consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the number of Kennedy School graduates in the core
two-year masters-degree program seeking corporate jobs has jumped
from 24 percent to a high of 45 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 schools belonging to the Association of Professional
Schools of International Affairs _ which include the Kennedy
School, Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and
Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs _ report that the largest group among last year's graduates
chose to take jobs in the private sector. According to the
association, 38 percent of students attending member schools went
to work for companies, while 31 percent went into government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, when I came into this job, the first thing
that struck me was the difference from 1980, when two-thirds of the
students were going into government,'' said Joseph Nye, a former
assistant secretary of defense and now dean of the Kennedy School.
``In 1995, only 30 percent were going into public service. We knew
some things had to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, Nye not only has been encouraging
students to consider lower-paying government jobs, he has been in
effect bribing them.
</P>
<P>
   Through his initiative, the Kennedy School now offers to repay
all of a student's loans if he or she takes a government position
that pays $32,500 or less. If students decide to enter the
Presidential Management Internship program, which has a starting
salary of $34,000 and lets interns work in the federal department
of their choice, the Kennedy School will knock off $10,000 from
their debt.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of incentives and cajoling seems to be paying
off. According to the latest statistics, the number of students
choosing to work in government has shot back up at Harvard. In
1999, 47 percent of graduating students in the core program are
going into government; 38 percent will take jobs in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   While the trend of public policy students choosing the private
sector over the public sector is still increasing, analysts say the
reason may be broad changes in government, rather than in students'
values.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since President Clinton declared ``the era of big
government is over'' in his 1996 State of the Union address, the
federal bureaucracy has been shrinking. Traditional jobs such as
monitoring welfare programs or long-term national security studies
are increasingly performed by private contractors, such as Lockheed
Martin Co. and the Rand Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people going into the profession today are finding good
public-service jobs in the private sector,'' said Paul Light,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institute in
Washington. ``These private firms have expanded dramatically, and
now this is where many of the good public-service jobs are.''
</P>
<P>
   The deflated bureaucracy, however, is only one of several
significant factors in a student's decision to work in the private
sector, school officials and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banking firms and management companies are no longer
just looking to recruit at business schools, especially as many
graduates with an MBA are passing over such traditional jobs and
heading for the more innovative and remunerative Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Today's public policy students, who have come of age at a time
when free enterprise is taking on a new meaning in cyberspace,
often view working for a private company as a more effective way to
influence government policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominant logic among many students is that capitalism will
save democracy,'' said Michael Brintnall, executive director of the
National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and
Administration in Washington. But if students believe that the
market's ingenuity will keep America and other democracies strong,
``they're not less committed to public service because they're
making money,'' Brintnall said.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much how Jonathan Abshire sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 26-year-old started at the Kennedy School last year,
he helped manage political campaigns in Maine. Now, he's set to
work for the McKinsey &AMP; Co., a New York-based consulting firm,
advising companies and earning more than $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are going to be leery about us going into the
private sector until they see we're maintaining our involvement
with policy circles and doing work that benefits the community,''
Abshire said. ``But if you're going to be making laws, it behooves
you to understand what is going on out in the world, outside
government.''

OSBERT SITWELL 
By Philip Ziegler 
Knopf, 444 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, when Osbert Sitwell, member of a famous
literary family, finished the five volumes of his autobiography,
``Left Hand, Right Hand!'', the books were widely acclaimed not
only as Sitwell's finest works but as one of the masterpieces of
20th-century writing in English. Today most of Sitwell's works,
including the autobiography, remain in print, but only in expensive
library editions available on special order, and it is doubtful
whether many people read them. Currently the most regular royalties
coming into Osbert Sitwell's estate are from the libretto he
compiled for William Walton's oratorio ``Belshazzar's Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   If people don't read the Sitwells much any more, they still seem
to enjoy reading about them, which only seems fitting. The critic
F. R. Leavis's famous judgment is invariably quoted when discussing
the family: ``They belong to the history of publicity, rather than
to that of poetry.'' The Sitwells were adroit self-promoters,
skilled in-fighters, furious defenders of themselves and their
friends; they were also vitriolic and remorseless to those they
perceived as enemies (which sometimes included members of the
family circle). Osbert's ``Who's Who'' entry for 1941 included this
observation: ``For the past 22 years has conducted, in conjunction
with his brother and sister, a series of skirmishes and
hand-to-hand battles against the Philistine. Though outnumbered,
has occasionally succeeded in denting the line; though not without
damage to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sitwells were witty themselves _ Osbert's book about his
travel to China includes a visit to a retirement home for the
imperial eunuchs who reportedly were eager to learn more about a
parallel community of eunuchs in England that they had heard about,
the one in Bloomsbury. And the Sitwells were the cause of wit in
others. Who can forget the novelist Elizabeth Bowen's description
of Dame Edith Sitwell, Osbert's older sister, as ``a high altar on
the move''? And Virginia Woolf once opined, ``I don't care for
Osbert's prose; the rhododendrons grow to such a height in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there have been entertaining books about Dame
Edith and about Sacheverell Sitwell, Osbert's younger brother, as
well as some ``three-way mirror'' studies of the family. Philip
Ziegler, the respected biographer of such figures as Edward VIII
and Mountbatten, felt that the missing biography of Osbert was a
lacuna he wanted to fill, and he has written another entertaining
book about a curious figure who made his reputation as a modernist
but who really belonged, even in his own time, to another age.
</P>
<P>
   Osbert Sitwell was a poet, a short-story writer, a novelist, and
a travel writer as well as an autobiographer. He was a diligent
worker who managed to produce 50 books as well as a prodigious
quantity of journalism (some of it collected into some of the
books) _ and one marvels at his ability to do so, considering his
crowded social schedule and his legendary hospitality; the
continuous family in-fighting across several generations and the
constant literary skirmishes; and the responsibility of running two
vast family estates, Renishaw in England and Montegufoni in Italy,
as well as keeping up a London house; not to mention prolonged
periods of ill health, terminating in a long, dignified, losing
battle against Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Sitwell found a congenial subject when she wrote her book
on ``English Eccentrics''; she came from a family full of them. One
of Ziegler's accomplishments is to produce something complicatedcognizably human from the figure of the patriarch Sir George
Sitwell, so memorably turned into a grotesque comic monster by his
son's autobiography. Certainly Sir George dispensed some rather
peculiar advice to his children. ``Unless you learn to play
ping-pong properly, you can never hope to be a Leader of Men,'' he
told his older son.
</P>
<P>
   Osbert himself grew to be a formidable eccentric, a compendium
of contradictory qualities. Self-educated (as he put it, ``in the
holidays from Eton''), Osbert was remarkably prescient and
well-informed, particularly in the arts; remarkably obtuse and
ignorant in other areas, including politics. He was always enraged
by the accusation of dilettantism, because in many areas he was a
dilettante. The great love of his life was an even greater
dilettante named David Horner, who lived with Osbert for 40 years
and was despised by the other Sitwells, who finally maneuevered him
out of the picture, with Osbert's consent, after Horner had lost
his ``orchidaceous'' looks and youthful charm and had become a
cantankerous and demanding problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler makes no extravagant claims for the quality of Sitwell's
writing, though he admires the autobiography greatly, and a couple
of the short stories, too. He ends up saying that who Sitwell was,
what he represented, was probably as significant as most of what he
wrote. The biographer can be clever, but makes no attempt to
compete with his subjects; he can also be as repetitious as they
were (he likes Virginia Woolf's rhododendron remark so much he
quotes it more than once). Edith, who lived with Osbert for
important periods of her life, pops in occasionally to say
something sybilline but is often conspicuous by her absence;
Sachie, with whom there was much acrimonious correspondence, is a
larger presence. The illustrative photographs are reproduced in a
size too small to make out any detail. Sitwell's friends invariably
report delight in his conversation; the examples quoted in
Ziegler's book sound pompous, alarming, and often unkind. But most
of the way through this book, Ziegler makes it interesting to be in
Sitwell's company, and pleasant to be in his own.

1999: BUZZ, BUSTS, AND SOME BESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Littleton, Colo. slaughter to the war in the Balkans,
from impeachment to Hurricane Floyd, 1999 was the year of the
ominous mega-saga. Behind those headlines, however, here are some
of the people, stories, and scandals that littered the media
landscape in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The overhyped: The Lndependent called the launch of Tina
Brown's Talk magazine, ``the media event of the year, if not the
decade.'' But after the initial buzz over the Hillary Clinton
interview, reaction to Talk has been more like Simon and
Garfunkel's ``Sounds of Silence.'' Brown's reputation as the Queen
Midas of magazines looks to be in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Another magazine about celebrity glitz, 4-year-old George,
seemed doomed when founder John F. Kennedy Jr. died this summer.
Owner Hachette Filipacchi decided to keep publishing. But its
choice of former Money magazine boss Frank Lalli to edit the
struggling George failed to inspire much enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks for ``The Insider,'' _ Michael Mann's movie about
how ``60 Minutes'' wobbled over airing an interview with tobacco
whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand _ came from Mike Wallace, whose ego
was damaged. Typical of films about complicated journalism issues,
however, the public stayed away in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Variety called it ``the most hyped movie in the history of
movies.' '' And the orchestrated orgy of pre-release publicity for
the Star Wars prequel ``Phantom Menace'' turned the media into an
advertising arm of 20th Century Fox. Redefining chutzpah, the
studio griped when three newspapers published early reviews _ two
of them, coincidentally enough, negative.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers, Moves, and Splits: After the $38 billion marriage of
older-skewing CBS and youth-oriented Viacom, some wondered whether
Dan Rather would narrate VH1's hit series ``Behind the Music.''
More ominously, the huge merger is part of the consolidation of
media in the hands of a few powerful mega-corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Further marking the Internet'sascendancy, veteran journalists
Sam Donaldson, Peter Arnett, Lou Dobbs, and Sydney Schanberg
migrated to the realm of ``dot com.'' Actually, that may be a sign
that ``old news'' is wresting control of the cyberspace frontier
away from the Matt Drudges of the world.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years atop the masthead, Mort Zuckerman sold the
Atlantic Monthly to ambitious, but disarmingly modest Washington
businessman David Bradley. Atlantic fans hope Bradley funnels in
the resources and that new editor, political pundit Michael Kelly,
can switch from a Beltway to Beantown mindset.
</P>
<P>
   And it was one of the biggest TV duo breakups this side of
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. In Boston, WCVB-TV's (Channel 5) Chet
Curtis and Natalie Jacobson _ who pioneered the news team-as-family
concept -- announced they would continue to anchor the news
together while separating as a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Losers: An ethical earthquake rocked the Los Angeles Times after
the paper shared profits with the Staples Center sports arena.
Editor Michael Parks and publisher Kathryn Downing look like
they're on the hot seat. But the culprit may be CEO Mark Willes,
who created an atmosphere of intense bottom-line pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Public broadcasting's benign image took a pounding when the
story broke that PBS stations were swapping fund-raising lists with
Democratic Party groups. Long dormant, the old charge of liberal
bias on the taxpayer's dime resurfaced on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiquita Brands lawyer George Ventura sued the Cincinnati
Enquirer, claiming it reneged on a deal to treat him as a
confidential source by revealing his identity to law enforcement
officials. The reporter who supposedly snitched on Ventura, Mike
Gallagher, faced charges of having stolen Chiquita voice mail
messages for his investigative series on the company.
</P>
<P>
   A jury levied a $25 million dollar penalty against ``The Jenny
Jones Show,'' finding it negligent in a murder sparked by a show in
which a man confessed to a secret crush on another man who later
killed him. First Amendment advocates were dismayed, but those fed
up with trash TV thought rough justice was served.
</P>
<P>
   Winners: Crusading Northwestern University professor David
Protess and students in his investigative journalism class scored a
major coup when their sleuthing helped free wrongfully convicted
Anthony Porter, an inmate who had been languishing on Illinois'
death row for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thought to be the only American reporter filing stories from the
war zone in Kosovo for a time, the Los Angeles Times' Paul Watson _
with one Pulitzer already under his belt _ braved life and limb to
file dispatches from a conflict whose coverage suffered from too
little on-the-scene reporting.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Andy Hiller's surprise world affairs quiz for George W.
Bush might have seen like hackneyed ``gotcha' journalism.'' But
almost two months later _ with Bush's gravitas and intellect still
the major campaign issue _ the WHDH-TV (Channel 7) reporter looks
like a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, whether you treat it as a guilty pleasure or the
epitome of everything that's wrong with our culture, People
magazine celebrated its 25th birthday with a 336 page issue. One
small measure of its impact on journalism: A survey showing that
between 1977 and 1997, Time and Newsweek doubled the number of
covers that dealt with sex or celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and a memo to Tina Brown. As one expert warned when she
was starting Talk, the last really successful general interest
magazine launch was People's in 1974.

A MOTHER'S LONG JOURNEY TO SAVE HER BABY'S LIFE

 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The telltale signs of illness were obvious when Ana
Lucia Merida Perez arrived at the emergency room of Children's
Hospital five weeks ago, clutched tightly to her mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   There were her spindly arms and legs, unable to grasp a rattle
or crawl across a floor. There was the long, dark scar stretching
across her stomach, a stark reminder of the hours she spent on an
operating table. And on the back of her tiny scalp, there was the
bald patch in an otherwise wispy, wavy tangle of thin brown hair,
the result of having spent nearly six months lying in a hospital
crib in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, hospital officials anticipate, a much healthier
Perez will be discharged from the hospital with her mother, Mariana
Perez de Merida, who has lived and slept by her 9-month-old
daughter's side since the pair appeared at Children's the day after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   As a medical mecca, Boston draws ailing pilgrims from all over
the world, many of whom come to the city's teaching hospitals with
little more than the clothes on their backs _ and a burning hope
that a life can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with Perez and her mother, who traveled here
to seek treatment for the infant's intestinal disorder and cystic
fibrosis, a chronic inherited disease that causes a range of
respiratory and digestive problems. The conditions had been
diagnosed by Guatemalan doctors, who advised Merida and her husband
to simply wait for their child to die.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the infant was admitted to Children's Hospital, she
had already endured two intestinal surgeries and two incidents of
cardiac arrest, battled bronchial pneumonia, and been catheterized
eight times. For all those reasons, she had failed to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Perez taken when she was 3 months old shows a plump,
double-chinned baby with fat cheeks, chubby thighs and a full head
of hair. Today, there is a sharpness to her facial features, and
her lean, scarecrow-like limbs are dwarfed by a Winnie the Pooh
sleeper speckled with little yellow bees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Perez, who was born on March 5, now weighs nine pounds _
four less than she did six months ago, but two more than last
month. With her mother's help, she can finally stand. And
Wednesday, in a hospital room filled with balloons, stuffed animals
and Christmas cards, she gripped a small toy dog firmly while
nibbling intently on its rubber ears.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perez, who was suffering from malnutrition when she
arrived in Boston, faces a lifetime of dependency on medication and
supplemental enzymes. For now, an intravenous tube inserted in her
chest pumps antibiotics into her fragile body. A tube in her
abdomen sends food directly to her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for her daughter's medical bills, Merida, 25, has
applied for financial assistance through the hospital's free-care
program, which will provide $28 million in public subsidies this
year. And hospital social workers are trying to secure specialty
services that will help the family build a temporary life in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Merida and her husband have appealed to family
members, friends and charitable organizations for aid, and mother
and daughter will stay with a relative in Revere once they are
discharged from the hospital. Their flight to Boston was paid for
by the company where Merida and her husband have worked for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Merida, who has a 10-year visa and speaks little English, hopes
to stay in the United States permanently, where advanced medical
care will be readily available if her daughter's condition worsens.
She would like her husband, Jose Francisco, 31, and their two other
children to join them eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have plans to come here,'' said Merida, speaking
through an interpeter. ``I know a lot of people think we may want
to stay to take advantage of the situation, but I just want to take
care of what's necessary.''

THE INS AND OUTS OF 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it ends, and not a nanosecond too soon. The Second Millennium
(Early Edition). Nine hundred and 99 years of conquest, inquest,
calamity, celebrity, heroism, despotism, genius, meanness, sin,
spin, and Regis Philbin. Yee haw.
</P>
<P>
   With the calendar ready to roll over to Y-2-0-0-0 Friday night,
the gods must be asking: Is that your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   Yeaaahhh baby! And if the power doesn't go out, we'll plug in a
year that can hold a candle to any of 'em, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Clues'' in! Booze cruise out! Feng shui in! Dung art
out! E-tailing in! Retailing out!
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' in! ``West Side Story'' out! Dixie Chicks in!
Two Chicks Dishing out! Mini-Me in! ``Leprechauns'' out!
</P>
<P>
   Slightly fictionalized presidential biographies in! Possibly
fictionalized presidential-hopeful biographies out!
</P>
<P>
   Y'all had to live through it to believe it. And even then, 1999
was a bigger mystery than George W. Bush's ``young and
irresponsible'' years.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon-mania was in, and Tinky Winky was outed. Chet and Nat
were on the outs, but Bruce and the E Street Band were back in
tune. Woodstock '99ers took out their lighters and torched the
whole peace-and-love thing. US bombers took out a Chinese embassy
not listed on Hertz's map of downtown Belgrade. Conversely, Chinese
ideograms were explosively in. So was Rage Against the Machine,
although road rage was hopefully out.
</P>
<P>
   This was some fun-filled fin de siecle, huh? Hannibal (The
Cannibal) Lecter dined in style, again. Harry Potter invaded the
nation's bookshelves. Carly Fiorina was installed in
Hewlett-Packard's executive suite. Norman Rockwell and Carlos
Santana were surprisingly back in fashion. Martha Stewart was in
the money after her handsomely accessorized public offering. Marv
Albert was back, but not back-biting, in the broadcast booth.
</P>
<P>
   Zero had a numerically super-in annum. Ditto for cargo (pants),
video (digital), Crespo (Elvis), Sopranos (HBO's), and techno. O,
behave!
</P>
<P>
   The New Sincerity was in. And we really, really mean that.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, two Mars space probes faded out of radio
contact. Talk magazine ran out of buzz. Minority characters were
left out of too many network shows. Stephen King and Tom Gordon ran
out of good karma, both landing on the disabled list. Dan (The Man)
Quayle dropped out of the presidential race. Dr. C. Everett Koop
dropped out of the sainthood sweepstakes. The Imus Book Awards went
out of business, and the I-Man's show got broomed out of WEEI's
line-up. In its stead: guy radio, TV morning-show wars, and (yawn)
``Later Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' is bowing out after 50 years on the comics page.
Aarrggh! Bill Gates took out ads explaining how Microsoft really,
really did not mean to crush its competitors like cockroaches. John
Martorano ratted out his former cronies. Good luck to you and the
ex, John!
</P>
<P>
   As if heads weren't spinning fast enough already, the planet
welcomed in its 6 billionth citizen in 1999. Other Earthlings
enjoying in-type years were gadfly historian Howard Zinn, la vida
loca hunk Ricky Martin, dot.com mogul Jeff Bezos, tennis star
Serena Williams, novelist Ha Jin, filmmaker Spike Jonze,
cyber-heroine Lara Croft, designer Stella McCartney, actress
Julianne Moore, columnist Gail Collins, bicyclist Lance Armstrong,
essayist Jedediah Purdy, media don Mel Karmazin, supermodel Gisele,
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, opera singer Andrea Bocelli, and
deceased comedian Andy Kaufman, untombed in two separate forms of
biography.
</P>
<P>
   Out to pasture, meanwhile, were councilor at large Albert
(Dapper) O'Neil, columnist A.M. Rosenthal, Hollywood memoirist
Eddie Fisher, designer Bill Blass, CBS sportscaster Sean McDonough,
tennis star Steffi Graf, WHDH-TV news director Mark Berryhill,
Atlantic editor William Whitworth, ``Firing Line'' host William F.
Buckley Jr., Howard Stern's marriage, the Beanie Babies craze, the
New England Patriots' offense, the keys to the Panama Canal, the
Celtics' parquet floor, and Pamela Anderson Lee's breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   Just in from the travel desk: Chappaqua in, Chechnya, out.
</P>
<P>
   In the winner's circle this year were a pair of talented
Duncans, hoop star Tim and ``Green Mile'' actor Michael Clarke. The
Rocks were more like in (comedian Chris and the WWF guy) and out
(rapper Kid). Ditto for a couple of motor-mouth Lauras (Ingraham
in, Schlessinger out). The US Women's World Cup squad was tops
(and, on occasion, topless) in our hearts, and Pedro Martinez
should have been tops in the AL MVP voting. But no sports drama was
as incredible as the Ryder Cup finish.
</P>
<P>
   To get your props in 1999, you might have tried one or more of
these: day trading, pashmina wearing, carbo-dieting, dancing on
Wepa! Wednesday, swallowing SAMe, eating tubular yogurt, creating a
millennial Web site, toting a Fendi baguette, undergoing a Naomi
Wolf personality makeover, constructing a safe room, growing
heirloom tomatoes, playing cover-two defense, converting to Linux,
moving to Chelsea, dining at No. 9 Park, or claiming solidarity
with Generation N.
</P>
<P>
   Out activities, on the other hand, included most any of the
following: championing creationism, running Reebok, curating a
Museum of Fine Arts department, downloading porn on your Harvard
computer, catching the West Nile virus, giving generously to
Hillsdale College, investing in Planet Hollywood, serving underage
drinkers at the Paradise Club, bidding on a supermodel egg,
preferring Garth Brooks as a rock singer, predicting ``Deuce
Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' had Oscar potential, shilling over erectile
dysfunction, conducting a listening tour of upstate New York, or
dating Michael Douglas on the pretext that he's ``younger than
Kirk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deepening millennial twilight, we light one last candle
for some great ones who passed away this year: William Alfred, Doug
Sahm, George V. Higgins, Josepr, George C. Scott, Quentin
Crisp, Art Farmer, Gene Siskel, Mel Torme, Joe Williams, Rick
Danko, Stanley Kubrick, Paul Bowles, Mario Puzo, Saul Steinberg,
Iris Murdoch, Yehudi Menuhin, Horst, Dusty Springfield, Hoyt Axton,
Al Hirt, Jose Quintero, Curtis Mayfield, Meg Greenfield, Shel
Silverstein, Madeline Kahn, Andre Dubus, John F. Kennedy Jr., and
Leonard Zakim.

A YEAR OF UGLY LIBERAL SLURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the wave of outrage that swept the nation after
Charlton Heston, the president of the National Rifle Association,
told a radio interviewer that the best way to deal with liberal
filmmaker Spike Lee would be to ``shoot him with a .44-caliber
Bulldog'' revolver? Remember the scathing editorials and the
full-page ads blasting Heston's appalling remark?
</P>
<P>
   You don't remember? Don't feel bad. It never happened. Heston
never said that about Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said it about Heston.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking in May, just a few weeks after the slaughter in
Littleton, Colo. Asked for his thoughts on Heston, Lee recommended
assassinating him with a .44 special. A conservative who made such
a comment about a liberal would have been crushed under an
avalanche of denunciation. But when a liberal talks that way about
a conservative, the media rarely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to my yearly column on liberal hate speech and the
double standard that shields it. By ``hate speech,'' I don't mean
language that is merely insulting. When Rosie O'Donnell, hosting a
Hillary Clinton fund-raiser in October, described Rudolph Giuliani
as New York's ``village idiot'' and compared his looks to ``a Pez
dispenser,'' she was simply being obnoxious. But when liberals
liken conservatives to Hitler, or call for them to be killed _
that's hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only Spike Lee who advocates death for those who have
the temerity to hold non-left-wing views.
</P>
<P>
   --When Elia Kazan, the bete noir of Hollywood's aging Reds, was
awarded the Oscar for lifetime achievement, the haters were out in
force. ``I'll be watching, hoping someone shoots him,'' said
Abraham Polonsky, who was blacklisted for his Communist sympathies
in the 1950s. ``It would no doubt be a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Washington Post's Richard Cohen commented on the fact that
Newt Gingrich was cheating on his wife even as he was denouncing
Bill Clinton's moral failings. ``For hypocrisy, for sheer gall,''
Cohen wrote, ``Gingrich should be hanged.''
</P>
<P>
   --Even the comics aren't free of death threats. The main
character in Aaron McGruder's ``Boondocks'' is Huey, a militant
black student. In one strip, Huey considers titles for his report
on ``the black neoconservative movement and its most famous
champion.'' His first choice: ``Ward Connerly Should Be Beaten by
Raekwon the Chef With a Spiked Bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Central to the leftist mentality is the belief that conservative
opinions are not simply misguided, they'r Conservatives are
not erring brethren to be reasoned with, they're moral heretics to
be cursed. And so liberals routinely reach for vicious epithets
when talking about nonliberals: Nazis, racists, the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative legal interest groups,'' says Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell, ``such as the Center for Individual Rights and the
Southeastern Legal Foundation'' _ which oppose racial preferences
and quotas _ ``are . . . a homogenized version of the Klan. They
may have traded in their sheets for suits . . ., but it's the same
old racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's archliberal Eleanor Clift was one of many who erupted
with venom when Bill Clinton was impeached. ``That herd of managers
from the House,'' she hissed in January, ``I mean, frankly all they
were missing was white sheets. They're like night riders. . .'' The
left-leaning Arkansas Times spat poison at the independent counsel.
``Kenneth Starr,'' the paper editorialized, ``is cunning, ruthless,
and about as well-mannered as Heinrich Himmler.'' In the Los
Angeles Times, Karen Grigsby Bates wrote, ``Whenever I hear Trent
Lott speak, I immediately think of nooses decorating trees. Big
trees, with black bodies swinging. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonist Paul Conrad, also of the L.A. Times, drew a sketch of
Buford Furrow _ the bigot who opened fire in a Jewish community
center, then murdered a Filipino mailman _ and labeled it: ``A
faith-based compassionate conservative.'' Republicans opposing a
minimum wage hike, charged US Representative Major Owens of New
York, are like foreign leaders who support ``ethnic cleansing'' _
i.e., mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the proposal in Florida to raise funds for
adoption agencies through a new specialty license plate bearing the
logo ``Choose Life.'' There are already 45 such plates, which
promote everything from protecting dolphins to Special Olympics.
But a prolife message was too much for state Senator Skip Campbell,
who fretted that senators would next be asked to approve a plate
reading ``Be a Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer filth, nothing in 1999 topped Salon's hate-filled
attack on Ann Coulter, a well-known Washington lawyer and Clinton
critic. In June, Coulter wrote a nonpolitical column lamenting the
state of romance in Washington. Soon after, the Web magazine Salon,
an avidly pro-Clinton publication, launched a malignant personal
attack. It purported to offer 11 tips for improving her love life.
Among them: ``Quit injecting yourself with your own urine,'' ``Stop
being a mean bitch,'' and ``Get your head out of your ass.'' It
urged her to tape a sign in her kitchen reading, ``Men don't want
to date castrating bitches.'' And that's not to mention the stuff
that can't be repeated in a daily paper.
</P>
<P>
   If a conservative Web site had hurled such vileness at, say,
Cheryl Mills, Clinton's young attorney, there would have been a
furious outcry. It would have become a national scandal. Pundits
and talk show hosts would have torn the web site to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   But Salon is liberal and Coulter is not. So nobody said a thing.

(DW) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every once in a while that waitress serving you
coffee really does become a star. That's what is happening to Amy
Spanger, whose theater-district resume includes more than one stint
at McHale's at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   These days Ms. Spanger, 28, is working one block south of
McHale's and just west of Eighth, at the Martin Beck Theater, where
she has received critical and audience acclaim for her performance
as Lois Lane, the freewheeling and easy-living cabaret singer
turned thespian in the hit Broadway revival of the 1948 Cole
Porter-Sam and Bella Spewack musical, ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Brantley in The New York Times hailed Ms. Spanger as a
``fresh young star in the making'' who gets three of the evening's
best songs (``Why Can't You Behave?,'' ``Tom, Dick or Harry'' and
``Always True to You'') and ``lands each of them with a sharp-edged
sensuality that turns her gold-digging archetype into something
newly minted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her publicist's office, Ms. Spanger, a native of
Newbury, Mass., remembered the morning after opening night in
mid-November when, after seven years on the theater scene in New
York doing what so many others do in their attempt to make it in
show business, she achieved her overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was in town, and we all had breakfast together,''
she said. ``I hadn't seen the papers. I woke up really late. My
boyfriend came over. My brother was there, and my parents. We all
read the reviews together. Everyone was just so happy. They said,
`You finally got your break.' I got so many phone calls. My
dressing room was filled with flowers. It was a dream. It still is.
I feel like Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' stars Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie
as Fred Graham and Lilli Vanessi, divorced actors who get together
again to try out a new musical in Baltimore based on Shakespeare's
``Taming of the Shrew.'' The director is Michael Blakemore and the
choreographer Kathleen Marshall. ``They took a chance on me,'' Ms.
Spanger said. ``I hadn't done a lot of work in New York. And I'm so
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger's dream began in Newbury, a small town north of
Boston, where she grew up the middle child of three. ``I don't have
the accent,'' she said. ``I lost it. My parents have it, though.''
Her father, Stephen Sr., is the head of guidance at a high school;
her mother, Nancy, is the director of sales for a cosmetics
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger always performed in school plays, among them a
musical ``Christmas Carol'' in the sixth grade, playing a female
Scrooge. She started training as a dancer at 16 _ ``kind of late,''
she said _ and after high school attended the University of
Massachusetts as a theater major. ``But I dropped out after a
year,'' she said. ``I didn't like being in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Where she wanted to be was New York, to follow a classic route
from small town to success in the big city. So, seven years ago, at
age 21, she found a roommate and moved to 108th Street and
Broadway. ``I knew one person in New York,'' she said. ``I met her
at a party and moved in with her. My parents put the furniture from
my bedroom at home into the back of a truck and took me to
Manhattan. I started waiting tables, going to auditions, taking
dance and acting classes, studying voice. And within two and a half
months I got my first stage job.''
</P>
<P>
   That first gig was as Cassie in a regional-theater production of
``A Chorus Line.'' Next came dinner theater in Westchester, then a
bus-and-truck tour of ``A Chorus Line,'' then a small role as a
cockney newsboy in a production of ``Jekyll and Hyde.'' Then she
was hired as an understudy on Broadway _ for the role of Betty
Schaefer, the pretty young screenwriter who makes Norma Desmond
jealous in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' ``I went on a couple of times,''
Ms. Spanger said. ``It was my first Broadway show.''
</P>
<P>
   She did a workshop in Toronto on an early version of ``Fosse.''
Then she auditioned for the first national tour of ``Rent.'' ``When
I got back from Toronto, I didn't have a job,'' she said. ``So I
started waiting tables again at McHale's,'' a mecca for Broadway
stagehands. ``I worked at McHale's on and off for about a year.
It's an easy place to work. Burgers and beers.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the waiting on tables was short term. ``The first day
back I got `Rent.' So I left.'' After ``Rent'' came ``Chicago,'' a
small role on Broadway, understudying Roxie Hart and Velma, and
eventually playing Roxie in the national tour for three months.
``And then I got `Kiss Me, Kate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger auditioned for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' more than once,
beginning about a year ago. ``I had what I thought was a great
audition, and they brought me back four or five months later,'' she
said. ``I remember seeing Sharon Lawrence at the audition and
thinking that she's going to get it. And she did. But then her TV
series was picked up, so they had me come in and audition again.
And I went back and nailed it.'' (The series for Ms. Lawrence,
known on television as the wife of Detective Andy Sipowicz on
``NYPD Blue,'' was ``Ladies' Man'' on CBS.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger said she loved the character of Lois, the second
banana to Lilli, and she doubles as Bianca in the ``Kiss Me, Kate''
version of ``Shrew'' and uses time-honored ways to get ahead but is
always true to her men, in her fashion. ``I had a great time
researching her,'' she said. ``I watched a bunch of Judy Holliday
films to get the feeling for that kind of edgy ingenue, someone
lacking in craft but who gets away with a lot nonetheless. She uses
her sexuality to her advantage, but it's a survival mechanism. She
sleeps with guys to get ahead, and she doesn't see anything wrong
with it. It's just how she's approached life.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing 5 feet 5 inches, Ms. Spanger has blue eyes and blond
hair with streaks of black. Her fingernails are painted an orangey
red with pink and gold flecks. ``This is my Lois color,'' she said.
``It's very garish.'' Onstage as Lois, her hair is red, a wig
created, she said, ``because they wanted to have a very distinct
contrast between Marin's blond hair and me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial idea, from seeing all the classic ditzes, was that
Lois should be platinum blond, maybe short and kinky hair,'' she
said. ``But the second I put on the wig and costumes I felt, there
she is. It made total sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger said she adored the wit and sophistication of the
Porter lyrics and how perfectly they defined Lois' character, but
she wants to be clear: Lois and she are not alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a similarity between us in that she's more street
smart than book smart,'' she said. ``And at times I can be a bit of
a ditz, and I can be a total goof. But I think I'm a pretty equal
combination of goofball and very serious person. And I also think I
have an ability to laugh at myself, which is important in this
business because it can get to be such a grind, with people
constantly telling you no. It's important to be able to laugh at
them and laugh at yourself.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger, who still lives on the Upper West Side, has classic
goals: television and movies and more theater. ``I'd love to play
Charity in `Sweet Charity' and Sally Bowles in `Cabaret,''' she
said. ``And I've always pictured myself having a television variety
show like Tracey Ullman's, doing all those different characters.''
</P>
<P>
   She would like to marry and eventually be a mother. Her
boyfriend of three years is an actor. ``It's like a roller coaster,
us both being in this business,'' she said. ``But we're both
becoming more established, so it gets a little bit easier. There's
more money, and we're both working in the city now.'' (She won't
mention his name, she said, because ``we want to keep our
identities separate.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is he a candidate for husband? ``I think so,'' she said. ``Yeah.
He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds, personally or professionally, it's
clear that Ms. Spanger, unlike Lois, won't settle for any Tom, Dick
or Harry _ Tom, Harry or Dick.

LAND ROVER DISCOVERY II: A TRUE OFF-ROAD VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fire up the engine and the noise up front is loud _ rumbling and
rattling.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside and your feet meet thick, industrial-weight rubber
floormats.
</P>
<P>
   Look about as you bump along the road and realize you are in a
big, rolling box.
</P>
<P>
   This is a luxury SUV? Yes and, thankfully, no.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover Discovery II, gussied up as it is with leather,
pretty paint, and a certan cachet that appeals to urban-dwellers
who like to look back-woods-weekend tough, is at its heart a true
SUV _ as in a vehicle that belongs in mud, on rocks, slashing
through brush, scrambling up and down steep slopes. It is too bad
that so few of them get used the way this vehicle is meant to be
used because off road it is very good.
</P>
<P>
   Sit high in the driver's seat, grip the thick steering wheel,
obviously made to be held tight in tough driving, and look about
you. The outside view, through tall, wide glass all around, is
expansive. No little car is going to sneak up on your rear
quarterpanel in this rig. You won't be backing into unseen trees in
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover has come a long way since its introduction at the
Amsterdam Auto Show in 1948 as a permanent-four-wheel-drive box
with a canvas roof and doors as optional equipment. Rover is owned
by the BMW group now and new technology aimed at taking out the
inherent dangers of operating SUVs, on highways and off road, is
abundant. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   First, get used to the big box you are driving.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-covered front seats are easy-chair big, firm at
thigh, side and back. The rear seat _ two adults with a child in
the middle _ is equally comfortable, and leg space is ample. In the
rear cargo compartment, two optional folding jump seats _ front
facing _ are ready for the odd times you'll need to carry seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   All gauges and controls are big and simple, from fog lamps and
wipers to the button that opens the gas-cap door. Cruise control
and audio volume are controlled with buttons on the steering wheel,
cutting down on distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space abounds in the form of bins, both deep and
shallow. Bins in the doors, a big bin between the front seats,
trays lined with rubber nubs tucked all over the place. Maps,
compasses, sunglasses, and anything else you need for travel or
off-road treks all have a place.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road driving can mean extremes in weather, and the Discovery
has one of the most powerful heaters I have encountered, a virtual
furnace when cranked high. For hot treks, the air conditioning is
powerful as well, with optional rear AC a boon for those at the
back of the box.
</P>
<P>
   I have read some complaints that the Discovery's 4.0-liter V8 is
not powerful enough. Hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   This SUV cruises easily well above the speed limit _ and far
faster than you should drive an SUV anyway. Further, off-road
driving is not about powering your way over or through anything.
It's about deft, steady, and often slow application of torque to
overcome whatever challenge the vehicle faces. And with 250 lb. ft.
of torque _ available over a very wide band of RPMs _ the Discovery
has plenty of what it needs. Combined off road and on, it averaged
15.6 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This test car went up a stack of 16-inch logs without rolling
one of them. It climbed a wet and slippery rock face. It climbed
hills so steep that only sky appeared in the windshield; held
itself back on hills so steep it felt like the bumper was going to
plant itself in the ground at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   This latter feat was aided by Rover's Hill Descent Control
system, which monitors the speed of each wheel and automatically
applies brakes to assist engine braking.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is a permanent-four-wheel-drive vehicle and uses a
two-speed transfer box to move between high and low range and a
four-speed automatic transmission with sport and manual modes.
Sport mode gives quicker downshifts and delayed upshifts for better
performance, while manual lets you do the choosing in off-road
situations, taking over and downshifting only if it senses you are
about to stall in the midst of a slow crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Rover has equipped the Discovery with four-wheel electronic
traction control and ABS and, in a step that all SUV manufacturers
should take, has added what the company calls Active Cornering
Enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs, with high centers of gravity and weight sitting up high,
are prone to go out of control or roll over in tight turns at
speed. ACE, as Rover has dubbed its system, is aimed at preventing
this.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is simple.
</P>
<P>
   When an SUV turns, weight gets shifted, sometimes dramatically.
Springs and shocks stretch on one side, compress on another. Energy
is stored and then released from turn to turn. Sometimes this is
bad. What ACE does is watch for lateral body movement in corners
and then actively counteracts it. It does this by applying torque
hydraulically to torsion bars. This virtually eliminates lean at
lower speeds (Rover says lateral body movement is eliminated up to
0.4 Gs of force) and significantly reduce it at higher speeds and
more G forces.
</P>
<P>
   Its effects were quite noticeable both on the highway, where
deliberate weaving in and out of traffic (not recommended in most
SUVs) was done with grace and little sense of lateral stress. Off
road, turns that should have been funky were smoothed by the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge numbers of Discoverys you see in urban
settings, this is a true off-road performer. Solid axles front and
rear. Twin forged steel radius arms, dampers, and coil springs up
front give it both highway stability and the long wheel travel
needed off road.
</P>
<P>
   Forged steel trailing arms are coupled with either optional
self-leveling shocks or coil springs at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and passengers are protected by dual front airbags, firm
headrests all around, a collapsible, compartmentalized aluminum
frame designed to absorb the energy of a crash, a steel cage
underbody, and door-mounted side impact beams.
</P>
<P>
   Steel? Industrial rubber? Cages and impact beams? Grinding over
rocks and logs? Rolling smoothly down the highway? Is it chi-chi
urban status symbol or true off-road warrior?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The thin bins on the ceiling above the front sun visors. Good
for maps, wallets, other flat items. Good use of space usually
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   --Those big, fat visors block the sun from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The gas cap. Crank this way, crank that way, count the turns,
count the clicks. It is too tough to operate. &QL;

A SCREEN SAVER FOR THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   What gift can anyone give you that's better than a great idea?
</P>
<P>
   My friend Lynn and I went to a lecture by a Hasidic rabbi named
Laibl Wolf. The topic was ``Practical Kabbalah: Jewish Wisdom for
Everyday Life,'' and as a way of involving his audience, the rabbi
asked us to visualize something positive that had happened
recently.
</P>
<P>
   I riffled through the day's memories. Earlier I'd stopped by my
daughter's house to find that my 5-year-old grandson had brought
home a lantern he'd made at school. It was a tall paper cylinder
painted yellow and closed at the bottom, with a string across the
top. Inside, a candle was stuck into half a potato with the flat
side down. Danny had hung his lantern from a small branch, and he
was so proud of his creation that after we turned off all the
lights in the house, his mother, his sister, and I followed Danny
in a parade from room to room.
</P>
<P>
   Following Rabbi Wolf's suggestion, I recalled the way the
lantern had swayed back and forth, creating a glowing circle around
Danny. I saw the light gleaming in his eyes and reflecting off his
face so that in the quiet house he shone every bit as bright as the
candle. It was a moment worth preserving, though I hadn't known it
until that minute.
</P>
<P>
   It pleased me immensely to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now take your image and turn it into a screen saver for your
mind,'' the rabbi said. ``Make it your default program so that when
you're at rest, or your mind is filling up with trivial worries,
you can take it out and calm yourself, and remember the beauty of
your life.''
</P>
<P>
   I caught my breath. What an excellent idea to take this precious
moment and preserve it. I could set it like a jewel in my memory
instead of allowing it to vanish into my mind's vast reservoir of
past experiences. The rabbi's idea reminded me of a story I'd heard
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An English friend of Lynn's had come to visit, bringing her
mother along. They'd spent the weekend together, laughing and going
to the beach, before the mother had returned to England. Several
years later, Lynn learned that her friend's mother had later
contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, an illness that left her
completely paralyzed for nearly a month. While she lay in bed
unable to move, the woman reviewed her life in her mind's eye and
found that she gravitated toward images from her many vacations.
She particularly enjoyed recalling her visit to Marblehead, she
told her daughter when she recovered, and had returned to those
memories again and again.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trick not dissimilar from this one, and it seemed to
have preserved her sanity.
</P>
<P>
   I made a point of visualizing Danny and his lantern before I
went to bed that night, and again while impatiently waiting in a
Christmas shopping line, but it immediately occurred to me that the
screen saver on my computer has more than one picture to choose
from. Why couldn't I collect an image a day and build up a
repertoire of happy scenes? I could even write them down so that I
wouldn't lose track of them.
</P>
<P>
   I began right away. When Jack and I went to visit my sister and
her husband in Chatham on Cape Cod, we went to the beach. There we
came across a man with a telescope trained on a group of merganser
ducks. He let me peek and, for the first time, I saw these handsome
little brown creatures take what looked like a joyful hop into the
air before diving out of sight. I was entranced. That night, the
mergansers dived and dived on my screen saver before I fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   At this darkest time of the year, I seem to be saving scenes of
light _ the moon, bright as a high-intensity headlamp, hovering
over the solstice ceremony at our Unitarian Church, and the
sanctuary lit only by candles as we sang ``Silent Night'' on
Christmas Eve. I stored away the sight of my dog greeting me, his
brown body wagging like a stuffed sausage to the tune of his tail.
I memorized my daughter Julie's face as she said a last goodbye
before boarding a plane with her husband to visit her in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   At bedtime, it turns out, savoring these images is a wonderful
way to release the cares of the day. I skim over my worries and my
usual litany of self-criticism to alight on one lovely moment after
another. Instead of fretting, I feel as if my senses have been
soothed by my attention to some blessed moments that would
otherwise slip away.
</P>
<P>
   A new day, a new year, a new millennium begins, giving us this
choice: Open ourselves to the wonder of the world or lie down alone
in darkness.

HOW TO STOP WINDOWS FROM FOGGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. There are a lot of old aluminum triple-track storms on our
1814 house. Every morning, there is a goodly amount of condensation
on the inside of the storm, and sometimes on the inside of the main
window. I have checked the weep holes in the storms, and they are
open. Now what can I do to get rid of that moisture?
</P>
<P>
   ANN STEWART, Francistown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the moisture is there in the morning, wait until
afternoon. That is our little ``Ho-ho-ho'' for the holiday. It's an
old story, but we are repeating it because of your clear question
and because other people have the same problem. The story might be
old hat to some but it certainly is not to those who have the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   There are several factors affecting the moisture that is
condensing on your windows. There is a lot of water vapor in the
house, created by breathing, washing, cooking, and bathing. It
builds up because your house is tight (a pretty good thing for an
1814 house). The vapor accumulates until the air becomes saturated
and cannot hold more, at which point the moisture condenses on any
cool surface. Usually this is the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, the condensation is on the inside of the
storm, because the main window is leaking air. The open weep holes
in the storm frame are supposed to release that water vapor, but if
there is too much of it, the weep holes don't do their job. The
cure is to weatherstrip the main window, so that less air escapes.
</P>
<P>
   When the inside of the main window has condensation, it means
that the windows are tight, the water vapor cannot escape, and the
window is the target of the condensation. The cure there is to
reduce the water vapor in the house. Not by dehumidifiers, but by
opening windows for 10 minutes morning and afternoon. There will be
very little loss of heat if you do this.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: People usually find the second-story windows do
most of the fogging up. That is because moist air rises. If the
condensation is minor, and is not dripping on the wood and rotting
it away, you may want to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you pull the shades down at night, you may be
aggravating the situation by trapping moist air between shade and
glass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to bring more light into my finished basement, which
is lighted only by those high, shallow, narrow windows. What if I
cut those openings deeper in the concrete foundation, put in longer
windows, and then window wells. I saw some kits in stores for
window wells.
</P>
<P>
   LARRY SHAW, Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, no, a thousand times! If you only knew how many times I
am asked why window wells are leaking water, and everything is a
mess both outside and in the basement. It is a noble idea, and more
light would be appreciated in the basement, but consider, first,
the cost, not only of the windows but also of cutting concrete;
more than $200 per cut. Second, consider the nuisance of window
wells, which could leak and fill with debris (and water,
sometimes), although window well covers can take care of some of
these problems.
</P>
<P>
   You could compensate for the lack of light by putting in
fluorescent lighting.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you have a one-story house, you could put in Solar
Tubes, which are tube-shaped skylights; the hollow shafts of these
skylights could go from the roof through the attic, and through a
closet or similar hiding place to end up in the basement, bringing
light and ventilation. They are not inexpensive, but are an option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last winter, I went away for three months, leaving the
thermostat at 55 degrees. There was no change in the heating bill.
What if I turned it down this winter to 50? Would that invite
freezing of pipes?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Turning the thermostat as low as possible is unlikely to
cause freezing of pipes, but it might not save much in heating
costs, either. However, it would not hurt to do so _ and, if
possible, have a house sitter check the house several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of saving fuel last winter might be due to the vagaries
of the weather. Short of turning down the heat, your alternatives
are shutting everything down, draining the water (and water
heater), and putting nontoxic antifreeze in the heating system (if
you have hot-water heat).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a product I could use on a varnished woodwork that
is alligatoring? How can I redo the finish without stripping it,
and what can I use to strip it if I have to?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA MACKEY, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might try the Formsby method, which reconstitutes the
finish. There are several different kits on the market. The easiest
finish to reconstitute is shellac.
</P>
<P>
   Varnish is more difficult to handle, and usually has to be
stripped. Indoors, I suggest you use a power sander to strip to the
bare wood. Then you can refinish with stain and/or polyurethane
varnish. I suggest using oil-based polyurethane; it gives better
results, in the handyman's opinion.

<P>
   The last 1,000 years in horticulture have been like the last
1,000 years in medicine, weaponry, communications, or most other
fields of human endeavor. With few exceptions, it's business as
usual for 900 years. Then with the arrival of modern technology in
the 20th century, all heck breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1000. With papermaking and printing well established in
China, the world's most advanced culture, botanical and
horticultural monography enter a golden age under the Song dynasty.

with rare plants, until the dynasty's final overthrow by the
Mongols in 1279.
</P>

spoiling called the ``Flavr Savr,'' is approved for sale in the
United States. It's a commercial failure, but soon hundreds of
other crops with genes borrowed from bacteria, viruses, insects,
and animals are in the approval pipeline of the US Agriculture
Department, including tomatoes with Arctic fish genes to make them
more cold-resistant. Not any, so far, have been rejected, despite
some scientists' charges of inadequate testing by applicants. The
European Union proceeds much more cautiously, approving only three
genetically altered maize crops for farming.
</P>
<P>
   --1997. Monsanto registers vegetables carrying insect-killing
genes as insecticides with the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Opponents worry about the accidental creation of resistant pests

FAITH, STRENGTH SUSTAIN US THROUGH PAST AND INTO THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we enter the year 2000, all of us are looking back a bit. And
we also are looking forward.
</P>
<P>
   My most unforgettable event of the last year of the 20th century
was sitting inside Wedgwood Baptist Church as people sang, prayed
and worshipped, ignoring the bullet holes in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The invincible spirit of Al Meredith, pastor of the church, and
his congregation members in the aftermath of the shooting rampage
inside their Fort Worth church that took eight lives _ including
that of the shooter _ is imprinted on my heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   In confronting that mind-boggling tragedy, Meredith and church
members, incredibly, found ways to be cordial and friendly with
everyone _ even the news media. And the church's young people wrote
messages of forgiveness to Larry Gene Ashbrook, who killed seven
people before taking his own life.
</P>
<P>
   Those messages still exist on the concrete underneath the new
carpeting that had to be installed after the bloody catastrophe.
The church has recovered, though some members still have nightmares
and jump when doors slam. Meredith may be crying inside. But he has
smiled through it all.
</P>
<P>
   He has more requests to speak than he can fill. If you watch
Saturday's Cotton Bowl football game between the University of
Texas and the University of Arkansas, you might catch Meredith
leading the prayer before the game starts.
</P>
<P>
   During my 20 years as a religion writer, there have been other
assignments that I will remember long into the 21st century. Some
of them include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Following Pope John Paul II on some of his many travels. The
first time I covered one of the pope's journeys was in 1983, when
he traveled through war-torn Central America. He faced down
protesters during a memorable Mass in Managua, Nicaragua. At the
time he was a rather vigorous pope, fully recovered from an
assassination attempt in Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching the rise and fall of television evangelists in the
1980s, including Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker and Robert Tilton.
Those men are still preaching, though to smaller audiences. Many
other TV preachers are thriving, including the colorful Benny Hinn,
who moved his headquarters to the Fort Worth-Dallas area last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seeing the surprising emergence of the so-called religious
right. Many were
</P>
<P>
   troubled by the high profile of fundamentalist ministers such as
Jerry Falwell who created the Moral Majority and turned to
politics. I helped cover Christian television network owner Pat
Robertson's unsuccessful run for the presidency. Now Americans take
the presence of religious conservatives in politics for granted.
Political conservatives will be taking a major role in the coming
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Covering the frustrating, never-ending struggle by many
denominations over the proper way to deal with gays and lesbians in
their midst. Few of the mainline Christian denominations have
settled questions about whether gays should be ordained as
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching the Southern Baptist Convention split between
moderates and conservatives. Although still the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, the highly benevolent denomination of 15.7
million members has gained an image of hostility and infighting
that has hurt its work. The image belies the fact that thousands of
Baptist churches clothe and feed the hungry and minister to people
rich and poor, helping them cope with deaths of loved ones, divorce
or loss of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seeing the dramatic rise of Islam in the United States and
discovering that few people, including myself, knew much about this
major world religion.
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable experience last year was a pilgrimage I took
to historic civil rights sites in Georgia and Alabama. I went along
with Southern Baptists who laid a wreath in front of the church in
Birmingham, Ala., where four young girls attending Sunday school
were killed by a bomb planted by white supremacists in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   We also visited Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery,
Ala., where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was pastor during the
time of the bus boycott that marked the beginning of the civil
rights movement. Early in my reporting days, I also saw King
address a national Southern Baptist Convention in Atlantic City,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One of my best memories of 1999 was being able to chat with
George Beverly Shea, the soloist for raham, who came to
Dallas for an appearance. He is 90 years old and still inspiring
crowds with his version of ``How Great Thou Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently I've written about an unforgettable man named Ed
Human. The 5-foot-5 evangelist from Euless has been taking
Christmas to street people for more thn a quarter-century. He says
he feels compelled to follow Jesus' command to feed the hungry and
clothe the naked.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of remarkable people like Human in our
country and across the world who are living out their faith. It is
good to know I'll meet more of them as we enter an exciting new
century.

WHAT KIDS REALLY WANT FROM WORKING PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a working parent and could grant your child one New
Year's wish to change the way your work affects her life, what do
you think her wish would be?
</P>
<P>
   More time with you? Try again. That's the wish most parents
assume their child would make, but it's not what children actually
wish for.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by researcher Ellen Galinsky reveals that what our
children really want is for us to be less tired and less pressured
by work, or to make more money so we'll feel less stress. This is
not so much altruistic as it is egocentric: If we are less stressed
and tired, we're more available and better able to focus
</P>
<P>
   on them.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they really want.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, says Galinsky, who offered the wish to 1,023
third through 12th graders and their working parents, ``It's not
that parents do or don't work that's the issue for children.
It's &UR;  &LR; how our work affects them that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The research, which is detailed in her recently published book,
``Ask the Children: What America's Children Really Think About
Working Parents'' (Morrow), is gaining praise from educators and
other researchers. They say it taps into the complicated feelings
our society continues to have about working parents, especially the
notion that if a mother works, she is less than a committed parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to change the culture or the amount of
stress in our job, but we can do something about how it gets
communicated to our children and how it affects them,'' says
educator Judith Wagner, director of the Broad Oaks Children's
School of Whittier College for preschool through Grade 6.

</P>
<P>
   Feelings of guilt
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She sees every day how much tension children feel when parents
are trying to beat the clock, and hurrying to get them to school on
time. All parents will get drawn into a battle of wills over
punctuality, of course, whether they work outside the home or not.
``It's part of the parent-child struggle, a child's way of exerting
some autonomy by saying, `You can't make me hurry!' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But parents who work tend to forget that. If we are also
fighting the clock at the other end of the day _ to get dinner on
the table and cram family time in between dinner, cleanup,
homework, and bedtime _ we begin to feel profound guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child doesn't have to be intoning, `If you didn't work, we
wouldn't have to rush so much,' for parents to think they are
thinking it,'' Wagner says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, children rarely think that thought or even anything
like it, says Rivka Polatnick, senior researcher at the Center for
Working Families at the University of California at Berkeley.
That's because most children's frame of reference doesn't include
us not working. The thing is, she says, when we do work, they
deduce that work is synonymous with stress and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   That they come to this conclusion may be our own fault, says
Galinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't communicate enough with them about work issues
because we're afraid we'll hear negative comments that will feed
into our guilt,'' she says. Instead, we leave a vacuum of
information that children fill with their fantasies and
misperceptions, which then not only affect the parent-child
relationship but also color their view of the world of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All children are constantly taking their parents' emotional
temperature,'' says Galinsky. Are we happy or cranky,
short-tempered or patient? The more they perceive that we are in a
bad mood or overly stressed, the less likely they are to want to
``bother'' us and the more likely to keep what Galinsky calls
secrets: things they know we would want to know but that they
intuit would upset us, for instance, that an after-school sitter
spends all her time on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she tells of a mother who moved her office out of
the house but never told her daughter why. The preschooler blamed
herself: ``I made too much noise.'' She never asked her mother if
that was so (it wasn't, of course) because she didn't want to anger
Mom even more, but it was the first thing she said to an
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something shameful this child was carrying with her,
all for lack of a simple conversation,'' Galinsky says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions about work
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Galinsky says children also are forming impressions about the
world of work in general: Is it mostly stimulating and satisfying,
or something to dread?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they mostly conclude the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that they will someday be workers themselves, I
wish we were more aware of the messages we send,'' says sociologist
Anita Garey, also a senior research fellow at the Center for
Working Families at the University of California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   She particularly worries about children whose parents talk about
work only in terms of its economic benefits, as in ``I work so you
can take ballet.'' That leads to a negative view of it, says Garey.
She urges us also to talk about benefits to self-esteem: ``I'm
proud of myself when I know I do a good job''; the pleasure of
being productive: ``I worked hard, but seeing the finished project
was worth it''; learning new skills; and solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the more we think of our work world as a living
laboratory for our children, the more we help them think about
their own future. If you're miserable at work, for instance, rather
than say nothing or lie about it, use this as an opportunity to
model how you deal with adversity: ``There's a lot of tension at
work right now. I'm going to take a yoga class to help me relax'';
``There are so many changes at work right now, I'm wondering if I
should make a change, too.'' Otherwise, says Galinsky, children see
the work world as a place that chews up adults who are nothing more
than helpless victims.
</P>
<P>
   She talks of a mother who didn't like to travel and would get
cranky before every trip, prompting her children to disengage from
her at leave-taking, which added to her upset. ``When she told them
that she didn't like to travel but that sometimes in life you have
to do hard things, she reduced the tension and also passed on a
life lesson,'' says Galinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jumping to conclusions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lack of communication also gets us into trouble because we jump
to conclusions and respond inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that what our children want is more time with us, for
instance, many parents create what Wagner calls the Razzmatazz
Weekend, where we make up for lost time together during the week by
cramming the weekend full of special events. In the process of
responding to our guilt, however, we create a chain reaction that
only adds to everyone's stress: We fall behind in chores and
errands, and we're rushing off to be someplace on a schedule, even
if we are all going there together.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on this is the Razzmatazz Vacation, which Wagner
calls a literal guilt trip. In an informal survey of 50 children
ages 5 to 13, she asked what kind of vacation they most wanted. The
answers stunned even her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to go fishing at a creek or live in a tent,'' she
says. Her interpretation: Children want to get their parents as far
away as possible from the shadow of work's stress.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's advice is to ratchet down the activites in our lives
and spend more time together without an agenda. Galinsky agrees _
she calls it ``hang-out'' time _ but also urges us to be more
deliberate in talking about work and to not be afraid to ask our
children the ``wish'' question. (A variation on that question might
be: ``If you were telling a friend about my work, what would you
say?'')
</P>
<P>
   In her interviews, Galinsky found that one boy's wish was to
know when it was OK to interrupt his mother when she got a phone
call from work. A 12-year-old girl wanted one of her parents to
accompany her on a school field trip. What this says to Galinsky is
that children measure how focused we are on them in small ways that
we often don't even consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time,'' she says, ``what they'll wish for is
something within your ability to grant. But you can't know unless
you ask.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOW TO TALK ABOUT WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It's a fine line between sharing an issue and burdening your
child: ``My boss doesn't realize how much work I do,'' rather than
``He picks on me.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be afraid to be honest: ``I don't like it when people
don't treat me well. One of the reasons I'm working is so that you
can get an education and get a better job than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   --Use examples from work to help a child with a problem: ``Not
feeling comfortable with a new teacher reminds me of the time I had
a new boss . . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Toddlers and preschoolers are most likely to say, ``I wish you
didn't have to work.'' Avoid saying, ``I wish I didn't, too,'' and
try instead: ``It's hard to say goodbye, isn't it? I mostly like my
job just like you mostly like preschool, but I wish I didn't have
to leave you.''
</P>
<P>
   --Conversations are easiest when there is some routine that
makes them possible _ everyone eating one meal a day together _ or
when you are doing something side by side like turning a chore into
something fun: ``Let's reorganize the playroom and then reward
ourselves with a tea party!''

GET A JUMP ON THE Y2K BUGS WITH A TOAD HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What better time to speak of new and old things, of cabbages and
kings, of products clever and uselessly cute.
</P>
<P>
   They are rife, and editors from Kennebunkport to Twenty-Nine
Palms, St. Augustine to Bellingham receive these items, or at least
information about them, from their manufacturers, who say, ``How
about a little free publicity?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not in so many words, but that is their intent and hope.
Sometimes the editors oblige _ if they think it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   So, before any more hope springs eternal, let's take a look:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you know that one toad can eat three times its weight in
insect pests every day? It's a good reason to invite one into your
garden, and you can do that in style with a Toad House from Mudbug
Pottery in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-inch-tall stoneware clay shelter provides perfect
sanctuary, particularly from errant lawn mowers. All you need is a
sheltered site and a small pool or ground-level birdbath.
</P>
<P>
   Potter John Jensen creates the toad houses, which cost $29.95.
Order from the Plow &AMP; Hearth catalog of Madison, Va., 800-627-1712,
or from Mudbug Pottery of Annapolis, Md., 410-263-6248.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be a little early to order such a summer-oriented
item, why not? You'll be ready for the Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ It may also be a little early to paint outdoors, but spring is
coming and before you know it you will be juggling paint can and
brush at the top of a ladder. You dread it, because the can, hung
by a hook in the traditional manner, turns this way and that, and
the handle is always getting in the way of your dipping brush.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Julius Martin of New Orleans experienced, so he
decided to make a better one. He tried a shelf arrangement, which
resulted in a can, paint and all, falling on his head.
</P>
<P>
   So, Martin came up with the Paint Cradle, a round plastic holder
that looks like an unstrung tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   A gallon can fits into the round section, and a handle sticks
directly into a hollow rung of the ladder. Result: a stable can,
open to all the brush-dipping you need.
</P>
<P>
   The Paint Cradle is $13.95 and not in stores yet. To order, call
504-392-7017.
</P>
<P>
   _ Odors know no season; they are so often with us and we are so
often frustrated as to how to get rid of them. It is relatively
easy to clean and deodorize hard surfaces such as counter tops,
floors, and appliances. But odors on soft materials _ fabrics,
clothing, curtains, rugs, draperies, bedding, lampshades, and
upholstery _ present their own problems. Such materials may not be
dirty but still have bad smells.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-surface cleaners are not designed to clean soft
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, when Procter &AMP; Gamble came up with Febreze, a
spray that gets into soft materials and zaps the odors instead of
just covering them. Febreze is also suitable for heavy fabrics such
as auto interiors, sneakers, and gym bags.
</P>
<P>
   Febreze is sold in the laundry aisle of supermarkets, drug
stores, mass merchandizers, and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's slippy-slidy time again, although we have had no major
ice problems so far this winter. Don't fret, they will come, and we
will be hard put to find ways to thaw the ice and spread salt and
sand without endangering plants, and our lives with all that salt.
</P>
<P>
   There have been salt substitutes around for some time, but none
has worked very well. Even chemical fertilizer, which does work,
presents its own environmental problems by providing too much
fertilizer to green things.
</P>
<P>
   IMC Salt of Overland Park, Kansas, has come to our rescue,
perhaps, with Safe Step, which contains potassium chloride and a
catalytic agent, MG-104, an enhanced methyl gluoside formula that
triggers the melting process.
</P>
<P>
   It does not attract water and therefore does not clump, pouring
easily in a humid summer or icy winter. And, its makers claim,
leaves little residue and few stains.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Step is sold at many retailers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   _ It will be some time before seeding starts in the garden, but
the New England Wild Flower Society wants you to get an early start
by ordering wildflower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of varieties of wild flowers, which you can
see at the Garden in the Woods in Framingham. They are sold by the
garden and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Easy-to-grow varieties include butterfly weed, New England
aster, blue false indigo, purple coneflower, and foamflower. More
experienced growers will find challenging trilliums, ferns,
gentians, pitcher plants, or native rhododendron.
</P>
<P>
   This year's catalog offers two meadow mixes: a new England seed
mix for general growing conditions and a tall grass mix for height
and drama.
</P>
<P>
   To order, send for the 2000 Seed &AMP; Book Catalogue. Requests must
be received by March 15. Seed requests are filled in the order
received. Order early for best selection.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a 2000 Seed &AMP; Book catalogue, send $2.50 to Seeds, New
England Wild Flower Society, Garden in the Woods, 180 Hemenway Rd.,
Framingham, MA 01701.

&HT;     CUOMO BRANCHES OUT IN NEW BOOK FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As a grandfather to nine grandchildren _ all
girls _ it was about time that former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New
York added children's author to his lengthy resume in politics and
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Spruce'' was recently published by Sleeping Bear
Press, with illustrations by Gijsbert van Frankenhuyzen. It is a
father-son parable that teaches the rewards of hard work,
perseverance and keeping dreams alive. The story takes its
inspiration from a storm that disabled the towering conifer in
front of Cuomos' home in Queens, 50 years ago when he was about 15.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Cuomo wrote his first children's book involves
a series of serendipitous encounters spanning 17 years. He
recounted the improbable journey in his inimitable blend of
raconteur and philosopher during a phone interview last week from
his New York City law office.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-told Cuomo anecdote of the lesson-in-an-evergreen (with
its signature line, ``We gonna push 'im up'') first had life in
print as the Oct. 22, 1982, entry in his book ``Diaries of Mario
Cuomo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '82 gubernatorial race, Cuomo was discouraged after a
slide in the polls against the well-financed campaign of Republican
Lewis Lehrman. ``Tired, very tired, feeling the many months of
struggle,'' Cuomo wrote at 4:30 a.m. in the Oct. 22 diary entry. He
lapsed into a woe-is-me attitude, but snapped out of the whining
when he thought of his father, Andrea Cuomo, a first-generation
Italian-American and a ditch digger who opened a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Papa faced was hard, but he dealt with difficult
circumstances,'' Cuomo said. ``Much of what he taught me was summed
up in the story of the blue spruce. I wrote my recollection of that
in my diary.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Diaries'' anecdote was re-published by Reader's Digest as
an inspirational tale.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Chartock, host of a radio talk show with Cuomo on WAMC-FM,
later gave away tapes of Cuomo reading the tale of ``The Blue
Spruce'' as a premium for offering a pledge during fund drives for
the Albany public radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, one of those tapes reached an editor with Sleeping
Bear Press (a publisher of sports books and children's books in
Chelsea, Mich.), who located the Reader's Digest version, contacted
Cuomo and asked if the former governor was interested in adapting
the tale as a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was naive and ignorant and figured I could just squeeze down
the diary story to 575 words, re-focus it for 4-year-olds and I'd
be done,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the initial readers, including a child psychologist,
reviewed Cuomo's manuscript ``and tore it to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rewrites ensued.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Cuomo bristled at the poetic license the publisher
recommended: dropping his older brother Frank altogether from the
story; reducing Cuomo's age from about 15 when the incident took
place to about 11; eradicating any allusion to his father's fiery
temperament, including the curses in Italian that actually
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went along with a lot of the changes they wanted, but I
insisted that the message still be about holding fast to your
dreams, fighting for them and never quitting,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   He added with a chuckle, ``I won the argument over keeping the
word `elude' in.''
</P>
<P>
   The author next sent his revised manuscript to a really tough
critic, his 7-year-old granddaughter, Amanda Cole. ``I like it,
Grandpa,'' she said. ``It taught me you should never quit and you
should fight for something you love.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher hired illustrator van Frankenhuyzen, who lives in
Michigan and had published two other children's books with Sleeping
Bear Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``His artwork is impressionistic, beautiful and heartfelt,''
Cuomo said. ``He took some artistic liberties. My father never wore
a vest in his life, but he thought a shopkeeper should wear a
vest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Spruce,'' a $17.95 hardcover, has been written up in
Newsweek and Newsday and Cuomo said he's had feelers from producers
of ``Rosie'' and ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, 67, who still plays full-court basketball with men half
his age, said he was most pleased with the response from his fellow
hoopsters. ``Four guys came up to me after the game and had me
autograph copies of the book for their kids,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the book's never-say-die message being a political
metaphor for himself a three-term governor turned out of the
Executive Mansion in 1994 by George Pataki, Cuomo, a Democrat,
sidestepped the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good message there for Andrew,'' Cuomo said of his
son, the high-profile U.S. Housing Secretary whose name is often
floated for various elective offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up on my own dreams,'' Cuomo added. ``When you
get so old you don't have an aspiration, you should be denied
respiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is giving to charity all the money he makes from ``The
Blue Spruce.'' The proceeds will go to MUSA, a mentoring program
run by his wife, Matilda, and HELP, an organization for homeless
children formed by Andrew Cuomo.

&HT;     PATAKI VOWS TO TAX GOODS SOLD ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES and JAMES M. ODATO  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Days after championing the largest tax increase
on New Yorkers of his five-year administration, Gov. George Pataki
said he would seek to make Native Americans collect sales taxes on
their land reservations in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long, end-of-the-year conversation with reporters on
Wednesday, the two-term Republican governor also said he would
likely run for re-election in 2002 _ his strongest acknowledgment
to date that he will remain in the Executive Mansion instead of
taking a White House office after the November election, should the
opportunity arise.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki painted a rosy picture of the state's outlook as it heads
into the new millennium, touting what he said was an upswing in New
York's economy during a simultaneous decrease in crime. And though
it calls for a 55-cent tax increase on cigarettes, Pataki described
the soon-to-be-approved Health Care Reform Act of 2000 as an
``outstanding bill'' that will also create $1 billion in Medicaid
savings annually over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax levy from the governor, who has proclaimed himself
as an anti-tax executive, cigarette taxes in New York will rise to
$1.11 a pack _ the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki said he also plans to crack down on illegal tobacco
sales on Indian reservations while trying to persuade Native
Americans to impose a tax on goods sold on those lands. Such
agreements could be the result of ongoing negotiations between the
state and ``virtually every Indian nation'' in New York over legal
ownership of Native-American land, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very sensitive negotiations. They also are wrapped in
litigation that has been going on for decades,'' Pataki said. ``...
We're going to be more agg.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also indicated he is willing to go to court to
decide the land claim damages owed Native Americans instead of
settling out-of-court. Going to court means the state would give up
its ability to negotiate terms such as tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the governor declined to say much about his
goals for New York in 2000, saying simply he will outline his
agenda at next Wednesday's annual State of the State address.
Instead, he listed accomplishments such as boosting the state's
economy and dramatically cutting welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those accomplishments, however, are disputed. Since
1995, Pataki said, the state has seen the creation of nearly
560,000 new private-sector jobs, and New York has climbed from
placing 39th in the nation in terms to job creation to 18th. Much
of those jobs, however, have been created in New York City, and the
upstate economy remains among the country's worst, according to
some economists.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the governor proudly pointed to the 750,000 fewer New
Yorkers who now receive welfare benefits than when he took office.
But again, the majority of those cases were accounted for in New
York City, where Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ who shares, at
best, a tense relationship with Pataki _ has taken credit for
getting 540,000 people off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As for his political agenda, Pataki has no plans to hit the
campaign trail on behalf of the Republican Party as he did a year
ago. The governor traveled across the country in early 1999 in what
was widely understood as a testing-of-the-waters mission for
national office, but Pataki curtailed his tours after endorsing a
fellow GOP governor, George W. Bush of Texas, for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has since been mentioned as a vice presidential or
Cabinet secretary contender in a potential Bush administration. But
by his own admission Wednesday, a more likely scenario is that
Pataki will be staying put for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bet a whole lot ... but I would expect the most likely
thing that I will be doing three years from now would be running
for re-election,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would leave in the middle of his gubernatorial term
to join a Bush administration, the governor said: ``There is no
Bush administration. I'm going to do everything I can to help get
Governor Bush elected, and I'm going to do everything I can to be
the best governor that I can be. I'm not going to speculate as to
what, politically, may or may not happen.''

<P>
   Federal officials say banks, electricity distributors and
transportation companies are ready for the New Year. But they offer
these tips just in case there are a few Y2K computer failures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a three-day supply of food and water, just as you would
be urged to have in preparation for a winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   _Refill prescription medicines when you still have a five- to
seven-day supply remaining.
</P>
<P>
   _Have a flashlight, batteries, a battery-powered radio, a
first-aid kit and extra blankets and clothes for warmth.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep automobile gas tanks more than half full, a normal
recommendation for motorists in cold winter climes.
</P>
<P>
   _Check with manufacturers to see if such electronic equipment as
programmable thermostats and personal computers are Y2K ready.
Appliances like ovens, stoves, refrigerators, television sets and
smoke detectors do not contain date-based computer chips and should
continue to operate normally in the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep paper copies of bank statements, credit card r,
bills and prescription medicine information, beginning now and
continuing for a few months after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _Withdraw only as much cash as you normally would for any
holiday weekend. Withdrawing large amounts of cash may invite
theft.
</P>
<P>
   _Beware of Y2K scams such as someone trying to sell Y2K
insurance or a Y2K-safe investment.
</P>
<P>
   Additional information can be obtained from the Y2K Council on
the Internet at www.y2k.gov or by calling 1-888-USA-4-Y2K

</P>
<P>
   NEWYEAR-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ The turn of the millennium is a
confusing time for those who live in the land where Jesus was born,
lived and died. Mostly Jews and Muslims, they do not attach
religious significance to the moment, yet they live, to some
degree, in the modern, secular world. One rabbi who wanted to mark
the moment without commemorating Jesus has scheduled a Y6K benefit
concert (although the year 6000 is still 240 years away on Jewish
calendar). By Deborah Sontag.

<P>
   DUNNE-BOOKS (New York) _ At St. Martin's Press, Thomas Dunne
created his own literary fief with an imprint, Thomas Dunne Books,
that scorns snobbery, prizes the quirky and commercial and
flourishes through a form of high-volume publishing that has
occasional perils. It was that breezy attitude that placed Dunne's
job in brief jeopardy when top St. Martin's executives considered
the publisher too cavalier when St. Martin's took the highly
unusual action of recalling a biography, ``Fortunate Son: George W.
Bush and the Making of an American President,'' which claimed that
Bush had covered up a youthful 1972 cocaine arrest. Soon after the
recall in October, St. Martin's executive editor resigned in
disgust over the incident. But in the weeks since, little has
changed in the hierarchy at St. Martin's Press, and Dunne remains
firmly in charge. By Doreen Carvajal.

AUTHOR GIVES INSIGHT INTO HOW THE OTHER HALF EARNS, SPENDS
FORTUNES

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holidays are nearly over, and the January bills are on their
way.
</P>
<P>
   As people begin to dig their way out of their millennium
hangover, some might contemplate the finances of the rich and
famous of the past.
</P>
<P>
   While it might not provide you with great financial insight into
your own money woes, looking into the pocketbooks of Lucille Ball,
Albert Einstein, Babe Ruth, Warren Harding and a host of other
celebrities does provide some entertaining January reading.
</P>
<P>
   Their accounts are chronicled in a new book called ``Money
Secrets of the Rich and Famous'' (Allworth Press, 272 pages,
$24.95), by Michael Reynard.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject of money concerns the rising fortunes of the
infamous, or the spending habits of the eminent, ``our curiosity is
piqued,'' writes Reynard, who has spent a lifetime peeking into the
paper trail of checks and other documents of the famous and
infamous as a sort of hobby, apparently. By day, Reynard is an eye
surgeon in California, and he holds several patents in fiber-optic
and laser technology as it applies to ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
   But his second love must be finance, as he is a member of the
Society of Paper Money Collectors and the American Society of Check
Collectors.
</P>
<P>
   It is through those associations that his research began for the
book, which includes copies of documents such as Albert Einstein's
check to the IRS for $29.16 and Howard Hughes' bank card listing
Houston as his permanent address, even though he spent almost no
time in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The book examines the finances of 28 personalities, including
Presidents George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant and John F. Kennedy,
businessmen John D. Rockefeller, J. Paul Getty and Hughes, and
entertainers Judy Garland, Harry Houdini and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   While a seemingly hodgepodge group, selected almost randomly,
Reynard assures readers there is an order to his choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individuals portrayed in this book were selected because
they represent different types of personalities from different
walks of life,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their profiles are classified according to monetary themes
that are the most closely associated with their financial life or
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus we have Ball, Alexander Graham Bell and Houdini tied
together under the Enterprising Entrepreneurs section, while
Garland, Thomas Jefferson and John Sutter, the ``Father of
California,'' all fall under the Riches to Rags category.
</P>
<P>
   The most fun of the book is the chance to sneak into the
financial lives of some we know so well. On that account, it shows
us:
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington invested nearly every dollar he made into buying
land, so much so that when elected president he had to borrow money
at 6 percent to finance the trip for his inauguration. His
accumulated wealth of more than $500,000, however, when compared
with the gross national product at the time of his death, makes him
one of the hundred wealthiest Americans in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ball and former husband Desi Arnez where financial whizzes,
accepting $1,000 a week less in salary for full rights to their
first show. Seven years later, CBS paid them a cool $4.3 million to
buy back the series.
</P>
<P>
   _ Einstein might have been the greatest mathematician in the
world, but his skills were woefully undervalued until his second
wife, Elsa, began to serve as his business manager. In 1932, when
the couple immigrated to the United States, she got his salary of
$3,000 a year from Princeton University changed to $16,000 annually
for life.
</P>
<P>
   _ While Rockefeller's fortune far surpassed the combined wealth
of Astor, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan, his philanthropy
was also among the highest of an American in history. He also paid
attention to tax strategies and transferred more than $500 million
to his son in 1921. By his death in 1937, he had a net value of $26
million, of which $16 million was taken in state and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Reynard's book provides entertaining and sometimes even helpful
insight into the personal finances of the famous and infamous.

   ``Mastering Guerrilla Marketing: 100 Profit-Producing Insights
You Can Take to the Bank''
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Conrad Levinson
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mifflin, $15
</P>
<P>
   By my count, this is the 16th book that Levinson has written on
his concept of ``guerrilla'' marketing, or bringing sophisticated
marketing ideas to small businesses. Not a bad racket. But the
master always has interesting things to say, and this book is no
exception. Couple that with the fact that marketing constantly
changes because of evolving communication technologies, and you
have ample reason to pick up his latest book.

LAND ROVER DISCOVERY II: A TRUE OFF-ROAD VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fire up the engine and the noise up front is loud _ rumbling and
rattling.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside and your feet meet thick, industrial-weight rubber
floormats.
</P>
<P>
   Look about as you bump along the road and realize you are in a
big, rolling box.
</P>
<P>
   This is a luxury SUV? Yes and, thankfully, no.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover Discovery II, gussied up as it is with leather,
pretty paint, and a certan cachet that appeals to urban-dwellers
who like to look back-woods-weekend tough, is at its heart a true
SUV _ as in a vehicle that belongs in mud, on rocks, slashing
through brush, scrambling up and down steep slopes. It is too bad
that so few of them get used the way this vehicle is meant to be
used because off road it is very good.
</P>
<P>
   Sit high in the driver's seat, grip the thick steering wheel,
obviously made to be held tight in tough driving, and look about
you. The outside view, through tall, wide glass all around, is
expansive. No little car is going to sneak up on your rear
quarterpanel in this rig. You won't be backing into unseen trees in
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover has come a long way since its introduction at the
Amsterdam Auto Show in 1948 as a permanent-four-wheel-drive box
with a canvas roof and doors as optional equipment. Rover is owned
by the BMW group now and new technology aimed at taking out the
inherent dangers of operating SUVs, on highways and off road, is
abundant. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   First, get used to the big box you are driving.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-covered front seats are easy-chair big, firm at
thigh, side and back. The rear seat _ two adults with a child in
the middle _ is equally comfortable, and leg space is ample. In the
rear cargo compartment, two optional folding jump seats _ front
facing _ are ready for the odd times you'll need to carry seven
people.
</P>
<P>
   All gauges and controls are big and simple, from fog lamps and
wipers to the button that opens the gas-cap door. Cruise control
and audio volume are controlled with buttons on the steering wheel,
cutting down on distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space abounds in the form of bins, both deep and
shallow. Bins in the doors, a big bin between the front seats,
trays lined with rubber nubs tucked all over the place. Maps,
compasses, sunglasses, and anything else you need for travel or
off-road treks all have a place.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road driving can mean extremes in weather, and the Discovery
has one of the most powerful heaters I have encountered, a virtual
furnace when cranked high. For hot treks, the air conditioning is
powerful as well, with optional rear AC a boon for those at the
back of the box.
</P>
<P>
   I have read some complaints that the Discovery's 4.0-liter V8 is
not powerful enough. Hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   This SUV cruises easily well above the speed limit _ and far
faster than you should drive an SUV anyway. Further, off-road
driving is not about powering your way over or through anything.
It's about deft, steady, and often slow application of torque to
overcome whatever challenge the vehicle faces. And with 250 lb. ft.
of torque _ available over a very wide band of RPMs _ the Discovery
has plenty of what it needs. Combined off road and on, it averaged
15.6 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This test car went up a stack of 16-inch logs without rolling
one of them. It climbed a wet and slippery rock face. It climbed
hills so steep that only sky appeared in the windshield; held
itself back on hills so steep it felt like the bumper was going to
plant itself in the ground at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   This latter feat was aided by Rover's Hill Descent Control
system, which monitors the speed of each wheel and automatically
applies brakes to assist engine braking.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is a permanent-four-wheel-drive vehicle and uses a
two-speed transfer box to move between high and low range and a
four-speed automatic transmission with sport and manual modes.
Sport mode gives quicker downshifts and delayed upshifts for better
performance, while manual lets you do the choosing in off-road
situations, taking over and downshifting only if it senses you are
about to stall in the midst of a slow crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Rover has equipped the Discovery with four-wheel electronic
traction control and ABS and, in a step that all SUV manufacturers
should take, has added what the company calls Active Cornering
Enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs, with high centers of gravity and weight sitting up high,
are prone to go out of control or roll over in tight turns at
speed. ACE, as Rover has dubbed its system, is aimed at preventing
this.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is simple.
</P>
<P>
   When an SUV turns, weight gets shifted, sometimes dramatically.
Springs and shocks stretch on one side, compress on another. Energy
is stored and then released from turn to turn. Sometimes this is
bad. What ACE does is watch for lateral body movement in corners
and then actively counteracts it. It does this by applying torque
hydraulically to torsion bars. This virtually eliminates lean at
lower speeds (Rover says lateral body movement is eliminated up to
0.4 Gs of force) and significantly reduce it at higher speeds and
more G forces.
</P>
<P>
   Its effects were quite noticeable both on the highway, where
deliberate weaving in and out of traffic (not recommended in most
SUVs) was done with grace and little sense of lateral stress. Off
road, turns that should have been funky were smoothed by the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge numbers of Discoverys you see in urban
settings, this is a true off-road performer. Solid axles front and
rear. Twin forged steel radius arms, dampers, and coil springs up
front give it both highway stability and the long wheel travel
needed off road.
</P>
<P>
   Forged steel trailing arms are coupled with either optional
self-leveling shocks or coil springs at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and passengers are protected by dual front airbags, firm
headrests all around, a collapsible, compartmentalized aluminum
frame designed to absorb the energy of a crash, a steel cage
underbody, and door-mounted side impact beams.
</P>
<P>
   Steel? Industrial rubber? Cages and impact beams? Grinding over
rocks and logs? Rolling smoothly down the highway? Is it chi-chi
urban status symbol or true off-road warrior?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The thin bins on the ceiling above the front sun visors. Good
for maps, wallets, other flat items. Good use of space usually
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   --Those big, fat visors block the sun from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The gas cap. Crank this way, crank that way, count the turns,
count the clicks. It is too tough to operate. &QL;

&HT;     SUICIDE PREVENTION AGENCY BRACES FOR MORE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city's suicide prevention agency is doubling
the number of telephone lines and volunteers who answer them in
preparation for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually don't know what to expect because there's a large
influx of people coming from outside the city,'' said Eve Meyer,
director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention. ``We'll have to be
ready for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide Prevention, along with the police and fire departments,
are coordinating with the Department of Health on potential
problems on Friday. Barbara Garcia, the deputy director of health,
said the department's goal is to have no suicides, no killings and
no accidental deaths going into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are crossing our fingers that no one will die on New Year's
Eve,'' Garcia said. ``We're hoping that we're going to be very
bored that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade in San Francisco, there have been hundreds
more suicides than homicides. Typically, March and April are the
busiest months for suicides.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure the exact reason why there are more suicides in
the spring, Meyer said, but there are several theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in tremendous amounts of pain have to watch everyone
fall in love and the flowers bloom,'' she said. ``It can be a very
depressing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said people might also become depressed during the winter
holidays, but not act on it until a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide prevention agency will expand its telephone hot
lines from three to six on Friday and Saturday because of concerns
that more people may be depressed, Meyer said. The volunteers
provide counseling and advice for suicidal people or those who are
seeking help for a friend or family member.
</P>
<P>
   The increased staffing at the agency for New Year's Eve does not
follow a national trend.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,
which specializes in research, said she had seen nothing to suggest
that suicide rates would increase on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Covenant House, a New York-based crisis hot line that gets more
than a million calls per year, is actually trimming its staff from
17 to seven for the New Year's Eve night shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had an increase in suicide calls or almost any
other category of calls that we get,'' said Covenant House director
Gil Ortiz.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They come to her every morning with a different story.
Liars and cheats, the whole lot of them, but Louise Bell, 76, loves
them just the same. Her feet snuggled in her slippers, she tries
her best to advise them, but they never listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do that,'' she begs. ``Baby, that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are characters from her favorite daytime dramas,
Ridge, Nikki, Victor, Margo, and Victoria are like family,
dependable constants in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Outside her tiny apartment, the world she has known has slipped
away.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young nurse who worked breakneck hours, Bell has slowed
her pace because of high blood pressure and eye problems. She gave
away the stacks of Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye LPs that gave her so
much joy, convinced that there was no place for vinyl in the
digital world. And the ritual of gathering with her large family _
brothers and sisters around the Christmas table in her native
Philadelphia _ is now just a memory since the last of her brothers
died four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of this state's elderly who have outlived family and
friends, Bell talks about her favorite soap characters as she would
a brother. From the perch of her armchair, she gives counsel on the
marriage of Victor Newman and his fickle wife, Nikki. And she warns
Ridge Forrester, like the son she never had, to keep away from that
no-good Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're with someone day in and day out, you feel that you
know them,'' said Bell. ``Like family, you try to tell people right
from wrong, but they don't take heed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is these simple, twisted tales of love, family, and betrayal
written for a much younger consumer that provide comfort and
friendship for the old and lonely. A half-century ago the soap
operas _ known simply as ``stories'' to some of the devout _ were
short radio dramas created to sell soap products. It drew an
audience of young, hurried mothers, blue-collar workers, and nurses
such as Bell who found a quick, needed escape in these nightly
tales of woe. Now some of those same fans have grown gray and
unsteady, outliving their contemporaries and feeling out of place
in the throes of technological change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things have changed in my time,'' said Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stories are the same. The stories and church are my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For many elders, their ailments limit their mobility and further
isolate them from society, said Alfred Davis, program director for
Amory Street Apartments, a senior apartment complex in Boston.
``They have seen these people, the characters evolve, get older,
and get into just as much mischief as they did when they were
younger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eartha Lee Jackson has watched generations of families come and
go on the shows.
</P>
<P>
   She worked most her life, but began to follow the shows after
retiring. Homebound and alone, she might work on the gardening, but
she spends most of her day transfixed by Channel 4. She said one of
her favorite shows is ``The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing else to do,'' said Jackson, who won't give her
age.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., after she has bathed and taken her medicine, she can
hear the theme music of ``The Guiding Light'' blaring through
several rooms of her South End home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up doing a little of something and sit back down again,
but this (soap watching) is about all I do all day.''
</P>
<P>
   At senior-citizen centers, though, workers fear that all of the
television watching makes the elderly even more isolated. Centers
across greater Boston are encouraging the elderly to take walks, or
join their friends in a game of bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Harway, 59, a close friend of Bell's and a tenant leader
at her apartment complex, urges her and other seniors to come down
to the lobby and talk to people rather than to the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Although, Bell usually doesn't receive company until after her
stories have ended at 3 p.m., Harway enticed her to join him at a
senior luncheon the other day. During the event, ironically, Bell
won a portable television.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``the seniors' way of getting outside the world,'' said
Harway. ``The beautiful parties and clothes are an escape sometimes
when you are shut in.''
</P>
<P>
   Harway understands the strong draw the soaps have on the
elderly. He got hooked several years ago while caring for his ill
mother. He would sit by her bedside and the two of them would
whisper about the actors as if they were peering at their neighbors
behind their living room curtains.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would say, `Oh, look at her _ what class, what style,' ''
he recalls. ``Oh, look at Drucilla, what a nice girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Watson, 81, loves Victor Newman, one of the longest
running characters on ``The Young and The Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who uses an electric wheelchair, talks about Newman with
an uncanny familiarity. She remembers him through his good and bad
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Victor has been around for a long time, '' she said. ``I
try to keep track of him, but he is always falling in love, getting
married more than any man I know. He divorces one woman and then
marries the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories that may seem far out to some, ring true for Watson,
Jackson, and Bell who have lived lives that have, at times, been
embroiled in their own drama. Watson was 50 before she met all of
her siblings. Bell recalls the drama of escaping a miserable
marriage.

   ``I laugh at the characters, but they are really like ordinary
people. . . . It's like real life,'' said Bell. ``Take for
instance, ``The Bold and the Beautiful'': Brooke ran through the
whole family. She married the father, then Ridge, and now she's
trying to get the baby brother, Thorne. It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. one recent afternoon, Bell was sitting in her chair
watching one of her last stories of the day. Something great just
happened today on ``The Young and The Restless,'' she said,
clasping her hands in pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Newman is back in the picture'' after being away in
Mexico, she said. ``I was so glad to see him.''

   NEWYEAR-CELEBRATE (New York) _ The date is an arbitrary slice of
time; many historians doubt that the Gregorian calendar's starting
point accurately matches the year Jesus was born. Yet the equally
arbitrary milestone it leads to, with the nice round number of
2000, has by now created whole industries of anticipation, revelry,
planning and retrospection. Never have three zeroes added up to so
much. Let all the nitpickers and killjoys insist that today is only
the last day of the 1900's, not the first day of the 21st century
and the third millennium A.D. Everyone else is getting ready to say
goodbye not just to a decade, but also to a century and a
millennium, maybe two. And there's no agreement on the right spirit
for the sendoff. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   NEWYEAR-ART (New York) _ Every New Year's Eve, we would like to
think, one small story closes and another opens. But this year the
story arrives in a deluxe edition. The ball dropping in Times
Square at midnight will punctuate not just a chapter or a volume,
but a boxed set titled ``20th Century.'' And it will be the first
mark of an ellipsis into the future. Epochal transitions are part
of every culture, and they are by no means always occasions for
cheer. Thresholds are worrisome places: you know a good deal about
what you're leaving behind, but not much about what's ahead. And
vulnerability makes emotions run high. No wonder the prospect of
ending one life and starting another _ the millennial concept in a
nutshell _ invites responsive extremes of hope and despair. All
over the world art is called on for guidance and assurance in such
matters. By Holland Cotter.

   The cup o' kindness that Robert Burns raised to those of auld
acquaintance suggested they not be forgot, for auld lang syne.
Those who died in 1999 influenced war and peace, fun and games, art
and commerce, life and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein bin Talal became King of Jordan at 16 and reigned until
he died at 63, spending the last decades of his life pursuing
peace. Harry A. Blackmun brought Minnesotan common sense to the
Supreme Court. Joe DiMaggio was an icon, a celebrity, an enigma,
and a terrific ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   The most-photographed magazine editor in history died at sea at
38 as John F. Kennedy Jr. united a nation in grief for another loss
of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Lamport used wit and rhyme to create uniquely funny
satires. Maud Morgan was a Boston artist of bold strokes and vivid
hues.
</P>
<P>
   George C. Scott brought power and passion to his film roles.
George V. Higgins deployed ear and eye in novels about Boston's
underside, which The Guardian of London called ``revolutionary'' in
milieu and form.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt ``The Stilt'' Chamberlain could dominate the basketball
floor. Walter ``Sweetness'' Payton could glide through tacklers on
the football field.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, Madeline Kahn was a comic beauty, never taking
herself seriously. Victor Mature brought the same attitude to
Biblical epics, Westerns, and film noir.

   John Chafee of Rhode Island left a legacy of intelligence and
integrity. James Farmer fought on the street for the same civil
rights that Frank M. Johnson Jr. preserved as a federal judge. Pete
Conrad was a famous astronaut. Lane Kirkland led the AFL-CIO. Three
old China hands died: John Service, John Paton Davies, and A. Doak
Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   From Congress, George Brown, Roman Hruska, Jeff Cohelan, Carl
Elliott, and David Dennis died, as did two men who had tough jobs:
Ralph Perk, mayor of Cleveland, and George Reedy, LBJ's press
secretary. From the Nixon era, Herb Stein, Charlie McWhorter, Ken
Clawson, and John Ehrlichman departed, and Bessie Cohen died, the
last survivor of a fire that killed 146 people at the Triangle
Shirtwaist factory in New York in 1911. She was 107.

Julius Nyerere of Kenya; Joshua Nkomo of Zimbabwe; Morocco's King
Hassan II; Maurice Couve de Murville of France; Brazil's Joao
Baptista Figueiredo; Franjo Tudjman of Croatia; Michel Camdessus of

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three giants of music were among those who sounded their final
note in 1999. Joe Williams carried a Kansas City jazz band in his
voice; Curtis Mayfield mixed conscience and joy in his songs; and
Hank Snow, clad in rhinestone, made ``Movin' On'' a Nashville
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Country singers Anita Carter and Dusty Springfield brought soul
to their songs. Yehudi Menuhin's violin kept him forever young. Al
Hirt handled a trumpet with style. Bidu Sayao was a soprano who
sang like a Brazilian angel, Joann Grillo sang almost 200 times at
the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and Robert Shaw conducted the
Atlanta Symphony. The jazz world lost Charles Earland, Charles
Brown, Grover Washington Jr., Art Farmer, Harry ``Sweets'' Edison,
Charlie Byrd, Ernie Wilkins, Charles Thomas, Red Norvo, Jaki Byard,
Dick Grove, Richard Boone, and critic Stanley Dance.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriters who died include Hoyt (``Joy to the World'') Axton;
Jesse (``Shake, Rattle, and Roll'') Stone; Buddy Wayne (``Party
Doll'') Knox; Julius (``Spanish Flea'') Wechter; and Bobby (``Route
66'') Troup. Singers as different as Roberta Sherwood and Anthony
Newley, Mel Torme and Boxcar Willie, Helen Forrest and Guy Mitchell
died, along with members of groups: Mark Sandman of Morphine, Rick
Danko of The Band, Johnny Moore of the Drifters; Donald Mills, the
last of the Mills Brothers; and Frances Gershwin Godowsky, the last
of the legendary musical family.

Gloucester sculptor Walker Hancock at 97; art dealer Leo Castelli;

   Hollywood noted the passing of those who survive only on
celluloid: Sylvia Sidney, the heroic working girl of the 1930s; the
durable, dark-haired cowboy Rory Calhoun; Desmond Llewelyn, the
ingenious Q of James Bond films; actor-director Don Taylor, the
groom in ``Father of the Bride;'' Ruth Roman of Lynn, both sultry
and wholesome; the saturnine British stars Dirk Bogarde and Oliver
Reed; David Manners, pursued by a thirsty Bela Lugosi in
``Dracula;'' and Buddy Rogers, who starred in ``Wings.'' Character
actors with familiar faces died: Henry Jones, Philip Sterling, Ian
Bannen, Robert Douglas, Gil Perkins; Lucille Vore, who was ``Baby
Lucille'' in ``Our Gang;'' and the funniest Bowery Boy, Huntz Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cameras, Stanley Kubrick, the Dr. Strangelove of
directing, died, as did the French director Robert Bresson; Edward
Dmytryk, who directed ``Crossfire,'' Irving Rapper of ``Now,
Voyager,'' and Charles Crichton of ``Lavender Hill Mob.'' Norman
Wexler wrote ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Serpico.'' Garson Kanin

Adams, Morris West, Brian Moore, Malachi Martin, J. F. Powers,
Kenneth Dodson, Iris Murdoch, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Niccolo Tucci,

designer Ben Edwards; director Jose Quintero; dancer Muriel
Bentley; impresarios Roger Stevens and Mike Ockrent; and playwright
William Alfred, the Harvard professor who created ``Hogan's Goat.''
Ann Corio and Lili St. Cyr were the mildly naughty, statuesque
queens of burlesque. Douglas Leigh, who lit up the Great White Way
with dazzling gimmicks that flashed and smoked, died at 92.

   Television offers different images for different decades, from
``the thrilling days of yesteryear,'' the setting for ``The Lone
Ranger,'' whose Clayton Moore Hi-yo-Silvered into the sunset at 85,
to ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' whose Dana Plato died at 34. Game-show
stalwarts Gene Rayburn and Peggy Cass died. So did Mary Kay Bergman
of ``South Park,'' David Strickland of ``Suddenly Susan,'' Ellen
Corby of ``The Waltons,'' and DeForest Kelley, the cranky Doc McCoy
of ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Siskel reviewed the week's movies. Martin Agronsky and
Martha Rountree brought dignity to television news. Harry Crane
wrote for ``The Honeymooners,'' Gene Levitt created ``Fantasy

Show of Shows.'' Joey Adams, Gary Morton, and Watty Watson got
laughs on TV in the 1950s. So did the ingenious Spanish puppeteer
Senor Wences, who died at 103.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Cherokee actor, Iron Eyes Cody, who famously wept in

Garber founded a travel agency; Bill Bowerman co-founded Nike
footgear; Aaron (Bunny) Lapin put whipped cream in a spray can and
called it Reddi-wip; Victor Bloede and David Ogilvy were ingenious

boxer Jerry Quarry; Bob Backus, a champion weight thrower; hockey's

KANSAS STATE CLOSES THE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Saturday, Jan. 1, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not yet time to remove Kansas State University from the
endangered brains list, but it deserves some recognition for
beginning the long climb out of the toxic dump otherwise known as
its football team.
</P>
<P>
   In my 1996 Graduation Gap Bowl, this emerging national power had
a 7 percent graduation rate for its African-American players, the
second-worst among ranked or bowl-bound teams. It had the nation's
worst gap between that 7 percent graduation rate for the
African-American players and the 50 percent graduation rate for the
student body. Kansas State is still near the bottom of this year's
Graduation Gap Bowl, but unlike the 70 percent of bowl schools
whose graduation rates have declined, K-State's has gone up. Its
African-American rate has gone from 7 to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That 19-point rise, tying Wisconsin, is the biggest advance
among bowl teams. The gap between African-American players and
other students has been cut from 43 percentage points to 20.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to me this summer and in a conversation last week,
Phil Hughes, director of student services in Kansas's athletic
department, said the 7 percent figure was ``particularly
alarming.'' Since then the school has opened what it calls a
``premier'' learning center for athletes. It says it has tripled
the tutorial budget for athletes and boosted its academic
counseling staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not satisfied,'' Hughes said. ``We're not beating our
chest. We know those past rates were abysmal. We know we have a
long way to go. But we think we have the system in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few NCAA reports will show how well the system stayed
in place. At least K-State was one school that did not stand in
place _ or slide deeper into the dump.

   BUSH-CENSUS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Every ten years, the federal
government counts Americans. The concept is simple, but the
execution is exceedingly complicated _ and political. Federal
officials use the final tally is to determine how many of the 435
U.S. representatives will be allotted to each state. State
legislatures use the numbers to draw congressional and state
legislative districts. People who aren't counted lose political
power, and nearly every census since the first one in 1790 has been
politically charged. Now the seemingly arcane question of whether
census takers should give state lawmakers numbers based on a strict
head count or estimates derived from ``statistical sampling'' is
presenting political problems for Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush. (Greenberger, Austin

 (For release Saturday, Jan. 1, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so I was off on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   I thought the new European currency launched last January was
going to fly. Well, it flew _ not straight down, but at a pretty
steep angle. Let me just say that the euro dove at a sharper angle
than I like to ski at.
</P>
<P>
   From a high-right-after-launch of $1.17 it kissed the dollar
almost right flat on the old $1.00 buckeroo. Hey, I'm only out 17
cents per buck, right? I blame myself for that one. But I blame all
my genius friends who boast of their NASDAQ stock runups for my
other biggest miss. How was I to know the technology-drenched
market index would run up 84 percent on the year to yesterday? Do I
know a lot of smart people? Yes. Did any of them call 52 weeks ago
and say, ``Dave, do yourself a favor and go heavy on NASDAQ?''
Nope.
</P>
<P>
   I did a little better on the politics. I never bought the
``Clinton will have to resign, Clinton should resign, this
presidency is cooked'' collection of doom-and-gloom themes. Bill
looked a little shaky at times, but it would take a lot more than
the Republicans have got to cook his goose. Any guy who has to come
home after a hard day's work running the planet and stare down
Hillary over a mug of soup and a cold sandwich is one tough
son-uv-a-gun.
</P>
<P>
   In his wayward fashion, Wild Bill is the paradigm of this
incredible economic expansion. It just keeps keeping on, and so
does Will-yum Jefferson. We're approaching the eight-year mark of
the current economic expansion. And only the truly delusional still
claim that the roots of this economic flowering were watered by the
previous four years of Bush Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton came into power with his finger-poppin'
speechifying and zig-zags to the middle, the American economy has
performed like no other economic engine in the history of
civilization. Did Clinton ever do anything right? Not according to
his enemies, who are legion, and largely much more prosperous than
they ever dreamed of being, thanks to Clinton's eerie feel for what
should be done to keep this jalopy turning over at the elevated rpm
rate we've come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   What else happened as we scroll back through the century's
rearview mirror? We've seen the rise of the Internet, as no one
lets us forget for a nanosecond. We've seen the decline of Congress
as an institution. The turnover of the Panama Canal to the
Panamanians _ that's a country we invented in order to swipe the
canal route from Columbia _ had to be ratified by the US Senate in
the Jimmy Carter era, and it passed, with enough Republican
support, because we used to have a bipartisan consensus on foreign
policy, all through the century, up to the Reagan presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The off-year elections of '78 saw the heavily financed right
wing outfits target and defeat five liberal Democratic senators,
using all sorts of wedge issues and red-baiting. The Senate became
a more hostile environment after that bit of business involving the
religious right and the anti-environmentalists of the Sagebrush
Rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   It went downhill a lot faster with Reagan's election in 1980,
and pitched straight down with the Gingrich Revolt of '94. When
Newt's Marauders took over the House, Congress became a toxic waste
dump. Dozens of veterans began parading out into retirement, rather
than face the petty irritations thrown up by the conservative
fundamentalists. Shutting down the government twice over
now-forgotten wrinkles in the perennial budget wrangles represented
the highwater mark _ or lowwater mark _ of the political tide.
</P>
<P>
   But the radioactive residue of the Newt era lingers on. The
Senate's refusal to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty, and the
House's refusal to vote symbolic support of America's fighting
forces while the Kosovo air war was underway, were two examples of
how badly ruptured is the US Congress these days.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives are not far off when they repeat their mantra
that ``Reagan won.'' Government has been widely discredited as an
agent of positive change. Reagan didn't win on the environment _
the children, thankfully, insist that their parents stop despoiling
the air and water and earth. But he won on taxes. The Old Gipper
may not have been much in the IQ department, but he figured out
people don't like to pay taxes. Just listen to the dreary recital
of how-I'd-slice-the-old-salami to give everyone a bigger share
that passes for the economic debate of the current presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The generic formula is: ``I'll do more for the children, the
elderly, the veterans, our brave GIs and for a cleaner environment
_ but I'll lower your taxes.'' You'd have to be a moron to believe
that, but millions will swallow that codswallop. Hey, it's a free
country. Still.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what made the world we enjoy today, living longer,
eating better, enjoying benefits unimaginable when our parents were
born. Freedom did it, the GIs did it, the government didn't screw
up too much, and we've learned not to take ourselves or our
politicians too seriously. Not a bad way to launch the next
century, even if I did screw up on the euro.

 &HT;    Toiling in `Proximity to Death'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing several important death
penalty cases this term.
</P>
<P>
   At least two could greatly affect the pace of executions in
Georgia, where about 120 people sit on death row.
</P>
<P>
   First, the high court will hear arguments as to whether the
electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment. And it will soon
issue a decision that could greatly restrict a death row inmate's
ability to challenge his sentence through the federal court system.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, historian William S. McFeely's
``Proximity to Death'' explores the imposition of the death penalty
in Georgia through the work of Stephen Bright and his fellow
lawyers and investigators at the Southern Center for Human Rights
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for his biography of
Ulysses S. Grant. He also won national awards for his 1991 book
about Frederick Douglass. He wrote ``Proximity to Death'' while
serving as the Richard B. Russell professor of American history at
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, McFeely does not hide his strong opposition to
capital punishment. He describes his book as ``a story of people
living in one corner of the country who carry a large
responsibility.'' The burden of the Southern Center's lawyers,
McFeely writes, is to ``keep each of their clients from the
ultimate expression of violence, the state killing its own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, McFeely was asked to provide expert testimony in the
case of Carzell Moore, convicted in a 1976 rape and murder of a
Cochran convenience store clerk. Bright, the Southern Center's
tireless director and one of the nation's most eloquent and vocal
opponents of capital punishment, asked McFeely to testify about the
meaning of the Confederate battle emblem, which is part of the
state flag. McFeely also testified about the relationship between
lynchings and racial violence in the past and the death penalty
today.
</P>
<P>
   Bright's motion, ultimately denied, claimed that racial
prejudice played a role in Moore's being charged with the death
penalty. (Moore is black; his victim, Teresa Allen, was white.)
</P>
<P>
   Impressed with Bright's legal work that day in the Sparta
courtroom, McFeely decided to chronicle the Southern Center's
uphill legal battles involving cases with heinous crimes,
innovative legal challenges and sometimes overly aggressive
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely writes that his book is not meant to persuade the reader
to adopt his view that the death penalty should be abolished. Yet
this appears to be one of his primary goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a nation capable of better to allow its states to take one
life as revenge for another life is to practice violence, not
combat it,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely, whose writing is vivid in its details and rich in
context, focuses primarily on three Southern Center clients. In the
case involving Tony Amadeo, convicted of a 1977 murder in Eatonton,
Bright won a new trial before the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision,
written by late Justice Thurgood Marshall, concluded that
prosecutors illegally _ and secretly _ kept blacks off the list of
potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely visits Amadeo, who is serving a life sentence at the
state prison in Buford, Ga. While imprisoned, Amadeo took
correspondence courses from Mercer University and graduated summa
cum laude. He gave the school's valedictory address from prison.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely offers Amadeo, 18 when he committed the murder, as
someone who can be convicted of a horrible crime and find
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   McFeely is at his best when writing about the trial and retrial
of William Brooks, convicted of the 1977 murder of Carol Jeannine
Galloway in Muscogee County. As a historian, McFeely uncovers a
surprising twist involving Brooks' first trial and its presiding
judge, John H. Land. As a reporter, McFeely takes the reader inside
the jury deliberation room during the retrial as jurors decide
whether Brooks should live or die.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate over the death penalty lingers on, the vast
majority of people in this country support it, according to polls.
``Proximity to Death'' allows the reader to consider what dedicated
lawyers will do to keep their clients off death row. In Brooks'
retrial, for example, Bright's investigators, Gay Nease and Mary
Eastland, went to extraordinary lengths in preparing for jury
selection. After names of potential jurors were published, they set
out to find out anything they could about them. They tried to find
out what churches they attended, whether they belonged to the NRA
or the NAACP. The investigators went to the county courthouse to
learn the appraised value of their homes, and even drove to each
potential juror's house and took a picture of it, all to find any
clue that a prospective juror was not wedded to the death penalty
as doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, ``Proximity to Death'' presents in fascinating
detail a wide array of legal strategies used by Southern Center
lawyers to combat the death penalty. But a problem with the book is
that McFeely can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a reporter
or an advocate. Slipping in and out of first-person commentary, he
tries too hard to be both.

 &HT;    Hiaasen's `Sick' tale a fun ride
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is, of course, a connection between the ex-drug dealer
obsessed with Barbie dolls and the swamp-dwelling recluse who uses
a dead buzzard's beak to carve the word ``shame'' into the naked
buttocks of the governor of Florida. But the connection leads
through the brain of author Carl Hiaasen, so it's better not to
ponder it too much.
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen, the leader in what his friend Dave Barry has called
``the Bunch of South Florida Wackos Genre,'' is back with his
eighth Miami noir novel, a comic romp that is thoroughly enjoyable,
if not quite up to the high standard Hiaasen has set with some of
his earlier works.
</P>
<P>
   The few characters here who aren't outright sociopaths are
businessmen so blinded with greed that they're more dangerous than
the psychos. The hero, in the technical sense, is one Twilly Spree,
who sounds more like an Evelyn Waugh refugee than a modern
eco-terrorist in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Spree is a rather low-level eco-terrorist,
following litterbugs down the highway and taking creative revenge.
But he gets a boost to the big leagues when he targets Palmer
Stoat, an oily lobbyist who's helping developers take over an
entire island. He kidnaps Stoat's pet Labrador (the ``sick puppy''
of the title, which might also refer to half the characters) and
then his wife. Plus there's the guy with the Barbie fetish who's
remaking real Euro-models into his own living dolls, a hit man who
listens to 911 tapes for jollies, a hooker who only does
Republicans, and way too many cigars.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw the movie ``Strip Tease,'' which was based on a
Hiaasen novel, forget it completely. His novels seethe with fury
against the despoilers of Florida, but his perverse comedy cuts the
message-mongering like cream cuts Kahlua. In his day job, Hiaasen
is an outrageous columnist for The Miami Herald (a large collection
of his columns, titled ``Kick Ass,'' was recently published by the
University of Florida Press). He is considerably more fun to read
than Elmore Leonard, but remains, after a decade of writing novels,
in that twilight of cult author who's on the verge of being
discovered big time. Discover him.

   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest

</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness, it arrives at
exactly the right time of year. (SM) 2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
like most flicks this time of year, ``Man'' moves swiftly for its
first 90 minutes, but it slows down to become a disappointingly
conventional love story that isn't really persuasive. The movie has
a heart, but a flagging pulse. (SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio, Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man Arnold
Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler
</P>
<P>
   and Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorceror's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' R (profanity and sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joe Mantegna,
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody and Ben Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Warmed-over chicken soup. Barry Levinson's movie about coming of
age in a Jewish neighborhood in 1950s Baltimore is generally
well-acted and sometimes evocative. His anecdotal reminiscences
concerning the Kurtzman brothers don't convey much that's fresh or
surprising. But Joe Mantegna delivers an unexpected dignity and a
nuanced self-knowledge as the boys' numbers-running father. (ERG) 2
hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' PG-13 (brief violent images,
</P>
<P>
   sexual content, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances O'Connor,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema's take on Jane Austen's third novel adds dollops
of lesbianism, feminism and social consciousness to Austen's
19th-century tale of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor girl
shipped off to live with her wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park.
Rozema extrapolates bits of Austen's journals into Fanny's own
writing, melding character and author. Rozema didn't seem to trust
her material. (ERG) 1 hour, 52 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger:
</P>
<P>
   The Story of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
swordplay slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM). 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) 1
hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. It's a ``once
upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature and
civilization. Boldly innovative yet eerily innocent, it's the sort
of thing you simply have to see for yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' PG-13 (profanity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and a scene of domestic discord)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer
</P>
<P>
   and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Give this one a tumble. Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown are
already generating Oscar buzz for their sensational performances in
this funny, heartfelt film. McTeer is a sassy Southerner with a
talent for finding the wrong men. Brown is her savvy adolescent
daughter who knows her mom's hit-and-run tactics all too well.
Sounds like ``Anywhere But Here,'' but it's a far more real, more
affecting work. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

 &HT;    Next century's big questions add up to zero
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who's received a zero knows failure. Indeed, a zero is
worse than failure. It's a negation of your efforts, a denial that
they even exist. Give me an ignominious F any day.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone comes to know failure sooner or later, but some few of
us make a grimmer acquaintance. Mine came early, in freshman
algebra class. To get a test back that you'd felt rather chipper
about and see on it a big, fat circle, a 0, is _ how to put it? _
discombobulating. Ten problems, every answer right. What's the deal
here?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was swift and direct. Something about methods of
proof not being clearly in evidence, not being set forth step by
step. I did 'em in my head, pal, with some scratching on the
margins. The answer's the bottom line. I make a hundred and you're
giving me a zero?
</P>
<P>
   Father Raymond Field was not a man to be toyed with, and the
appeal was quietly dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers attract the superstitious. Hotels skip the 13th floor,
going straight from 12 to 14, lest someone have a sleepless night.
Certain religious cults _ and I've never understood this _ have a
thing about 666.
</P>
<P>
   But no number in the West's history has been so freighted with
fear and trouble as zero. It is the number the West didn't want to
acknowledge and tried for centuries to reject. Seemingly innocent,
it lay at the heart of problems long before Y2K. It was an Eastern
idea that Christian thinkers equated with the abyss, with
nothingness. Not until the Middle Ages did Western mathematicians
give up the ghost of Aristotelian logic and incorporate zero into
their calculations _ an acceptance without which Isaac Newton (and,
concurrently, the German Gottfried Leibniz) could never have
discovered the calculus.
</P>
<P>
   A biblical prophecy of destruction
</P>
<P>
   ``Western civilization,'' Charles Seife writes in ``Zero: The
Biography of a Dangerous Idea'' (Penguin Putnam, $24.95),
``eventually had to make a choice between Aristotle and the Bible,
which says that the finite universe sprang forth from the void and
prophesies its ultimate destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   As natural as the arithmetic zero seems to us, ``for ancient
peoples it was a foreign _ and frightening _ idea.'' People dispute
the true end of the 20th century and the true beginning of the 21st
only because we count by 10s. But it wasn't always so. We first had
to accept the zero.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the millennium, Seife is only one of two writers
to have seized on the opportunity to show how the obvious isn't as
obvious as we think (the other is Robert Kaplan, author of ``The
Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero,'' published by Oxford).
Mathematicians, contrary to popular misconception, are often the
most lucid of writers (Bertrand Russell won a Nobel Prize not in
mathematics but in literature), and Seife is a welcome example. He
writes with an understated charm that takes account of human fear,
the mistakes of geniuses and the mind's grandest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Zero, as Seife writes, not only evokes the void. It also
``unhinges the laws of physics. It is at the zero hour of the big
bang and the ground zero of the black hole that the mathematical
equations that describe our world stop making sense.'' Yet it
cannot be ignored. ``Not only does zero hold the secret to our
existence, it will also be responsible for the end of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Eternity eventually gave way
</P>
<P>
   Even Einstein was wary of the nothingness of zero. The general
theory of relativity proved that the universe was not stable and
unchanging, but instead was either compressing or expanding.
Einstein could abide neither conclusion, and wanted to believe like
Aristotle that it was eternal. He adjusted his equations with a
cosmological constant that balanced compression and expansion _ a
fudging he later called ``the biggest mistake of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In the century now behind us, quantum physics gave us a
radically different understanding of the universe. At the beginning
of a new century, a small handful of powerful minds seeks nothing
less than the irrefutable explanation of our universe's beginning
and end. Seife cites the familiar words of Stephen Hawking: a
mathematical physics so complete ``we would know the mind of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are heresy on their face. But zero risked heresy from
the start, and now we confront it as infinity's twin, its equal but
also its opposite. ``The biggest questions in science and
religion,'' Seife writes, ``are about nothingness and eternity, the
void and the infinite.'' The number one cannot be raised to a
higher power. But zero is the number that transcends mathematics
itself.

 &HT;    A prevention doctors don't want: blocked calls to patients
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a family practitioner, Dr. Doris Robitaille
knows how frustrating it can be when technology turns on its users.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, she futilely attempted to return a page from parents
whose boy had smashed his head on a coffee table, only to be told
her call could not go through. She wanted to explain to the family
how to decide whether the 2-year-old needed stitches, and what to
do if it was a closed head injury, which can be serious.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit was a commonly used phone service that automatically
rejects calls from callers who have requested that their numbers
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Like most doctors, Robitaille has an unlisted number, and the
service, called anonymous call rejection, has repeatedly thwarted
her efforts and those of other doctors to return patients' calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me more when it's kids,'' Robitaille said. ``It's
not the kid's fault that the parents don't know how to unblock
their number.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no one interviewed could point to a medical catastrophe
resulting from this technological snafu, doctors are becoming
increasingly frustrated by the service. Some have even sent
strongly worded memos to their patients, telling them to deactivate
the service before they page a doctor or nurse.
</P>
<P>
   One of the selling points of the service is that it cuts down on
annoying calls from telemarketers. Southwestern Bell describes
anonymous call rejection as a ``very popular'' service that
``empowers customers to set their own privacy boundaries,''
according to the company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a downside.
</P>
<P>
   The company information does not mention that the service can
temporarily prevent a doctor from calling.
</P>
<P>
   About 54 percent of Austin-area homes have caller identification
devices, said a spokeswoman for Southwestern Bell, and 29 percent
of Austin-area homes have anonymous call rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors have unlisted numbers because if they don't, they
will get calls at home all the time. Instead, they use answering
services and take turns responding to after-hours calls.
</P>
<P>
   After Dr. Leigh Fredholm, a family practitioner, found she
couldn't return a few patients' calls from her home, she began
returning calls from her cellular telephone. ``I just make those
calls from my cell phone,'' Fredholm said. ``It's an ongoing
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Lowery, another spokeswoman for Southwestern Bell, said the
problem arises because people don't read the instructions when they
buy caller identification devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the (anonymous call rejection) service, you just
need to know how to turn it on and off if you are expecting a call
from doctors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Robitaille's case this fall, she finally called her answering
service back and asked an operator to call the boy's parents again
and tell them to deactivate their anonymous call blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lisa Savage, an Austin obstetrician-gynecologist, is with a
group of doctors who have given their patients a memo on
after-hours paging. The section on anonymous call rejection is
punctuated with exclamation marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not accept 'anonymous calls,' your telephone will
not even ring when we call you back!'' says Savage's memo. ``Please
be familiar with your caller ID features and know how to disable
the whole unit if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage said she is so frustrated with the problem she almost
questions the whole concept of anonymous call rejection. Many of
her patients don't even know they have the service, much less how
to disable it so doctors' calls can get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you it's been the bane of our communication ever
since its inception,'' Savage said. ``It was affecting our whole
practice.''

 &HT;    Reasonable goals, outside support are keys to making resolutions
stick
 &HT;    (For Sunday, Jan. 2.)
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's annual holiday letter from my friend, Susan,
concluded with her list of millennium resolutions: ``To travel,
clean out the garage, lose 20 pounds and get rid of some of the
junk I've accumulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Her list, she noted, is pretty much the same every year.
</P>
<P>
   Can't we all relate? It's kind of like being sent back to GO in
Monopoly. Chances are we'll have trouble keeping this year's
resolutions and will end up staring them in the face a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impulse to make resolutions, says Dayton psychologist
Judith Schwartzman, is a healthy and positive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a natural tendency toward growth, and that's a good
thing,'' she says. ``Each new year _ and especially this one _
represents a new beginning and is an opportunity to wipe the slate
clean and start fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   But we get tripped up, Schwartzman adds, because too often we
list things someone else wants us to do or things we feel we should
do but don't really want to do badly enough to change. ``We often
underestimate how difficult it is to change,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Changing familiar and comfortable habits is hard, even when they
aren't good for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``To change means life will be different,'' she says, ``and fear
goes along with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are methods that will help ensure
success.
</P>
<P>
   Barak Strickland of Beavercreek says he's learned that it's much
easier if you have some help and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I was struggling to get up in the morning and
begin the day as I desired with some quiet time and exercise,''
says Strickland, 36. Early in 1998, several men in his church began
meeting in a small discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we discussed the things we were struggling with, I shared
my lack of morning self-discipline along with my desire to get up
... on a regular basis for quiet time and exercise,'' Stickland
says. One of the men in the group volunteered to call him at 6 a.m.
every weekday to make sure he was up. ``We also agreed we would use
this time to share a few words of prayer together.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been two years now, and the phone still rings at 6 a.m.
every weekday, unless it's a holiday,'' Strickland reports. ``Our
friendship has grown tremendously, we have seen many prayers
answered and my days have been significantly more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to consider dropping your unreasonable
resolutions. My friend, Susan, for example, says she did eliminate
one from her annual list this year.
</P>
<P>
   She took off ``to win the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play it anymore, so it is highly unlikely
that I will win,'' she concludes. ``Though it's not really much
more unlikely than when I was playing!''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Judith Schwartzman offers these tips for keeping
your New Year's resolutions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Program yourself for success by starting with just one
resolution. Choose the one that is either most pressing or the one
that's easiest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set a realistic goal. Instead of committing to walk three
miles seven days a week, start by exercising 10-15 minutes five out
of seven days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider the timing. If you've just moved to a new city or
started a new job, you're under additional stress. This may not be
the best time to try to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledge each success. It will be reinforcing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reward yourself. Give yourself a verbal pat on the back,
social activity with a friend, something for your hobby _ like a
new exercise tape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get support from others. Join a health club, an organization
committed to the same goal; ask a friend or family member to be a
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect setbacks. There are going to be times you'll lapse into
old habits or won't be able to carry out your plan. Understand it's
part of the change process and not an excuse to give up.

<P>
   SCIENCE-CENTURY _ Every day, scientists in labs and field
stations pursue what may be the noblest and most meaningful of all
human activities: the quest for knowledge. They are trying to find
answers. But as the century turns, what are the most pressing
questions _ and how likely is it that they will be answered in the
21st century? How did life on Earth begin? Are we alone? How does
the brain work? How does a single fertilized cell become an
organism of trillions of specialized cells? Scientists provide a
roundup of some of the greatn unaswered science questions of the
century, as we ring in the new year. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-CALLBACKS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ As a family practitioner,
Dr. Doris Robitaille knows how frustrating it can be when
technology turns on its users. Last fall, she futilely attempted to
return a page from parents whose boy had smashed his head on a
coffee table, only to be told her call could not go through. The
culprit was a commonly used phone service that automatically
rejects calls from callers who have requested that their numbers
remain anonymous. Like most doctors, Robitaille has an unlisted
number, and the service, called anonymous call rejection, has
repeatedly thwarted her efforts and those of other doctors to
return patients' calls. (Thatcher, Austin American-Statesman)

pollution. (McCarthy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   PORTS-EXPANSION _ CHARLESTON, S.C._ Opposition is rising to the

Southeastern ports to expand and upgrade facilities to snare the
world's largest container ships, port officials in Charleston say

   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-STYLE _ Something about putting on shorts every night
for years and dribbling a ball before thousands changes the way a
performer reacts in front of crowds. The tension of stage fright,
common among those who act, play the concert piano _ or, in most
cases, run for public office _ is missing. The muscles donit
tighten in the same way and the face assumes a loose, locker-room
quality of disregard for the attention being focused on it. As much
as any of the traditional Democratic initiatives he proposes in his
platform, this low-key demeanor, epitomized by the throat lozenge
tumbling constantly in his mouth during his speeches, distinguishes
former Sen. Bill Bradley out on the stump. (Bradley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40.

</P>
<P>
   GA-AETNA-PRUDENTIAL _ ATLANTA _ Aetna appears to be on the verge
of getting final approval to acquire Prudential's health care
business in Georgia. But the deal has been overshadowed by
problems. The company is on the verge of being fined for late
payments to doctors and patients. At least one hospital is refusing
to treat patients insured by the company because it says Aetna is
lax in paying its bills. There are also customer service problems
that continue to plague Aetna, and the deal raises the question of
whether service will improve in light of its plans to acquire
Prudential. (Miller, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-RETURNS _ ATLANTA _ If Y2K comes and goes without a blip,
shoppers could ring in the New Year at refund counters. Retailers
that have seen a recent spike in sales of emergency supplies are
expecting a good bit of it to come back if New Year's Eve turns out
to be a non-event. Some retailers, like Sears and Ace Hardware, are
clamping down on customers who bring stuff back. Sears is charging
a 20 percent restocking fee on generators. Some Ace stores won't
take back any emergency supplies. Home Depot has a liberal policy
in general and could see the most refunds. Includes reports from
area stores. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   DOW-2000 _ If you're reading this, congratulations, it means you
survived Y2K. More to the point, it means you can probably look
forward to another good year of economic and stock market growth,
as amazing as that seems. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   &UR; OFFICIALS WARN OF JAMMED PHONE CIRCUITS AT MIDNIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't pick up the telephone at midnight tonight
just to see if it survived the Y2K rollover into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   That advice comes from telecommunications experts who worry that
a rash of New Year's telephone calls could jam circuits and prevent
urgent calls from getting through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that the network is engineered
for a certain amount of capacity and there are rare events in which
the calling patterns increase so dramatically, you could not get
through or you would get a busy signal,'' said Michael Powell, a
member of the Federal Communications Commission. ``This is not a
Y2K issue.'' Instead, he said, it's a congestion problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing we see every Mother's Day,'' Powell said.
Some people trying to call mom have instead received a fast busy
signal or a message saying that all circuits are busy and, please,
try again later.
</P>
<P>
   If people do need to make a call at midnight tonight and receive
such a message or a fast busy signal, Powell said they should wait
a few minutes and try again.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone operations won't be affected by any Y2K glitches,
according to Gerry Roth, a vice president at GTE Corp., because the
computers that make the calls lack computer chips that are
date-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call processing _ the ability to pick up your phone and make
the call to your neighbors _ is unaffected by the year 2000,'' said
Gerry Roth, a vice president at GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   However, telephone company computers that generate bills for
customers are date-sensitive. The telecommunications industry in
the United States has spent $3.6 billion to make sure those
computers can properly read the digits ``00'' as the year 2000
rather than the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, those computers might send incorrect bills to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with not ``testing'' the phones at midnight, Powell also
urged telephone users to avoid testing the emergency-911 number to
see if it's working. Again, it's a question of overloading the
system.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Powell said it's a good idea to keep the
seven-digit telephone numbers of the local police, fire and
ambulance services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a way to call the police, to call ambulance services
long before 911,'' Powell said.
</P>

A TV EVENT FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the clock strikes 12, the future will arrive! In science
fiction and in popular superstition, the 21st century has long
signified the dark dawning of a sterile new age, a major
post-technological, post-informational, post-emotional something or
other. After Friday night, it will signify little more than a new
Month-At-A-Glance, and maybe a bit of a hangover. That was why the
Wachowskis set their futuristic blockbuster, ``The Matrix,'' in the
22d century. They knew the 21st was on the way to passe.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be television's style to let this major perceptual
shift occur without massive fanfare, now would it? Particularly
because surveys show that most of us plan to pass the apocalypse
quietly at home, greeting the future in the electronic warmth of
the global hearth. TV will milk the changing of the millennium for
all it's worth, with more ``statement'' programming and
oh-so-momentous news coverage than seems possible. Indeed, in a
rare feat, almost every single TV outlet will have the exact same
thing on its mind, as channels ranging from TBS and CNN to TCM and
MTV pay homage to the worldwide event in their own ways. Even the
Cartoon Network is joining the fray. Its choice? ``The Jetsons,''
natch.
</P>
<P>
   What will be on your screen at the moment the future arrives?
Here is a partial listing of options _ and there are many. Alas, a
few sound as exciting as Jerry Lewis's Labor Day telethon, so be
sure to keep your remote at hand. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Realism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Will he make it? Watching Peter Jennings survive 24 hours on
TV may be more interesting than ABC's Life-magazine-esque survey of
world cultures, past, present, and future. The idea is that
Jennings will anchor the endless broadcast, and cut to reporters
like Barbara Walters and Sam Donaldson and performers like Elton
John and Andrea Bocelli in farflug places around the globe. The
``ABC 2000'' celebration begins at 4:50 a.m., and along its merry
way it will pay Dick Clark a visit for his Times Square countdown.
Go ahead, Peter, yawn.
</P>
<P>
   --CBS is taking more of a piecemeal approach. Today's news shows
will focus on things millennium, and news briefs anchored by Dan
Rather will pop in and out of regular programming every hour after
11 a.m. David Letterman's ``Late Show'' will air at the early time
of 8 p.m., followed inexplicably at 9 by a collection of special
moments in Grammy Award history. Then, at 10, the network will
shift into a three-hour special called ``America's Millennium,''
including live coverage of a Washington, D.C., gala featuring Will
Smith and a short film by Steven Spielberg. Oh yes, and a
Billennium address by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   --After expanding ``The Today Show'' to three hours, NBC will
pepper its regular programming with hourly remarks from
correspondents around the world. At 8 p.m., ``Dateline'' will offer
up predictions for the next millennium (how about: ``newsmagazines
will become extinct'') and at 9, Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw will
host the two-hour report ``Millennium Special.'' You know, Y2K
developments, celebrities spouting timeless profundities, and so
on. After local news at 11, and a monologue by Jay Leno on ``The
Tonight Show'' at 11:35, the network will head over to Times Square
for millennium mania until 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   --Does Fox, home of ``The World's Wildest Police Videos'' and
``Greed,'' have taste and restraint? Tonight, anyway, the network
is restricting its coverage to a 90-minute show called ``Fox
2000,'' with Paula Zahn and Brit Hume anchoring from Times Square.
Expect the Red Hot Chili Peppers in LA, the Neville Brothers in New
Orleans, and Y2K updates from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   --Pax TV, the network that thrives on reruns of ``Touched by an
Angel,'' is hipping itself up today with ``Millennium Live:
Humanity's Broadcast,'' beginning at 6 a.m. from Fiji. The 24-hour
broadcast features celebrations in 24 time zones, with performances
by Aerosmith, 'N Sync, the Bee Gees, the Spice Girls, and Santana,
and it will wind up in Hawaii. Technically, the show is produced by
an international consortium of broadcasters and Pax TV is the US
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-four hours? Big deal. PBS one-ups ABC and Pax TV with a
25-hour live special, beginning at 4:40 a.m. Called ``Millennium
2000,'' it will mark the new year every hour from a different
place, including the South Pole. Look for concert performances
along the way by Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt, and Sting, and a freedom
celebration with Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   --OK, CNN, you win. The cable channel's ``CNN Millennium 2000''
project will last for a whopping 100 hours and employ some 60
correspondents, beginning at 5 a.m. and ending on Tuesday morning.
After the first 24 hours, coverage will move from the New Year's
celebrations to reports on the last 1,000 years and guesses about
the future. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Escapism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to avoid the timely hype, then travel no
further than cable, where time never seems to matter anyway. Cable
is TV's archive, from the rock moments on VH1 to the film festivals
on American Movie Classics. And so many of these channels will mine
their catalogs for some witty, gimmicky, and self-promotional New
Year's Eve programming.
</P>
<P>
   --The Cartoon Network takes the clever prize, as it continues to
air episodes of ``The Jetsons'' nonstop until midnight. The
Hanna-Barbera series gives us a stereotypical American family in
the century we're about to enter, with utterly fantastic gadgetry
like talking computers and videophones. ``The Jetsons'' as
prophecy? I'll believe it when I meet Rosie the maid.
</P>
<P>
   --At the other end of the cartoon spectrum, Comedy Central is
airing a four-episode ``South Park'' minimarathon. Those
trash-talking kids would eat Elroy for dinner. Tonight they'll ply
their subversive trade from 10 to just before midnight, when the
channel will go ``live'' to South Park, Colo., for a bleeping
countdown.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're anxious about the start of the new millennium, you
won't find a more soothing, down-home figure than Andy Taylor,
loving dad, shrewd sheriff, respectful nephew, and all-round local
Buddha figure. TBS is airing back-to-back episodes of ``The Andy
Griffith Show'' until midnight, when the station loses the rights
to broadcast the series. Food for thought: What would Otis look
like the morning after his millennial New Year's fun?
</P>
<P>
   --Turner Classic Movies pays homage to the Most Famous Hip
Shaker and Bloated Icon of the Millennium, also known as Elvis
Presley. ``Rockin' in the New Year with Elvis'' is an eight-movie
King-a-thon, including ``Girl Happy,'' ``Jailhouse Rock'' and
``Viva Las Vegas.'' The festivities begin at 2 p.m. with ``The
Trouble with Girls.'' Memo to TCM: Thangyouverymuch.
</P>
<P>
   --Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk. After a 10:05 p.m. airing of ``A Shot in the
Dark,'' Blake Edwards's second Inspector Clouseau movie, American
Movie Classics will begin a four-hour ``Three Stooges Marathon.''
It's hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   --The Movie Channel is doling out horror thrills for those who
want to cloak themselves in denial on the eve of a possible
worldwide infrastructural disaster. Starting at 6 p.m., the ``Y2K
Go Away'' marathon features eight movies in the ``Friday the 13th''
series, finishing up with ``Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes
Manhattan'' at 4:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   --Meanwhile, beginning at 8 p.m., Showtime will be doing its
best to raise apocalypse fever with an ``End of the World
Marathon,'' including the movies ``Hard Rain,'' ``Deep Impact,''
and, at midnight, the 1998 remake of ``Godzilla.'' They named it
after that R.E.M. song, ``It's the End of the World as We Know It
(and I Feel Terrified).''
</P>
<P>
   --Bugged by the whole Y2K enchilada? The Discovery Channel is
running a seven-hour marathon of documentaries on bugs, from ants
and killer bees to cannibal mites and tarantulas. The swarm of
shows begins at 7 p.m. Can't wait for the bloodsucking parasites.
</P>
<P>
   --For real creeps, and intelligent creeps, of course, you can't
do better than ``The Twilight Zone.'' Beginning at 9 a.m., The
Sci-Fi Channel is airing ``Twilight Zone _ Chain Reaction,'' a
20-episode marathon of Rod Serling's classic modern-nightmare
series. The midnight episode is ``I Sing the Body Electric,'' in
which a widower buys his children a grandmother who isn't quite
human. Rosie the maid, I presume? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rockism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to a concert this decade, never mind this
year, you can make up for it tonight. While most of the
telethon-styled network shows will include musical clips within
their overall millennial coverage, one or two outlets know what
really matters.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you think Whatshisname will sing ``1999''? And will he
change the lyrics from ``like'' to ``'cause''? ``The RAVE un2 The
Year 2000'' showcases The Artist in a pay-per-view concert from his
Paisley Park Studio in Minneapolis, at 10 p.m. Guests include the
Family Stone, the Time, and Mavis Staples. By the way, the Artist
won't be working up much of a sweat tonight: the concert was
recorded on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   --Par-tay, dudes! ``MTV 2 Large'' does justice to the Millennium
bash from MTV's Time Square Studio with a few hot teenybopper acts
in attendance, including Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys,
98 Degrees, and others. Also, Puff Daddy, arrested on a weapons
charge this week, is still planning to appear. And the beat goes
on, beginning at 5 p.m. &QL; 
 &QL; 
For kids
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --An online poll will determine the specific shows to be aired
on ``Z2K: Zoogin' New Yearz Eve Party,'' a five-hour marathon of
the young people's choice on the Disney Channel beginning at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   --A 24-hour commercial-free documentary called ``Nickellennium''
will begin on Nickelodeon at midnight. Kids from around the world
will share fears and fantasies about the future.

   By now you must be thinking about getting decked out for New
Year's Eve. C'mon, you're just itching to pull out that tux or gown
from the closet, break out the top-shelf jewelry and head out to
that elegant evening that will ring out the decade, century and, if
you insist, the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What? No? What do you mean no?
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, me neither. And we are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Television executives from New York to Hollywood are giggling,
as the night heralded for years as the Party to End All Parties
looks more and more like the Night to Scan All Channels.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have consistently shown that seven out of 10 people
will be at home _ theirs or someone else's _ for the final
countdown of the 1900s. Big-budget events have largely been a bust.
People have chosen the Barcalounger over the luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, cruise to the equator. Hello, Dick Clark. And Peter
Jennings, Tom Brokaw, David Letterman ...
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will be home, some with friends, watching to see if
Jennings can complete his quest to anchor a 24-hour ABC broadcast
solo (with help from correspondents ranging from Barbara Walters in
Paris to Diane Sawyer in New Zealand).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the networks will be doing millennial coverage, with an
emphasis on what is happening throughout the world. CNN is looking
to trump everyone with 100 hours of global reports.
</P>
<P>
   But the most inspired scheduling comes out of WSBK Channel 38 in
Boston, a UPN affiliate: a ``Three Stooges'' marathon. There is
something deeply artistic about this programming choice. (No, I
don't know what it is. But I like it.)
</P>
<P>
   We will watch TV tonight, even in houses where there are
parties, even in houses where parents without sitters are helpless
to prevent toddlers from pilfering cookies behind our backs, going
into sugar-induced mass hysteria and embarking on a rampage that
will make the Huns look like Girl Scouts. ... Wait, wait. Sorry.
That will just be my house. Let's start again.
</P>
<P>
   We will watch, even in houses where there are parties, because
that is what we are trained to do. We want to see the ball go down.
We want to see other people in tuxedos and gowns.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see the millions in Times Square, half-wishing we
were there, more than half glad we are smart enough not to freeze
our ... noses off for the off-chance of getting our mugs on
television for one-eighth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   And we will watch for one reason more, one more serious, serious
reason.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what is going to happen. Forget the ``Y2K: The
Movie'' scenarios of nuclear meltdowns and chaos in the streets as
the result of computer screw-ups. My home computer is dead meat,
but widespread failures _ at least in the United States _ are not
that likely.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the terrorists and lone nutbags? Seattle has already
canceled its New Year's celebration out of security concerns. Could
terrorists possibly strike _ where? New York? London? Jerusalem?
Moscow?
</P>
<P>
   If something happens (I want to remain optimistic enough not to
use when), television will be all over it, instantaneously. We no
longer wonder at the live report from any corner of the globe; we
expect it. Hopefully the stories will be about celebrations in the
street, of fears unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, come midnight we will watch. Joyous and
apprehensive.

DISNEY SCORES WITH `FANTASIA/2000'

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fantasia'' is back, and it's bigger than ever. Louder and more
technically advanced, too.
</P>
<P>
   But better?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: If Walt Disney's 59-year-old effort to
marry classical music with cartoon animation was kitsch that later
generations mistook for cinematic art, future audiences may
consider ``Fantasia/2000'' art. What it is at the moment is a
state-of-the-sciences introduction to great and marginally great
music for kids, a good deal of fun and not quite as imaginative as
you'd like it to be.
</P>
<P>
   And, as mentioned, ``F2K'' is big. It's screening exclusively at
IMAX theaters through the end of April, including a brand spanking
new one that the Disney company built just for this run off the 405
Freeway at the Howard Hughes Parkway, down around where Culver City
meets Westchester. The movie should hit standard-size screens later
this year, but a key part of the experience _ except in the forlorn
case of one segment _ is seeing the beautifully wrought drawing
dance across, practically, your entire field of vision. ``F2K'' is
the first non-documentary, feature-length production presented in
IMAX, and it certainly doesn't waste the medium's capacity for
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Depth is a somewhat different matter. ``F2K,'' which contains
seven new animated segments and the Mickey Mouse ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice'' sequence from the original, gets off to an impressive
start with computerized bits from the first ``Fantasia'' flying
around a studio where the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, under the
leadership of James Levine, is tuning up for the upcoming toons.
This leads into the film's most abstract and arguably most
successful segment, a semi-psychedelic symphony of light and
patterns set to Beethoven's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Then we get Steve Martin, the first and funniest of several
segment hosts, pushing his two-week master musician study course
and introducing a variation _ to put it mildly _ on Respighi's
``Pines of Rome.'' No Italian trees in sight in this heavily
computerized vision of flying whales romping through arctic seas
and skies. Marked by rich cloud and water formations and stunning
perspective shifts, it's an accomplished presentation that never
quite transcends its visual origins, which can basically be found
at any tourist gallery on the island of Maui.
</P>
<P>
   The film's approach to Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' is
certainly apt. Based on the flat line drawings of celebrity
caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, it follows several residents of
Depression-era New York through their day and daydreams.
Conceptually inspired all the way around, but the characters'
adventures unfortunately add up to very little.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better put-together pieces sets Hans Christian
Anderson's ``The Steadfast Tin Soldier'' to a section of
Shastakovich's second piano concerto. Though much of it is
computer-generated, this particular toy story has a richly shaded
and colored, classic animation look, plus a fast, eventful and
wonderfully sustained pace.
</P>
<P>
   Low points immediately follow. A quick thing involving flamingos
and a yo-yo set to Saint-Saens seems like so much animal slapstick
_ and it can't help but compare unfavorably with the lyrically
loony hippo ballet from the first ``Fantasia.'' But just when
they've got you longing nostalgically, up comes ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' which, all splotchy and grainy on the humongous
screen, becomes that forlorn piece mentioned earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``F2K'' somewhat regains its footing in the stretch, with an
amusing Donald Duck as Noah's assistant ark-filler while some
``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches play. Things crescendo with
another mystical/environmental/New Agey bit, in which a water
sprite accidentally awakens Stravinsky's Firebird and sees her
forest turned to ash. Like most of the new film's segments, this
one echoes a piece from the original _ the genuinely chilling
``Night on Bald Mountain'' _ and seems to echo it faintly at that.
</P>
<P>
   But even if ``F2K'' doesn't initially sing to us as vibrantly as
we felt ``Fantasia'' did, it certainly does not lack the kind of
artistry that could resonate with future viewings and future
audiences. And there can be no question that as much care and love
went into creating this extension of Disney's dream as Uncle Walt
lavished on his first, now-classical-by-consensus attempt. &QL;

YES, `VIRGINIAN': BILL PULLMAN RIDES THE COWBOY WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Bill Pullman in
a scene from ``The Virginian.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Somehow Bill Pullman comes across as a city slicker.
 &HT;    Maybe it's because his most memorable roles were as urban types
in ``The Last Seduction'' (l994), ``While You Were Sleeping''
(l995) and ``Independence Day'' (l996).
 &HT;    But appearances can be deceptive. When he's not on screen,
Pullman prefers to spend his days on horseback or building corrals
on the 1,000-acre-plus spread he and his brother own in Montana.
 &HT;    So it shouldn't be surprising _ though it is _ to see Pullman
riding tall in the saddle in one of Hollywood's ultimate cowboy
roles, the title character in a new version of ``The Virginian''
that will air on Turner Network Television on Jan. 9.
 &HT;    And he isn't just riding _ besides starring in the classic
Western, Pullman has also directed and produced the film, which
co-stars Diane Lane, Dennis Weaver and John Savage.
 &HT;    It's only the latest step onward and upward for the 45-year-old
Pullman, a onetime bit player who has gradually eased himself up to
featured roles and, finally, to leading-man status.
 &HT;    It was during the shooting of ``Independence Day'' that TNT
executives asked Pullman about ``The Virginian,'' dangling the
chance to direct as an added inducement.
 &HT;    ``I was flattered when they said, `We think you're the guy
living now who should play the padirect,''' he recalls. ``So
I read the book and thought, `This could be good _ it could also be
scary.'''
 &HT;    ``The Virginian'' has a long Hollywood track record. Owen
Wister's l902 novel, ``The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains,''
was first filmed in l914, with Dustin Farnum starring under the
direction of Cecil B. DeMille. In l923 it was remade with Kenneth
Harlan, and six years later Gary Cooper climbed into the
Virginian's saddle. Joel McCrea played the role in l946, and from
l962 to 1971 it was a television staple with James Drury in the
lead.
 &HT;    Now it's Pullman's turn to play the man who has left his native
state to seek his fortune in the wild West. Therels in love
with Molly Stark (Lane) _ and vigorously pursues her, unlike the
traditional cowboy who allegedly would rather kiss hi.
 &HT;    ``I knew it had started all these conventions,'' Pullman says,
relaxing in a suite at the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills.
``But it didn't seem conventional at its core at all _ it seemed
darker than even what TNT remembered it was.
 &HT;    ``I had thought cowboy heroes are men of few words and shy with
the ladies,'' the actor says. ``The ladies make the advances,
traditionally, and they reluctantly go along with it. He was the
opposite _ he's direct and colorful, and takes on the quest of
pursuing the girl against her incredible ability to say, `I don't
think so.'''
 &HT;    Besides, the role gave him a chance to play cowboy, a longtime
passion.
 &HT;    ``When we were kids,'' he recalls, ``my dad's idea of a vacation
for us was to put all of us kids out on the farm, and from eighth
grade onwards that's the way I'd spend my summer vacations.''
 &HT;    From that early experience grew an abiding love of the legends
of the West.
 &HT;    ``Westerns are kind of like America's Shakespeare,'' Pullman
says. ``They are tales of people in conflict with the land, with
each other and with themselves.''
 &HT;    The affable actor grew up in Hornell, N.Y., the youngest of
seven children of a taciturn doctor, and was himself painfully shy.
 &HT;    ``I had no social skills,'' he recalls. ``I didn't date, and I
was a really gawky kid.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in an environment where my dad was in medicine and
all the family were caregivers,'' he adds. ``We were always
conflicted, never allowed to show emotion in public. We had a sense
of keeping things subdued. It was important to keep that
British-style stiff upper lip, maintain balance _ otherwise we
would get out of control.
 &HT;    ``It was all very restraining.''
 &HT;    Acting would be his way around those restraints, but even during
college, as he studied architectural engineering, he admits that he
still felt no sense of direction.
 &HT;    ``There was a period in my life where I didn't think I'd ever
find out what I was supposed to do with myself,'' he says.
 &HT;    Finally a gifted drama teacher sparked his interest in acting.
Pullman switched to a theater major, earned a bachelor's degree in
theater arts and then began teaching drama at Montana State
University in Bozeman.
 &HT;    From there he went to New York, where he found stage work, and
then to Los Angeles in quest of a film career. His first movie role
was as a stupid crook in ``Ruthless People'' (l986), followed a
year later by a bit part in Mel Brooks' ``Spaceballs.''
 &HT;    ``The Accidental Tourist'' (l988) gave him his first role as
``the nice guy who never gets the girl,'' with similar roles
following in ``Singles'' (l992), ``Sleepless in Seattle'' (l993)
and ``Sommersby'' (l993).
 &HT;    In l995, however, he actually landed leading lady Sandra Bullock
in ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and won Ellen DeGeneres' hand in
the disappointing ``Mr. Wrong'' (l996). Then came ``Independence
Day,'' with Pullman as the fighter-pilot/president who, with a
little help from Will Smith, saves the world.
 &HT;    Acting, he says, gave his life direction and, as a byproduct,
helped him overcome his shyness to the point that today he is in
real life exactly the sort of easygoing guy he so often plays
onscreen.
 &HT;    ``Acting got me out of myself,'' Pullman says. ``I could feel
rage as an actor, and express directness which in my family had
been weeded out and suppressed.''
 &HT;    Since finishing ``The Virginian,'' th has made two
independent movies, ``History is Made at Night'' and ``The
Guilty.''
 &HT;    The former, shot in Finland, is a quirky look at the world of
espionage.
 &HT;    ``I'm a James Bond/CIA type who is put out to pasture,'' the
actor explains. ``He's living in Helsinki, looking for work and
hoping that, in that remote corner of the world, nothing too
exciting is going to happen. He knows a low-level Russian operative
in the same area in this time of no Cold War, and then all of a
sudden things erupt.''
 &HT;    ``The Guilty,'' shot in Vancouver, casts Pullman as a lawyer
about to be named a judge when a story surfaces about an alleged
rape. Co-starring are English actresses Joanne Whalley _ formerly
Mrs. Val Kilmer, and known then as Joanne Whalley-Kilmer _ and
Gabrielle Anwar.
 &HT;    Offscreen, Pullman is married to dancer Tamara Hurwitz. The two
have three children _ Maesa, Jack and Louis, ages 6 to ll. He likes
to spend time on the vast family cattle ranch in Montana, not far
from another owned by actor Peter Fonda and an even bigger one
owned by Fonda's sister Jane and his brother-in-law, TNT honcho Ted
Turner.
 &HT;    ``There I get to be a cowboy and brush shoulders with the guys
who are making their principal living that way,'' the actor says,
chuckling. ``I risk becoming the laughing stock of the valley.
 &HT;    ``But getting away up there with my family and my brothers does
provide us a way to have our families together and be in contact
with the land and agriculture,'' he adds. ``We can put out the hay
and vaccinate the cows.
 &HT;    ``I was never one for taking vacations sitting on a beach and
reading,'' Pullman concludes. ``I'm happy doing something more
physical.''

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of ``X-Files''
composer Mark Snow.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nestled behind a suspiciously charming house in Santa Monica,
Calif., Mulder and Scully's silent partner is hard at work.
 &HT;    And no, we're not talking about X, Deep Throat, Jeffrey Spender
or even the Cigarette-Smoking Man.
 &HT;    Walk across the front lawn, through a side gate and past the
pool, and you'll enter a hospitable little building, a.k.a. ``Snow
Tunes.'' And from a dark room, lit only by the shafts of light cast
off by a football game on television, emerges a bearded man in blue
jeans, a black T-shirt and an ``X-Files'' baseball cap.
 &HT;    His name is Mark Snow, and he's the man who scores and performs
all the music heard on ``The X-Files.'' His other credits include
the now-defunct ``Millennium'' and ``Harsh Realm,'' as well as such
films and television movies as ``Crazy in Alabama,'' ``Disturbing
Behavior,'' ``Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' and, of
course, ``The X-Files: Fight the Future.''
 &HT;    ``This is where it all happens,'' Snow says, settling into a
chair and waving to indicate his beloved Synclavier, the
synthesizer he uses to create all those eerie sounds. ``On average
there's about 30 minutes of music per episode _ though, as time has
gone on, we've done as much as 40 minutes for a 44-minute episode.
 &HT;    ``If I have to really deliver and jam on something, 10 minutes a
day is doable,'' he adds. ``That's kind of pushing it, though. Five
days is comfortable to do 30 to 33 minutes. Three days is a little
irritating, but it can be done.''
 &HT;    The process begins when Snow receives a script, which he reads
to get a feeling for what's to come. Upon receiving the unsweetened
final cut of an actual episode, he determines how best to color it
musically.
 &HT;    Then, after a music editor provides him with the show's
``spotting'' _ where the music should stop and start, and its
length _ Snow creates the music, generally a blend of moody strings
and synthesizer, as well as vocal sounds and sound effects.
 &HT;    ``I like to start with a real meaty cue that's possibly in Act
Four or toward the end, and they can run for five to 10 minutes,''
he says. ``That's pretty amazing. These `X-Files' music cues, for
whatever reason, have developed into long pieces.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``A friend of mine is a music editor on `Roswell,''' he says,
``and the composer said, `Well, I think we need a Mark Snow here.'
He said, `What do you mean by that?' And the composer said, `Oh,
you know, a 10-minute cue.'
 &HT;    ``It had nothing to do with musical style, but with length.''
 &HT;    Series creator Chris Carter, like most of the show's directors,
tends to give Snow free rein. Such license allows Snow to feel
``uninhibited,'' and likely has played a key role in his earning
four Emmy Award nominations for his ``X-Files'' efforts alone.
 &HT;    To date, the composer points to ``Post-Modern Prometheus'' and
``The Ghosts Who Stole Christmas'' as his personal favorite
``X-Files'' scores. He also enjoyed stepping out from behind his
home console to lead an 85-piece orchestra through the score of the
``X-Files'' feature during several sessions at a recording studio.
 &HT;    With ``The X-Files'' in its seventh and apparently final season,
Snow is hoping to be able to concentrate on film scores. Still,
he's grateful for everything that ``The X-Files'' has done for him
and, for that matter, for television and film composers in general.
 &HT;    ``I think that most of the time people take music for granted,''
Snow says. ``I've had an unusual experience with `The X-Files.'
 &HT;    ``The Internet was coming into its own when the show started,''
he explains. ``I've gotten a lot of fan mail over the Internet, and
I've also visited the chat rooms, and all of that has let me know
that what I'm doing is really appreciated.
 &HT;    ``There are also film-score magazines and film-score critics,''
he adds. ``Some of the magazines are pretentious and some of them
are terrific, and some guy will love something I do, while some
other guy will knock me.''
 &HT;    Snow tugs on his ``X-Files'' cap.
 &HT;    ``Really, that's OK,'' he says. ``It all just tells me that more
people are paying more attention to music than ever before. And
that's what's important.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last day of the millennium will be dry across most of the
nation as fast west-to-east jet stream suppress moist air over the
Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In the Northeast, sinking air
currents associated with high pressure near Maine will bring ample
sunshine and cooler conditions to New England and the Great Lakes.
Clouds will graze the northern Middle Atlantic Seaboard on Friday
morning. The clouds will dissipate by the afternoon as developing
breezes from the north direct drier air into the region. Clear
skies and temperatures in the middle 30s will greet New Year's Eve
revelers in New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly sunny skies and seasonably warm conditions will
cover much of the southern states from Arizona to the Gulf and
Southeast coasts. A weak jet stream disturbance crossing the
interior Southeast will cause scattered light showers from northern
Alabama to the southern Appalachians. Farther south, Florida will
stay mainly clear and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers will accompany low pressure and its attendant cold
front crossing the upper Mississippi Valley. A paucity of moisture
will insure that the snow showers will be light so little
accumulation is expected. Noticeably colder air will arrive over
the region Friday night as the front passes southward.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and patchy showers will affect the Northwest coast as
onshore breezes direct moist air inland from the Pacific. Dense fog
will persist in the Snake River Valley of Idaho while scattered
clouds and isolated showers accompany a jet stream disturbance in
southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Past Century
</P>
<P>
   Although the climate from year to year can seem chaotic, the
temperature patterns during the past 100 years across the United
States exhibit long-term trends. The 1900s will end punctuated by
their two warmest years, but the path to the warmth has been
uneven. The coldest winter on record for the nation was just 20
years ago in 1979. Despite the warmth of recent years, the hottest
summer occurred in 1931. In general, the first 40 years of the
century showed a notable warming trend. The period from 1940 to
mid-1970s cooled. For the last 20 years, a marked warming has been
underway.

ARE CALENDARS RELEVANT? TIME WILL TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of a new millennium _ or not _ it's worth remembering
what Albert Einstein told us.
</P>
<P>
   Time is relative.
</P>
<P>
   For computers and other number-driven devices, the numerical
millennium does begin precisely when the digits click over to that
first microsecond or nanosecond or eensy-teeny-weenier second that
will mark the first Y2K moment, Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of cyberspace, however, our millennial celebrations will
have to tolerate a very unscientific and much lower level of
precision.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars were created by humankind based on astronomical,
seasonal and daily cycles. They've since been repeatedly corrupted
and adjusted to accommodate all sorts of religious, political and
social objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a scientist, there's no point in celebrating an arbitrary
calendar system,'' said Woodruff Sullivan, an astronomy professor
at the University of Washington. ``But that's not the point
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as we can't help noting when our automobile odometer flips
over to 100,000 miles, Sullivan said, we shouldn't resist getting
excited about our calendar hitting the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new beginning,'' he said. ``It's a good excuse for a
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there will be complications.
</P>
<P>
   We need to ignore the fact that, by international convention,
the official beginning of every new year on Earth always starts in
Greenwich, England _ known as Greenwich Mean Time or Coordinated
Universal Time. In that sense, Jan. 1, 2000, hits the planet at 4
p.m. tomorrow Seattle time.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, officially, this isn't the new millennium,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive-compulsive types among us have been having fits
trying to get everyone to recognize that the ``real'' start of our
calendar's third millennium doesn't begin for another year _ not
until Jan. 1, 2001 _ thanks to a sixth-century Russian monk named
Dionysius Exiguus (Latin for Dennis the Short).
</P>
<P>
   The glitch perpetuated now for two millennia by Diminutive
Dennis was created by the European ignorance of zeroes (an Arabic
mathematical invention that we all eventually adopted). They had
zero knowledge of zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the Christian calendar starts at year one,'' said
Hillel Schwartz, author of ``Century's End'' and an associate
member of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis started the calendar at 1 A.D., after designating the
preceding year 1 B.C., to center the calendar on the birthdate of
Christ. Besides screwing up the annual accounting system, Dennis
didn't even start in the right place. Scholars now say Christ was
born at least four years earlier, about 4 B.C. or so.
</P>
<P>
   Our calendar is off-target about the millennium on both
religious and numerical grounds, Schwartz said, but so what?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no calendar date for which we have an absolute date
of origin that is incontestable, even in astronomical terms,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows precisely when the Big Bang happened, he said, so
why worry about when our calendar started?
</P>
<P>
   ``The change from 1999 to 2000 is far more significant in our
cultural experience.... It's a magical change,'' Schwartz said. We
make sense of our lives by marking the passage of time, he said,
and changing those first two digits represents something profound.
</P>
<P>
   He notes this is the first time in history that a new century
will begin with a dominant calendar shared around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Western world's calendar, also known as the Christian or
Gregorian (after Pope Gregory) calendar, has become the
international date-keeping standard, just as English has become the
international language.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this century, some nations resisted adoption of the
Gregorian calendar because of its Catholic origin. The Russian
Bolshevik revolution of 1917 was called the October Revolution
based on the Russian calendar. Based on a U.S. or Western Europe
calendar, it would have been the November Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Today's international acceptance of the Gregorian calendar,
however, doesn't mean it's the only calendar around. There are at
least 40 other calendars in use worldwide _ a few of which are
already working on their fifth, sixth or even eighth millenniums,
by the way.
</P>
<P>
   But go ahead and celebrate this particular millennium. It
doesn't get any clearer the deeper you look into how we keep track
of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about time, really we don't know what we're
talking about at all,'' said Louis Wolcher, a University of
Washington law professor and part-time philosopher who recently won
a prestigious international contest of wits in Weimar, Germany,
focused on the meaning of time.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar is one way of marking time. What is it exactly that
we are marking when we mark time?
</P>
<P>
   When Einstein said time was relative, Wolcher noted, he was
referring to a new way of thinking about time as a point of
reference or as a measurement of motion or distance in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never said what time is, in the sense that it might
exist independent of the measurement,'' Wolcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The only way we can think of time, he said, is by measuring it.
But what, he and other philosophers have pondered, are we
measuring?
</P>
<P>
   Does time move, as when ``time flies?'' If time moves, Wolcher
said, how can there be a past, present and future? That is, if time
existed in the past and moved into the present, what moved? Is it
now gone from the past, or is the time that was past still there in
the past?
</P>
<P>
   Or is time a linear progression, a time line or even a moving
line like a river? That ultimately doesn't work too well either,
Wolcher said, when we get to the point of trying to identify what
the line or river is made of.
</P>
<P>
   All this may sound like semantic nonsense, Wolcher said, but
understanding time remains one of the fundamental questions of
humankind _ right up there with the meaning of life and why toast
always falls buttered side down.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling with this question in his essay, ``Time's Language,''
Wolcher won a second place award from Germany's Goethe Institute
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,500 writers and philosophers worldwide were asked by
the Institute to competitively ponder a topic of millennial
significance: ``Liberating the Past from the Future? Liberating the
Future from the Past?'' First place went to Ivesta Gerasimchuk of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Wolcher took second essentially by arguing that this wasn't the
right question.
</P>
<P>
   So, is it absurd to celebrate the millennium _ this hopelessly
flawed and crude estimate of time _ especially if we don't even
know what time is or what it measures?
</P>
<P>
   ``At one level, I'm tempted to agree that we're making a big
deal about something that is, at bottom, a convention founded on
ignorance,'' Wolcher said. ``But, as humans, we have a drive to
make meaningful gestures ... to find significance in things.''
</P>
<P>
   If we want to believe that Jan. 1, 2000, is a day of
extraordinary significance and meaning, he said, then that by
itself makes it significant and important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world is going to come to an end because
some monk was ignorant about zeroes,'' Wolcher said. ``The number
really doesn't correspond to anything outside of its own accounting
system ... But the calendar is a ritual and rituals are
important.''

&HT;     PATAKI TOUTS TAX INCREASE ON CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>

taxes; edits to tighten.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES and JAMES M. ODATO  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Days after championing the largest tax increase
on New Yorkers of his five-year administration, Gov. George Pataki
said he would seek to reduce the disparity between the cost of
cigarettes at Indian and non-Indian retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long, end-of-the-year conversation with reporters on
Wednesday, the two-term Republican governor also said he would
likely run for re-election in 2002 _ his strongest acknowledgment
to date that he will remain in the Executive Mansion instead of
taking a White House office after the November election, should the
opportunity arise.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki painted a rosy picture of the state's outlook as it heads
into the new millennium, touting what he said was an upswing in New
York's economy during a simultaneous decrease in crime. And though
it calls for a 55-cent tax increase on cigarettes, Pataki described
the soon-to-be-approved Health Care Reform Act of 2000 as an
``outstanding bill'' that will also create $1 billion in Medicaid
savings annually over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax levy from the governor, who has proclaimed himself
as an anti-tax executive, cigarette taxes in New York will rise to
$1.11 a pack _ the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, said the governor is trying
to persuade Native Americans to raise their prices on cigarettes to
match the those charged by stores off reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not collect sales tax on Indian reservations,
meaning the prices of cigarettes and other goods are typically
cheaper. Retail trade groups want to erase the cost disparity.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement on pricing could be the result of ongoing
negotiations between the state and ``virtually every Indian
nation'' in New York over legal ownership of Native-American land,
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very sensitive negotiations. They also are wrapped in
litigation that has been going on for decades,'' Pataki said. ``...
We're going to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor indicated he is willing to go to court to decide
the land claim damages owed Native Americans instead of settling
out-of-court. Going to court means the state would give up its
ability to negotiate terms such as tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the governor declined to say much about his
goals for New York in 2000, saying simply he will outline his
agenda at the annual State of the State address on Jan. 5. Instead,
he listed accomplishments such as boosting the state's economy and
dramatically cutting welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those accomplishments, however, are disputed. Since
1995, Pataki said, the state has seen the creation of nearly
560,000 new private-sector jobs, and New York has climbed from
placing 39th in the nation in terms to job creation to 18th. Much
of those jobs, however, have been created in New York City, and the
upstate economy remains among the country's worst, according to
some economists.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the governor proudly pointed to the 750,000 fewer New
Yorkers who now receive welfare benefits than when he took office.
But again, the majority of those cases were accounted for in New
York City, where Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ who shares, at
best, a tense relationship with Pataki _ has taken credit for
getting 540,000 people off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As for his political agenda, Pataki has no plans to hit the
campaign trail on behalf of the Republican Party as he did a year
ago. The governor traveled across the country in early 1999 in what
was widely understood as a testing-of-the-waters mission for
national office, but Pataki curtailed his tours after endorsing a
fellow GOP governor, George W. Bush of Texas, for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has since been mentioned as a vice presidential or
Cabinet secretary contender in a potential Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki indicated he would stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bet a whole lot,'' he said, ``but I would expect the
most likely thing that I will be doing three years from now would
be running for re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would leave in the middle of his gubernatorial term
to join a Bush administration, the governor said: ``There is no
Bush administration. I'm going to do everything I can to help get
Governor Bush elected, and I'm going to do everything I can to be
the best governor that I can be. I'm not going to speculate as to
what, politically, may or may not happen.''

&HT;     ONE IN FOUR U.S. KIDS LIVES WITH A PROBLEM DRINKER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One in four U.S. children under age 18 are living
in households with an adult who is addicted to alcohol or abuses
it, according to a comprehensive new survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey provides ``the most precise estimate to date of
children affected by family alcohol problems,'' said Dr. Enoch
Gordis, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, a federal agency, which sponsored the survey. ``Given
the prevalence of alcohol abuse and alcoholise U.S. adult
population, however, the number of exposed children shocks but
regrettably does not surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordis said adult drinking problems cause instability and chaos
in the lives of an estimated 19 million children who live with an
alcoholic parent or relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family in which alcohol is being abused, is a family in
which children have a hard time growing up,'' Gordis said in an
interview. ``It's unpredictable, because you don't know if there is
going to be anger or hostility or violence. It's a stressful,
chaotic environment to grow up in.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also says that more than 7 percent of U.S. adults, or
14 million people, in 1992 abused alcohol or were dependent on it.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of drinking that results
in harm to family relationships or job performance. Alcohol
dependence means a person needs to drink increasingly more to
achieve a desired effect and also suffers withdrawal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologist Bridget F. Grant conducted the study for the
institute based on data collected from 42,862 respondents who were
interviewed as part of the 1992 Census.
</P>
<P>
   In her report in the January issue of the American Journal of
Public Health, Grant says alcohol abuse and dependence are the two
``most prevalent and deleterious psychiatric disorders in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that men were 2  &QC;  times more likely to be
problem drinkers than women were. Almost 10 million of the adults
who were problem drinkers were men, compared to almost 4 million
women.
</P>
<P>
   The study, known as the 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol
Epidemiologic Survey, included questions such as: ``In your entire
life, did you ever find that you had to drink much more than you
once did to get the effect you wanted?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, did you ever ``try to stop or cut down on your drinking but
found you couldn't do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Grant says in her article that children whose families include
an alcoholic grow up in an environment that has more conflicts,
less bonding and greater hostility.
</P>
<P>
   She says parental alcoholism also can cause behavioral problems
in children, drug abuse by teen-agers and anxiety disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of alcoholics may be neglected or abused and
frequently face economic hardship and social isolation,'' Grant
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are also vulnerable to psychopathology and medical
problems, including an increased risk for themselves of developing
alcohol abuse or alcoholism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordis said the findings ``once again call attention to the
enormous impact of alcohol in this country and the need to confront
its social, health and economic consequences head on.''

`WOODY ALLEN': THE BRITISH ROAD MAP TO A NEW YORK INSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(dw) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who is this John Baxter, the author of a new biography of Woody
Allen? Baxter has written more than a dozen film-related books,
several of them biographies of directors (Spielberg, Kubrick,
Fellini, Bunuel).
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Paris. He apparently believes it is possible to live
in Manhattan ``on East 79th Street, just off Sixth Avenue,'' as he
contends Allen did in the late 1960s. Note for out-of-towners: All
of Sixth Avenue is on the West Side, and the corner in question, if
it existed, would be smack-dab in the middle of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter also notes that Allen moved later to an apartment ``on
Central Park East,'' that his film ``Mighty Aphrodite'' didn't make
money because of ``few audiences understanding its mythological
references'' (it was the story of a 1990s New York hooker, with the
appearance of a Greek chorus as a recurring joke) and that ``Play
It Again, Sam'' was largely responsible for the continuing
popularity of ``Casablanca'' and Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   Is the author a little out of his territory?
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in England, retains its British
spellings (characters realise, fantasise, desensitise, dramatise,
specialise and womanise), but surely someone at its New York
publishing house who knows basic Manhattan geography gave the
manuscript a read.
</P>
<P>
   All writers and their editors make mistakes, of course, and
maybe this sort of thing could be forgiven if the rest of ``Woody
Allen: A Biography'' were strong. But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning Baxter seems to be looking hard for
meaning that isn't there. On the first page of the preface, for
instance, he notes that the main entrance of the Carlyle Hotel _
where Allen plays clarinet with a jazz band _ is on the side
street, rather than on Madison Avenue, and interprets that as
turning ``a cold shoulder to the leafy playground of Central Park
only a block away.'' But let's give the author his due: he got
Madison's distance from the park right.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter did not have the access to Allen and his inner circle
that Eric Lax had for his 1991 biography of the same title, and
unfortunately he has not made up for that disadvantage in terms of
insight or style. So the book's only distinction is that it is the
first on Allen since the 1992 events involving him, Mia Farrow and
Soon-Yi Previn, Ms. Farrow's adopted daughter. This new work is
certainly readable, but its flaws rob it of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Of Allen's childhood we read basic information: that he was born
in 1935 in the Bronx, grew up as Allan Konigsberg in Brooklyn and
attended Public School 99 in Flatbush and Midwood High School
before his very short college career: a semester at New York
University as a film production major and a semester at City
College.
</P>
<P>
   When details and interpretation are needed, Baxter turns to
Allen's films, which gives the early part of the biography an
unsettling, jumpy quality. One minute readers are at a resort in
Pennsylvania where Allen is writing comedy routines in the 1950s;
the next, they are in a scene from the 1977 film ``Annie Hall''
that may have parodied the Pennsylvania resort period of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Making the connections seems like a good idea in theory, but it
robs the book's first third or so of a secure sense of place and
time. Even the black-and-white photographs representing Allen's
early years are from his movies, not from his real childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was a junior in high school when he sold his first jokes,
one-liners, to a cousin who was a press agent, and did his first
stand-up comedy at the Young Israel Social Club on Ocean Avenue.
The librettist Abe Burrows, who was related to Allen by marriage,
gave him advice and wrote letters of introduction to the likes of
the entertainer Peter Lind Hayes (who bought some jokes from him)
and Sid Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Allen got into an NBC writers' development program, which led in
1956 to a steady job in California, writing for ``The NBC Comedy
Hour'' at the age of 20. From there it was a matter of better and
better television writing jobs, Broadway plays and increasingher-budget feature films, from ``What's New, Pussycat?'' (1965)
through ``Celebrity'' (1998), where the book ends.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's personal life is given just as much attention. In 1956
he married Harlene Rosen, a New York shoe-store owner's daughter
who had played piano with his weekend band. In 1961 he met and
moved in with Louise Lasser, and Ms. Rosen got a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Lasser were married in February 1966 at her parent's
home in Manhattan. In 1968 he met Diane Keaton, when she auditioned
for his play ``Play It Again, Sam'' and they had an affair,
followed the next year by Ms. Lasser's divorce. One night at
Elaine's in late 1979 Michael Caine introduced him to Mia Farrow.
Their first date, dinner at Lutece (Baxter calls it ``the
Lutece''), was in April 1980.
</P>
<P>
   They were a couple for more than a decade but never moved in
together. By the time their son, Satchel, was born in December
1987, some said Allen was becoming a little too fascinated with
their adopted 2-year-old daughter, Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   In the su 1989 Soon-Yi Previn, Ms. Farrow's teen-age
adopted daughter, was going to basketball games with Allen. In
January 1992 Ms. Farrow found the nude photographs of Ms. Previn at
Allen's apartment; the tabloids printed their articles about the
affair seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter defines Allen's relationship with his longtime
girlfriend's daughter, whom he married in Venice in early 1998, as
a ``lapse of taste, but it was hardly an indictable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, one of Baxter's observations is on target. Allen's
``story to tell,'' he writes, is ``that of the outsider unable or
unwilling to understand what he's told or, if he understands, to
act on it.'' In his films, Allen ``looks to archetypes of
omniscience _ aliens, ghosts, God, death, mediums _ for
enlightenment.''
</P>
<P>
   So do we. Almost eight years after the Mia, Woody and Soon-Yi
news led many of Allen's devoted fans to do an emotional double
take, it's still unclear how we could have identified so strongly,
how we could have shared so many passions (for Gershwin, the joys
of relentless self-analysis, urban wit, New York itself) with a man
who _ if the press reports are true _ always had crucial moral
shortcomings. Unfortunately, Baxter's biography doesn't help us
understand.

 &HT;    FAA MAKES LAST-MINUTE Y2K FIX IN AIR SAFETY SYSTEM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Aviation officials this week found and fixed Y2K
software bugs in an air safety system, but the last-minute problems
were ``very minor,'' Jane Garvey, head of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs were completed early Thursday. ``The patch is in,
it's been fixed,'' she said at a transportation briefing at the
White House's Y2K Information Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said FAA officials are continuing to test the air traffic
control system for so-called Y2K bugs, a software flaw that could
trip up computers as the year rolls over to 2000. Recent tests
revealed the need for a software patch for the ``HOCSR'' computers
that process flight plan and radar data.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto said the agency
determined that, under extremely rare circumstances, the bug might
have caused the controllers' computer storage drives to fail for
about 10 seconds as they moved into 2000. ``In the worst-case
scenario...it would have caused only a blip (on radar screens) that
the controllers would have spotted immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Professional Airways Systems Specialists, a union
representing about 11,000 FAA employees, said the Y2K flaw was more
serious than Garvey admits and reflects the poor management of the
agency. The union, which is in contract negotiations, is a frequent
critic of the FAA's senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kathey(cq) Carman, the union's regional vice president for the
South, said she was not as worried so much about the Y2K bug
itself, but rather the timing of its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days before the transition (to 2000) and they are finding
a problem,'' Carman said. ``It makes us a little uneasy that
something was caught in such a short time-frame. You wonder what
else they didn't catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while she was sharply critical of FAA management, she
said controllers and members of the union would keep the skies
safe. ``I wouldn't be an alarmist about it because we are
professionals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the transportation briefing, Coast Guard Rear Adm.
George Naccara said that about two dozen of the world's 16,000
cargo ships have been ``red-flagged'' because of possible
Y2K-related problems. That means they may be barred from entering
U.S. ports this New Year's weekend because they were unable to
prove they could operate safely. Naccara would not identify the
ships or the countries where they were based.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, also at the briefing,
said that freight railroads, Amtrak and rail transit systems in big
cities have volunteered to stop running trains, beginning a few
minutes before midnight Friday to make sure nothing goes wrong as
the date changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not ask them to stand down,'' he said, but their
decision was prudeney want to make sure that you don't have
trains or passengers in difficult straits,'' such as getting
stranded on a bridge or in a tunnel at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the pause in operations will last about 15 minutes
in most cases, though some railroads will operate on a reduced
schedule while systems are being checked. ``They should be ready
and in full swing by Monday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Americans should expect only minor problems, such as
traffic lights that don't work, he said. ``We are confident that
our transportation sector is ready for a new century and a new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate press briefing, John Koskinen, head of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said the government
has received no reports of significant stockpiling of cash,
groceries, gasoline or other essentials as the nation braces for
Y2K.

THE HEART OF MR. RIPLEY  
 STILL BUSY AT 83  
 FAME AT ANY COST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Anthony Minghella has been consumed with ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' for years. Even before he won an Academy
Award for directing ``The English Patient,'' Minghella had been
writing the adaptation of this Patricia Highsmith suspense novel,
which opened last week.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which takes place mostly in sun-drenched Italy in the
late 1950s, is about a young man named Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who
insinuates himself into the lives of some American expatriates and
yearns to exchange his identity with that of a rich, spoiled and
carefree playboy (Jude Law). Slowly, perhaps, inevitably, Ripley
loses control and turns murderous. The cast also includes Gwyneth
Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Minghella, a British playwright turned director who made his
feature film debut with ``Truly, Madly, Deeply,'' said, quite
simply, that Ripley was one of the most extraordinary characters in
postwar fiction. (An earlier film version of the book was the 1960
``Purple Noon,'' starring Alain Delon and directed by Rene
Clement.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that Ripley looks at the world speaks for what's
inside every human heart,'' Minghella said. ``One often has a sense
of dislocation and alienation and unease with oneself. There's
often a sense that the secret to each person, if made public, would
be rejected. We cover up who we really are to be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ripley may _ or may not _ be a sociopath at the
start of the film, Minghella said that as a writer and director he
identified with him. ``There's this sense of being strange, which
is at the heart of every creative person,'' he said. ``Every
writer, every actor, every director knows who Ripley is. We've made
careers and lives out of pretending, making things up, inhabiting
other people's stories and lives. That's what I do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What especially fascinated Minghella was that Ripley, who turns
monstrous, mysteriously eludes any sense of overt punishment. ``The
story is so audacious and subversive: a central character who
behaves badly and isn't apparently caught,'' he said. ``That
intrigued me no end.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues that most interested Minghella in the film was
the notion of social class among Americans. ``In Britain you have
class tattooed on your forehead,'' he said. ``It's hard to escape
because people can discover your social territory in a few seconds
by the nature of your accent, bearing, manner, surname. In America
it's obscured. But it's still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Minghella as well as several of the actors are English,
the director said the story was ``extremely American.'' ``What
fuels the whole film is a study of Americans in Europe,'' he said.
``And the idea that Europe will offer both an escape route and an
opportunity to reinvent themselves, which was particularly present
in the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella said with a laugh that the one person he loathed
during the making of the lushly produced film in Rome, Venice and
Sicily was the screenwriter _ who happened to be Minghella.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to sit in London writing a scene that takes
place on the Spanish Steps,'' said Minghella. ``It's another thing
to go to Rome and shoot on the Spanish Steps, with thousands of
people swarming all over, and trying to make it look like it's
taking place in 1958 and deserted. At that point, I could have
happily killed the writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Producer
</P>
<P>
   At 83, David Brown is still busily producing, still fighting
battles with studio executives who could be his grandchildren.
``Yes, I've survived,'' he said, chuckling. ``At a certain age you
become cool, not cold. I kind of represent the new and old
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's newest producing effort, ``Angela's Ashes,'' with the
prolific Scott Rudin, began more than three years ago when an
excerpt from the Frank McCourt autobiography appeared in The New
Yorker. An associate, Kit Golden, urged him to read it and he
promptly began negotiating the option. Rudin called him and
suggested joining as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brown said, the McCourt book, about his harrowing
childhood in Ireland, was not being pursued by most studios. Those
studios got involved only after McCourt won the Pulitzer Prize in
1997 for nonfiction and the book sold over 6 million copies in 30
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words just jumped off the page at me,'' Brown said. ``If
anyone had said, `How would you like a story about a bleak Irish
Catholic childhood?' I would have said: `You must be joking. I'm
not in the mood to be depressed.' But having read the book I was
far from being depressed. I was in a state of euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that he and Rudin had virtually auditioned for
McCourt, who was a bit nervous about selling the rights to his book
and having it turned into a Hollywood extravaganza. ``Scott and I
both had an encyclopedic knowledge of the book, we read it in
detail, which is unusual in Hollywood,'' Brown said. ``We didn't
promise the moon and the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, McCourt has seen the film and congratulated
the producers as well as the director, Alan Parker, and the actors,
Emily Watson, who plays the author's valiant mother, Angela, and
Robert Carlyle, who plays his alcoholic father, Malachy. ``As the
lights went up the first time he saw the film, Frank said, `I need
a drink,''' said Brown. ``He was bowled over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had a partnership for years with Richard D. Zanuck that
resulted in ``Jaws,'' ``MacArthur,'' ``The Verdict,'' ``The
Sting,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``Deep Impact.''
The producer, who lives in New York with his wife of 40 years,
Helen Gurley Brown, the former longtime editor of Cosmopolitan, is
now producing a Broadway musical based on the Clifford Odets-Ernest
Lehman film ``The Sweet Smell of Success,'' directed by Alexander
Mackendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledges that he wants to quit the movie business
every few weeks. ``I become frustrated at what I perceive to be a
flight from excellence,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   A Doll's Valley
</P>
<P>
   In the new comedy drama ``Isn't She Great,'' about the life of
Jacqueline Susann, Bette Midler, who plays the famous best-selling
novelist, says: ``All I know about are aging stars, hopeful hookers
and people popping pills and winding up in the gutter. And nobody
writes books about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Susann most certainly wrote books about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very funny and very gutsy,'' said Paul Rudnick, who
wrote the screenplay for the film, which opens on Jan. 28. ``And
she was valiant in a way. She triumphed over an amazing number of
odds with high humor, outrageous behavior and Pucci outfits.''
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the film was an article about Miss Susann by
Michael Korda that appeared in The New Yorker on Aug. 14, 1995.
Korda, who was one of Ms. Susann's editors, affectionately wrote
about the life and career of the author, who wrote hugely
successful potboilers like ``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Love
Machine'' and ``Once is Not Enough.'' Encouraged by her adoring
husband and manager, Irving Mansfield, Ms. Susann not only decided
to write novels about sex-crazed and drug-addicted movie stars and
moguls but also virtually invented a new way of selling the books.
The couple went on cross-country tours, paying calls on regional
booksellers and engaging in the kind of self-promotion that would
embarrass other authors.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Susann's success was short-lived. In 1963, at the age of
44, before her books were published, Ms. Susann had a radical
mastectomy. At that point Miss Susann said she needed 10 years to
become famous. She died in 1974 of recurring breast cancer.
Mansfield (who is played in the film by Nathan Lane) died in 1988
at 80.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Bergman, director of the film, said he had read the Korda
piece and was captivated by Miss Susann. Rudnick was enlisted to
write the screenplay. ``It was not easy to write because here's a
woman who is inherently comic and like the mega-yenta of all time,
but also enormously brave,'' Bergman said. Miss Susann not only
battled cancer but also had an autistic child, Guy, who lived in an
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a miserable life,'' said Bergman, whose directing
credits include ``Honeymoon in Vegas.'' He added: ``But she was
determined to be famous. She willed herself to be famous. That's
what she wanted. She was a failed actress, a failed game-show host.
She was sort of a joke until the novels. Actually I admired her
because she was terribly brave.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one line of dialogue in the film was especially
significant. At one point, Stockard Channing, who plays Miss
Susann's closest friend, tells her straight-faced, ``Talent isn't
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said, ``Jackie is a model of the 20th-century
celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudnick agreed. ``She was desperate to be famous, and it took
her quite a while to get there,'' he said. ``She wanted global
adoration, nothing less. It's not easy to achieve.'' Rudnick said
that Miss Susann did not disclose that she had breast cancer for
years. ``She imagined it would hurt book sales,'' he said.

   HARRISON-ATTACK (London) _ An assailant armed with a large knife
broke into the house of the former Beatle George Harrison early
Thursday morning and stabbed him in the chest, the authorities
said, as evidence emerged that the assailant may have harbored a
dangerous obsession with the band. Harrison, 56, one of three
remaining members of the Beatles after the murder of John Lennon by
a crazed fan 19 years ago, was treated for a collapsed lung at a
hospital near his house in Henley-on-Thames and was listed in
stable condition Thursday night. Doctors said that his condition
was not life-threatening. His wife, Olivia, was treated and
released after suffering minor head injuries in the struggle. By

   NEWYEAR-ISAREL (Jerusalem) _ How to find a Jewish angle for the
millennium? With the eyes of the world on the Holy Land, Rabbi
Shlomo Gestetner wanted to exploit the moment, without, he hastened
to add, commemorating Jesus. The turn of the millennium is a
confusing time for those who live in the land where Jesus was born,
lived and died. Mostly Jews and Muslims, they do not attach
religious significance to the moment, yet they live, to some
degree, in the modern, secular world. It may be the year 5760
according to the Jewish calendar, but there is no denying the
worldwide ``energy and sense of trepidation,'' Gestetner said. And
so he came up with an idea: a Y6K benefit concert. Two hundred and
forty years early, but why be an accountant? By Deborah Sontag.

   Remember those recent ads for the Gap with the slogan,
``Everybody in khakis''? The phrase's frighteningly autocratic
undertone only reinforced the sense that people would, of their own
free will, make it come true, adopting the chain's latest offering
as a reliable uniform. The same aura surrounds the third album by
the Brooklyn-based rapper Jay-Z (on Def Jam). Even casual hip-hop
fans will buy this album immediately, and its simple, sturdy tracks
will soon make many others lay their money down.
</P>
<P>
   Jay-Z is not exactly a poet, nor is he that dextrous vocally.
But he knows good product, which in hip-hop means sticky hooks and
flashy but credible gangster tales. Enlisting top producers
including Timbaland, Swizz Beats, DJ Clue, Dr. Dre and Rockwilder,
and calling in favors from his fellow stars Mariah Carey and
Juvenile, he has made a dependably engaging collection of macho
boasts lifted by bouncy rhythms, memorable samples and interesting
guest turns.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-voiced Amil does well as Jay-Z's female foil, while the
Texas-based duo UGK stands out among the many guest rhymers.
Unsurprisingly, Jay-Z himself acts just as his fans will expect:
nastily cool, invulnerable, his arrogant persona as tight as a
well-stitched seam.

MUSIC REVIEW: MARSALIS' DARING SYMPHONIC STEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wynton Marsalis' tap didn't turn off in 1999. There
were eight new disks bearing his name, ranging from new extended
jazz works to rearranged Jelly Roll Morton and Thelonious Monk; one
seven-CD box set of live material; six months of the year spent
touring worldwide and playing the music of Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in its premiere performance on Wednesday night at
Avery Fisher Hall, there was ``All Rise,'' a symphonic piece
commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, representing a
collaboration between the Philharmonic and Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   With someone as busy and official as Marsalis, one has to wonder
_ even before hearing a piece like ``All Rise'' _ about the
difference between deadline work and art based on a need to
communicate. ``All Rise'' is both.
</P>
<P>
   Called upon to write a millennium piece, Marsalis wrote
something appropriately large _ around 200 musicians, including the
Philharmonic, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, and the Morgan
State University Choir, filled an extended stage _ and
appropriately accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   It has little in the way of either simple pleasures or flat-out
sublimity; instead of narrative development there are
juxtapositions and surface details galore, enough to keep you
interested during the performance and make you wonder afterward
what it was you'd heard.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis did not take the jazz composer's easy way out; there
are no lengthy jazz-band sections larded up with improvised solos.
It's about 100 minutes of written music, and it's a work that can
be prized on intellectual grounds but throughout remains difficult
to love.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of ``All Rise'' shrewdly connects grand millennial
thoughts back to a deeply American theme. ``The 20th century has
been the century of communication,'' Marsalis writes in the program
notes; ``the 21st will be the century of integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing out this concept in music, the composer has enfolded
orchestral writing both popular (sweet, sweeping, film-soundtrack
pastorality) and semipopular (repetitive unison minimalism
reminiscent of Steve Reich) with small-group jazz and gospel music,
and further added bits of clave, Scots-Irish reels and blues.
</P>
<P>
   These different disciplines weren't just put side-by-side,
secure within their own boundaries; they were often playing one
another's roles, with string sections playing bluesy glissandos in
unison and saxophones playing with classical technique.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis puts an easygoing religiosity into a lot of his work,
and a piece about the cross-fertilization of humanity is bound to
have some of it. To that end, the choir repeated phrases like
``Save us for we know not what we do,'' ``Look beyond,'' and ``the
glory of God'' _ fragmentary millennial cries which begged for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestral effects fascinate Marsalis, and they became the
lasting memory of ``All Rise.'' In ``Save Us,'' the Philharmonic's
percussion section, with the Jazz Orchestra's drummer Herlin Riley,
began playing a clave rhythm together; the choir sang in clashing
counterpoint within itself; violins held a single note quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this, suddenly, the sound of a jazz quartet emerged, with
Marsalis playing an agitated solo. In ``Look Beyond,'' the strings
droned another unison note, and from that sprouted a quiet two-beat
New Orleans jazz rhythm, which shortly subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra then created a wave of romantic, major-key
playing; next a funk rhythm began, with strings accenting each
beat. There were exciting, jarring juxtapositions, and there was
experimentation with sound across the field of the orchestra. One
might call ``All Rise'' the product of a jump-cut imagination,
except that Marsalis' individual parts are rather long, and the
sections trickled into each other.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was what happened between segues. Much of ``All
Rise'' is odd music, slightly tortured in its ambition, and though
Marsalis was largely successful in his project of dissolving
musical idioms into each other, one struggled to find the true
character of the piece _ partly because the work lacks memorable
themes, partly because it was heavy with formal ideas that didn't
seem to have roots.
</P>
<P>
   And what jazz there was in ``All Rise'' curiously seemed drained
of the strengths of Marsalis' best small-band music _ in which
arrangements rule, and tone colors of each individual instrument,
even bass and drums, are bright and strong. These were more like
official portraits of jazz tropes, from a train song called
``Expressbrown Local'' to funeral marches, slow blues and
post-Coltrane harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   The first four movements, conceived as the joyous third of a
12-movement piece (constructed to mirror a 12-bar blues form), were
often dour; there's never been so much dissonance in Marsalis'
music. Even the last movement, which ended on a New Orleans march,
was tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Rise'' may be full of jazz and dance sections, but it is
not jolly; its mood is not one of safety under the beneficent eyes
of God, but a mottled question about who we might become, what
causes we may have to defend, during a time of rapid growth and
change.

   In the year 2030 people will have dolphins and gorillas for
roommates, one girl from Canada predicts in ``Nickellennium,''
Nickelodeon's New Year's Eve special. In 2040, a boy from Romania
announces, he will live on an island ``in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean'' with 1,000 cats. In the future, a little girl from
England says, ``you'll have e-mail in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Cute and adorable, huh? Kids say the darndest things. But now
and then, in the middle of ``Nickellennium'' _ a five-hour
presentation that begins at the stroke of midnight Friday night and
runs repeatedly until midnight Saturday _ someone like 14-year-old
Alfred from the Navajo nation will speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people call a soul,'' says Alfred, his eyes and voice
exuding calm intelligence. ``I think we will ultimately find out
what that is. We will be able to comprehend what a soul is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nickellennium'' is a pretty free-form experience, not
something most people of any age would want to sit through from
beginning to end, but it has its moments. Like that one.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the show consists of 7- to 14-year-olds from various
countries expounding on life in the future, talking-head style.
Between their comments _ on topics like fashion, medicine, war,
immortality, space travel, romantic love and robots _ there are
musical interludes, on-location segments (Kei from Japan gets a
``year 2000 hairdo,'' for instance, and asks people on the street
what they think of it) and splashy, sometimes psychedelic graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The range of opinion is about what you'd expect to find among an
equal number of adults, and a great deal of the time it's clear
that the children are repeating their parents' views verbatim.
</P>
<P>
   But that's interesting in itself, revealing something about what
the turn-of-the-millennium generation is being carefully taught.
And sometimes the children sound awfully convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Having been asked what the beginning of the new millennium
means, Siddharth from India, peering through his eyeglasses on a
chain, states pleasantly, ``We live forever and we have thousands
of millenniums and hundreds of thousands of millenniums, so I don't
think it means anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the children are really imaginative. Amalia from
Mexico predicts that in the future ``everything will be upside
down,'' that children will be the teachers (with grown-up students)
and the parents (telling their own mothers and fathers what to do).
Not only that, but ``you'll be walking with your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   At times the predictions mirror the concerns of the age group
being interviewed. There are expectations of a five-minute school
day, because information can be injected directly into the
students' brains or an encyclopedia chip can be implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Hope is also expressed for instant travel by teleportation
(``Are we there yet?''), instant baths and showers and the
elimination of brussels sprouts. Of course, by 2040 or so these
issues may not seem so important.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Holly, Chloe, Rachel, Tiffany, Kamairi, Malika, River,
Jade, Aoife, Preksha and Tsipora; Ben, Kyle, Massimo, Sebastian,
Ahmed, Gabe, Kazuki, Jordan and Riveesh. (And those are only a few
of the interview subjects.)
</P>
<P>
   They come from the United States, Brazil, Zimbabwe, England,
Ireland, India, Israel, New Zealand, Jamaica and elsewhere. And
they are by and large a serious group, concerned about the
environment, racism, divorce, animals, technology's promise and its
dangers. Maybe the idealism and activism of the 1960s will be
reborn with them, sometime in the 2010s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no mistakinharm when their dreams for the
years ahead are purely personal and less than solemn. Maddy, an
8{-year-old American, states her idea of a perfect future: ``I
would not see my little brother a lot. He would go on lots of
vacations in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Sana from India, who is a little older, has it all in
perspective. ``I would like to see more people like Mother Teresa''
in the world, she says. ``And Brad Pitt too.''

LEVELING COMPOUND WILL SMOOTH OUT CRUMBLING CONCRETE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 2, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON

<P>
   Q. The basement floor in my 1960s house has vinyl tiles that
have deteriorated from dampness and come loose, and so has the
concrete under them, making a very uneven surface. Some 24 tiles
are involved, and there is efflorescence (white powder) under them.
How can I smooth out that concrete before putting down a pad and
carpeting?
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR CHAMIAN, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Tiles installed in the '60s could be vinyl-asbestos; if they
are 9 by 9 inches and very rigid, chances are they are
vinyl-asbestos; if you want to remove them, have them checked by an
asbestos abatement company. According to the amoasbestos
they contain, they might need professional removal. If the asbestos
is at a certain level, you can remove them yourself. Or, leave them
intact; asbestos tiles left intact are not harmful, and can be
covered with carpeting or other tiles. To smooth the deteriorating
concrete, sweep out the efflorescent powder, fill the rough areas
with floor-leveling compound, let set, and sand smooth. Glue the
tiles back with tile cement or adhesive caulk. Install a synthetic
jute pad and the carpeting on the smooth, even tiles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My shower is three years old, and now when I turn on the
one-handle valve, water rumbles and pulsates, getting stronger and
stronger. What's wrong? How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   LINDA CARP, Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The pressure may be high. Have a plumber check it and put a
pressure-reducing valve on the main intake line, if necessary. If
pressure is not the culprit, then it's the valve.
</P>
<P>
   One-handled pressure-control valves are sensitive, and a bit of
grit in one can knock it askew. Sometimes taking the valve apart
and reassembling it will work; if not, the valve should be
replaced. Unless you are comfortable with plumbing, hire a plumber
to do this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I left a folded Oriental rug on my deck for five months.
Needless to say it is moldy. I had a it professionally cleaned and
I scrubbed it myself, without much success. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   DEBORAH NAGLER, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The more sun you can get on it, the better. Both sides, too.
If it is not too big, hang it over a clothesline. And, try this:
Wash it with Era, a detergent that contains oxygen (not chlorine)
bleach, which will attack any lurking mold.
</P>
<P>
   A final try is to make a mix of one part household bleach and 10
parts water and wipe this lightly on the back of the rug. But first
try it on an obscure area to make sure it does not bleach out the
colors. If colors fade, even a little, stop. The solution is too
strong. If colors show no sign of fading, wipe both front and back
lightly with this solution. Squeeze out a sponge in this solution
to make sure the application is light. Wear skin and eye protection
when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put up a prefab shed in my yard last fall. The floor is
plywood; do I have to treat it? There is a little outside ramp of
pressure-treated plywood. Does that have to be treated? Finally,
there is vinyl siding on this shed; should I caulk the ends or any
joints?
</P>
<P>
   JAY PEDERSON, Littleton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No to all three questions. The shed floor is exterior-grade
plywood, or at least should be, and does not have to be treated
unless you want a color. If you like the idea of a color, use a
semitransparent stain. This stain (only one coat is needed) will
also provide a modicum of resistance to wear and tear. The
pressur-treated plwyood ramp does not have to be treated; it is
best left alone. Do not caulk any ends or joints in the siding;
vinyl siding is designed to shed water, and any corners or joints
where so-called J-channels are installed (where the siding meets
trim, or window or door casing, for example) are designed to let
water flow around them and through them out of harm's way. Caulking
could block this flow. So, you can relax and enjoy your shed.

   Q. My concrete front porch had minor repairs made, but now the
new concrete patches are quite different from the old. How can I
make them the same color?
</P>
<P>
   HARVEY COTE, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait a few years; the new concrete will weather to match the
old. But for instant color, give the porch a coat of concrete
stain. Muralao makes one in many color choices. The stain will not
peel. Do not paint the concrete; you are likely to end up with a
perennial headache of scraping and repainting the peeling paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. All my walls are finished with flat oil paint. Can I put
acrylic or latex paint over it? Is any special prep to be done?
</P>
<P>
   HERBERT SHIVEK, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Latex or acrylic can go over an old flat oil finish. There is
no special prep needed, but I suggest you sand the walls lightly
with fine sandpaper, then wash them with a strong solution of Spic
and Span and water before applying two thin coats of the wall
paint.

&HT;     GUN SALES SURGE IN ADVANCE OF NEW LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians have been buying guns in near
record numbers, apparently because of concerns about the millennium
computer glitch and changes in state gun laws that take effect Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Justice statistics show that gun sales are
up to 3,000 a day in December from 1,200 a day a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surge,'' said Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the state
attorney general. ``We've seen similar surges in gun purchases in
earlier years just before new laws take effect. Dealers are sitting
on stock that they won't be able to sell after Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers interviewed in the San Francisco Bay Area and
Southern California agreed. They said business was up because of a
mix of hype over potential computer problems associated with the
date change and four new state laws that take effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy, really hectic, at least twice as busy as
normal,'' said Monique Miedema of Jackson Arms in South San
Francisco. She attributed the surge in business to the ``Y2K
nonsense. There are people who believe all that stuff. They get
afraid, so they stock up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun store owners report a large increase in sales of all types
of firearms, especially semiautomatic rifles with detachable
ammunition magazines. Many of these types of rifles will be
restricted under a new law designed to prevent the sale of
so-called assault rifles. The new legislation is designed to
strengthen a 1989 weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than doubled our business,'' said Tony Cucchiara of
Trader's Sports in San Leandro, the largest gun store in the Bay
Area. ``We're getting lots of first-time buyers and lots of people
who resent seeing their right to bear arms eroded by these new
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, FBI statistics show a surge in the number of
background checks on prospective gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase of about 100,000 in each of the past
four months,'' said FBI agent Dave Miller, who works on the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System. ``Based on raw
numbers, there is a large increase in the number of people filling
out the paperwork for background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,045,799 background checks conducted by federal and
state officials for December, as of Monday, up from 703,394 in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Miller noted that the FBI numbers do not actually measure gun
sales. ``We don't know if they are buying one gun or two or 10,''
he said. ``We just know there are a lot more people getting
background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Waldron, executive director of the Citizens Committee for
the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said California represents a
national trend. ``Every time there is new gun legislation passed,
there is a surge in gun sales,'' Waldron said. ``They want to get
in before the door slams shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates say sales increases need to be put in
historical perspective, in part because 1999 was a banner year for
their cause. With a Democratic governor and Democratic majority in
both houses of the Legislature for the first time since 1982,
weapons bills that were vetoed or scuttled in the past were signed
into law in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more than happy to trade a temporary increase for
knowing that as of Jan. 1 these assault rifles will never be sold
in California ever again,'' said Luis Tolley of Handgun Control
Inc. in Los Angeles. ` a trade we'll take any day of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, handguns outsold rifles and shotguns (or long
guns) by about a 3-to-2 ratio in California. That may change in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that all gun sales are up, but especially long guns
are selling in larger numbers than we have seen before,'' Attorney
General Bill Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people buying a weapon are law-abiding citizens and they
have protected rights to do that,'' Lockyer said. ``Some are buying
certain items before the deadline, and that's their legal right.''
</P>
<P>
   Under another new state law, most Californians will be allowed
to buy only one handgun every 30 days. Police officers, security
guards and gun dealers are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The record year for gun sales in California was 1993, when
642,197 firearms were sold.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If not for the inhibiting effect of political
correctness, heaven only knows what might become of Jackie Mason. A
nice intelligent man he is, but as cab passengers know, he has a
tongue on him. So maybe he would be slicing pastrami (it wouldn't
be lean) in a deli somewhere instead of convulsing audiences with
laughter at the Golden Theater on Broadway in his irreverent new
one-jester show, ``Jackie Mason: Much Ado About Everything!''
</P>
<P>
   For the underprivileged who know Mason solely from his yentalike
recorded admonitions to buckle up in taxis, the man is flat-out
funny. He is a lustrously polished standup comic, political
commentator, topical humorist and, when the audience's eyes are
sufficiently clear of laughter-induced tears to savor the expansive
vocabulary of his body language, a splendid and nimble mime and
mimic.
</P>
<P>
   But much of his humor plays against the goody-goodiness that is
the latest manifestation of the puritan streak in American life.
Because Mason knows his First Amendment rights and is more than
willing to exercise them, he does not fear to speak what others may
pretend they don't even think.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Mason's brand of open intolerance is sheathed in wit
and tempered by disarming apology, though catholic in its targets,
which include Jews, gentiles, Puerto Ricans, blacks, Greeks, Poles
and Asian Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to laugh at everybody and anybody,'' says
Mason, reminding those who might have forgotten that the United
States is a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On that subject, he has a few words about Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, while not overlooking the Clinton presidency, which, of
course, necessitates mentions of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Monica
Lewinsky, Vice President Al Gore and George W. Bush (``brilliant,
unless you ask him a question'').
</P>
<P>
   Mason is also a sociologist, so he has a lot to say about dining
habits, including the difference between ices and sorbets, pudding
and mousse, and espresso and regular coffee (about $20, he
figures); the purity and price of bottled water; fat-free food;
diets, and Japanese restaurants where patrons applaud chefs who
chop fish on their tables.
</P>
<P>
   The penchant for sport utility vehicles has not escaped his
gimlet eye, nor have the ubiquitous cell phones, leg room and seat
prices on planes, and the popularity of Siegfried and Roy,
Riverdance and the musical ``Titanic,'' in which, he declares,
everyone sang and danced while 3,000 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Mason has a few words to say about Bill Gates and John Glenn,
and he speculates on how overjoyed the world might have been had
the newspaper been invented after the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Using his own brand of scat and drawing on the expressive
vocabulary of his body language, Mason delivers hilarious
imitations of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, James Cagney, Sylvester
Stallone and Henry Kissinger. Best of all, there is his classic and
side-splitting portrayal of his robotic nemesis, Ed Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Mason's material is brand new. Devotees will
recognize bits from s shows like ``Politically Incorrect''
and ``Love Thy Neighbor,'' including not only the Sullivan and
Cagney imitations but also the routines about e-mail and New York's
Indian cab drivers. But the vintage material remains funny.
</P>
<P>
   In this time of fears of terrorism and Y2K chaos (two other
topics of ``Much Ado About Everything''), those who wake up
Saturday can give thanks that Mason (if all goes well) is around to
make the 21st century safe for democracy and for those who cherish
a good laugh.

 By BARBARA GRIZZUTI HARRISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was growing up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, there
were two places in our known universe. One was Bensonhurst itself,
a village, Our Town, an extension of our skin _ our skin's skin _
the container of ordinariness and of the melodrama that fills
ordinary lives, the comfortable, bland backdrop of family fights
and secrets, some so volatile and violent, threatening and crazy
that the maple trees lining quiet streets would have shivered if
the physical world reflected the turmoil of hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet-smelling streets: honeysuckle. We jumped from roof to
roof, one four-story building to another; we took up-and-down rides
in the dumbwaiters and never regarded the danger. Roller-skating in
pools of leaf-dappled light when the street lights were turned on,
flying on the edge. ``Practice kissing'' in elevators. Stoops where
at night, giggling and serious, we regaled one another with dirty
stories without benefit of anatomical, physiological or
psychological knowledge: mystical, mythic stories. Three distinct
and different groups, entities, peopling Our Town: Italians, Jews
and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were blond and fair and lived in one-family houses and
there weren't a lot of them. There was Veronica, in elementary
school, so pretty, singular, antiseptic; one day walking home from
school, she asked if I were a Christian, a question my ignorance or
defenses prevented me from understanding was fundamentally
anti-Semitic. (Yes, I said. The world was full of tests
unrecognizable as tests.)
</P>
<P>
   These random thoughts and bunches of others were jogging around
in my head on my way to see ``The Italians of New York: Five
Centuries of Struggle and Achievement,'' an exhibition (thin but
worthy) at the New-York Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Cozy little mysteries obscurely soothed: the Crazy Lady's house
we chose to believe was haunted; the house from the windows of
which pots and pans and shoes and copies of Il Progresso were
hurled when we made too much noise. Small-town shops _ bagels, and
unsalted butter from a barrel, sausages and lemon ices and bridal
gowns and communion dresses and the button-and-zipper store, the
bread store (Italianwholewheat, pronounced as if it were one word);
everything.
</P>
<P>
   There was another place. It was called New York. It was called
``the city.'' It was Manhattan. It was Other. Aunt Angie went there
to work at a place she called ``the place.'' She called it that
because she hated it, piecework in the garment center; she hated
the union as much as she hated her bosses _ ``They get you coming
and going.'' She had left the wild, ancient beauty of the Abruzzi
to come here, to this ``place''; she did not question her destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Collura, my darling avuncular friend _ when I was 15, 16 _
drove me to work in his ice truck. I had a temporary job in the
bank of the United Nations Secretariat building; work one week,
school the next: it was called the Cooperative Course at New
Utrecht High School, a euphemism (for what? for people of small
means with no college in their future). Right up to the doors of
the Secretariat building, past unquestioning guards (can you
imagine?) in a gaily colored, raucously decorated Sicilian ice
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you have an Italian last name?, a teacher asked me in the
halls of New Utrecht High School. I was smart and known to be
smart, even though I wasn't on a college track. It followed that I
must be Jewish; we all accepted that Jews were the smart ones. I
hung my head and muttered, I'm Italian.
</P>
<P>
   These are the intangibles of experience _ of which there are
many: 25 years ago, for example, you couldn't expect often to see
Italian names among prominent obituaries. Italians didn't believe
New York belonged to them, notwithstanding the reported fact that
there are more descendants of Italian immigrants in New York than
of any other ethnic group, and notwithstanding the fact that the
infrastructure of New York is the work of the hands of Italian
laborers and artists: the subway; the lions guarding the New York
Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   How does an art gallery display intangibles? It does it through
eloquent artifacts: piano-tuning equipment, sewing machines,
beading frames. Life-size Sicilian marionettes. I saw them first in
the countryside of Taoromina, in Sicily, watching Francis Ford
Coppola make ``Godfather, Part III.'' There they seemed almost
scarily alive, literally spirited; here they were handsome
curiosities.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso's opera costume. The paternal and maternal sides of my
family, who came here during the Great Migration at the turn of the
century, argue, embittered, over who swiped Grandpa DiNardo's
Caruso records _ which have, apparently, disappeared into thin air.
Shortly before his death, Uncle Pasquale, noisily appalled,
declared that his family had been robbed, robbed, ROBBED! He
couldn't possibly have understood how little value any of his
Americanized nieces and grandnephews attached to them _ Caruso? On
the other hand, they provided as good an occasion for a tribal
argument as any.
</P>
<P>
   Garibaldi's bloodstained jacket. In junior high school we were
never instructed about Garibaldi. We learned about the War of the
Roses. Here was our general conception of history: dinosaurs
roamed; the Dark Ages descended, plague and ignorance and filth;
the Renaissance happened, and then the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth
Rock. For a while we had slavery and then we had Abraham Lincoln.
Punto. The Great Immigration did not exist. And Italians were
complicit in this silence. ``Swarthy sons of the sunny south'' as
The New York Times said at the turn of the century of Italian men
(whom suffragists did not wish to get the vote), most Italians
wanted to disguise their past; they wanted to be ``Americans.'' I
never learned Italian until I went to Italy, in advanced adulthood.
I associated that most beautiful of all languages with brute
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs. All immigrants look the same on the steerage deck,
bundles and babies and headscarves. On their faces anticipation and
wariness and the faint, almost unreadable traces of hope are
written, hardened as they were against oppression and
disappointment and believing as they did that one's luck, God
willing, could change. I think, but I can't be sure, that my father
was a man without papers. When the steamers came into New York
Harbor, their inhabitants were transferred to ferries that took
them to Ellis Island. My father's allusions, decoded over the
years, tell me that he descended skillfully and stealthily into a
private boat, owned by the informal Mott Street neighborhood
fraternity, and escaped the Island and its inquisitors. He was a
permanently humble, permanently embarrassed (and tyrannical) man.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of Vito Marcantonio, the left-wing congressman from
Italian East Harlem, and New York's Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia,
and the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, martyrs to the radical cause
in the '20s, whose names, when I was growing up, were unfamiliar to
me; we were an unapologetically apolitical family. Pictures of the
balls and feasts and picnics given by Italian Mutual Aid Societies,
to which our family, insular, locked into themselves _
characteristics bred into the bone and marrow of the Abruzzese and
Calabrese _ never belonged. I never saw an Italian in a ball gown
in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of feasts. The Madonna festooned with dollar bills
(which non-Italians find so amusing, as if superstition were not a
primitive form of faith); pictures of the towering giglio _ the
elongated papier-mache pyramid from Our Lady of Carmel in
Williamsburg _ which requires the faith-inspired strength of many
men to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of front-yard shrines of stone and stucco and shells.
When Cobble Hill's brownstones in Brooklyn were first sold, perhaps
20 years ago, to non-Italians, they _ the Americans _ hated the
garish statues; but they wanted the fish man and the vegetable man
still to come, door to door, in their trucks (and the
knife-and-scissors sharpener). They were picturesque and handy,
whereas the Madonna (useless to Yuppies) inspired owners of houses
with round oak tables and phonographs permanently playing Mozart
with irritation bordering on rage.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of boccie players (an old friend points out to me that
Italian men over 70 always wore their sports shirts buttoned to the
very top, straining their throats against the fabric _ something to
do with respectability, and perhaps with vulnerability). Communion
dresses, lacy and so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   What about the tools of daily life _ the means to bread and the
occasional rose _ ice picks and shovels, their energy quietly
sleeping. And accurate replicas (into which one may climb) of
steerage bunk beds where Italians spent the long voyage to America.
Not in themselves uncomfortable; but sanitized _ so close together
you could taste the breath of the immigrant sleeping in the bunk
next to yours. And you could most certainly smell the stench of
unwashed bodies and bucket latrines (no replicas of sanitary
arrangements, chamber pots).
</P>
<P>
   Oh. This I love: a reproduction of a tenement flat, a railroad
apartment. Odd. Nowadays, if found in Hell's Kitchen it would be
called charming in real-estate ads. And it is charming, because it
too is sanitized. Gauzy pictures behind it show smoke-blackened
greasy stoves, clothes hanging among pots, children of all sizes
crowding what seems almost to be a doll house. But the reproduction
itself is charming. There is nothing to remind anybody that there
is no place to wash. And absolutely no privacy. Oh! when I think of
the suffocating presence of male members of the family whenever a
male outsider dared to make himself seen.
</P>
<P>
   In rooms like this my aunts made paper flowers at night. (My
Uncle Lenny and my father, who also had respectable day jobs,
ventured forth at dawn with spiked poles, burlap bags slung over
their shoulders, to snatch the produce that fell off the market
trucks.) Samples of beautiful handiwork in the doll house _
embroidered cloth on top of fruit boxes that served as bedside
tables; lacework and beadwork, flowering in claustrophobia.
</P>
<P>
   My family moved from Little Italy. Two brothers and three
sisters combined their pay to fill the family coffers. They left
Mott Street for Bensonhurst and later for suburban New Jersey. My
Grandma Grizzuti missed being able to lean out the window and chat
with neighbors. She never saw the point of a front lawn; she
preferred the passing parade of people. She was isolated,
essentially without a language to call her own. But her children
had achieved respectability, and money enough. And I have her silk
textiles _ the ones with hand lace and embroidered flowers _ and
crocheted bedspreads. To this day textiles breathe life into me, I
cannot have enough beautiful stuff created by human hands.
</P>
<P>
   People sign the visitors' book at the historical society.
Schoolchildren write perfunctory thanks. Almost every single
visiting Italian voices his or her gratitude for the society's not
catering to the ``stereotype'' _ which is to say, the Mafia.
Indeed, in blown-up posters, the contribution of Italian-Americans
in the fight against organized crime is extolled. It breaks my
heart. Why should we have to defend ourselves against bigoted
charges anymore? Why should we concentrate so much on this thin
slice of the pie? The rest of the world isn't going to give it up
and stop hollering about it until Italians themselves do. Can't we
love ourselves better?
</P>
<P>
   Guess who isn't here? Sinatra. Sinatra. Of course you could
argue that he comes from Hoboken, N.J. (but Hoboken, my daughter
says, is part of Greater New York). Sinatra owned New York,
generous, tender sweetheart that he was. ``New York, New York?'' I
thought the Paramount was in New York. Well, Brooklyn. California
was Sinatra's aberration. A sin, really. Yes; and lots of Joe
DiMaggio stuff, but virtually nothing about the drama of the
Brooklyn Dodgers, the scrappiest, most lovable, most loved team
ever to play and some of their most storied players _ Cookie
Lavagetto, Carl Furillo, Ralph Branca. God bless them.

   When we lived in Bensonhurst, my father, who was a printer, rode
the train back and forth to work, in and out of the light and dark
of the tunnels back to 18th Avenue. He never returned to Mott and
Mulberry Streets until the week before he died. He drove around the
neighborhood in the Edsel he had given my brother as an ill-advised
Christmas gift, his head swiveling on his scrawny neck like a
bird's. New York didn't belong to him. He was lost.

JAPAN'S CROWN PRINCESS SUFFERS A MISCARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Three weeks after press reports that Crown Princess
Masako was pregnant spurred a wave of hopeful speculation about the
imperial succession, officials announced Thursday night that she
had suffered a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyodo News Agency reported that officials said the princess
had undergone surgery and was in good condition, but would remain
hospitalized for an unspecified period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prince and princess were calm,'' Kiyoshi Furukawa, grand
master of the crown prince's household, told reporters at a
briefing when asked how the couple reacted to the news from
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The child could have been the first new direct heir to Japan's
throne since 1965, and news of the miscarriage came as nearly as
much of a blow to the nation's mood as to the imperial family. It
was made public after the princess, 36, underwent a previously
scheduled ultrasound test Thursday afternoon that was widely
expected to confirm her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, the sparse reports that trickled out
of the Imperial Household Agency on Thursday, which were minutely
reported and commented on in the Japanese press, hinted at trouble.
Then, well after nightfall, came the news that Princess Masako had
suffered a miscarriage and undergone surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that tests had failed to detect a pulse in the
fetus. Although the nature of the operation was not specified, the
Kyodo News Agency said the surgery was believed to have been
necessary to remove the fetus from the womb.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After six years of childless marriage, the initial reports of
Princess Masako's pregnancy set off an extraordinarily frenzied
weekend of press coverage about the possible birth of a new heir.
Newspapers published special editions about the ``event,'' and
competing television networks rushed to broadcast specials about
Crown Prince Naruhito and his bride.
</P>
<P>
   Breathless documentaries reprised every inch of available film
and combed over every detail of the princess' life, from her
childhood in a well-to-do family of commoners, to her education at
Harvard and Oxford and her brief diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of all of this attention was whether the couple
would finally produce a royal successor for the 2,660-year-old
imperial line. So far, the emperor and empress have only female
grandchildren _ Princess Mako, 8, and Princess Kako, 4 _ daughters
of the crown prince's younger brother, Prince Akishino, and his
wife, Princess Kiko.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said that the birth of an heir would provide
such a boost to the national mood that the economy might finally
rebound after a decade of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the news of a ``millennium baby'' was an uncommonly
good omen for the embattled prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who must
call elections by the fall. Indeed many here believe that Obuchi's
government leaked the initial reports of the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Some, claiming to have an inside line to officials and
legislators considering such matters, said that if the princess
gave birth to a girl, constitutional changes would be enacted to
allow a female to ascend to the throne for the first time in more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Household Agency, the conservative and secretive
body that manages every detail of the imperial family's affairs,
reacted harshly to all the speculation and news coverage, saying
that the news reports were violating the royal couple's human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was an attempt by the agency to rein in the wild
reports and manage the news, and in a way that is peculiarly
Japanese, most of the media complied, turning their attention as if
by a switch to other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening weeks, the Imperial Household Agency has
announced two ultrasound tests. After the first test, on Dec. 13,
to which the princess was driven in a limousine with curtains
drawn, Furukawa, head of the agency, told reporters only that we
``are not at a stage to announce whether or not the crown princess
is pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency severely curtailed the princess' schedule of official
duties, which consist mostly of public events that members of the
imperial family attend.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that everything was in order again increased one
week ago when the princess appeared on the palace balcony with
other members of the royal family and waved happily to well-wishers
on the occasion of Emperor Akihito's birthday.

   If it's a head trip you're looking for in the millennial version
of Walt Disney's ``Fantasia,'' you'll have to wait for the grand
finale, in which the world appears to come to an end, then suddenly
bursts to life again with the furious, accelerating urgency of an
uncontrollable force.
</P>
<P>
   The conjurer of this frenzied orgy of creation, destruction and
renewal is a whirling sprite, a shape-shifting purple comet of an
animated figure summoned from a volcano by an elk in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   This pagan goddess, the visual invention of the directors Gaetan
and Paul Brizzi, dips and swoops around a world consisting entirely
of forests, oceans and mountains while creation explodes in
spontaneous sunbursts of energy coordinated to music from
Stravinsky's ``Firebird Suite.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the sprite appears as sweet and benign as Snow White,
sometimes as wrathful as the Wicked Witch of the West. Even with
its occasionally saccharine frills, the segment leaves a lasting
impression of the beauty, terror and unpredictability of the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven episodes created for ``Fantasia/2000,'' which
opens Saturday at the Sony Imax theater in Lincoln Square, this is
the only one in which the images and music sustain the kind of
magical synergy that has been the elusive goal of ``Fantasia,''
beginning with the groundbreaking 1940 movie, the first to have
stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' connects the millennial version to the
60-year-old film by including one of its original segments, the
justly celebrated ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' in which Mickey Mouse
is a magician's work-weary assistant who dons his boss' cone-shaped
hat while he's out and plays at being sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying the hat's magical powers, Mickey commands his broom to
develop arms and legs and carry out his chores, but the results are
disastrously chaotic. The story's not-so-subtle moral is an age-old
one about playing with fire: Little boys should listen to their
fathers and not attempt grown-up tasks without supervision. None of
the new episodes are a fraction as stern as this one.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' harmonizes surprisingly well
with the new segments. Although its colors are ruddier and slightly
darker than the glistening hues of the new version, it doesn't seem
visually out of place. And it is certainly a lot more coherent and
inventive than the attempt by ``Fantasia/2000'' to match it with a
story built around another classic Disney character, Donald Duck.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of fusing Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches
(arranged by Peter Schickele) to a vignette featuring Disney's
pompous little quacker is not a bad one. It just doesn't go
anywhere. Here Donald (like Mickey) plays an assistant, but his
boss happens to be Noah, who is preparing the ark for departure.
While processing animals lined up for the journey, Donald gets
carried away and becomes separated from his beloved Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   From the movie's wraparound Imax images to its hosts (Steve
Martin, Itzhak Perlman, Quincy Jones, Bette Midler, James Earl
Jones, Penn and Teller, Angela Lansbury and James Levine) who
introduce the segments, ``Fantasia/2000'' often has the feel of a
giant corporate promotion whose stars are there simply to hawk the
company's wares. As smooth as these introductions are, they give
the film a choppy momentum and only underscore the grandiosity of
the idea of ``improving'' mass culture by wedding classical music
and animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia'' was conceived as a glorified music-appreciation
course designed to bring highbrow music to everyone. But while the
synchronization of classical music with animated images certainly
furthered the art of animation by encouraging abstract design, it
proved to be a hit-and-miss affair and not much more than
high-flown kitsch, even at its best in the original production.
Ideally the music and imagery should fuse into something larger
than either. It has rarely worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' opens with a battle between two groups of
abstract shapes (to a fragment of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony) that
is too abbreviated to amount to much. It moves on to Respighi's
``Pines of Rome,'' in which a school of whales takes flight after a
supernova explodes over its arctic habitat. Although the images
follow the mood swings of the diaphanous score, the visuals quickly
becomes redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' the new version's second-best episode (set
to Gershwin and directed by Eric Goldberg), is a stylish visual
homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. Here a group of jazz-age
Manhattan residents from every step of the social ladder collide in
a witty, hyperkinetic evocation of the New York melting pot.
Although we hardly get to know these characters, each is sharply
defined. It is the only segment whose imagery completely transcends
a Disney cartoony cuteness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the cuteness spectrum, Goldberg also
directed the zany ``Carnival of the Animals'' (to Saint-Saens) in
which a group of marching flamingos get tangled up in a yo-yo. In a
more traditional vein, the Allegro from Shostakovich's Piano
Concerto No. 2 drives the story (adapted from a Hans Christian
Andersen tale) of a brave tin soldier who rescues a beautiful
ballerina from the clutches of an evil jack-in-the-box. It's the
one segment that comes close to being traditionally romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Even given the Imax-size screen, ``Fantasia/2000'' (unlike the
1940 version) is not especially innovative in its look or subject
matter. And except for the ``Firebird Suite'' and ``Rhapsody in
Blue,'' the music seems more background than integral to any
concept. This is not to say that ``Fantasia/2000'' is devoid of
dazzling moments. But despite its science-fiction title, the movie
is really a compendium of familiar Disney attitudes and styles, one
thatto the past more than to the future.

COMMENTARY: WHAT WOMEN WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first female overachiever of this millennium would have been
Freydis, the sister of Leif Ericson. Leif was quite the millennial
man himself, having stumbled on North America around the year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Norse settlement there was attacked, Freydis led
the defense, despite her advanced pregnancy. ``She took her breasts
out and whetted the sword upon them. At that, the (enemy) became
afraid and ran away,'' reported a Viking chronicler. Why, in the
era of Xena and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, does this woman not have
a TV series of her own?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Freydis qualifies for one of the really great
women of the last thousand years _ the thing with the sword was
really her best moment. The inevitable nominees from the distant
past would include Queen Elizabeth I, Joan of Arc and Shikibu
Murasaki, whose ``Tales of Genji'' was the first realistic novel.
My own favorite is Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century abbess,
mystic and composer who went into a trance and levitated whenever a
male authority figure tried to cross her.
</P>
<P>
   What you notice about these women, and most of the other
super-achieving females of the millennium, is how solitary they
seem. The great things they did may have startled the world, or
improved the lot of humanity, but they didn't open the way for
other women to follow in their path. Wang Zhenui discovered the law
of lunar eclipses in the 18th century, but that didn't create
opportunities for future generations of Chinese women to become
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to our own time, the great women no longer look quite so
isolated. But many of them seem like disappointed figures, waitingfor something that never arrived. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, the 19th-century suffragists, understood that they'd
probably die before women in American got the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But they did believe that when the day came, it would change
everything for their sex from that time on. It didn't. ``She would
have been astounded we had to go through another women's
movement,'' said Lynn Sherr, the author of ``Failure Is
Impossible,'' an Anthony biography.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know the name of the first woman who looked down at her
sleeping daughter and imagined her having the same chances as any
boy, but we do know that she didn't get her wish.
</P>
<P>
   Women who fought for social change often believed they were on
the brink of an era when they could make an impact on society
without being the most spectacular strivers of their era. It didn't
happen. During the French Revolution, women petitioned the National
Assembly to remember to ``abolish also the privileges of the male
sex.'' The Assembly forgot.
</P>
<P>
   It took the post-industrial revolution to create an economy in
which the sexes might be able to compete equally, and it took a
biological revolution to give us control of our bodies. A
millennium ago women had the will to practice birth control, but
the means were more than a little shaky.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern Europe, protected sex in A.D. 1000 involved drinking
a potion made of ground wolf penis, spitting into the mouth of a
frog or eating bees. In Muslim Spain, where things were more
sophisticated, women who wanted to avoid pregnancy were advised to
leap up and down after the sexual act, then jump backwards nine
times.
</P>
<P>
   But once birth control became relatively simple and physical
strength dwindled as a requirement for the world of work, society
shifted so quickly you'd have thought the pressure of all those
generations of isolated eccentrics and disappointed strivers was
propelling things forward.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in high school, teachers were still warning us that
girls couldn't be scientists. Now 40 percent of all graduate
degrees go to women. Progress seems slow when you happen to be
living it, but put in a millennial context, the speed takes your
breath away.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who are professional complainers can tell you all
the areas where we're still falling short. We fret that what was
won might be taken away, and feel guilty about the gulf between our
lives and those of women in places like Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the peculiar celebration of the turn of the calendar we're
having this New Year's Eve gives us a chance to think about the
obvious but incredible fact of how far we've come, and what we've
seen in our own lifetimes. The liberation that women throughout
history have fought for, or sometimes been unable to even imagine,
occurred in the last blink of the millennium, for us.

&HT;     LAWMAKER URGES GORE, HILLARY CLINTON TO SEEK RELEASE OF SPY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is one of
the top Jewish elected officials in New York, said he would urge
Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to
advocate for the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American convicted
of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Such a position would force both Gore and Clinton to abandon the
White House's seven-year refusal of clemency for Pollard, who was
convicted in 1986 on an espionage charge and sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Gore and Clinton resist calling for Pollard's release,
both stand to lose crucial support from New York's Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, led a four-person Assembly
delegation Wednesday to visit Pollard at the North Carolina federal
prison where he is being held. The speaker is a top political
adviser in New York for Gore's presidential campaign and Clinton's
campaign for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its the right thing to do; I think an injustice was
done to the man, to the extent that he is still sitting in jail
after 14 years,'' Silver said. ``I have no idea on how (Gore and
Clinton) will react. I spoke to Hillary yesterday and indicated to
her that I was coming down today, and she seemed anxious to hear
from me after I had a chance to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the vice president, ``I will still ask him to commute the
sentence or ask him to give clemency,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was convicted of handing over more than 1,000 top-secret
documents to Israel in 1984 and 1985 while working as a civilian
analyst for U.S. Naval Intelligence. His supporters _ including
many high-level Jewish leaders _ believe the ``friendly nation''
should have been entitled to those secrets anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But national law enforcement and intelligence officials
dissuaded President Clinton as recently as last fall from granting
Pollard clemency, charging that some of the information the spy
gave to Israel was, in turn, handed over to Russia and may have
cost American agents their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Hillary Rodham Clinton has said where they
stand on the matter of granting Pollard clemency; and both camps on
Wednesday appeared to dodge being pinned down on an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``understands the concerns of Shelly Silver and others
who feel strongly about this issue, and she has not taken a
position yet,'' said campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Tom Rosshirt was even more vague, saying the vice
president _ by virtue of his position _ has not taken an in-depth
look at the case. Only presidents can grant clemency to federal
prisoners. Rosshirt also refused to say whether Gore would consider
Pollard's release if elected president, calling that scenario
``hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The matter of Pollard's release continues to be important to the
state's Jewish community. With a high turnout rate, Jewish voters
generally account for 25 percent of the vote in New York's
Democratic primaries _ and could potentially pick the winner of the
already tight race between Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley. The New York presidential primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jewish voters could make up as much as 15 percent of
the total turnout in the Senate election in November, pollsters
estimate. In 1998, the Jewish vote accounted for more than 10
percent _ 575,000 out of 5 million _ of the statewide electoral
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Hillary Clinton leading the
all-but-announced Republican opponent in the Senate race, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who called for Pollard's release three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Silver accused federal prosecutors of reneging on a plea bargain
with Pollard, and said the spy's legal rights were violated when he
tried to appeal the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to the Jewish community ... but there's an
issue of injustice here, and it transcends the issue of the Jewish
community,'' Silver said. ``Other similar cases have not had this
kind of magnitude of this sentence. People do not spend 14 years in
jail under similar circumstances.''

COMMENTARY: THE FAULT, DEAR BRUTUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS  
 &HT;     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we think of our achievements at the end of this millennium,
it is not artistic expressions of the human spirit that come to
mind. Today's music and literature and art can hardly claim to
surpass the past's. Not many contemporary buildings can be compared
to Chartres.
</P>
<P>
   It is science and technology at which we excel. In the year 1000
most people lived in isolated communities, unaware of other
societies. Today, from the palm of our hand, we can send words
around the world. We can cure disease. We can destroy cities with a
single weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the particulars there has been one transforming
change over this thousand years. It is the adoption of the
scientific method: the commitment to experiment, to test every
hypothesis. But it is broader than science. It is the open mind,
the willingness in all aspects of life to consider possibilities
other than the received truth. It is openness to reason.
</P>
<P>
   Reason, Freud said, is persistent. It keeps trying to get past
the dark instinctive forces in our psyche: ``This is one of the few
points on which one can be optimistic about the future of
mankind.'' He wrote that in 1933, just as the Nazis were about to
show how powerful unreason can be.
</P>
<P>
   There you have the conflicted character of the century just
ending. It saw dazzling scientific achievements _ and the darkest
human instincts working on an unprecedented scale. More than 100
million people were killed in the name of ideology, perhaps 25
million by the Nazis, the rest by Communist regimes. This terrible
century, Hannah Arendt called it.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter continued till the end of the century. Millions
more have died in recent years, hated for their beliefs or their
ethnic identity. Nothing in earlier centuries outdid the savagery
of Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The great enemy of reason in this century has been political
utopianism: absolute belief in a supposedly perfect system. In the
totalitarian state that utopianism produced, dissent could not be
tolerated; everything and everyone was forced into a single mold.
The result was catastrophe for man and nature.
</P>
<P>
   The romance with political utopias is ended now. But the
struggle for reason, for the open mind, continues. Human beings
have a tenacious ability to shut out what they do not want to know:
the novel, the uncomfortable. We all have disabling certitudes. We
all suffer from deafness of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Deafness to reason is especially dangerous today on one
question: how to maintain a livable earth. I think it is the most
profound challenge of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of global warming, for example, is all around us. The
increasing number of damaging storms, the higher winter
temperatures: Something is happening. The evidence is not just
personal or anecdotal. A well-based scientific study published this
month said that an area of Arctic Sea ice larger than Massachusetts
is melting every year. Continuation of that trend will mean a
significant rise in sea levels and the swamping of coastal cities
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Related to the environmental challenge is population growth.
There were about 310 million people in the world in the year 1000.
We have just passed the six-billion mark. We can feel the pressure
of the rising numbers, on other species and on nature generally,
even in a spacious country like the United States. In Rwanda, poor,
small and densely populated, population pressure surely contributed
to sparking the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   It will require all of our ingenuity and commitment to meet the
challenges of environmental degradation and population growth. But
even modest steps are obstructed now by ideology or a self-interest
that cannot see beyond the short term. Like Micawber, we hope that
something will turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever our faith, there is no escape from human responsibility
_ from the demands of reason. As President Kennedy said at the end
of his inaugural speech in 1961, ``Let us go forth to lead the land
we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on
earth God's work must truly be our own.''

COMMENTARY: MIRACLES AT WARP SPEED 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just 50 years ago, no time at all in the long
excursion of history, Americans were driving cars with divided
windshields, listening to ballgames on radios that crackled with
static, and reading comic strips that suggested someday there might
be a portable electronic device (a wrist radio, perhaps) that would
allow individuals to have the equivalent of a telephone with them
at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment your personal computers and fax machines.
Americans on the cusp of 1950 had not even heard of rock 'n' roll.
Milkmen were ubiquitous. Credit cards were not. Even television was
an oddity.
</P>
<P>
   Just 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night the country will raise a toast to the peaceful and
prosperous transition from one epoch to another, a toast that in
effect is a salute to the remarkable advances of the past
half-century. Those advances have been driven by science and
technology and a commitment to the ideals of freedom, and they have
lifted the quality of life for most of us to heights that would
have astonished midcentury America.
</P>
<P>
   Now buckle up. This ride is just getting started. The last few
decades have been amazing. But the next few will be profound.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Dr. Dari Shalon, director of the Harvard Center for
Genomics Research:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some recent results have indicated that things that looked
very complex, such as aging and intelligence, can actually be
altered with a single gene. And once you can alter something with a
single gene, it's not far-fetched to imagine gene therapy
permanently altering what's called the germ line, which means it
gets transmitted from generation to generation. I think people will
be very hesitant to do that on humans, but it's very easy to make a
small molecule drug that you can just take as a pill that alters
the activity of a single gene. The pharmaceutical industry is well
geared to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So once certain genes are discovered that actually change, if
you will, a cognitive trait _ intelligence _ or even things such as
life span, it's not too far-fetched to imagine a small pill that
actually influences these two activities. I don't think it's as far
off as people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less drastic will be things such as tissue regeneration. So,
for example, people who are suffering now from nerve disorders _
say, Parkinson's disease or liver disease _ we're getting pretty
close in animals and pretty soon in humans to be able to simply
regenerate those tissues from what's called stem cells. And that's
a new form of therapy that I believe is going to be on the horizon
within 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Or listen to Dr. Michael Crow, executive vice provost for
research at Columbia University:
</P>
<P>
   ``Science right now is the most powerful single force in our
culture. We've got guys who are not just working on the double
helix, approaching the structure that carries all of our DNA-based
genetic code _ they're saying: `Well, let's build something beyond
that. Let's build our own structures.'
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get into that very, very heady business of building
molecular communication molecules _ which puts us into the role of
life designer _ and not deal with the complicated ethical and moral
questions?''
</P>
<P>
   We are speeding semiblindly into frontiers that will change not
just our standard of living, but even, in very fundamental ways,
what it means to be human. The science and technology that have
made something wondrous of our lives to date are now pulling us
ahead at warp speed. The crucial task is to find out how to do more
than just hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Crow is helping to develop a project that will bring experts
together from a wide variety of disciplines to study the
implications _ and, where feasible, help shape the outcomes _ of
scientific and technological research.
</P>
<P>
   Offering an illustration of the astonishing speed of some
scientific advances, Crow said, ``Biological science's knowledge is
doubling every 180 days.''
</P>
<P>
   When the toasts are done and our heads have cleared and we are
squinting in wonder at the rising sun of the new century, we'll see
the need for a more knowledgeable and mature approach by all of us
to the accelerating miracles of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   If we're up to the task, and our luck holds, we'll hand the
coming generations a world that even in our most optimistic moments
we could never have imagined.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech's White won't decide on NFL until after Gator Bowl
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Georgia Tech's Dez White will not decide
whether to enter the NFL draft until after the Gator Bowl, his
mother and his coach say.
</P>
<P>
   Desiree White reacted strongly to reports that her son, a junior
receiver projected as a potential first-round pick, has decided to
leave school early.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely, positively not true,'' Desiree White said
Thursday. ``We are not going to make any decision . . . until after
the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach George O'Leary said he had not discussed the issue
with White. ``If Dez has decided to enter the draft, I would
know,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   White was not available to comment Thursday because players are
off limits to the media until after Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   It is against NCAA rules for a player with eligibility remaining
to hire an agent. Several agents have tried to contact White at the
team hotel, his mother said. ``We are being very aboveboard,'' she
said. ``We would not resort to doing such things.''
</P>
<P>
   Since August, White has maintained he will weigh his options
after the last game of the year. ``It's a decision I'll have to
make with my family after the season,'' he said earlier this week.
``I don't want it to be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   White caught 44 passes for 860 yards and five touchdowns this
season, after catching 46 for 973 yards and nine TDs last year. But
with All-America quarterback Joe Hamilton playing his final game,
the Jackets might resort to more of a running attack next season,
which could become a part of White's decision.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, a former NFL assistant, said he will call league
officials to ascertain White's draft prospects. Underclassmen have
until Jan. 10 to decide to enter the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a No. 1 draft pick as a junior, you should come
out,'' O'Leary said. ``The money is too good. Any coach wants his
players to come back. You have to be honest and up-front with them.
I want what's best for the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't take me long to find out (White's draft prospects).
Agents don't know what's going on. They're looking at (players) as
dollar bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Desiree White said she is especially upset that the reports
portray her son as not being honest with the media, his coaches and
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dez only wants to focus on the bowl game,'' she said. ``We
have the utmost respect for coach O'Leary and his staff, and we
would not want to burn any bridges.''

`CLOSE-UP': FILM AS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one film after another, the great Iranian director
Abbas Kiarostami twists around the equation that the author Neal
Gabler calls ``Life: The Movie'' to make films whose aesthetic
might be described as ``The Movie: Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiarostami's films frequently feature nonactors playing
themselves in unglamorized reconstructions of actual events. And in
his brilliant, knotty 1990 film ``Close-Up,'' those reconstructions
are seamlessly embedded in a documentary about the trial of Hossein
Sabzian, a young man arrested on charges of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close-Up'' is directed in a radically drab cinema-verite style
that helps blur any difference between what is real and what is
reconstructed. The movie is not always easy to watch. In one scene,
the camera follows the course of a kicked piece of trash for a few
seconds that seem nearly endless.
</P>
<P>
   But if, on the surface, the movie appears to epitomize crude,
seat-of-your-pants filmmaking, the raw aesthetic of ``Close-Up,''
which is not rated, is really one its strengths. For like other
Kiarostami films, it goes to risky extremes to remind us that what
we are seeing is a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, as the director and his
cinematographer and sound engineer follow Sabzian in a post-trial
sequence, their audio equipment malfunctions, and as the sound
comes in and out, half of what we see is silent. The director's
insistence on making us aware of filmmaking technology is part of a
broader strategy to force us to contemplate the basic experience of
moviegoing.
</P>
<P>
   The serious, far-reaching joke of ``Close-Up'' is that Sabzian's
fraud was his impersonation of a successful filmmaker, Mohsen
Makhmalbaf. By pretending to be a director interested in filming
the Ahankhahs, a well-to-do family, Sabzian was able insinuate his
way into their lives and feel like a Somebody.
</P>
<P>
   It all began by chance, when he was reading Makhmalbaf's book
``The Cyclist,'' while sitting next to Mrs. Ahankhah on a bus.
After they struck up a conversation, he impulsively said he was the
author, and one thing led to another. His deceit in some ways
parallels John Guare's ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' in which a
young man of meager means and dazzling charm convinces a prosperous
Manhattan couple that he is the prep-school-educated son of the
actor Sidney Poitier.
</P>
<P>
   After they find him out, the Ahankhahs accuse Sabzian of fraud
because he borrowed money from them. Since he has thoroughly
inspected their home in preparation for a film he says he is
preparing, in which they will appear, they assume he has been
planning to rob them.
</P>
<P>
   But at the trial, it becomes evident that Sabzian had no plans
to steal from his new friends. A dreamer who worships art, he
insists that he pretended to be Makhmalbaf because it gave him
status and self-esteem. At first, Mehrdad, one of the Ahankhahs'
sons, doesn't believe him and accuses him of playing another role.
But as Sabzian abjectly pleads his innocence to the judge and
apologizes to the Ahankhahs, he cuts a compellingly waifish figure.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sabzian's poignancy that makes ``Close-Up'' much more than
a clever reflection on film-vs.-life as an endless hall of mirrors.
A transcendent humanist in the tradition of the Italian neorealists
and the Indian director Satyajit Ray, Kiarostami has made a film
that looks into the heart of a man accused of a crime and, instead
of evil, discovers only sweetness, longing and a sad confusion.
</P>

 &HT;    Dodd award given to Virginia Tech's BeamerBy Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer added Thursday
another prestigious award to his fast-growing collection. Beamer,
53, was named the 1999 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer already had won coach-of-the-year awards from the Walter
Camp Foundation and the Associated Press. He is one of three
finalists for the Eddie Robinson award, which will be presented in
February by the Football Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met coach Dodd, but I do know this award is for more
than wins and losses,'' Beamer said. ``It's also for what you do
with your kids off the field. That's very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The award has been presented since 1976 by the Bobby Dodd
Foundation and goes to an individual ``in recognition of a higher
and more noble aspect of college coaching _ a style that emphasizes
something more than winning the game, a belief that the game of
football should be kept in perspective with college life in
general.''

<P>
   By the time you read this, it will be next year in New Zealand,
and our correspondent Matt Sullivan will be at his computer,
chronicling the Y2K crisis in the town of Glen Massey, population
105. ``I'll tell you if any cows stray into the road and if any of
the gates are noncompliant,'' promises Sullivan, who works as a
computer-aided draftsman when he isn't monitoring millennial
madness on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Buddhist nun will be sitting at her workstation at
the Kundeling Monastery in Mysore,Indorting breaking news
from the spiritual center. A computer expert in Reykjavik will be
manning the keyboard at the official command headquarters in
Iceland, and a limo driver will be firing off the hottest
happenings from Tamuning, Guam.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the one day we need to know what's going on
in the streets of Reykjavik and the cowfields of Glen Massey. If
the electricity konks out in Guam, folks still have time to race
out and buy that spare generator _ or at least dig up those
mustard-scented aromatherapy candles the in-laws gave us for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Dick Clark or Peter Jennings when we've got Web cams
and dot coms? All day Friday, farflung correspondents will be
filing up-to-the-minute reports on various grassroots Web sites set
up to monitor the millennium. Some 3,000 scribes have volunteered
to contribute to Zone 2000 (www.jrwhipple.com/z2k), a site hosted
by J.R. Whipple, a semi-retired programmer in Corning, Calif. ``I
spent 20 years of my career creating this problem, and a year or so
ago, I thought it might not be a bad idea to have a little clearing
house for regular Joes who want to tell us what is happening in
their neck of the woods,'' Whipple says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same experts who will be glued to their computers
are the ones telling us to turn the darn things off for 48 hours,
just in case. But for those who can't detach themselves from their
monitors, the Internet promises to be a great place to watch the
action unfold. But be warned: Stuff posted by amateurs isn't always
reliable, so if some scribe from Budapest reports a ``War of the
Worlds'' scenario, it might be a good idea to check it out on
official government sites, such as the U.S. site (www.y2k.gov) and
the United Nations site (www.iycc.org).
</P>
<P>
   But the official sites give you exactly that _ the ``official''
line, which is crucial, but not exactly up close and personal.
Steve Davis, a Y2K consultant in Simpsonville, Md., wanted to set
up a way for regular citizens worldwide to get a handle on what is
happening on the grassroots level. He's enlisting volunteers to
file reports, which will be moderated to avoid sex, lies, and
flames. ``It's important to get the community aspect, whether it's
a computer malfunction, an electrical failure or just people lining
up outside the store to stock up on toilet paper,'' Davis notes.
The site is at www.coalition2000.org/GICC.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Davis plans to be at his workstation all day _ although he is
taking a few hours off to stop in at a party and ``bang some
pots.'' But some of the corresondents out there don't plan to leave
their screens for even a minute. ``I'll be glued to my computer,''
says Preston Alexander, a former computer programmer who is now an
aspiring novelist in Provincetown. ``I'll have my short wave radio,
my television, my can of tuna and can opener ready, and my
fireplace blazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander will be filing reports at Zone 2000 from his hot spot
on Cape Cod; his former colleagues, he says, called him Dr. Doom.
``The other day when I did my grocery shopping, people looked at me
like I was some extremist or weirdo or freak,'' he says. ``When I
got to the checkout counter with my 50 gallons of water, a
policeman circled my cart twice.'' Did he really buy 50 gallons of
water? ``Actually, I bought 60 gallons,'' says Alexander, who has
already filed his first report on Zone 2000. It turns out his
furnace died and his pipes froze on Christmas morning, and the
disaster had nothing to do with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not too late to stock up if the reports from New
Zealand seem to indicate trouble ahead. There are plenty of Web
sites offering advice on what staples to buy: There's even one
designed specifically for ladies at www.y2kwomen.com. The site, run
by Karen Anderson of Phoenix, has a long checklist for the ``busy
woman.'' Along with essential items like flashlights and firewood,
the list includes all those important things like makeup and hair
coloring. ``Don't discount this as unimportant!'' the site warns.
``If wearing makeup is part of your lifestyle, make sure you
include enough to last you for a while. It's important to feel good
about how you look!'' (Um, which century are we talking about
here?)
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, we will be in touch all day with our new Web buddy,
Matt Sullivan. He's not too worried about the fin de siecle, since
he lives on a self-sufficient farm with a wood burning stove and a
fresh rainwater supply. ``The millenium arrives here first,'' he
says, ``and I'll happy to tell you the future.'' We're hoping the
news is upbeat, otherwise there might be a stampede at the local
Lancome counter.

<P>
   &UR; By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.1999 Hearst Newspapers &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House's chief Y2K coordinator confidently
predicted Thursday that the rollover into the 2000 new year won't
bring major computer glitches in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   `This didn't happen by accident,'' said John Koskinen, the Y2K
chief, attributing the apparent lack of major Y2K problems to hard
work and billions of dollars invested by governments and the
private sector around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With a smooth transition in sight, Koskinen defended himself
against suggestions that the whole Y2K episode was a gross
exaggeration blown out of proportion by government safety officials
and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see some of the indications already arising where
people say, `Well, it was a lot of hype,''' Koskinen said. ``It was
not a lot of hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Koskinen said the Y2K threat ``has been a serious,
critical, major challenge to world systems that has been dealt with
for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned that the real Y2K test won't come until
Monday, Jan. 3, when millions of businesses and schools reopen
after the holiday weekend and use computers for the first time
since the millenium rollover.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects some ``minor hiccups or glitches'' in the
United States related to Y2K, but repeated his assessment that
large national or regional problems were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are doing as well as we are is a tribute to
the effort that's gone into it by the people who are actually
responsible for those (computer) systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's known as the Y2K problem stems from old computer
programming that expressed dates with two digits rather than four
digits to save space. This practice gave rise to fears that the
digits ``00'' would be interpreted by computers as the year 1900
rather than 2000. In turn, this could cause the computers to crash,
disrupting the financial, transportation, health-care industries
and other sectors dependent on date-sensitive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   To preclude such calamities, governments and private industry
have spent more than $100 billion upgrading their computers to
properly read the digits ``00'' as 2000. Private computer
consulting firms estimate that private industry and governments
around the world have spent close to $400 billion to prevent
potential Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said retailers and banks were reporting no unusual
changes in buying habits of food or gasoline or that people were
withdrawing large amounts of cash, as some bankers had once feared.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen predicted that stores would become crowded in the final
hours as consumers stocked up on bottled-water, batteries and food
for private New Year's Eve parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers continue to show more and more people are(going
to) celebrate at home with friends,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released Thursday showed that 71
percent of Americans surveyed had no special plans for the weekend
and that 66 percent of them were unlikely to take any special
precautions to guard against any Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has encouraged people to have enough food
and water on hand for three days as well as to purchase
flashlights, batteries and a battery-powered radio. But opinion
polls show that more Americans seem to be concerned about
terrorism. The same USA Today poll showed that 61 percent of those
surveyed say a terrorist attack against the United States was very
likely or somewhat likely on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen will be the official U.S. Y2K spokesman during New
Year's weekend, providing regular briefings beginning at noon EST
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen coordinates a federal government command post that will
track any computer-related glitches around the world, beginning
with New Zealand, which becomes the first sizable country to move
into the New Year, turning past midnight at 6 a.m. EST on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not much is going on by the time we get to the middle of
the afternoon tomorrow, I think that will give us some increased
confidence that not much is going to happen here,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts say the United States and most other
developed countries were well prepared for the rollover into the
New Year. Some undeveloped countries may experience major
disruptions, such as failed electric power grids.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen warned that such events might not surface until later
in January because it takes time for problems in complex computer
systems to build up and cause a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Thursday, most federal agencies continued testing
their computers to see how well they will function on Jan. 1 and
beyond. The Federal Aviation Administration made last-minute
repairs to computers that process radar data and send it to air
traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   FAA Administrator Jane Garvey described the problem as a ``very,
very minor issue.'' But the union representing FAA employees _ the
Professional Airways Systems Specialists _ charged that the
computer problem was a bigger deal and ``nearly put passenger lives
in jeopardy.'' The union is currently in contract negotiations with
the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency assigned staffers to all
50 states and five territories to help respond to any large-scale
emergencies caused by possible Y2K computer problems. As is
normally the case in natural disasters such as hurricanes, FEMA
would only be called in after a state's governor asked President
Clinton to declare a federal disaster area.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lightship baskets, those simple oval and round
baskets with wooden handles carried as summer purses by proud women
on Nantucket, could have been invented only there. Soon after the
first settlers arrived on Nantucket in 1659, they learned to make
their living from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1800s they had formed America's largest whaling
fleet, with ships traveling as far as the Pacific and Southeast
Asia in their quest for more and more whales. One of the products
they brought back from the Far East was rattan, a pliable palm best
known today as the cane used for seating. Nantucketers used rattan
to form a new kind of basket, and the resulting cottage industry
continues on the island to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Now a selection of antique lightship baskets is the highlight of
a loan exhibition organized by the Nantucket Historical Association
for the 46th annual East Side Winter Antiques Show, which runs from
Jan. 21 to 30 at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan. The
exhibition, ``Away Off Shore,'' also features portraits, whaling
artifacts, ship logs, ceramics, silver, furniture and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   Basket making is a slow, painstaking task that requires people
with a lot of time on their hands, which explains the second part
of the basket story.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of losing their precious ships, Nantucketers began
deploying lightships, floating lighthouses anchored at sea, as
early as 1828, with the first being the Cross Rip. In 1854 they
sent another one to the deadly South Shoal southeast of Nantucket.
Such ships would be stationed as far as 40 miles offshore for
months to warn whalers and clippers of the dangers in the
surrounding waters.
</P>
<P>
   It was an efficient system, but not infallible. In stormy
weather a lightship was difficult to handle; sometimes the ships
capsized and were lost at sea. But in calm waters days were long
and life was monotonous. Crew members had only to raise the mast
lights at dusk, lower them at dawn and keep them clean. In their
spare time during the winter they made sturdy open baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucketers are an industrious breed. Ralph Waldo Emerson
called the offshore community ``the nation of Nantucket.'' As David
H. Wood, a trustee of the Nantucket Historical Association, wrote
in 1995 in The Magazine Antiques, Nantucket, ``insular in every
sense of the word, developed not only its own government, laws and
mores, but also its own skills and crafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most skilled craftsmen were the coopers, who made
staved wooden vessels, including barrels, buckets and casks. It was
probably their ability to steam and bend wood staves over a moldthat later allowed them to form the rattan lightship baskets.
</P>
<P>
   The simple basket looks like a beautifully proportioned mixing
bowl. The origin of the form is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local Wampanoag Indians might have had something to do
it,'' said Sam Sylvia, a Nantucket antiques dealer whose family has
been selling the baskets since 1927. ``Quakers on the island may
also have seen similar baskets made by a colony of Quakers on the
Continent.'' Nonetheless, successive generations of captains, mates
and crew members developed variations in their own distinctive
form.
</P>
<P>
   The baskets were designed as utilitarian household items. In
``The Lightship Baskets of Nantucket'' (Casey Publications, 1994),
Wood wrote in one of the book's essays that they were ``merely one
of the appurtenances of a simple and frugal lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia said, ``They made baskets to collect berries, transport
pies, hold sewing kits, carry laundry and store field vegetables
and apples.''
</P>
<P>
   As antiques, lightship baskets made aboard the New South Shoal
Lightship are probably the most prized, Sylvia said. ``Maybe it's
because that ship was in the most precarious position,'' he added.
``There was a lot of sea traffic, and several ships were swept
away. Lightships were run down by steamers. In a dense fog, the
lights and bells and whistles didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for the lightships lessened when oil and kerosene were
introduced, and the whale-oil market withered. Nantucket's
population fell from 10,000 in 1830 to about 3,000 in 1880. The
trade in lightship baskets never faltered, however; it just went
ashore. ``The standard of craftsmanship was amazingly high,'' Wood
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s summer visitors discovered Nantucket and began to
buy the baskets as romantic souvenirs. Then folk-art collectors
began buying lightship baskets signed by early masters, including
Capt. Charles B. Ray (1798-1884), his grandson Clinton Mitchell Ray
(1870-1956), Capt. James Wyer (1816-1899) and Davis Hall
(1828-1895).
</P>
<P>
   Today in Nantucket shops like the 40-year-old Four Winds Crafts
Guild sell antique baskets for $3,000 to $6,000, but fine ones in
good condition with a dark, rich brown patina go for a lot more,
especially if they were made by a top name. In 1994 a nest of six
baskets signed by Davis Hall sold for $118,000 when Sotheby's
auctioned the holdings of the renowned folk-art collector Nina
Fletcher Little.
</P>
<P>
   The basket became a purse only after World War II. In the late
1940s an immigrant from the Philippines named Jose Formoso Reyes
moved to Nantucket. He added hinges to the tops to make pocketbooks
and attached ivory or whalebone plaques, with the owner's initials
or carved bas-relief whales or sea gulls. The purses quickly became
status symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were carried as purses as a badge of exclusiveness,''
Wood wrote. In time such purses were acquired by stylish taste
makers like Bunny Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized all over the world,'' said Susan
Ottison, a Nantucket native who has been making baskets and their
carved decorations for 31 years. Her husband, Karl, makes the
basket handles and wood bottoms out of cherry, walnut and imported
ebony and rosewood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ottison uses dentists' tools to carve flying pigs, rabbits,
dolphins, shells and whales from antique ivory and whalebone. She
says she has a three-year waiting list for her commissions, which
cost between $100 and $1,000, with customers from as far away as
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Nancy Chase, runs the Nancy Chase Carving Shop. A
self-trained master carver as well as a basket maker, Ms. Chase has
been in the lightship basket business since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of my work is custom, and each commission
is a challenge,'' Ms. Chase said. ``I like carving in three
dimensions: whales, dogs, cats, flowers. I'm now doing seven
dancing angels. I have a lot of back orders, but I go at my own
speed.''

Nantucketers go at their own speed, and their baskets are always

<P>
   When the big questions are too big to answer, the trick is to
think small.
</P>
<P>
   The collective breath-taking, life-examining,
balance-sheet-tallying, and stock-taking attendant upon millennial
tick-marks make all but the dullest aware of how much has changed,
and how exciting but apprehensive is the future.
</P>
<P>
   This is my ``Three Spices'' recipe for the next era, taken from
the ancient Latin:
</P>
<P>
   ``Respice, adspice, prospice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to the past, look to the present, look to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 6 billion of us, white-knuckled passengers on the
watery orb hurtling around our sun, and we are all turning clock
and calendar in the same direction. There's no going back, but we
cannot help looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Whence sprang we? Where are we? Where are we going? The big
questions are hard to answer. But the trick to improving the lot of
humankind at this juncture is to ask the simpler questions: What
can I do to make things better? On my own?
</P>
<P>
   What's the single best thing most Americans can do to make life
a little better? Lose five pounds, recommends a fresh American
Medical Association study. You'll be able to climb stairs more
easily and have fewer aches and pains. Try it. You'll like it. Need
more ammo? The average American puts on seven pounds between
Thanksgiving and New Year's, estimates a fitness company.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, we enjoy a lavish standard of living. But 1 out of
5 households subsists on $24 per day, and the next-better-off
quintile of households live on $55 a day. This is a lot better than
the one-fifth of mankind, all 1.2 billion of us, who exist on the
equivalent of one dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   But we've got a maldistribution of wealth going on here. ``Ten
years ago, there were 66 billionaires and 31.5 million people
livow the poverty line in this country. Today there are 268
billionaires and 34.5 million people living below the official
poverty line _ about $13,000 for a three-person family,'' says
Chuck Collins of United for a Fair Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The top fifth of US housholds earn half of all income in the
nation. The richest 1 percent of Americans will have as many
after-tax dollars to spend as the poorest 100 million. Does that
sound right?
</P>
<P>
   The stock markets have been volcanoes of prosperity for many
Americans. But the lava flows mostly to the already-rich or
already-well-off. Two out of three Americans with a job earn less
than $40,000 a year. Does that sound right?
</P>
<P>
   Now take guns. Please. We have as many as 200 million guns
floating around this country, for only 274 million people. No other
developed country allows this much firepower in the hands of
ordinary citizens. Which is why we have 40,000 Americans shot dead
every year. Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Japan, Australia,
all their laws are much tougher. Canada banned semiautomatics and
big-rifle ammunition in 1991, and authorities want to register
every gun in the country within two years.
</P>
<P>
   We can do something about guns and gunplay. But the man polls
identify as most likely to be elected president in November, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, signed a law that gives Texas citizens the
right to carry a concealed gun. Does that sound right? When 40,000
Americans get shot dead every year?
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to crime, which leads to prison, which gives us
prisoners. Two million Americans are behind bars at this juncture.
Close to another half-million have to work to feed, clothe, guard,
and tend to them. All those 2 million convicts, except the ones who
are executed or die in a cell, are coming out, just as dumb,
hostile, uneducated, ignorant, and unemployable as when they went
in. Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   No other country does it this way. Virtually every state in
America pays more to keep people in prison than the state spends on
colleges and universities. Does that sound right?
</P>
<P>
   There is a common belief that money is ``radix malorum,'' in the
ancient Latin, ``the root of all evil.'' It's more like the envy of
money is the root of evil. It's possible to envision evil in a
cashless society. But there can be no such thing as an evil-less
society. Put three people on a desert island, give them each a gold
coin, and by the end of the day, one of them has three coins and
two enemies. I tend to think that is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Our ambivalence about money is farcical. We crave the creature
comforts it buys, while denouncing its perfidious influence on our
fellows. The poor are always with us, in large measure because we
do not, at heart, believe that money will ameliorate the lot of the
poor. We think something is wrong with them beyond a severe case of
the shorts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no money to be made in helping the poor. That is the
sad crux of the matter. On those rare occasions when someone
possessed of great wealth decides to shower it all upon the
unwealthy, we pause respectfully, mouth the appropriate pieties,
and shake our heads, inwardly repeating the timeworn adage about a
fool and his money, etc., resolving privately not to do anything
remotely as silly.
</P>
<P>
   Governments toss money at the poor, in greater or lesser
amounts, to quash incipient anarchy, and to make the streets safe
for the rich and the powerful. But there is a widespread consensus
that giving cash handouts to the needy is ultimately like watering
a field during a dry spell: No matter how much you lavish on the
thirsty acreage, it will soak up more. This explains the wild
popularity of ``work to welfare'' schemes drafted by '90s
politicians. It all sounded so good.
</P>
<P>
   We have split-screens for money, for the poor, and for taxes.
Oil has gone up from nine bucks a barrell to past $26, a near
threefold jump. But there was not a scintilla of a new tax on oil
or gas in this country, nor could there be, given politicians'
fears of raising taxes. Had a brave politician proposed that we
take a one-cent-a-gallon in extra tax on gasoline, and use the
resulting $1 billion in revenue to virtually double the daily
living standard of the planet's poorest billion people, what would
have been the reaction?
</P>
<P>
   That foolhardy politician would have been pilloried in the Wall
Street Journal as a brain-dead liberal. But we gave the difference
between nine bucks a barrell and $26 per to the oil companies,
whose greasy minions in Congress vote down anything close to a new
tax on ``earl,'' as our Sunbelt legionnaires say.
</P>
<P>
   These are just some of the smaller issues individual Americans
can do something about, with your votes and your campaign
contributions. Be of brave heart. You cannot go far wrong if you
adopt the motto once embraced by the Duke of Wellington: ``Virtutis
fortuna comes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortune is the companion of valor.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. This next millennium is in your hands.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes,
Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R,
101 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). A whole new order
of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical
exaggeration of this filmmaker's earlier work have blossomed into a
newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply
felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses,
this film weaves its own soap opera around ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women; Almodovar has
aptly described his material as ``screwball drama.'' Rich and
entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and
impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms.
San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named
Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANGELA'S ASHES,' starring Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joe
Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge. Directed by Alan Parker (R,
120 minutes). Anyone who thinks poverty is not pretty would have to
think twice after seeing this artfully desolate-looking film
version of Frank McCourt's boyhood memoir. As such, it's a perfect
tsk-tsk for the holiday season, describing dire suffering alongside
inspiring, uplifting episodes. Directed reverently by Parker, it
parades forth a series of familiar anecdotes from McCourt's book
without taking on much weight. This is the kind of film about
hardship in which nobody has indoor plumbing, but everybody has
clean hair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANNA AND THE KING,' starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 140 minutes). The same story that
inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ``The King and I'' is
the basis for this movie about the British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens (Ms. Foster), who travels to Bangkok in 1862 to educate
the 58 children of King Mongkut (Chow). Although the story has been
given a contemporary multicultural perspective that is critical of
British imperialism, the picturesque film tells essentially the
same story but without the beloved songs, which are badly missed.
Ms. Foster's Anna is another of her nobler-than-thou ice queens,
and Chow's king is authoritative but less than thunderous (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hypermacho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,' starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener,
Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to
the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a
stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a
technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder
workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack plays a
discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Malkovich's
mind. While the ordinary science fiction plot might go downhill
after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on
and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BICENTENNIAL MAN,' starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam
Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132
minutes). This year's gushy Christmas card from Robin Williams
follows the 200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to
become human. Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who
steered this star through ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the movie is a
joke-strewn sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us
feel good about being human that is punctuated by corny speeches
exalting freedom, the joys of sex and the mystery of mortality.
Except for illiams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a '40s
``David Copperfield'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `CRADLE WILL ROCK,' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben
Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa Redgrave.
Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes). This huge
Depression-era story features well-known figures from Orson Welles
to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works them into an
ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau. Though too many figures in this
landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Robbins and his
impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this (mostly)
true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught production of
the banner-waving 1936 agitprop musical ``The Cradle Will Rock'' by
Welles and John Houseman. Robbins and his cast play out all sides
of this event with the certitude that its importance lives on
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a
dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's
underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting
is London in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the
inspired costume designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'')
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `END OF DAYS,' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118
minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who
may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years.
And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty
would-be thriller. The material is so derivative that it amounts to
a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic films, with
special credit owed to ``The Exorcist'' for grisly sacrilegious
tricks. Hyams favors a jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock
value. The star dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic
forces. But Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and
has the better role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie,
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a pre-college-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in
prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy
ballad of a movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep
portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast
and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members
of a Canadian commune who took up Carter's cause and all but
eliminating his heroic co-defendant John Artis from the story. And
the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story
of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is
still inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the '90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia,'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAN ON THE MOON,' starring Jim Carrey, Courtney Love, Danny
DeVito and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Milos Forman (R, 118
minutes). Andy Kaufman: genius or creep? This biography takes the
more positive view and minimizes the kinkier aspects of Kaufman's
misanthropic performance art, preferring a big, vibrant collection
of greatest hits. Carrey channels his character brilliantly and
makes his material funnier and tighter than it was in fact. And
Forman directs with the same enthusiasm for outlaw Americana that
he brought to ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' But the writers, who
also wrote that film and ``Ed Wood,'' can't easily find an
unself-conscious side of the late comic artist to work with. This
feels like the authorized version. It has no real answer to the
question of who Kaufman was and how he got that way (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ONEGIN,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler and Martin Donovan.
Directed by Martha Fiennes (not rated, 106 minutes). As the
directorial debut of Fiennes' sister Martha, ``Onegin'' diminishes
Alexander Pushkin's epic 19th-century novel ``Evgeny Onegin'' into
a cramped little soap opera whose two stars are painfully
mismatched. While Fiennes acts up a fine storm as the arrogant,
cynical title character who doesn't believe in love, Ms. Tyler, who
plays his romantic nemesis, is an inert cipher. Somehow, even the
grand ballrooms of 1820s St. Petersburg look drab and chintzy
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SLEEPY HOLLOW,' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda
Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and
Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by
Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully
concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little
to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with
Burton's macabre vision. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's
shy detective, but the story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and
``Fight Club'') is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A
first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely for the secret
tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer
at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS,' starring Ethan Hawke, James Cromwell
and Max Von Sydow. Directed by Scott Hicks (PG-13, 130 minutes).
This director's follow-up to ``Shine'' is the cinematic equivalent
of an arty coffee-table book. It is so busy illustrating the story
(with elaborate flashbacks and montage sequences) that it forgets
to be dramatic. Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1950, the movie
looks back to World War II and the charged relationships between
Japanese-Americans and whites on an island north of the Puget
Sound. Hawke is the brooding reporter covering the trial and Von
Sydow the defense lawyer who is the film's official conscience.
Robert Richardson is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is adopted
by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian house cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `SWEET AND LOWDOWN,' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma
Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to
the kind of jaunty 1930s jazz that has been heard on many of his
other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a consummate jazz
character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn), who can play the
guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain
interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing
attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into
another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering
mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her
wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains
flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly
presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness
of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the
delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As
the story's odious playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly
wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a
shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome
with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOY STORY 2,' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98
minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's
wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to
computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that
Hollywood can still make movies to pudiences of any age or
persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody) to its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with
more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy
bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance
the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy
dealer, experiences new-found celebrity and needs to be rescued by
his fabulous old friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is
much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling the lives of former
schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James
Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has become much more
comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters
are also more interesting than might have been expected. Ms.
Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous oil
heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school
vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary
roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action
as well as he does the talk (Maslin).

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every New Year's eve, we would like to think, one
small story closes and another opens. But this year the story
arrives in a deluxe edition. The ball dropping in Times Square at
midnight will punctuate not just a chapter or a volume, but a boxed
set titled ``20th Century.'' It will be the first mark of an
ellipsis into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Thresholds are worrisome places: you know a good deal about what
you're leaving behind, but not much about what's ahead.
Vulnerability makes emotions run high. No wonder the prospect of
ending one life and starting another _ the millennial concept in a
nutshell _ invites responsive extremes of hope and despair.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, art is called on for guidance and assurance
in such matters. Certain kinds of objects play an instrumental,
constructive role, forecasting the future and insuring stability in
the here-and-now. Others have a speculative purpose, advancing
visions of what could and should be. Still others offer
retrospective glances, cautionary or nostalgic, to the past.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, art works for us as a psychic tuning fork
sensitive to every tremor of elation or fear, cosmic and personal.
One can feel those vibrations on visits to theme shows like
``Millennial Dreams: Vision and Prophecy in American Folk Art'' at
The Museum of American Folk Art, or ``From This World to the Next:
Jewish Approaches to Illness, Death, and the Afterlife'' at the
Jewish Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   They are just as evident on a tour of the permanent collections
of almost any museum in the city, as the old stories of ends and
beginnings converge on us this New Year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MORGAN LIBRARY
</P>
<P>
   For a high-pressure blast of millennial urgency, shifting
between storms and calms, one can do no better than visit the
Morgan Library, where two examples of work by William Blake
(1757-1825) are on view in a small show titled ``Collecting for the
Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was one of Western art's outstanding polymaths. He wrote
and illustrated a series of fantastic epic poems, hand-printing
them in a self-invented etching process that rendered each page as
fresh and unique as a painting. He was also a radical political
thinker who crafted a vision of history in mythological and
religious terms and conceived the world we live in as a
revolutionary site.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan is displaying two plates from ``America, A Prophecy''
(1793), an early work that distills Blake's spirit of utopian
agitation. For him, the American war of independence and French
Revolution were lynchpin unheavals of the kind promised by
Judeo-Christian Apocalyptic tradition. In them the forces of
liberty and tyranny met in pitched battle, after which, he trusted,
universal harmony would reign.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the two plates, the poem's title page, flames
shoot from the enemy's trike water from a riot hose, driving
a terrified family from their home. But even as fire and smoke fill
the sky, a figure with broken chains soars free. The conflict is
resolved in the second plate, a pastoral scene of sleeping
children, birds of paradise, and a clear sky washed in rainbow
hues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the time is dawn or sunset is a question, though. For
Blake, America didn't live up to its promise. The Declaration of
Independence was signed; but the abhorrent practice of slavery
continued. Yet his belief in the human capacity for goodness held
firm, and his view of earthly experience grew increasingly cosmic.
To him, reality and imagination were one and the same, and bliss
was always just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America had acquired a visionary artist of its own in
the self-taught British-born painter Thomas Cole (1801-1848). A
highly-strung romantic appalled by the ecological and cultural
effects of the Industrial Revolution, in America he sought, and
initially found, an Eden of natural beauty and republican virtue.
</P>
<P>
   As with Blake, Cole's idealistic view did not last. During the
Jacksonian era of the 1830s the country was increasingly in
turmoil. The wilderness was disappearing fast; sectional
differences were hardening; urban disorder was on the rise; a
profit-hungry elite was gaining power. Temperamentally inclined to
operate in crisis mode, Cole poured his fears for the future into
art, and the apocalyptic series of five paintings titled ``Course
of Empire'' (1833-36) was the result.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, on permanent view at the New-York Historical
Society, form an allegorical fever chart of civilization. The
evolutionary motto that Cole attached to them tells the tale. Taken
from Byron, it reads: ``First freedom and then glory _ when that
fails, wealth, vice, corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenes depicted correspond to times of day. In the first,
titled ``Savage State,'' an untamed forest emerges from a murky
pre-dawn twilight. In the second, a dewy arcadian tranquillity
prevails. The centerpiece, ``Consummation of the Empire,'' shows a
colossal city, resplendent with Trump-style gilt and marble,
glinting under a hazy, too-hot noon sky. As darkness approaches,
destruction falls: the city is torn apart by war. In the grim coda,
``Desolation,'' urban ruins molder away in a brackish, moonlit
swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's scenario is every bit as millennialist as Blake's, but
with a downward trajectory. The optimism is gone. Unlike Blake's
America, Cole's creation is depressed, despairing, an operatic
jeremiad on the theme of paradise lost.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, nearly unknown during his life, continued to stretch his
vision; Cole, honored as a kind of star, retreated to a position of
psychological comfort. His final paintings were religious
allegories elaborate in execution but conventional in sentiment,
and already regarded as old-fashioned by the audiences of their
day.
</P>
<P>
   EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO
</P>
<P>
   The year Cole died the United States, under pressure from
southern slaveholders and northern capitalists, annexed a huge
chunk of land from Mexico, including present day California,
Arizona, and Nevada. The acquisition was politically justified by a
sense of millennial entitlement, summed up in the catchphrase
``Manifest Destiny.'' It also officially brought a new
Spanish-speaking population into the national sphere.
</P>
<P>
   That territorial population has expanded in the United States
ever since, from long-established Chicano communities on the West
Coast, to the growing numbers of Mexican residents in New York
today. If any emblem is common to them all it is the Roman Catholic
icon known as the Virgin of Guadalupe, the subject of a small
exhibition titled ``Our Lady of the Apocalypse'' at El Museo del
Barrio.
</P>
<P>
   The image, part of the larger cult of the Virgin of the
Immaculate Conception, originated in Europe but is said to have
appeared in an apparition to a Spanish-speaking Aztec in Mexico in
1531. She has been described as a Christian incarnation of various
Indian deities, including the fertility goddess Tonantzin. But
there is no question, that she is modelled on the ``woman clothed
with the sun,'' a key player in the eschatalogical drama described
in the biblical Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of her plural origins, she is a dynamic presence
in Mexico and beyond, especially among the poor. Millions of
pilgrims visit her shrine in Mexico City each year. Her image
appears everywhere, not only in popular paintings like those at El
Museo, but on T-shirts, murals, shop signs, car decals and tattoos.
Her very ubiquity has made her an emblem of grassroots vitality and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of several Latino religious images imbued with
distinct millennial import. The Three Kings of the Nativity story
are another: earthly rulers who, on faith, followed a star to find
a humble child whom they acknowledged as the source of a new
spiritual order.
</P>
<P>
   Folk carvings of the kings, called santos, are on view at El
Museo. Every year on their feast day, Jan. 6, the museum organizes
a parade in their honor. It's an unforgettable event, with huge
puppets of the kings themselves and crowds of children dressed as
shepherds and angels walking from the museum's Fifth Avenue
headquarters eastward into the Barrio.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, both the parade and the Guadalupe exhibition
coincide with the museum's vibrant survey of Chicano and Puerto
Rican political prints, many of dating them from the radical 1960s
and 70s. In these prints, the Virgin and the Kings appear along
with secular political heroes like the Puerto Rican nationalist
Lolita Lebron, and the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata,
a conjunction that makes perfect sense in a culture where the
spiritual and political are, in the end, two sides of the same
coin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART
</P>
<P>
   If the Virgin of Guadalupe's icon holds out the potential of
ameliorative social change, other kinds of art from other cultures
have immediate, concrete ways of transforming life for the better.
Such is the case with African objects associated with divination,
splendid examples of which can be found in the Met's permanent
collection.
</P>
<P>
   One is a haunting Janus figure produced by the Fon people of the
Republic of Benin. Carved in wood and adorned with an animal's
skull and a necklace of tiny bones, its back-to-back faces look
vigilantly in opposite directions. Placed in homes and near
villages, such figures could be used as spiritual surveillance
devices to ward off malevolent spirits and anticipate dangers to
come.
</P>
<P>
   A second sculpture at the Met, a Songye power figure from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, served as a community's direct
access channel to the ancestral realm, where present and future
events were determined. Designed by a ritual specialist, carefully
dressed and packed with medicines, it revealed crucial information
about group welfare through the medium of prophetic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Still other divination figures were reserved for the individual
use, and were consulted to gauge the timing and advisability of
personal plans (a business venture, a marriage) or to explain
baffling events in the past, such as the sudden death of a loved
one.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the scope of their functions, these magnetic objects
were transitive symbols, through which the human and divine
interacted. And such interactions will be examined in depth when
the Met opens its much-anticipated exhibition ``Art and Oracle:
Spirit Voices of Africa'' this spring. Brooklyn Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   Uninterrupted joy on a spiritually refurbished earth is the
prospect offered by a gorgeous little gilded-copper Tibetan figure
of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, or Buddha of the Future, in the Asian
galleries of the Brookyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The human Buddha, known as Siddhartha and born in India around
560 B.C., was a philosopher. His exceptional achievement was to
have devised a logical and sensible strategy for dealing with the
stress of life on earth. After his death, legends grew around him,
and a religion, replete with an elaborate spiritual cosmology of
gods and heavens, was founded in his name.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intricate forms of that religion was developed
in Tibet, an intensely messianic Tantric strain described by the
historian Robert Thurman as ``Apocalyptic Buddhism.'' Through its
practice, spiritual evolution is speeded up, social institutions
are imaginatively and compassionately restructured, and the
multi-dimensional possibilities of beauty in the world are
realized.
</P>
<P>
   Maitreya, in his role as Buddha of the Next Age, is central to
this salvational plan. For countless eons, it is said, he has been
sitting in heaven, meditating and thinking sweet thoughts, just as
he appears in the Brooklyn sculpture. When the right hour comes, he
will emerge as the mortal Buddha (Siddhartha was Maitreya once) to
preside over an earthly paradise of timeless peace and material
perfection. Whitney Museum of American Art
</P>
<P>
   Perfection, or perhaps perfectionism, of a secular kind, is an
abiding impulse in 20th-century Western art too, specifically in
much modernist abstraction. And of many examples in New York
museums, none is more centripital than a 1956 two-panel painting
titled ``Atlantic'' by Ellsworth Kelly, on view in ``The American
Century'' exhibition at the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's painting, all black except for two tensile,
upward-sweeping white arcs, is installed in the section of the show
devoted to 1960's Minimalism, though in this reductivist company,
its spirit feels singularly upbeat, expansive and lyrical, its
wave-like curves imbued with some of the essential rhythms of life.
</P>
<P>
   Derived from life they were. In 1954, Kelly was living near the
seaport in Lower Manhattan. One day, he traveled by ferry and bus
to visit a friend on Staten Island. As the bus was moving, shadows
of telephone poles fell across the paperback he was reading. He
began tracing the outlines of the shadows directly on the pages in
pencil. Back in the studio he copied these sketches into a note
book, filling them in with black ink. Later he turned some of them
into paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantic'' is one: its two contiguous panels _ the separation
line is invisible in reproduction _ correspond to the facing pages
of an open book; its white forms curve to the center where the
painting divides and where the swelling surfaces of the original
pages met. The result is both the record of a fleeting optical
sensation and an example of evanescence captured as shape and
space.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly once spoke of his work as existing ``forever in the
present.'' He has also said, ``I think what we all want from art is
a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living.
This is an illusion, of course. What I've tried to capture is the
reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get
at the rapture of seeing.'' His uninsistent utopianism feels like
just the thing to keep in mind as we cross the millennial divide.

`BEYOND THE PRAIRIE': A HARSHER WORLD FOR THAT LITTLE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 BY RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come Sunday, you may find that the relentless confrontation of
everything new is becoming a bit old. If so, CBS is offering an
antidote to millennial overload, a film that looks back warmly to a
simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder''
revisits familiar territory _ in this case the Dakota Territory in
the 1880s _ to look again at a piece of the life that Wilder
herself chronicled in the autobiographical ``Little House'' books,
which she began writing at age 60. The effective and affecting
film, written by Stephen Harrigan and directed by Marcus Cole, is
presented as Wilder's reminiscences late in life. In voice-over she
says that while everything in her books was true, she chose to
leave out some of the darker details.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, though; this is no shocking exercise in
revisionism. The film, which takes Laura from bright schoolgirl to
determined young wife and mother, may give ``Little House'' a
slightly different spin, but gently, so little of the nostalgia
flies off.
</P>
<P>
   The film's Laura, Meredith Monroe (of ``Dawson's Creek'') is a
pluckily independent young woman, a dreamer with backbone. Ms.
Monroe, who in many shots bears a strong resemblance to Gwynethw, is just the companion you'd want out on the harsh
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Her Laura falls in love with a hardy young neighbor, Almanzo
Wilder, even before she meets him. (She finds his name
fascinating.) But when he does propose marriage, she warns him that
she'll only take two-thirds of the traditional vows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will love and honor,'' she says. ``But I plan to live my
life pretty much as it occurs to me to do so. And I won't promise
to obey you or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   As Almanzo (Walton Goggins) agrees to her terms, he wears an
expression of confused adoration that he maintains for much of his
time on screen. Either the film is telling us that Almanzo was
nowhere near Laura in the brains department, or Goggins can't find
much depth in the character. You may conclude a bit sadly that
Laura could have made a better match in a neighborhood with a few
more guys to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   If this Almanzo is a bit less heroic than expected, fans of
Wilder's books (and the television series they inspired) may be
even more surprised by the new dimensions of Laura's beloved Pa,
Charles Ingalls. Richard Thomas, still rather John Boy-ish, even
under a graying beard, portrays him as a sweet but restless soul,
better at playing the fiddle than at providing for his levelheaded
wife, Caroline (Lindsay Crouse), and their four daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But even the strongest man or woman was at the mercy of nature
out there on the prairie. And nature is well served in the film's
endless vistas (filmed in Utah) as well as its depictions of the
lightning, wildfire, blizzards and hailstorms that controlled the
settlers' lives. Barry M. Wilson's photography and Ernest Troost's
folk-song-inspired music help tell a story that does indeed feel
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I knew on the prairie in those years would have
given you a puzzled look if you called them heroes,'' the
voice-over declares. And while the people depicted here do seem
heroic, they also seem both fragile and fallible. That's a
believable combination.

   `Galaxy Quest'
</P>
<P>
   With: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub,
Sam Rockwell; Directed by Dean Parisot
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG; 102 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Like windup toys, the former stars of a long-canceled television
series along the lines of ``Star Trek'' travel the fan club
circuit, wearily presenting themselves to fanatics decked out in
``Galaxy Quest'' costumes with latex attachments and spouting
trivia about warp this and that.
</P>
<P>
   At one gathering a delegation of grinning fans, looking and
acting no more strangely or normally than anyone else, approaches
Jason Nesmith (Allen), who played Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart on
``Galaxy Quest.'' Don't tell the fan club, but it seems these
people are real aliens. An endangered breed called Thermians, they
are here because they are under the impression that ``Galaxy
Quest'' was also real, and they would like the characters to help
them avoid annihilation at the hands of a starship full of
barnacle-faced lizard types who are chasing them around the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for anything that will shake up the routine,
Nesmith-Taggart rallies the crew, which includes Gwen DeMarco (Ms.
Weaver) as the stunning communications officer, Lt. Tawny Madison,
and blasts off with the Thermians. Thinking themselves in the
company of space heroes, the aliens turn the ship over to Taggart's
people, who learn as they go. ``The red thingie is moving toward
the green thingie,'' says one Galaxy Quester at his battle station.
</P>
<P>
   Myriad perils later, the saga crash-lands at another fan club
gathering, where Taggart and the Thermians give the attendees more
than their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Space war combustion results in the usual run of
grievous injury, none of it in any way realistic or fear-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None, but Taggart and Tawny signal inclinations in this
regard.

   PROFANITY: A smattering.

<P>
   AGES 3-6: All in all, they're a little young.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10: Some of the humor and finer points will escape them,
but they will be on board.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-14: As an idea for a spoof, the film blasts off. In
execution, occasional flatness might bother some.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP: Depending on degrees of ``sophistication,''
they'll enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Girl, Interrupted
</P>
<P>
   With: Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Clea
Duvall, Brittany Murphy, Jared Leto, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa
Redgrave; Directed by James Mangold.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R; 120 minutes
</P>
<P>
   After washing down a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka,
Susanna (Ms. Ryder) is packed off to Claymoore, an institution
modeled after the McLean psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Mass.,
where Susanna Kaysen spent two years before writing the
best-selling memoir on which the film is based.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1967, and unlike other children of privilege,
Susanna, a high school senior, has no thoughts of the Ivy League
but would rather go off and write. These being questioning times,
and Susanna being nothing if not questioning herself, she has
become boxed into a corner of lethal discontent. The psychiatrists,
a stodgy lot in the '60s, note promiscuous tendencies, which she
vehemently denies. Finally, she is thrown into that great
diagnostic pool: borderline personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna talks about emotional quicksand and mystical undertow.
Valerie (Ms. Goldberg), a nurse at Claymoore, comes to another
conclusion: ``You're a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is
driving herself crazy.'' In the ward she falls under the spell of
Lisa (Ms. Jolie), a charismatic sociopath with a quick tongue and a
penchant for escaping. Together they make a break for Florida, but
shaken by a tragedy on the way, Susanna voluntarily returns to
Claymoore. There is much work to do.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Some confrontations are violent, and there is
self-abuse, including a moderately bloody suicide.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Susanna is shown in a sexual situation with her boyfriend,
and there is much plain talk about various sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Many strong obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 14: Drawn by the stars and the situation, many
children under 17 will crash this film, or try to, without adult
accompaniment. Many parents will judge it inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: By now it becomes a matter of personal
guidelines. With issues related directly to them, this is a
compelling film for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cider House Rules
</P>
<P>
   With: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Delroy
Lindo, Erykah Badu, Paul Rudd, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker;
Directed by Lasse Hallstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13; 125 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Destined never to be chosen by adoptive parents, Homer Wells
(Maguire) reaches his late teens at St. Cloud's orphanage in Maine.
It is the height of World War II in Hallstrom's film, based on a
sliver of John Irving's novel. Women come and go quickly at St.
Cloud's, to drop off their unwanted babies or to have them or to
have abortions performed by the sagacious Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine).
</P>
<P>
   A bright, unshakably calm lad, Homer virtually becomes a son to
Dr. Larch, who trains him in obstetrics and gynecology to the point
where he can perform examinations and procedures himself, but not
abortions, to which Homer objects. As caring as his mentor, Homer
is also a good hand around a dormitory filled with young children
with their noses forever pressed against the window in hopes of
leaving one day with families of their own.
</P>
<P>
   For Homer liberation arrives in a Ford convertible. Wally
Worthington (Rudd), a 24-year-old B-24 pilot, has brought Candy
Kendall (Ms. Theron), who is in need of an abortion. Much to the
distress of Dr. Larch, Homer goes home with them to a coastal town
where he goes to work in the apple orchards owned by Wally's
family.
</P>
<P>
   In the cider house he befriends his illiterate fellow workers
and reads them the cider house rules (no smoking in bed and stay
off the roof). A natural adjudicator, he steps into the explosive
situation between the boss man, Rose (Lindo), and his daughter,
Rose Rose (Ms. Badu), who is pregnant by her father.
</P>
<P>
   With Wally gone back to war, Homer also begins an affair with
Candy, a good-hearted young woman who has trouble being alone. But
eventually events force a choice. Wally will return to Candy; St.
Cloud's needs Homer. For this life's passage, the ending is
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: There is a knife fight between Rose and another
worker. Later Rose lies dying after being stabbed by his daughter
and finishing the job himself.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Homer and Candy make love.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Strong at times.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: Parents willing, there is much to engage older
children. Abortion is performed, and both sides of the question
spoken for. Dr. Larch is an ether addict and is often anesthetizing
himself. There is incest. And there are many other issues of
relevance: rebellion and independence, loyalty, honest
self-assessment, sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11: On balance, no.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP: For all its tribulations, this a tasteful,
essentially gentle movie. Unless parents have particular
objections, teen-agers should get much from it.

<P>
   Big movies spawn a rush of related videos, and so it is with
Milos Forman's ``Man on the Moon,'' with Jim Carrey as the comedian
Andy Kaufman. But for those expecting clarification of Kaufman's
peculiar comedic persona, don't count on much enlightenment from
three tapes of the real Kaufman currently in circulation: ``Andy
Kaufman: The Midnight Special,'' ``Andy Kaufman: I'm From
Hollywood'' and ``Andy Kaufman in `My Breakfast With Blassie.'''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences weren't sure of Kaufman, who died at 35 in 1985, and
never knew whether to laugh or erupt in anger at his prosaic jibes
and braggadocio. That was the intent, of course, and fans get no
closer to their man on these tapes, which date from the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   That he did a pretty fair Elvis impersonation is obvious enough
on ``The Midnight Special,'' released by Sony Music VideoSony(DG).
But as his alter ego the sleazy lounge performer Tony Clifton,
Kaufman artfully keeps people wondering whether to take Clifton's
crude insults humorously or seriously or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   The approach works in a wrestling arena. In ``I'm From
Hollywood,'' issued by Rhino, Kaufman plumbs a noted obsession of
his. ``I'm not really a wrestler,'' he says with the laid-on
ingenuousness that probably was his greatest talent. ``I couldn't
very well challenge men in the audience because I would get
beaten.'' So he challenges women, getting into convincing-looking
brawls that he always wins.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself a big Hollywood star (a reference to his role in
the television series ``Taxi'') and labeling opponents people with
``oatmeal north of the eyebrows,'' Kaufman gets away with his
wrestling routine until one night in Memphis when he takes on Foxy,
who is a very big woman. She succumbs finally, but her trainer, a
professional wrestler named Jerry Lawler, picks up Kaufman and
drives him head first into the floor, not once but several times.
</P>
<P>
   For months Kaufman screams threats on television, invokes his
celebrityhood, promises lawsuits, gets into a scrap with Lawler on
David Letterman's show and returns to the arena in Memphis to bait
the crowd, which roars its derision. He's got to be kidding.
Privately Kaufman's friends say he's acting crazy. (Are  &UR; they
 &LR; kidding?) ``Basically, I could live without the wrestling,'' his
manager says.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman is still wearing his neck brace when he joins his friend
Fred Blassie, another wrestler, in ``My Breakfast With Blassie''
(also from Rhino), a takeoff on ``My Dinner With Andre.'' While
Blassie patronizes the waitress, Kaufman gets into a row with
several women at a nearby table. ``They say be nice to them on the
way up, and they'll be nice to you on the way down,'' he says.
``Well, I'm never coming down.''

   Could it be the fastest video turnaround ever? From Friday
through Tuesday, CNN will broadcast 100 hours of millennium
coverage from Auckland, New Zealand, to Washington. At the same
time, from 25 posts around the world, Warner Home Video will be
working on a two-hour tape of highlights, which the company plans
to have available by Tuesday, the day the CNN coverage ends. That
could almost be called simultaneous.

<P>
   The Thomas Crown Affair
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Norman Jewison's film starred Steve McQueen as a suave
Boston art thief who tangles with a slick investigator (Faye
Dunaway). Strictly for the '90s, John McTiernan's remake stars
Pierce Brosnan, as sleek and nattily attired as he is in the James
Bond role _ no hurdling backyard fences with the pinched van Gogh
here _ and Rene Russo as the lusty, relentless sleuth. While there
is supposed to be sexual and competitive heat between these two,
what they do best is wear clothes and go shopping. Even the action
is designed not to get anyone too mussed up (one scene even has a
Catamaran Coordinator). ``If the film had been shot in 3-D Imax,''
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``it would be dangling
price tags that the audience could reach out and almost touch.''
</P>

<P>
   Desert Blue
</P>
<P>
   In the fictional desert town of Baxter, Calif., population 87, a
tanker full of concentrate bound for a local cola company
overturns, spilling its contents. Splattered with the stuff, the
driver dies and the Environmental Protection Agency, not
unreasonably, closes the town, quarantining the inhabitants and
stranding a divorced professor of cultural studies (John Heard) who
has come to Baxter to see the town's giant ice-cream cone and his
teen-age daughter (Kate Hudson), the star of a television show
called ``Maggie's World.'' There she encounters Blue (Brendan
Sexton III) and the rest of the town's teen-agers and learns that
the cone is part of a plan to turn Baxter into a beach-and-ocean
park in the desert. Sounds hardly possible, especially when the
cola company hogs all the water, but from a storytelling standpoint
``the graceful literary and directorial touch of Morgan J. Freeman
turns these youngsters into individuals rather than cinema's
customary caricatures'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

<P>
   Dudley-Do-Right
</P>
<P>
   The kind of guy who flattens himself by stepping on loose
floorboards, Dudley (Brendan Fraser), a Canadian mountie, starts
out as a distinct underdog in his quest to apprehend Snidely
Whiplash (Alfred Molina), a bank robber so successful that his gang
is too big to fit into a bank. Torn between the two, Nell Fenwick
(Sarah Jessica Parker) participates with them both in a big dance
number to the tune of ``Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?''
Finally, Dudley jumps into black leather and onto a dirt bike to
rally his Indian allies for a battle with Snidely's mechanized
forces. Based on Jay Ward's animated series, Hugh Wilson's film
aims to be both zany and nostalgic, ``and it works pretty well,
too'' (Stephen Holden).

   THE MILKY WAY. In 1964 Arab villagers in the Galilee chafe under
the thumb of a leader (Makram Khoury) who is beholden to the
Israeli military governor (Yussef Abu Warda). While the tension
generates certain plot elements, the aim of the film by Ali Nassar,
who grew up in such a community, is to recreate the rhythms of
village life in such conditions. ``Our problems are our own doing,
not the stars,''' says Mahmmud (Muhammad Bakri), a smith and the
protagonist in a story, Larry Van Gelder wrote in The New York
Times, that ``maintains a simultaneous awareness of mankind's
yearning for peace and friendship and the simple pleasures of life

   U.N.-ANNAN (United Nations) _ When Kofi Annan, a soft-spoken

abuse from American politicians and unsettled by an ugly Clinton

Boutros-Ghali. Three years later and with two more years to go in
his first term, Annan is turning out to be one of the most
provocative leaders the United Nations has ever known. By Barbara

BLASTING INTO GROZNY TOUGH, DEADLY WORK FOR RUSSIANS

<P>
   STARAYA SUNZHA, Russia _ What does it take to blow up a
building?
</P>
<P>
   That was the problem facing Russian Colonel Yury Bakhurin and
his men on the front lines of the battle for Grozny, capital of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Over a two-hour period Wednesday, Chechen rebel snipers in the
nine-story apartment block on Grozny's northeast outskirts had
already killed one of Bakhurin's men and wounded four, halting his
unit's effort to push any further towards the center of the
embattled city.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away from the snipers, Bukharin barked
orders over his walkie-talkie from his makeshift headquarters in a
ruined house in the Grozny suburb of Staraya Sunzha.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the big Russian guns in a field behind the
village opened fire. A Russian T-80 tank rumbled down a lane strewn
with wreckage and fired a salvo at the building. Heavy machine guns
and mortar let loose in every direction. The nine-story building
still stood. Then came the response _ the deceptively
harmless-sounding pop-pop-pop of a sniper's rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange epitomized the difficulty of Russia's week-long
assault on Grozny, the rebels' largest remaining stronghold in the
flatlands that make up two-thirds of Chechnya. Russian commanders
once said they would capture the city by New Year's, but no one is
saying that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian tactic of shelling Grozny's fortified buildings and
sending in lightly armed infantry to mop up is designed to limit
Russian casualties and slowly decimate the insurgents. But it is
arduously slow, costly, and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it would be easy, that we'd go in, and if we met any
resistance, we'd go back out, and the artillery would take care of
it, but it's not like that,'' said a Russian police commando to an
infantry officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fired 250 rounds yesterday, and 60 so far today,'' replied
the officer. ``I don't know what else to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it take to take out a nine-story building?,'' asked
the commando. His unit was ordered to go back into the city and
creep around, looking for rebels. He and about 20 other men put on
their helmets, scrambled onto an armored troop carrier and sped
off.
</P>
<P>
   Before they left, Denis Parshin, a officer in a commando unit
from Murmansk, scrawled out a note to pass on to his parents: ``I'm
alive, I'm well, and I'm storming Grozny. Happy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians captured Staraya Sunzha on Christmas day, in
fighting that turned entire blocks of houses into hollow ruins. The
streets are rivers of mud, trees have been cut and razed by shells
and bullets. Villagers cut up the remaining trees for firewood.
There is no heat, light or gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian guns here fire almost constantly, even though many
of the estimated 40,000 civilians in Grozny are trapped there in
the northern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are not letting civilians out, we are waiting for
the civilians,'' said a deputy commander of a pro-Russian Chechen
militia who would only give his first name, Mayerbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Armored personnel carriers with soldiers in full battle gear
roared up and down war-ruined lanes. The militiamen rushed across
open streets, firing rounds towards the high buildings of Grozny to
distract snipers. A few others led a cow out of a courtyard toward
the Russian headquarters. A few Chechen villagers started to
complain about their treatment at the hands of the Russians, but a
few words from Bukharin quieted them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a big spectacle,'' said one woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bukharin offered some guests hard candy and soldiers' rations of
oatmeal and canned meat. In the adjoining room, Chechens suspected
of being rebel fighters stood against the wall, their hands and
legs spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Bukharin's men are confident they will eventually overwhelm
their adversaries, but they are concerned the Chechen rebels are
going to try to break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Santa Clauses are going to try to fly tonight,'' he said
with a grim smile, pausing to order another salvo on his walkie
talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Russian soldiers milled around among the muddy ruins
with pro-Russian Chechen militia, wearing white armbands to
distinguish themselves from the rebels. Colonel Bukharin repeated
the official line that the loyalist Chechens have been useful
allies for their knowledge of the area, but it is clear the
Russians and the loyalists do not fully trust each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bukharin would not even speak to Mayerbeck, despite their
nominally equal rank. At one point, a Russian and a loyalist
Chechen, both armed to the teeth, got in a shoving match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you push me,'' said the Chechen. ``We have to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your work, and we have ours,'' snapped the Russian,
and things looked like they might get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble was broken up by Bukharin's report that the rebels
had launched a ``gas attack,'' or rather a cloud of noxious ammonia
gas, from their hideouts in the city. A soldier cheerfully set of a
flare, to judge from the smoke trail which way the wind was blowing
(it was going in a different direction, which brought ironic cheers
from the Russian unit.)
</P>
<P>
   The center of Russia's campaign is in Grozny, and the soldiers
were tense along the road leading into the capital from the
northwest, territory captured at the beginning of the conflict in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get shot at every night,'' said Alexander, a riot police
officer from Vladivostok, who was manning a checkpoint on the road
leading from the Chechen town of Znamenskaya into Grozny. Here,
some soldiers were putting up phone lines wrecked during the
fighting. Others were digging trenches. The rebels, the soldiers
say, sneak across Russian territory and launch hit-and run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should just drop a few hydrogen bombs on the place and be
done with this,'' Alexander said. ``Otherwise this war will go on
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But his and other police patrols waved journalists through. In
the towns along the way were rows of fresh graves. There were more
than 40 in Goragorsky, just over Chechnya's western frontier, the
site of a fierce two-day battle in October.
</P>
<P>
   At the town of Tolstoy-Yurt, behind the low ridge that runs just
north of Grozny, the Russian artillery barrage was intense. At one
point, journalists counted 60 rounds fired in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   At a small street market, vendors sold special New Year's cakes
with Christmas tree designs on the icing.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of armored vehicles rumbled along the Grozny road.
Trucks full of men and supplies made their way toward the fighting;
trucks with their canvas flaps closed tight rumbled out. The
passage of many tanks has ruined the pavement and strewn clay and
mud along the road, making the driving treacherous. A large Russian
military truck lay on its side; its driver had apparently lost
control in the muck.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian forward positions start at the checkpoint outside
Staraya Sunzha. Two young draftees stopped a car and asked for
food. One of them greedily grabbed a pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We standing here in a ring around the city, waiting for the
order to go in,'' said Vladimir, a soldier front Novorossiisk who
has been fighting the rebels since they invaded the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan in August.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir, who also fought in Russia's 1994-1996 war against the
rebels, has signed a contract to fight through February. It is
decent pay for Russia _ $120 per month plus a $30 per diem for each
day spent in the battle zone _ but Vladimir is not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want out of here now,'' he said. ``But we're spending New
Year's in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   A mortar round went off nearby. The pro-Russian Chechens agreed
to escort a group of journalists into Staraya Sunzha, but only to
the front line in the village center. The Russian forces still do
not fully control the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is not safe,'' said a Russian police officer who
gave his name as Sergei. He said the rebel fighters were mostly not
Chechens, but mercenaries from other countries. Every Russian
officer tells this story, and the list of nationalities gets longer
at each checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting Turks, Poles, Balts, Arabs, Ukrainian women
snipers with small caliber rifles, Scots in kilts, blacks from
Africa, scared 16-year-old boys, what have you,'' Colonel Bukharin
said with a big smile. He gave orders to his troops to set up a
guard against any possible breakouts by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Outside headquarters, a Russian soldier in full battle gear
called his mother on a journalist's satellite phone and told her he
was all right. He hung up and grabbed his assault rifle and moved
off to join the other men going off toward the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's that, now I'm off to fight,'' he said, and then he was
gone.

BOSTON COLLEGE EXPECTED TO SHOW DEPTH IN INSIGHT BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Boston College's football team _ led by a senior class
that coach Tom O'Brien has described as having ``hearts the size of
oceans'' _ has come out west to the Arizona desert to play in its
first bowl game in five years and last of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 25 Eagles (8-3) will once again have to demonstrate the
oceanic depth of their heart as they find themselves in the
familiar role of underdog against Colorado (6-5) in the
ESPN-televised Insight.com Bowl at 1:45 Friday at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 12th or 13th bowl, so I've been through this
before,'' said O'Brien, who is making his first bowl appearance as
a head coach after being a longtime assistant to George Welsh at
Virginia and Navy. ``But for these kids, it's such a highlight for
them. Every team probably everywhere in the country in preseason
practice says, `Well, we're going to be a bowl team,' but that
hasn't been a realistic goal until this year for this football
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said at the beginning of the season, I thought we'd be a
6-5 football team, then we got the sixth and raised the bar to
seven; we got to seven and then we got to eight, and now the bar is
set at nine. They've met every challenge, so it's a great tribute
to them and it's a great jump-start to our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have two fewer victories than their Big East
opponent, the Buffaloes of the Big 12 Conference have been
installed as 8-point favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, personally, can't fathom how we'd be underdogs,'' said
junior running back Cedric Washington, who earned All-Big East
first-team honors this season after he paced BC's offensive attack,
rushing for 1,122 yards and seven touchdowns on 222 carries.
``We're 8-3 and they're 6-5. It's something that motivates this
team, because we've been the underdogs all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So both teams have arrived at this point in the season (with
O'Brien likening it to a season opener because of the long layoff
between games, and Colorado coach Gary Barnett saying, ``I see it
as a true finale for the two teams involved'') with something to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, feeling somewhat snubbed, will attempt to prove they
are not an 8-point underdog, while the Buffaloes will aim to show
they are better than their 6-5 record. Colorado extended Nebraska
into overtime before losing their regular-season home finale,
33-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have a bad taste in our mouths from that game,'' said
senior guard Brad Bedell, referring to Colorado's gut-wrenching
loss to Nebraska. ``That's why we're just happy to be able to play
another football game to get that bad taste out of our mouths,
because that's not the way we wanted to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Buffaloes started the season 3-3, Barnett said the
turnaround came after a 31-10 loss against Texas Tech when Colorado
won three of its last five games, losing to Kansas State (20-14)
and the Cornhuskers. ``From the Texas Tech game on, it's been a
distinct difference in the way we've played,'' Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a 6-foot quarterback Mike Moschetti, a former shortstop
in the Oakland A's farm system and admitted fan of former BC
quarterback Doug Flutie, the Buffaloes will pit an offense that,
O'Brien said, ``possesses a lot of speed at the skill positions and
overall team speed.'' Moschetti will be opposed by BC junior
quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, who has the offense operating at peak
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've recruited a quarterback, until this year,
as hard as I recruited Timmy Hasselbeck,'' said Barnett. ``And he
went to Boston College anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   While BC's biggest concern in its first matchup against Colorado
will be its overall team speed _ ``They are the fastest team we
will have played,'' O'Brien said _ Barnett said the physical play
of BC's offensive and defensive fronts posed the biggest concern
for the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chris) Hovan is just a flat-out great player,'' Barnett said.
``And (Mike) Willetts plays the same way, but he just doesn't get
the same recognition. Our game is a speed game on offense and
defense and whether or not we can hold up against the physical
nature of Boston College's offense and defense, those are my
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the concern about how much baggage Colorado
will carry into the game after its loss to Nebraska. Asked if he
was relieved he didn't have to face BC in the Insight.com Bowl a
week after their regular-season setback against the Cornhuskers,
Barnett said, ``It hung around for about four or five days, but the
best thing for us was to get back on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we didn't play for a week allowed us to carry it
on, and I think most teams find a way to put it behind them right
away, and the best way to do that is to start focusing on your next
opponent,'' he added. ``But we had 10 days before we started doing
that and that allowed it to linger a little bit. Now we have to get
ready to play.''

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lights were dim, the ballroom hushed and the mood
as taut as a paperback mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thomas Dunne was nonchalant as he tossed a dollar bill on
the crisp white linen of a back table located strategically on the
far literary outskirts of the annual National Book Awards banquet
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later Dunne claimed a prize, but it was not for any of
his book titles at St. Martin's Press, where he relentlessly pumps
out everything from mysteries to how-to guitar lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne's triumph this time was the St. Martin's betting pool. He
won the price of a hardcover by correctly guessing this year's
National Book Awards nonfiction champion, ``Embracing Defeat,'' a
study of postwar Japan that he chose because it was the ``fattest,
squarest book of history written by an author who had labored the
longest.''
</P>
<P>
   That irreverent comment is emblematic of a style that has helped
Dunne, 53, create his own literary fief with an imprint that scorns
snobbery, prizes the quirky and commercial and flourishes through a
unique form of high-volume publishing that has occasional perils.
</P>
<P>
   It was that breezy attitude that placed Dunne's job in brief
jeopardy when top St. Martin's executives considered the publisher
too cavalier during a crisis in October.
</P>
<P>
   That was when St. Martin's took the highly unusual action of
recalling a biography, published by Thomas Dunne Books, called
``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an American
President.'' The company destroyed the remaining books after
disclosures that the author, J.H. Hatfield, had made a car-bombing
attempt on the life of his former boss, for which he spent time in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's said it had lost faith in Hatfield, whose book
included anonymous allegations that Bush had covered up a youthful
1972 cocaine arrest. Soon after the recall, St. Martin's executive
editor resigned in disgust over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, little has changed in the hierarchy at St.
Martin's Press, one of the nation's top 10 general publishers,
which former and present employees often describe as a close-knit
but dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   From an 18th-floor office at the very point of the Flatiron
Building in Manhattan, Dunne remains firmly in charge. His imprint
is one of the company's most profitable, with an estimated $15
million in net sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, a unit of Holtzbrinck in Stuttgart, Germany, is
faring so well this year _ with record revenues from its mix of
small books, high-profile titles like Monica Lewinsky's memoir, and
an Eddie Fisher bestseller _ that a few weeks ago John Sargent, the
chairman and chief executive, gave all the company's more than 600
employees three extra days off over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   There had been grumbling from Dunne's critics at the publishing
house that he would be reined in now. Sargent, several employees
said, was so furious about Dunne's casual reaction that he briefly
wanted to fire him, but he apparently realized he could not oust
him for attitude. Sargent and St. Martin's president, Sally
Richardson, now praise Dunne as a ``Renaissance publisher'' and
call the Hatfield episode a ``fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resentment lingers in other offices. ``There are a
lot of people who are angry _ not because of what happened, but
because of the way he didn't take it seriously,'' said one St.
Martin's employee. ``He would walk around joking, `This, too, shall
pass. This is nothing. It's probably all true anyway. Ha. Ha.' That
attitude may be his shield, but no one likes to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush biography shows no sign of vanishing into
pulp. Soft Skull Press, a small independent, is preparing to
publish a revised edition early next year. It has turned to an
unlikely consultant: James Fitzgerald, a former executive editor
who was fired from St. Martin's in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dunne draws a classic gambling lesson from it all.
``What went wrong is bad luck,'' he said. ``It's the law of
averages.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thomas Dunne Books, the average is extremely high because
each year he and his staff of nine edit and publish more than 125
books and about 50 mysteries. That velocity is the source of
Dunne's strength, and also his weakness, publishing executives say,
adding that it's difficult to devote great attention to so many
books.
</P>
<P>
   By buying cheap _ advances as low as $5,000 _ Dunne takes a lot
of little risks even as he bets generous sums on prominent authors.
The Bush biography, for example, was acquired for a $25,000
advance, and since the author did not have a big name, the
publishing house did not have high expectations at first.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne freely says he does not read all his titles. His imprint
is the leading publisher of mysteries, but also sells histories,
niche titles, British literary imports, and unauthorized
biographies of celebrities like the author Terry McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   He relies on an eclectic staff that ranges from an assistant
editor with a fresh degree from Dunne's alma mater, Brown
University, to Ruth Cavin, 81, a senior editor and doyenne of
mysteries because of her high output and deft touch for nurturing
mystery writers, who call themselves the ``Ruthsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Neville, the young editor who acquired the ography,
came to St. Martin's Press in 1998 from Penguin Putnam and had a
record of acquiring mysteries and the story of the making of ``The
Planet of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Dunne's style to delegate a lot of responsibility. ``When
I hire someone to be an editorial assistant I tell them there's a
lot that needs to be done,'' Dunne said. ``So they get more
responsibility and I expect them to make mistakes. And if they make
a mistake I will try not to beat them up. You have to trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Dunne wrote a memo that signaled the
limitations on vetting authors. ``St. Martin's Press,'' he wrote,
``does not investigate the loyalties, politics and/or personal
lives of the authors it publishes.'' He wrote that shortly before
St. Martin's canceled a biography of Joseph Goebbels that he had
acquired from David Irving for a modest $25,000 advance.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the then chief executive, Thomas McCormack,
decided to scrap the book amid a controversy about Irving's links
to the Institute for Historical Review _ the literary center of the
U.S. Holocaust denial movement. The pressures and tensions at the
publishing house had a more searing effect on Dunne, who soon after
joined Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Friendships shattered in the debate about whether the book
should have been published. Death threats were made. Dunne was so
despondent about the outcry that at one point he took a telephone
call from a reporter and began weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne says now that he didn't know about Irving's links to the
institute. So this debate came down to a basic question that would
haunt him again: How do you check out an author?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't,'' Dunne insisted. ``If I publish 3,000 or 4,000
books, how can I do it? I mean, if I grew apples and hundreds of
them were rolling around on the ground, how would I find the one
with a worm in it?'' As he pointed out, Hatfield lied about his
background.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield concedes that he denied having a prison record. His
complaint is that St. Martin's rushed him to publish an afterword
with the cocaine allegations that was ``written, vetted,
re-written, vetted again, in less than a week.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The son of an accountant and a schoolteacher, Dunne, a
Providence, R.I., native, had once considered a career in the
classroom. He studied for a doctorate in history at Columbia
University, but never finished because he decided that academia was
too political.
</P>
<P>
   His own literary oeuvre reflects his irrepressible nature and
disdain for snobbery. He was the author, for instance, of a St.
Martin's paperback, ``Irish Erotic Art,'' which consists entirely
of blank pages. He wrote a mystery called ``Scourge'' with a plot
that pivots on deadly literature _ readers are poisoned by the ink
on the printed page. If he could write his author's bio, he jokes
that he would describe himself as a ``boyish 53, often mistaken on
the street for Brad Pitt.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony to his mentoring skills is the high number of
former editorial assistants and editors who have ultimately moved
on to top positions elsewhere. Robert S. Miller, for instance, took
his first publishing job in 1978 as an assistant to Dunne. Today he
is managing director of Disney's Hyperion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is unique in publishing,'' Miller said. ``He does a lot of
different books and it's an incredible output. It's a very
different philosophy from what you see at other publishing
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-quantity publishing affects authors in different ways.
Some lesser-known authors complain that their books don't get
proper attention. ``His greatest strength is his real enthusiasm
for projects,'' said one author, who published with Dunne and left
for another house. ``He fires up the authors and he's very pleasant
and very charming. But after that you're more or less on your own.
It's just a matter of inattention and I think it's a question of
the house cranking out too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, some of the company's best-known and most
profitable authors, like the fiction writer Rosamunde Pilcher, are
singularly devoted to Dunne, who is her publisher and editor.
``He's always been my No. 1 guy for discussing things with. I
basically don't talk to anybody else. I don't talk to my family and
I don't talk to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Pilcher's vintage Olympia typewriter broke down, Dunne
hunted the second-hand shops of London to find a similar machine.
He regularly meets with her at the Ritz Hotel in London to discuss
plots and characters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pilcher's prolific number of books may not have won any
National Book Awards, but Dunne seeks literary acclaim in other
ways: ``Rosamunde Pilcher's books will probably be read 200 years
from now while some of the books from the National Book Awards may
not. People are still reading Charles Dickens and he was not
popular with critics.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may just be a quirk of the calendar or a
legitimate millennial dread, but this holiday season has proved to
be far gloomier than expected for many Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   A year after record-breaking box office and
packed-to-the-rafters audiences, Broadway had one of its
slowest-selling weeks of the year last week, with big drops in
grosses and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   For the week that ended on Sunday, 18 Broadway shows were
playing to under 60 percent of capacity, including three at under
30 percent. The demoralizing effect of playing to a half-empty
house must have been particularly acute at the cavernous 1,933-seat
Gershwin Theater, where ``Tango Argentino'' was playing to 27
percent of capacity, or an average of 530 people a night.
</P>
<P>
   In blunt economic terms, the situation was even harsher. Grosses
for the week were down $2.6 million from the same week last year,
when the industry pulled in just over $14 million. Attendance
during Christmas week this year was off by nearly 50,000. The
holidays are usually one of Broadway's happiest times as
entertainment-starved tourists and family-weary locals seek out
even the weakest shows. Last year every show on Broadway saw a bump
in business during New Year's week, even such soon-to-die
spectacles as ``On the Town'' and ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The sluggish sales were especially hard on smaller shows, which
need big holiday sales. ``This is always, far and away, one of the
strongest weeks of the year,'' said David Richenthal, producer of
``The Price.'' ``This year, it's a near disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater executives said there were three culprits: the calendar,
the countdown and the cut-rate shopper. First, there was the
unfortunate timing of Christmas and New Year's; both holidays fell
on Saturday this year, with their eves on Friday. Weekend nights,
of course, are big for Broadway, but this year most shows canceled
on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night all of Broadway is dark, except for the home of
``Marie Christine,'' the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center,
which is at West 66th Street and thus will be spared the crush of
revelers in Times Square. It will be the first time since the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy that the industry has so
dimmed its bulbs. Most performances canceled this month were
rescheduled as for Monday nights or weekday matinees, but matinees,
falling during work hours, are less popular and harder for
audiences to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the case of the vanishing holiday week,'' said Jed
Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and
Producers, the Broadway trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein also said that Broadway was being affected by the same
ambivalence or apprehension that has muted millennial sales in the
entertainment and travel industries worldwide. ``Whether it be Y2K
or what have you, people are feeling they want to stay at home,''
he said. That means fewer tourists in seats.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, producers say many ticket buyers are taking advantage
of the peculiar schedules to pick up half-price tickets at the last
minute. That assertion was borne out by figures from the Theater
Development Fund TKTS Booth in Times Square, where ticket sales
were up 27 percent compared with the same holiday period last year.
On Wednesday afternoon large crowds, rerouted because of Times
Square preparations, spilled up and down Seventh Avenue and
Broadway. There is hope, of course, that the numbers will be better
when this week's sales are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Open and Shut
</P>
<P>
   All right, all right, a few milestones to note. The last show to
open this century is ``Much Ado About Everything!'' by Jackie
Mason, who opened Thursday night and must love having the title.
And the last closing will be ``Epic Proportions,'' which folded on
Dec. 19 and whose producers can't be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   And the hottest ticket, at least as the numbers go, is still
``The Lion King,'' which enters its 26th month at the top of the
box office heap. When nearly everything else was down last week, it
grossed over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Chariot Awaited
</P>
<P>
   The last time Broadway watched a century pass, electric light
was all the rage, copyrights for playwrights were a new concept and
the hottest show in town featured eight live horses in a live
chariot race. The play? You guessed it: ``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   The production, a six-act extravaganza, opened on Nov. 29, 1899,
at the Broadway Theater, the same place where that famous
helicopter (in ``Miss Saigon'') would land 91 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel by Lew Wallace, ``Ben-Hur'' was the
brainchild of producers who evidently figured you couldn't miss
with a show where the men and the women wore short skirts. Just to
back up the bet, however, producers invested in 120,000 square feet
of scenery, a live camel (and two fake ones) and what the writer
William W. Ellsworth called ``one of the greatest stage
contrivances of our day'': an eight-part treadmill complete with a
rolling panorama of a Roman stadium to simulate Ben-Hur's
staggering victory over the evil Messala.
</P>
<P>
   It worked like this, according to ``Theater U.S.A.: 1668 to
1957,'' a history of American theater written by Bernard Hewitt.
Behind a darkened scrim, each of the horses was led onto a separate
treadmill, activated by the animal's running. The actors playing
Ben-Hur and Messala, equipped with whips and racing skirts, climbed
into actual chariots and started, well, whipping the horses to run.
And run they did.
</P>
<P>
   When the sound built to a fever pitch, the scrim flew up,
exposing to the audience a chariot race in full stride. As the
panoramas rolled, Messala's treadmills were slowly shifted upstage
so that the Ben-Hur chariot would appear to be gaining. In the
finale, the wheels were pulled off Messala's chariot, the horses
reared and the lights fell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's theater.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion helped seal the show's popularity. ``Panoramic,
pictorial, musical, terpsichorean, religious,'' Edward A. Dithmar
wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben-Hur'' ran out the season at the Broadway and later became
a favorite on the road. Then a little thing called the motion
pictures came along, of course, and made the need for the horses,
their treadmills and the rolling panorama extinct.

 &HT;    This is not your father's Beamer: Life different for Virginia
Tech coachBy Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Frank Beamer knows his life has changed. The signs
are everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   _ In years past, the Virginia Tech coach could move around
Blacksburg, Va., virtually unnoticed. Not anymore. Not since the
Hokies went 11-0 and earned a berth in the Sugar Bowl against
Florida State for Tuesday night's national championship. On Dec.
24, Beamer tried to slip into a mall to do some last-minute
Christmas shopping. ``I almost never got out of there,'' he said.
``People were so excited. I'd never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Beamer once had to beg the media outside Virginia to pay
attention to his program. On a recent afternoon, the Virginia Tech
campus entertained reporters from New York, Chicago, St.
Petersburg, Boston, ABC, CNN, and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beamer's mail has more than tripled, and the requests have
ranged from the ridiculous to the ridiculous. One man wrote asking
permission to name his prize bull after the Virginia Tech coach. So
today there is a good-looking Hereford in West Viwho goes by
the name of Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honored,'' said Beamer, who has seen a picture of his
namesake. ``At least I think I was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beamer bandwagon is almost full. He already has received
three awards as national coach of the year and is up for a fourth.
Here this week in New Orleans, Beamer will share the podium with
Florida State's Bobby Bowden, one of only five coaches in Division
I history to win 300 games. It's all pretty heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Beamer is enjoying the pinnacle of his career, he
also reflects that it easily might not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've gone through tough times, it really makes you
appreciate the good times,'' said Beamer, 53. ``Not a whole lot of
people would have bet that we would ever be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, nobody was betting on Beamer in 1992. He had just
completed his sixth season as head coach at Virginia Tech with a
record of 2-8-1. He was 24-40-2 after taking over the program from
Bill Dooley. The natives were getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not a Virginia Tech grad, they probably don't let me
hang around,'' he said. ``But they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer stayed on the job at Virginia Tech because of an
administration, specifically athletics director Dave Braine, that
could see that things were about to turn around in Blacksburg. The
school had just joined the Big East Conference, which would provide
stability in scheduling and improve recruiting. Braine persuaded
Beamer to make some coaching changes, but he also promised more
money for the assistants in order to stabilize the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell that Frank really wasn't the problem,'' said
Braine, now the athletics director at Georgia Tech. ``He had the
ability to be a really good head coach if we helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a winning formula. Starting in 1993,
Virginia Tech has gone 64-19, an average of nine wins a year. The
Hokies have won three Big East championships and are playing in
their seventh consecutive bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought we could be successful at Virginia Tech, but
we had to hit on the right combination and everybody from the
president on down had to be on the same page,'' Beamer said.
``We've got that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamer came close to being nowhere now. His life almost ended at
the age of seven.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Beamer was doing yard work on the family farm in
Virginia. After burning a pile of trash, he carried into the garage
the push broom he had been using. The broom, still smoldering,
ignited a can of gasoline that exploded right in front of Beamer,
severely burning the right side of his neck and upper body.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years Beamer would have more than 30
operations and skin grafts to repair the damage. Some of these
operations would require extended hospital visits in Pulaski, about
35 minutes from his home in Fancy Gap. During those visits, the
Virginia country boy was exposed to a world he never knew existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me realize that I wanted to do something more with my
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank has always been a little bit special _ especially from
the time he got burned,'' his brother, Barnett, told the Richmond
Times Dispatch. ``He became more outgoing for the experience. I
think it made him a little more capable of reaching for the
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   For a football coach, the national championship represents the
highest star. Frank Beamer is just 60 good minutes of football away
from putting it in his pocket.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ How to find a Jewish angle for the millennium? With
the eyes of the world on the Holy Land, Rabbi Shlomo Gestetner
wanted to exploit the moment, without, he hastened to add,
commemorating Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of the millennium is a confusing time for those who
live in the land where Jesus was born, lived and died. Mostly Jews
and Muslims, they do not attach religious significance to the
moment, yet they live, to some degree, in the modern, secular
world. It may be the year 5760 according to the Jewish calendar,
but there is no denying the worldwide ``energy and sense of
trepidation,'' Gestetner said.
</P>
<P>
   And so he came up with an idea: a Y6K benefit concert. Two
hundred and forty years early, but why be an accountant?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting the end of the world, but we are still
waiting for the Messiah,'' said Gestetner, director of the Mayanot
Institute of Jewish Studies, a modern Hasidic organization that
caters to college-age students from abroad. ``And in Jerusalem, all
good Jewish organizations are always looking for a way to fund
raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the Y6K event will take place on the night of
Jan. 1, and not on New Year's Eve, when Jerusalem will effectively
be shut down for the Jewish Sabbath. The actual millennial eve will
be a nonevent for most people here, although secular Tel Aviv and
Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem are expected to be lively. But in the
holy city, where most millennial tourists are staying, it will be
at best a closeted party of limited merriment _ no music, no
dancing _ because of Sabbath restrictions imposed by the rabbinical
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, pooh,'' said Jane Waugh, a tourist who had just arrived
from Nottingham, England. ``We're not terribly religious but we
figured this would be the most happening city in the world. Now it
seems, by all accounts, that it will be dead here. Nottingham would
be more eventful.''
</P>
<P>
   The day itself is likely to be bustling, particularly at the
Temple Mount in the Old City, which will see hundreds of thousands
of worshipers in shifts _ first Muslims, then Jews, then
Christians. The Muslims, for whom this is approximately the year
1420, are expected en masse to pray at al-Aksa mosque for the
fourth Friday of Ramadan, the holy month. At sundown, the usual
traffic of Jewish worshipers will crowd the plaza at the Western
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   And, later, local Christians and pilgrims will gather at the
Basilica of Gethsemane and at the Mount of Olives.
</P>
<P>
   The literal millennium madness is no longer expected, although
anything is possible. KfarShaul, the mental health center, had
reserved beds for foreigners struck by doomsday delusions or the
more commonplace holy city derangement labeled the Jerusalem
Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Yair Barel, the director, said that he had seen ``more
journalists than patients.'' Not a single person believing himself
to be God, a prophet or in direct communicath either has
shown up in the last 10 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Jabari, owner of the Black Horse Hostel off the Via Dolorosa
near the first Station of the Cross, said he had had some
``strange'' guests. One woman from Sweden left suddenly, telling
him Jesus had instructed her to ``check out.'' And a woman from
Canada, who claimed to be speaking with Jesus, was taken away by
the police and deported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other hoteliers in and around the Old City reported ``nothing
out of the ordinary,'' as Stellios Odeh, the reception clerk at the
Gloria Hotel, said.
</P>
<P>
   The police, though, will remain on high alert. Earlier this
year, the police deported to the United States and Britain a group
of apocalyptic cultists and several religious eccentrics who had
lived on the Mount of Olives for years. Now their concerns are
broader: the combustible mix of religious groups revolving through
the Temple Mount area, worldwide terrorism cautions, specific
terrorism concerns related to the revival of the peace effort, and
Y2K computer issues.
</P>
<P>
   The government sought and received special dispensation for a
heavy mobilization of police officers, public workers and
volunteers on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   The police will heavily guard most religious sites. At the
national park in the ancient city of Megiddo, for instance, the
police and forest rangers will step up their patrols since the
site, based on the New Testament, is believed to be where
Armageddon _ the end of the world _ will occur.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, almost all restaurants are closed on Friday
nights, and this Friday night will be no different. The hotels,
whose invaluable kosher certificates can be revoked if there are
perceived violations of the Sabbath, had reached an agreement with
the rabbinate allowing modest parties. But after pressure or
perceived pressure from the local religious councils, most hotels
will not hold anything more than a Champagne toast at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost all the hotels that had plans to do events for
Christians only, they withdrew those plans and none of them will do
anything,'' said Yonatan Harpaz, director of the Jerusalem Hotel
Association, referring to ``threats that are more than veiled.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with the downsizing of the millennial eve, the Israeli
government has canceled a scheduled concert of Handel's ``Messiah''
at the Jerusalem Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Ronit Levy, an American-born university student, was
stocking up on Champagne this week. ``I really don't think the
state of Israel should be cowed by the rabbis into conceiving of
New Year's Eve as a Christian event,'' she said. ``Hello? How many
Israelis have any clue that it is the Jewish month of Tevet? My
laptop isn't programmed to the year 5760. We're Y2K like the rest
of the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officially, though, Israelis seem both ambivalent and sometimes
clueless hosts to the Christian pilgrims that are staying in their
hotels. One hotel, the Hyatt Regency, unwittingly held its
Christmas dinner on Dec. 24, following the Jewish tradition of
holding the festival meal on the eve of a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The once vaunted ``millennial season,'' which some hoteliers say
was inadequately promoted by the government, is turning out to be a
dud. Many hotels, which raised their rates in eager anticipation of
hordes, are experiencing lower occupancy rates than last year. At
the Jerusalem Hilton, the Christmas-New Year's season usually
brings back-to-back bar mitzvah groups, but not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Palns, eager to embrace the event, do not have many
hotel rooms to fill. But they are holding another celebration in
the newly refurbished Manger Square in Bethlehem, where they will
release thousands of doves for peace _ despite opposition from a
French animal rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hatem Abu Ahmed, a Muslim food vendor, most Palestinians
will not celebrate the day themselves. Abu Ahmed said the
millennium meant nothing to him, and then retracted his statement.
``If I am lucky, the millennium will mean a good day for shwarma,''
he said, referring to the meat in pita sandwiches that he sells.

   NEW YORK _ When the sun comes up Saturday morning, it will the
23rd day of Teve in 5760 by the Jewish calendar. In Chinese
tradition it will be the 25th day of the 11th month in 4697, year
of the earth rabbit. It will be the 24th day of Ramadan in 1420
under the Islamic calendar, and the 11th day of Pausa in 1921 by
the national calendar of India. It would, in other words, be just
another day, except that for most of the Western world (and its
business partners), Saturday will also be New Year's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The date is an arbitrary slice of time; many historians doubt
that the Gregorian calendar's starting point accurately matches the
year Jesus Christ was born. Yet the equally arbitrary milestone it
leads to, with the nice round number of 2000, has by now created
whole industries of anticipation, revelry, planning and
retrospection. Never have three zeroes added up to so much.
</P>
<P>
   As an inevitable result of simple arithmetic, 1999 has been a
year of lists, polls, histories, assessments, reassessments,
pontifications and summations. Not to mention commercial tie-ins:
There have been ubiquitous variations on the phrase ``Last
(whatever) of the millennium,'' a line that will finally be laughed
out of existence on Saturday. Let all the nitpickers and killjoys
insist that Friday is only the last day of the 1900s, not the first
day of the 21st century and the third millennium A.D. Everyone else
is getting ready to say goodbye not just to a decade, but also to a
century and a millennium, maybe two. And there's no agreement on
the right spirit for the sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve always arrives with mixed emotions: reminiscing
about some things while trying to forget others, mingling nostalgia
and relief and hope and apprehension. Yet Friday night is, by any
reckoning, the most polarized New Year's observance in memory, far
outstripping the fin de siecle agitation of the 1890s. That's
because at midnight Friday, no one knows whether to expect a
jamboree or a disaster. This year more than ever, New Year's Eve is
simultaneously the province of reckless hedonists and grim
pessimists. As Jimi Hendrix sang, ``Is it tomorrow or just the end
of time?''
</P>
<P>
   That split in attitude ran straight down the middle of popular
culture in 1999. Early on, musicians endorsed confident good times
in releases like the Backstreet Boys' album ``Millennium,'' Robbie
Williams' song ``Millennium'' and Will Smith's album ``Willennium''
and its current hit single, ``Will 2K.'' (Oddly, these high-profile
millennial tidings were geared to pop's teen-age and younger
audiences, some of whom have barely digested a decade, much less a
century.) Movies and television took the opposite tone, rushing to
envision impending disasters and apocalypses in ``End of Days'' and
the television movie ``Y2K.'' A major incentive for the gloom was
probably thosions look dandy on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, meanwhile, have been cracking jokes about the Year
2000 computer bug, which, as everyone has been told, will leave
some computer programs clueless about what year it is. More than a
year's worth of wildly varying forecasts have posited that the bug
will knock out anything from a handful of antiquated home computers
to unprepared power plants to the entire world economy. Some
commentators, interpreting Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce or the Bible,
say the Year 2000 bug could trigger the apocalypse; others have
simply been urging people to cash everything in and head for the
backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night may be the best time ever to conversationally
drop the word chiliasm: the belief, as the historian Eugen Weber
defines it in ``Apocalypses'' (Harvard University Press, 1999),
that ``the world order was about to end in terrible torments, to be
followed by the millennium, a thousand years of blessedness.'' (Is
it coincidence, or portent, that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are to
perform Friday night on the Fox Network?) Unfortunately for most of
the population, the Revelations of St. John stipulate that only a
saved elite will be left on Earth to enjoy that happy millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists and entrepreneurs aren't about to wait. They're
determined to make Friday night the worldwide party of all time.
Unlike previous centuries or millennia, the 20th century built
instantaneous global communications, and all those connections will
be flaunted Friday. On television, ABC, PBS and CNN are tracking
the change of the year for 24 hours, from the moment it hits the
International Date Line at 5 a.m. New York time. (And if Year 2000
problems strike when 1/1/00 arrives abroad, correspondents will be
in place.)
</P>
<P>
   The annual crowd scene for millions of visitors to Times Square,
this time waiting for the new crystal ball to drop at midnight, has
been extended this year into an all-day event with a one-world
theme. Beginning at 10 a.m., it will follow the time zones to
present traditional music and dance from various cultures as their
home countries reach 2000. England has built a Millennium Dome for
its own mass gathering, and in city centers around the world
throngs are expected to pack arenas and restaurants, cruise ships
and concert halls, clubs and bars and luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unbridled, free-spending hedonism has had fewer takers than
expected for the big rollover. Promoters who banked on the wildest
extravagance have been, by and large, severely disillusioned.
Apparently no one expects the Year 2000 bug to wipe out their
credit-card balances. In New York, a much-touted program at the
Javits Center, with Sting, Aretha Franklin and Andrea Bocelli for
$1,000 and up a person, didn't find enough customers who wanted to
meet the year 2000 inside a convention hall. (Ms. Franklin is to
sing on ABC.) Tickets for Billy Joel's concert at Madison Square
Garden from $150 to $999.99 were still available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, people will be running a chilly five-kilometer
race through Central Park, dancing to disc jockeys at Chelsea
Piers, walking across the Brooklyn Bridge while fireworks flash
overhead or bellying up to their favorite neighborhood bars, if
they can cram themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Bars and people giving their own parties don't have much time
left to decide which song will bridge 1999 and 2000. Will Prince's
``1999'' get its last chance? R.E.M.'s ``It's the End of the World
as We Know It (and I Feel Fine)''? Some 20th-century jazz from
Ornette Coleman's album ``End of the Century''? Or how about Patsy
Cline's potentially prescient song about a breakdown of
transportation as the Year 2000 bug hits: ``Walkin' After
Midnight''?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even as people put on their party duds or running shoes, no one
has been able to avoid absorbing more dire predictions about the
end of 1999: the foreboding that if a computer fiasco doesn't get
us, maybe terrorists will. Between assurances that every node of
the computer-controlled infrastructure has been checked and
double-checked, some public officials have quietly suggested laying
in enough bottled water, batteries and canned goods to get through
a winter storm or power failure, just in case. For the occasion,
MTV has put half a dozen people in a bunker under Times Square to
be televised as potential survivors of a Year 2000 meltdown. Of
course, the ratings will suffer if no one can watch.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of a man taking potential bomb materials into
Washington state has heightened anxieties about terrorism
everywhere, not least in New York City. The big multicultural party
in Times Square has been surrounded with precautions: nearly 8,000
uniformed and plainclothes officers on duty, helicopters surveying
the area, streets cleared of cars, mailboxes locked and manhole
covers welded shut to deter bombers. As if to continue the
apocalyptic theme, the police operation is named Archangel.
</P>
<P>
   What's an appropriate commemoration of the last century? Maybe
it would be to revel in the technological marvels of the present,
lest some unknown Year 2000 side effect scramble them all beyond
rebooting. Crank up some all-synthetic music by the likes of
Autechre or Squarepusher. Ignore a phone call as it comes through
the answering machine. Check out that remote video feed from
Djibouti on the network news; tape and replay it. Log on to the
Internet for a connection to some stranger's obsession, perhaps
monitoring signs of the Second Coming through the self-designated
Messiahcam trained on Jerusalem's eastern gate, the next Messiah's
earthly portal (www.olivetree.org). Taste a fresh mango in New York
in December; think about the window view from a recent airplane
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the modern comforts, some people are winding up the
last day of 1999 by fasting, meditating, praying or observing a vow
of silence at Buddhist centers and churches. At the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine in New York, there is an annual concert
dedicated to peace. Consider it a deliberate pause in the
information barrage or a somber memorial to millions of victims of
a violent century and millennium; gunpowder was invented in China
about 1,000 years ago. As 1999 ends, the penitential mode seems no
less appropriate than frantic celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to measure the passage of eras would be a temporary
return to the conditions of 1899. Shut off the computer, the
television, the CD player, the VCR, the radio; forget about
watching the ball drop in Times Square, where the annual stunt
wasn't inaugurated until 1904. People might still read this
newspaper under recently installed electric lights. They could
listen to recorded music, but they'd have to crank the newfangled
Edison machine or put a nickel in a coin phonograph to spin one
two-minute selection at a time, recorded on a cylinder. Perhaps
they'd pump the player piano instead, or pick up a guitar.
Carriages and bicycles would be rolling through the streets; trains
would be huffing across the countryside. Distances would seem far
greater and nights much darker than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Or go back even further, to 999. Clear away New York City and
the United States, still hundreds of years in the future. No one
speaks an English we would recognize. Music hasn't developed
harmony. Europe is a feudal patchwork dominated by a nascent Holy
Roman Empire, while other centers of civilization _ in Asia,
Africa, the Middle East and what would become the Americas _ are
surrounded by unmapped places where nature, not information,
dominates the landscape. The borders of a village or estate or
encampment circumscribe most people's lives. And while every flood
or war raises fears that the end times are about to arrive, there's
no particular Jan. 1 furor as all the digits change. Although
churchmen did recognize the 1,000th anniversary of the Nativity,
the Gregorian calendar wouldn't come into general use for centuries
to come, while the new year was celebrated not in January, but in
March. When an abacus was used for commerce, there was no Y1K
problem.
</P>
<P>
   For this New Year's Eve, everyone can seek an individual balance
of celebration and dread. Wired to the world, with party hats and
noisemakers, champagne on ice and flashlights stashed nearby _ just
in case those Year 2000 warnings come true _ toasts will be raised
and invocations offered to the four new digits on calendars and
computers. And next year at this time, a punctilious few will
celebrate the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square 2000'' will be held on Broadway and Seventh
Avenue between 43rd and 47th Streets. There will be music, costumed
dancers, puppets and video broadcasts of New Year's Eve
celebrations from all over the world. It begins tonight at 6:30 and
continues for 24 hours. Programs begin 15 minutes before each hour,
and each lasts about 30 minutes. The Times Square ball will be
lowered at midnight. Free. Remote viewing screens at the Avenue of
the Americas at 43rd Street, Eighth Avenue at 43rd Street, and
Broadway at 50th Street. Information: (212) 354-0003.

IN A PEACE GESTURE, ISRAEL RELEASES 7 PALESTINIAN PRISONERS
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-NEWYEAR) 
(nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Calling it a good-will gesture for the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan, Israel on Thursday freed seven Palestinian
prisoners who come from East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since 1994 that Jerusalem residents, who
live under Israeli rule, had been included in a prisoner release.
In 1994, the Israeli right wing protested vehemently when 74
Jerusalemites were released.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials took Thursday's release as a victory, if
not a tacit admission that Palestinians in the disputed eastern
half of the city are allied with the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli members of Parliament saw it that way, too, and
criticized the government for what they called a surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not capitulate in such a way,'' said Gideon Ezra of
the opposition Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians are negotiating the fate of Jerusalem
in final status talks. Israel claims the whole city as its capital,
and the Palestinians are fighting to regain a foothold in the
eastern part of the city, which Israel captured from Jordan in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seven men belonged to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction. They had been convicted of crimes ranging
from stone-throwing to attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   After reunions with their families, two of the seven men
traveled immediately to al-Aksa mosque in the Old City to pray.
Then, they were received at the Orient House, the Palestine
Liberation Organization's headquarters in East Jerusalem, where
they complained about the many Jerusalemites still in prison.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 Palestinians remain in Israeli prisons,
including some 168 from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a new page and that Israeli will close all the
files of Palestinian prisoners,'' said Faisal Husseini, the PLO's
representative in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's release brought to 383 the number of Palestinian
security prisoners that Israel has released since September, when
Prime Minister Ehud Barak signed the most recent agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Israeli troops removed more than 100 young
settlers who had set up a tent camp on a plot of the West Bank
scheduled to be transferred soon to the Palestinian Authority.
Police officers and soldiers dragged the settlers, mostly
teen-agers from a radical youth group, to awaiting buses and tore
down their tents.

 &HT;    Hanspard's recovery begins to gain speed
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Byron Hanspard was grinning as he jawed at Falcons
cornerback Ronnie Bradford at practice the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, man, you know you can't cover me!'' Hanspard said.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, it wasn't a totally preposterous suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a month ago, the 23-year-old running back ran
like he was about 43. He looked like a man on his way out of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Hanspard ran in Sunday's 37-14 victory against the
Cardinals, the horrible left knee injury he suffered in the last
exhibition game of the 1998 season was a bad memory.
</P>
<P>
   When he rushed 26 times for 102 yards and his first rushing
touchdown, the 5-foot-10, 200-pound Hanspard looked much as he did
as a rookie in the '97 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had fallen in love with his speed and drafted him in
the second round. He didn't disappoint, averaging 6.3 yards per
carry that season and returning two kickoffs for touchdowns. Before
Sunday, though, he had averaged just 2.7 yards per carry through
the first 10 games before coach Dan Reeves decided to keep Hanspard
in street clothes for four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The time off helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This previous week was the best it felt,'' Hanspard said. ``I
didn't have any problems cutting, accelerating or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron gave us a tremendous boost,'' he said. ``He ran
extremely well. He really accelerated through the holes and also
did a good job of finding daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard's path had been blocked for a while. He had just 53
carries as a rookie, when running back Jamal Anderson was
blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And he missed the entire '98 season after tearing the anterior
cruciate ligament and patella tendon in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   After arduous rehabilitation, Hanspard's break appeared to come
in the second game of the season, when Anderson's season ended with
a right knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Near his hometown of Desoto, Texas, Hanspard rushed 19 times for
76 yards, a 4-yard average, in a 24-7 loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about it for highlights until Sunday. He started
the next two games, but on 31 carries he managed just 70 yards, 2.3
yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard lacked acceleration and was so tentative he seemed to
be backing into some holes.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, he had said little about considerable pain in his
knee, where scar tissue had stiffened. After it was broken by a
doctor, the pain was worse.
</P>
<P>
   The next game, at New Orleans, Ken Oxendine took over as the
starting running back.
</P>
<P>
   In a reserve role, Hanspard had five carries for 3 yards Oct. 17
against the Rams, four carries for 6 yards Oct. 25 at Pittsburgh,
four carries for 11 yards Nov. 7 against Jacksonville and four
carries for 3 yards Nov. 21 at Tampa Bay. ``Last year, I was hurt,
and . . . I knew I couldn't play,'' he said. ``This year . . . I
came back expecting to play, but the knee being sore didn't allowed
me to do what I expected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all of his travails, the deeply religious Hanspard has
leaned on prayer and his wife, Yolanda, his high-school sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Their first child, Byron Jr., is due in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been my inspiration,'' Hanspard said. ``We try to find a
positive in everything. She's been my encouragement when I wanted
to be down or when I wanted to throw in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard will become a restricted free agent in the offseason
but probably will end up staying with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   He just wants to keep working on his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 85 to 90 percent, strength-wise,'' he said. ``I
have all the flexion, but I still need some strength. I fully
expect to get back to where I was.''

<P>
   Q: I just bought a new computer and I notice when I connect to
my ISP, I now have to wait longer than I did with my old system to
get on the Web. I get the ``logging on to remote computer'' message
and that my name and password are being verified, but it seems I
have to wait up to 30 seconds. Before it was a matter of two or
three seconds. What's wrong? Bad modem? Software conflict?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, none of the above. You've got some settings wrong,
but these are easy to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows connects to a remote computer, such as your
Internet provider's systems, your computer goes through several
processes before you can start using the connection.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that happens is that your modem and either the
modem or terminal server at your Internet provider have to agree on
how they're going to talk to each other. That's essentially the
ugly sound you hear from your modem, the screeches and beeps.
</P>
<P>
   The two devices negotiate with each other and decide on how
they're going to get along. This is when such things as the speed
of the connection is determined.
</P>
<P>
   Once that's done, Windows then begins talking over the
connection to software on your provider's network. It sends, among
other things, your log-in name and password, and this should take a
few seconds on a properly configured system.
</P>
<P>
   Some settings on your machine may make it try to do more in the
way of logging on than it needs to. For example, most providers
don't require that you log into their network in the same way you
might log into a computer network at your office. However, Windows'
default setting tries to do this.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what's causing your system to take longer than
necessary to complete the connection.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this off, go into your Dialup Networking folder and
right-click on the icon for your connection. Choose Properties, and
then click on the Server Types tab.
</P>
<P>
   From there, uncheck the ``Log on to network'' box. Also, make
sure the boxes next to NetBEUI and IPX/SPX Compatible are
unchecked. TCP/IP needs to remain checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a computer with Windows 98 as the operating
system. It has Microsoft Word loaded in it, but I couldn't save my
Word documents in the older 6.0/Word 95 type. In the SAVE AS TYPE
list box, I couldn't find that option. I reinstalled the Office,
and it still doesn't have the 6.0/95 format. What can I do to get
that format into my copy of Word?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reinstall Microsoft Word, but instead of using the automatic
or express installation option, choose Custom.
</P>
<P>
   Find the setting that lets you pick which file format converters
are included, and make sure the Word 6.0 option is selected. You
also can use this to add any other features that might not be
included in a standard installation, or remove some you don't think
you might need, and thus regain some disk space.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was going to buy a new computer for our home, but I just
heard that work on Windows 2000 is complete and that it will be
ready in February. Should I wait for Windows 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't let the name fool you. This is not the successor to
Windows 98. Instead, Windows 2000 is actually the next version of
Windows NT, an operating system that's aimed at corporate and
business users.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows 2000 reportedly is friendlier _ it is the first
version of NT with plug-and-play capabilities _ it still is not
aimed at consumer users. Microsoft is working on a new version of
its so-called ``9X'' Windows for home users, code-named Millennium,
that is supposed to be out sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is _ there's no real need to wait. If you need a
new computer now, get one now.

NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT CHRISTIE'S  
 NEW ACQUISITIONS AT THE WHITNEY  
 A NEW ADDRESS FOR THE MICHAEL WERNER GALLERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, France, Netherlands, Calif.)   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials at Christie's chose Christmas Eve to send
all staff members e-mail announcing that Christopher M. Davidge,
chief executive worldwide since 1993 and a 34-year veteran of the
company, was leaving to pursue other interests. Edward Dolman, its
managing director in New York, will replace him.
</P>
<P>
   While few at Christie's expected the news to come just as
everyone was leaving for the holidays, it did not come as a
surprise. A management shake-up has been expected ever since the
French investor Francois Pinault bought the company a year and a
half ago. Pinault is known for waiting a year after acquiring a
business before making major changes. It was also well known at
Christie's that there was bitter conflict between Davidge and
several top board members and that he did not always get along with
Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's said Davidge declined to comment on the reasons for
his departure. ``He plans to move on to different things,'' Dolman
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors that Davidge was talking with Bernard
Arnault, the French investor who bought Phillips, the London-based
auction house, two months ago. But Dolman emphasized that none of
Davidge's plans would involve the auction world and that he would
``remain loyal to Christie's.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Dolman as chief executive is popular among staff
members because he understands the company both as an expert and as
a manager. He joined the auction house in 1984, when he was 24, as
a porter at Christie's South Kensington in London, the company's
lower-priced arm. The job was typical for a young trainee. Since
then he has rapidly risen through the ranks, holding a variety of
positions, including one as an expert in its English furniture
department and as managing director of Christie's Amsterdam,
managing director of Christie's in Europe and since July managing
director of Christie's in America.
</P>
<P>
   While Dolman will be based in New York, he said the rest of the
management team would stay in London, signaling that the
French-owned auction house would continue to have its headquarters
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Curiel was named deputy chairman of Christie's
worldwide. He was previously executive chairman of Christie's in
Europe.

   FLURRIES OF ACQUISITIONS AT THE WHITNEY
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum of American Art has just announced its
acquisitions for the year. As in most American museums, a majority
of them were acquired in the last three months when donors began to
anticipate the significant tax deductions for their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's acquisitions include many classic names, among
them Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Louise Bourgeois, the list
also includes lesser-known artists who are to be featured in this
year's Biennial, the Whitney's giant survey of contemporary art
opening in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the museum was founded in the 1930's, it has always
taken risks,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, the Whitney's director.
``The museum has always invested in artists they believe in before
waiting until judgments are passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the newly acquired works are ``Rapture,'' a 13-minute
black-and-white video by the Iranian-born artist Shirin Neshat;
``Babe'' (1998) and the ``Best of Life'' portfolio (1985-1995) by
the Brooklyn-based photographer Vik Muniz; ``A Young Man Resting on
an Exercise Bike, Amityville, Long Island,'' a 1990 photograph by
the Chicago photographer Dawoud Bey, and ``Untitled No. 824,'' a
work in wax and mixed media by the sculptor Petah Coyne. None of
these works will be in the Biennial, although the artists will be
represented by other works.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to beefing up its collection of work by young
artists, the Whitney has been trying to fill gaps in other areas.
It acquired ``Emetic Fields,'' a 1989 eight-panel painting 9 feet
long and 17 feet high by the 70-year-old figurative painter Ida
Applebroog, who was in the Whitney's 1991 and 1993 Biennials.
``Emetic Fields'' is Ms. Applebroog's first work to enter the
Whitney's collection. Since the museum lacked a new work by the Los
Angeles artist Ed Ruscha, it recently bought ``Hollywood to Pico,''
a 1998 painting.
</P>
<P>
   In photography, it has bought one of Matthew Barney's most
recent triptychs using stills from the film ``Cremaster 2,'' which
was released this fall. It also bought eight prints by Nan Goldin
and one of Cindy Sherman's most recent works, ``Untitled (347),'' a
1999 black-and-white photograph of plastic dolls and action
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also concentrated on increasing its holdings in
drawings. Among the most significant to enter the collection are
Johns' ``Usuyuki'' (1979), which uses the artist's signature
crosshatching in a triptych format that can simultaneously be read
in horizontal and vertical directions. It was bought with money
from the Lauder Foundation, the Evelyn and Leonard Lauder Fund and
the museum's drawing committee, as was ``Study for Mother and Son''
(1936) by Arshile Gorky. That drawing is a study for the ``The
Artist and His Mother,'' a painting in the Whitney's collection.
The museum's drawing committee bought ``Pierre's Blazer'' (1997),
by Louise Bourgeois. ``A lot of artists are working in drawings,''
Anderson said. ``So we were able to make some successful
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   A selection of these works are to go on view this summer in the
museum's second-floor galleries, which are devoted to its permanent
collection.
</P>
<P>
   NEW AND FAMOUS HOME FOR THE MICHAEL WERNER GALLERY
</P>
<P>
   The Michael Werner Gallery is celebrating its 10th anniversary
in New York this spring by moving to larger quarters, 2,500 square
feet on the second floor of 4 East 77th Street. The address is
familiar to those in the art world: it is the town house where Leo
Castelli opened his New York gallery in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The Werner Gallery, which specializes in German contemporary
artists like Georg Baselitz and Sigmar Polke, closed at 21 East
67th Street two weeks ago. The new gallery will formally open in
March; until then it will be open only by appointment.

 &HT;    Q and A on Y2K (one last time)
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now almost everyone has heard of the Y2K computer glitch.
Because of some programming shortcuts in the early days of
computers, some were at risk of losing data or providing bad
information as the year 2000 approaches. Businesses have spent
billions attempting to fix the problem. And the market is flooded
with fixes for the personal computer user as well. Here are some
questions and answers about the Y2K glitch provided by Bill Husted,
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Personal Technology editor and
TechnoBuddy columnist. Husted, 53, has worked for the
Journal-Constitution since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the utilities _ electricity, telephone, water and gas _
done a good enough job? Is there a reason to worry that Y2K
problems will interrupt any of these services?
</P>
<P>
   A: From all indications, there should be no Y2K service
interruptions. Keep this in mind, however: On any given day there
are isolated problems and failures from all these utilities. If you
experience a service outage, remember that it may not be caused by
the Y2K glitch. And, despite the fact that all these computer fixes
have been tested and retested, no one can make an ironclad
guarantee that they will work. So if you worry about interruptions,
don't feel silly about laying in a supply of drinking water, food
and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the experts think the most likely source of Y2K
problems will be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Experts worry that there could be panic caused by Y2K
hysteria. After all, the problem has been much in the news and
wildly exaggerated movies and books have painted worst case
scenarios. So fearful consumers could exhaust money supplies in ATM
machines, overload telephone systems by testing their telephone at
the stroke of midnight, and overwhelm computer networks by logging
on to check for problems.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the fear _ a reasonable one _ that there may be
minor problems caused, ironically, by some of the new computer
programming designed to fix the Y2K problem. Since computer
programs are complex and require millions of lines of code, some of
these Y2K fixes themselves may have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But wouldn't any problems _ caused either by Y2K itself or
the fixes _ become apparent in the tests of government and business
computer networks?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the computer tests are thorough, there always is a
chance of missing a potential problem. Remember that computer
networks are dynamic (in other words: Things change from moment to
moment based on the programs running and the data feeding into them
from the network) not static. So it would be impossible to
duplicate in a test every possible condition that might exist on
the network at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about travel during the New Year's holiday? Is that Y2K
safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: So far as road travel, computer-controlled stoplights and
other traffic control systems should work fine. But keep in mind
that the holidays are always an especially dangerous time to
travel, and if there is a Y2K panic _ warranted or not _ roadways
could become jammed. Air travel also should be safe, but since no
one can make an absolute promise, some people may want to consider
postponing optional trips during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should home computer users do to make sure that their
systems are Y2K safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Macintosh users don't really need to worry at all. PC users
are more vulnerable because of differences in how the operating
system handles dates. But for any computer user, the most important
step is creating a backup copy of the vital information on your
computer, a good idea at any time. That way, if there are
unanticipated problems, you will not lose information.
</P>
<P>
   Second, make sure that your programs are Y2K-compatible.
Especially at risk are finance programs and spreadsheets,
particularly older ones. Check the Web site of the publisher of
your various programs for advice and updates. But again, no one can
make ironclad guarantees, so create a backup copy of the
information on your machine. If you don't know how to do that,
check the built in ``help'' category on your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about the possibility of hackers using Y2K as an excuse
to cause trouble? Is that a danger?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sure is. And the experts already have seen several new
viruses with internal triggers set to go off on or around New
Year's Day. So it makes good sense for businesses and individuals
to have a good anti-virus program and to be especially cautious
about downloading Internet files and opening e-mail attachments.
It's also smart to make a good backup copy _ on a Zip drive or
floppy disks _ of your most precious information.

 &HT;    Some small businesses directly in path of Y2k problems
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big day is finally here, and some Y2K experts
don't believe that many of Georgia's small businesses are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of small businesses that are going to need help
after the first of the year,'' said Ron Dolinsky, executive
director of the Southeast Region Y2K Solutions Center in Atlanta.
``I think there are a number of companies that have waited too
long, and there could be a ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K has the potential to affect billing, accounting, inventory,
scheduling and quarterly reports for small businesses. Once the
date changes to 2000, the personal computers and software that
handle these functions may not work properly.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of small business readiness apparently isn't limited to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Federation of Independent Business,
between 1.25 million and 1.5 million small employers, or 26
percent, will have made no effort to detect and correct any
Y2K-related computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The NFIB said 52 percent of small businesses will actually do
something to prepare for Y2K. The remainder of small businesses are
either already Y2K compliant or not affected by the date change.
</P>
<P>
   John Laszcz, director of Georgia Tech's Y2K Resource Center, has
spent the past year on a crusade to inform small businesses about
the potential damage Y2K can cause.
</P>
<P>
   Laszcz said his center made more than 5,000 calls to small
manufacturers since 1998 to ask them about their Y2K preparation.
</P>
<P>
   He also has spoken with 40 chambers of commerce across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Laszcz said many small to midsized companies that
own proprietary software aren't prepared.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cost of updating the software has been a deterrent
to a lot of companies that may be working on razor-thin margins.
Laszcz said companies that aren't taking Y2K seriously would rather
wait and see what happens after the date change to take corrective
action.
</P>
<P>
   But other small businesses have been active in exterminating the
Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Scovil, vice president and general manager of
50-employee Prime Power, said the Atlanta company became
Y2K-compliant earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes parts for generators, will be more
concerned that clients' generators are working on Saturday than
whether internal systems are functioning, Scovil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting it to be a non-event,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolinsky said smaller companies might not discover Y2K glitches
for three or four months, when scheduling or inventory reports come
up with inaccurate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He said this could eventually affect large companies that rely
on the smaller guys for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys with the command centers could eventually be
impacted by this,'' Dolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Region Y2K Solutions Group suggested two helpful
Web sites for small businesses experiencing Y2K problems;
www.oky2k.org and www.globalspeak.com
</P>
<P>
   The resource center plans to shift into ``disaster recovery
mode'' in January, Laszcz said. He expects calls to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ready,'' Laszcz said.

AFTER `IMPASSE,' TALKS RESUME BETWEEN HIJACKERS, INDIAN
GOVERNMENT

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Negotiations between Indian officials and
hijackers holding more than 150 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines
jet in Afghanistan resumed Thursday after nearly breaking down in
the early hours of the morning, and are now ``delicately poised,''
the foreign minister of India, Jaswant Singh, said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are focused on the hijackers' remaining demand that
India free a jailed Pakistani Muslim cleric and 35 militants
opposed to Indian rule of Kashmir. On Wednesday, the hijackers
abandoned their insistence that India pay a $200 million ransom and
turn over the exhumed body of a slain militant.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Indians and the hijackers are under intense pressure
from the ruling Taliban militia in Afghanistan to make a deal and
end the week old crisis. The Indian Airlines Airbus that was seized
by the hijackers on a flight from Nepal last Friday has been
sitting on the tarmac of an airport in the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke off at 2 a.m. and Indian officials left
discouraged. ``The negotiations came to a situation of impasse,''
Singh said. ``There was apprehension about no further resumption of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, the Taliban, which has made its impatience
with the pace of the talks clear, sent in dozens of heavily armed
soldiers and trucks loaded with a rocket launcher and an
anti-aircraft Stinger missile.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban officials have repeatedly said they would storm the
plane if the hijackers began killing passengers on Afghan soil, and
the movement of soldiers to the airport raised speculation that
such an attack might be imminent _ or that the Taliban was trying
to remind the hijackers of what could happen if they resorted to
more violence. The hijackers fatally stabbed one man, a newlywed
returning from his honeymoon in Nepal, before the plane reached
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban's foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil,
played down the significance of the deployment and said it was just
a routine security measure. ``It does not mean we are going to
storm the plane,'' he told reporters in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said neither the Taliban nor the hijackers had set a
deadline for an end to the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when little information of substance was made public,
unconfirmed reports spread quickly that the Indians were close to a
deal to release some of the militants in exchange for the freeing
of the hostages. But Indian officials emphatically denied it.
``There is no such agreement,'' said Raminder Singh Jassal, a
spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers _ their identities still a mystery _ are holed up
in the Airbus and talking with Indian negotiators by radio. The
strongest clue to who they are lies in their demand for the release
of Maulana Masood Azhar, a Pakistani cleric who was a leader of
Harakat ul-Ansar. The group helped recruit, train and send
militants to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and is on the U.
S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Kashmir, whose population is predominantly Muslim,
has been a festering source of conflict between predominantly Hindu
India and Islamic Pakistan ever since they were created from the
British empire in 1947. In the last decade, indigenous Kashmiri
rebels as well as militants sponsored by Pakistan have fought for a
separate Kashmiri nation, or for Kashmir's right to join Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the precise motives of the hijackers are murky. They have
not yet spoken directly to the public or to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a small sign of flexibility, they allowed a young,
unidentified male passenger with a serious stomach ailment to leave
the plane for treatment at a hospital, but only with the
understanding that he would return to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said the hijackers had refused to allow the passenger to
be treated near the airport by Red Cross doctors because the
organization had made it clear that it would not be party to
returning the passenger to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, the Indian man, looking pale and exhausted,
was whisked from the airport in a white van. Thursday night, there
were conflicting reports about whether he had been returned to
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic hostage, Anil Khurana, who was released on Sunday
because of his failing health, returned to Delhi Thursday night. He
had been flown to Islamabad on Monday and taken to the intensive
care unit of a hospital there.

FORMER BEATLE GEORGE HARRISON HOSPITALIZED AFTER STABBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A man armed with a large knife broke into the house of
George Harrison, the former Beatle, early Thursday morning and
stabbed him in the chest, authorities said. Evidence has since
emerged that the assailant may have harbored a dangerous obsession
with the band.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, 56, is one of three remaining members of the Beatles
after the murder of John Lennon by a mentally unstable fan 19 years
ago. Harrison was treated for a collapsed lung and various minor
stab wounds at a hospital near his home in Henley-on-Thames. He was
listed in stable condition Thursday night, and doctors said that
his wounds were not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Olivia, was treated for minor head injuries she had
suffered in the struggle with the intruder. She has been released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had arrested a 33-year-old man from Liverpool,
the hometown of all four Beatles, on suspicion of attempted murder.
In keeping with British practice, the police would not release the
suspect's name or give details about the investigation. But they
did say that it appeared to be a deliberate attack, rather than a
simple break-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all sure this is a burglary that went wrong,''
Detective Chief Inspector Euan Read, who is leading the
investigation for the Thames Valley Police, told reporters outside
Harrison's estate.
</P>
<P>
   And as the day wore on, there were suggestions that the suspect
_ identified in media reports as Michael Abram following a police
search of a Liverpool house where he is listed as the occupant _
had nursed an irrational obsession with the Beatles. The emerging
portrait of the man is similar to that of Mark Chapman, whose
obsession with John Lennon resulted in Chapman shooting and killing
Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building on Central Park West
in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Thursday's issue of The Liverpool Echo,
Abram's mother, Lynda, said her son was a mentally ill former
heroin addict who hears voices in his head, sees things emerging
from walls and ``takes all music literally.'' After a brief
obsession with Oasis, a Beatles-influenced British band, she said,
Abram had ``been running in pubs shouting about the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   Abram ``hates them and even believes they are witches and takes
their music seriously,'' his mother said of the Beatles. ``He
started to wear a Walkman to play music to stop the voices in his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   From his hospital bed, Harrison told the authorities that he did
not believe the assailant was a burglar. Mark Gritten, the chief
executive of the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where Harrison was taken
after the attack, said, ``The quote he gave me was that the man
wasn't a burglar but that he certainly wasn't auditioning for the
Traveling Wilburys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Traveling Wilburys is the name of a band set up in the 1980s
by Harrison along with Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff
Lynne.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attack took place at around 3:30 a.m., when a
man armed with a knife they described as 6 or 7 inches long broke a
window and entered Friar Park, the Harrisons' estate in
Henley-on-Thames, about 25 miles west of London.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which is set on 34 acres and has dozens of rooms, is
known as Fort Knox to neighbors because of the stringent security
measures there, including powerful lights, video cameras, a
razor-wire fence and electronically controlled gates.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder hit Mrs. Harrison on the head and then repeatedly
stabbed Harrison when he came to his wife's aid, leaving him with a
one-inch stab wound in his chest and other minor injuries, police
said. The couple fought back, injuring the intruder's head before
detaining him while a member of their staff called police.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison's were treated at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.
Their assailant was treated for minor injuries at a nearby hospital
before being turned over to police.
</P>
<P>
   William Fountain, the surgeon who treated Harrison, said the
singer had had a narrow escape that was little short of miraculous.
The knife barely missed piercing the superior vena cava, a vein
that carries blood from the head, arms and upper body to the heart,
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``No stab wound to the chest is minor,'' he said. ``In Mr.
Harrison's case, it is just by chance that it is not particularly
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said that Harrison, who was later moved to Harefield
Hospital, which has a specialist chest department, was ``having
serious painkillers because this is a seriously painful injury.''
The physical recovery should take about two to three weeks, he
said, although ``it may a bit longer to be mentally fully fit''
after such an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, the former lead guitarist of the Beatles, was known as
``the quiet Beatle'' because he was content to leave most of the
spotlight to the songwriting duo of John Lennon and Paul McCartney.
After the band broke up in 1970, he embarked on a successful solo
career with the release of the single ``My Sweet Lord'' and a
number of albums, including ``Dark Horse.'' He became increasingly
interested in spirituality, giving up meat, rejecting the life of a
rock celebrity and often using a false name in his travels.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he collaborated again with Sir Paul to produce
the phenomenally successful Beatles Anthology, a series of albums
and videos. His marriage to the model Patti Boyd broke up in 1974
after she left him for his friend the musician Eric Clapton. He
married Olivia, the mother of his son, Dhani, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is obsessed with security and privacy, and admitted to
being seriously unsettled by Lennon's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened to John, I'm absolutely terrified,'' he
said in 194. He had reason to be worried: in 1990, he was sent a
series of death threats at home, and two years later, police found
an obsessed Beatles fan lurking around his house, apparently with
the intention of burning it down.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Harrison was discovered to have throat
cancer, which he attributed to many years of smoking. But the
condition was successfully treated with radiation therapy, and
Harrison said afterward that his doctors had called the growth on
his throat ``more of a warning than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of the attack, Sir Paul released a statement saying:
``Thank God both George and Olivia are all right. I send them all
my love.''
</P>
<P>
   From California, the other surviving Beatle, Ringo Starr, said
that he and his wife, Barbara Bach, were deeply shocked. ``We send
George and Olivia all our love and wish George a speedy recovery,''
he said.

SURGEON SAYS GROWTH REMOVED FROM TIPPER GORE'S THYROID WAS NOT
CANCEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after performing an operation to remove a
growth on Tipper Gore's thyroid gland, the doctor who performed the
surgery said Thursday that the growth was not cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipper Gore does not have thyroid cancer,'' Dr. Robert
Udelsman of Johns Hopkins Hospital said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Udelsman, chief of the division of surgical oncology and
endocrine surgery at Johns Hopkins, said that because the left side
of Mrs. Gore's thyroid remained intact, it was unlikely she would
need thyroid hormone replacement therapy. He said the vice
president's wife's condition would be monitored in the coming weeks
to make sure no deficiency in thyroid hormones developed.
</P>
<P>
   The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that wraps around the
front part of the windpipe. It produces hormones that regulate
important body functions like metabolism, heart rate, cholesterol
level, memory and muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   A deficiency in thyroid hormones, a condition known as
hypothyroidism, can cause a number of ailments, including
tiredness, forgetfulness, depression and unexpected weight gain. It
can easily be treated through thyroid replacement therapy, taken
daily as a pill.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found a growth on the right side of Mrs. Gore's thyroid
after she complained of neck pains. When a biopsy of the growth was
inconclusive, she underwent a two-hour operation on Tuesday called
a right thyroid lobectomy, which removed the right side of the
gland.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement made public Thursday, Udelsman said tests on the
growth showed it was a benign tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore was released from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon.

 &HT;    Many preparing, but very few panicking
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some shoppers armed themselves with guns and cash this
week. Others took solace in bottled water and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics have joined doomsayers in a last-minute rush to buy
supplies for any calamities that might start tonight when the
calendar flips to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really thought about it until I saw everyone else
buying things,'' said Decatur, Ga., resident Evonne White, who
bought three flashlights and batteries at a Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, I'm going to Publix to buy bottled water and
charcoal for the grill,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, jittery consumers snapped up batteries,
fuel, firewood and other emergency goods as the New Year crept
closer. But there were few signs of Y2K panic or hoarding,
retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one guy who bought enough barbed wire to wrap up his
entire house, but most people are just joking about it at this
stage,'' said Ben Gray, assistant manager of Intown Ace Hardware in
Decatur. ``The serious people bought their supplies during the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup survey in November found that about 45 percent of
Americans would make some kind of Y2K preparation. About 23 percent
of respondents said they'd buy extra food. About 18 percent planned
to stockpile water, and about 6 percent would buy a generator,
according to the survey of 1,010 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of home generators surged earlier this year but tapered
off until a small spike this week. In the first six months of 1999,
nearly 1 million electric generators were sold in the United
States, twice as many as all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree for generators was driven partly by fears that
computers might malfunction as a result of the so-called millennium
bug. Also, recent bad weather from storms such as Hurricane Floyd
helped to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although some retailers reported a few late-hour sales of
generators this week, most people stocked up on items they could
end up using if Y2K turns out to be a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batteries, flashlights and firewood are moving briskly,'' said
Don Harrison, spokesman for Home Depot. ``Sales definitely picked
up, but shoppers are not at a panic level.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Home Depot stores in Atlanta sold out of propane and
kerosene heaters. Similar reports of brisk sales came from Lowe's
Home Improvement Warehouse and other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   U-Haul International said its propane sales this week rose 30
percent over the same period a year ago. Atlanta area retailers
reported above-average sales of baby formula and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, people are buying as if there's a snowstorm coming,''
said Suzanne McCoy, a Lowe's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At some drugstores, Y2K customers faced longer lines than usual
at pharmacies as they stocked up on prescriptions. That's because
they ran into people with winter colds, plus people who had met
insurance plan deductibles and were refilling before the year's
over.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of the unknown moved some to stock up on firearms. Once
this week at Bernie's Sports Center in Norcross, Ga., people lined
up two hours before the doors opened to buy guns and ammunition,
said owner Bernie Esguerra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonstop. The place is packed with people,'' said
Esguerra, who noted that most customers said they were buying guns
for self-defense. Other gun shops reported a run on sales, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some ignored the last-minute Y2K rush altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends have been telling me to get cash out of the bank,
but money won't do much good if everything goes to heck and back,''
said Rick Edwards. ``If that happens, you better have a gun to
protect your property and a can of beans to barter with.''

 &HT;    South keeps eye on more domestic scenarios
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Around the South, law enforcement officials say they
will remain vigilant for would-be terrorists through the New Year's
weekend but admit they are breathing easier than their colleagues
guarding against violence at extravanganzas in New York and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They say they are worried much less about international
terrorism than about some white supremacist setting off a ``bubba
bomb'' for attention, but even the anti-government separatists
apparently are hunkering down against possible Y2K breakdowns and
pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who believe their power will fail, their
water won't run or they won't be able to get money out of their
ATM,'' said Bill Emfeld, special agent in charge of the FBI office
in Mobile, Ala., that serves 36 Alabama counties, including the
capital of Montgomery. ``They're worried that we'll get U.N. troops
to come in to restore order.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Joe Roy, director of the Intelligence Project of the
Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors Web sites of hate
groups, ``It's relatively quiet out there in cyberspace, but you
never know which individual might fall off the grid.''
</P>
<P>
   More typical of police worries are those in Charlotte, N.C.,
where for the first time the Uptown Downtown Countdown celebration
will include alcohol on the town square. Keith Bridges of the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said investigators have
been tracking dead-end tips about threats of violence ``but our
biggest concern is the crowds and drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, police have set up remote booking areas. ``If they
want to be drunk and disruptive, sadly for them they will wake up
in a new millennium behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Southern scene, police in New York were
pulling out all stops to guard against terrorism before the New
Year's ball drops in Times Square. Officials have ordered that area
be stripped of wastebaskets and parked cars and that manhole covers
be welded shut.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, perhaps the most drastic security measures are
being taken in Florida, where revelers will pass through metal
detectors to attend concerts by Blondie and the Gipsy Kings on
Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil Ramer with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
said the state expects a relatively tranquil millennium passage, in
part because its law enforcement officers are veterans at handling
both international visitors and big-time crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is used to drugs being smuggled for years, so our
(U.S.) Customs operations are tighter,'' he said. Ports of entry
are posted with dogs trained at sniffing out explosives and drugs.
Florida's international flights are limited mostly to Orlando and
Miami where security is extremely tight.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a tourist headed to the theme parks, Ramer says
you'll find model, futuristic security at Disney World, where the
doors will be closed behind visitors at 10 a.m. today. After that,
Ramer said, ``They'll let you out, but they're not letting anybody
else in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much security there,'' Ramer said. ``Have you
ever wondered why there's no trash in the containers at Disney
World? It's because it's sucked right up. There's a whole city
under Disney World where the employees go back and forth to work.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents in Alabama are among those across the nation on alert
for domestic terrorism activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two basic groups we're looking at, the radical
religious and the militias,'' said Ernfeld of the Mobile office.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI there has established contact with every police chief,
sheriff and emergency management agency via telephone or radio, he
said. A command center was launched Wednesday that is scheduled to
operate until Jan. 5 and telephone numbers will be available for
any possible problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for anything biological, chemical, radiological or
somebody getting to a power substation, and we will be able to
minimize the response time,'' Emfeld said. ``If your VCR keeps
blinking midnight, we even have a number for that.''

NEW YORK DOCTOR HAS HER FINGER ON THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With millions of eyes fixed on the 1,070-pound Waterford Crystal
ball atop One Times Square in New York City, few people may even
wonder who pushes the magic button that sinks the sphere precisely
at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But some folks in Milton, mass. have the scoop: One of their
own, Mary Ann Hopkins, is doing hand exercises and keeping her
pointer finger warm and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of excited that I'm going to be able to get very good
seats,'' said Hopkins, 36, who was raised in Milton, but now lives
in New York. She is a surgeon at Bellevue Hospital and New York
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Hopkins was spending her days in Burundi
treating countless gunshot and machete wounds. A volunteer with
Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres, which won the
1999 Nobel Peace Prize, Hopkins was chosen to represent the group
at Friday night's festivities in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Ann stands out in her own way. Her efforts throughout the
world are something we can all be inspired by,'' said Jeffrey
Straus, president of Countdown Entertainment, which represents One
Times Square, owners of the New Year's Eve ball. ``I think she and
Doctors Without Borders represent the fact that we've got to help
each other and reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old group, Doctors Without Borders is a worldwide
network of doctors, nurses, and support staff who voluntarily
provide medical care in nearly 90 countries. Hopkins has been on
two missions, to Sri Lanka in 1996 and most recently in Burundi in
late October.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of two doctors in a hospital in the southern part of
the country and the only surgeon. At one point, because of the
volume of gunshot and machete wounds, she had to teach the family
practitioner some basic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great pressure, but you also worry because your
Intensive Care Unit's are nonexistent. You don't have a CAT scan
machine. So much of the total patient care and getting a patient to
survive is on you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Long interested in developing nations, Hopkins worked at
Canadian-run orphanages in India and Somalia as a college student
with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was born in Cleveland but her family moved to Milton in
1970. Many excited friends and even a former speech teacher at
Milton Academy, which Hopkins graduated from in 1981, have called
her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all thrilled, they are just overwhelmed,'' Hopkins
said. ``My father couldn't stop laughing for the first half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents will join her in New York this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all thrilled and surprised and looking forward to it,''
said her mother Ann Hopkins. ``It's a wonderful surprise and I
can't imagine ever having it happen to one of us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, in fact, thought the call asking Mary Ann to do the
honors New Year's Eve was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins becomes part of a four-year New York tradition to honor
outstanding individuals by allowing them to push the button that
descends the ball and begins a new year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 17-year-old Chinese gymnast, Sang Lan, who was
paralyzed in the Goodwill Games, pushed the button. Before that,
five fourth-graders _ one from each New York City borough _ helped
celebrate the city's 100th anniversary by sending the ball down its
77-foot spire. And beginning the tradition was 88-year-old Osceola
McCarty, a laundress who donated her $150,000 life savings to the
University of Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said she is thrilled to be chosen as an
``anticelebrity'' who has given back to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Doctors Without Borders it's also a very exciting way that
we think we can increase awareness of all sorts of health needs
around the world . . . of how many people there are in need of
health care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a double dose of excitement, this will be the first time
since Hopkins moved to New York nine years ago she will attend New
Year's Eve festivities in Times Square. Mostly she has watched it
on television or attended a party _ or been on-call.
</P>
<P>
   But the honor of being the one who essentially drops the ball
isn't the most important thing, Hopkins stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think really it's to have the entire world see Medecins Sans
Frontieres up there and to see what our organization is about and
the spirit behind it,'' she said. ``I think that's the most
exciting thing.''

&HT;     STANFORD FANS SMELL THE ROSES FOR FIRST TIME IN 28 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It has been 28 years since Stanford has been
to the Rose Bowl. Despite the long wait, loyal fans never gave up
on the their football team.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Saturday's football game against Wisconsin a big deal
for the die-hards. Thousands of Stanford fans will travel to
Southern California for the Rose Bowl, while many others will
celebrate the historic happening at home or in bars or restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Wisconsin, which won the 1999 Rose Bowl, considered
the favorite and several key Stanford players injured, Stanford
sports fans will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call me a bandwagon fan, but I've been a Stanford fan
since 1991 when I moved here from Indiana,'' said Bill Mullen,
director of logistics at Old Navy in San Francisco. He won't be
able to attend the game because he'll be standing by in San
Francisco in case his clothing company has any computer glitches
associated with the rollover of the calendar from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for pharmacist Michael Ghiorso, a '59
Stanford grad, who lives north of Yosemite in Sonora. He, too, will
be on Y2K alert in case the hospital he works for has any problems
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So he's having friends over to watch the game on two 25-inch
television sets, instead of making the trip to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this in 1971 at somebody else's house,'' Ghiorso said.
``We're going to have food, drinks and watch the game.''
</P>
<P>
   John Place will be taking his wife and two daughters to the
Tournament of Roses parade, then the game.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a teen-ager, Place sold ice-cold sodas at the
Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to carry this big heavy aluminum tray around my neck,''
said Place, a 1985 Stanford law school graduate who now works for
Yahoo, the Internet search engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, the beefy aluminum (Pepsi) cans were heavy and
the tray was filled with ice. I'd get soaking wet as the ice
melted.''
</P>
<P>
   At each game, Place could make at least $20 for three hours
work. He also got to see the game which sent Stanford to the Rose
Bowl, a 24-14 win over the University of Southern California in
1970. One year later, Stanford again got to go to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole place was rocking,'' Place, 45, said. ``I've been to
a lot of sporting events, including the World Series interrupted by
the earthquake _ but nothing compares to the Stanford-USC game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans weren't even alive the last time Stanford made it to
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime,'' said
Gina Lee, 24, a merchandise planner for Old Navy in San Francisco
who graduated from Stanford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lee organized a New Year's Eve-Millennium-Stanford-Rose Bowl
party and invited 25 Stanford alums she either went to school with
in the 1990s, or met later.
</P>
<P>
   After partying into the new millennium, Lee and her friends
intend to board a bus to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a bond between Stanford alums,'' she said.
``There's an energy particularly with our sports teams, which
allows everyone to come together when the teams achieve success.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco ticket brokers are reporting that most of their
sales for the Rose Bowl are to Wisconsin fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone doesn't stop ringing with Wisconsin fans wanting to
buy tickets and Stanford people selling them,'' said Larry Smith
with Golden Gate Tickets. ``It shows you how much bigger fans the
Wisconsin people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets average $150 for seats near the 5-yard line and $400 for
40- or 50-yard-line seats in good rows.

&HT;     HEIGHTENED SECURITY SEEN AT NATIONAL NEW YEAR'S SITE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While English crooner Tom Jones practiced his
classic song ``It's Not Unusual'' on the National Mall Thursday,
security officers scanned the two-mile-long site for anything
remotely unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of White House preparations for a star-studded
New Year's Eve celebration amid heightened concern here in the wake
of the arrest of a suspected terrorist earlier this month on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   To make the security agents' job easier, the U.S. Park Police
has fenced off a stretch of the Mall running from the Washington
Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, where 200,000 people are expected
to show up for the millennium extravaganza Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leaning over the fence by the (memorial's) Reflecting
Pool to see what was going on, and the next thing I know a police
officer popped out from the trees and told me to back away,'' said
tourist Michael Bolt of Cincinnati, Ohio. ``It didn't bother me
since I figured it was probably a good thing that people are
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI has said it has received no specific threats
against targets here, law enforcement agencies around the country
have been on high alert for a possible act of terror since the Dec.
14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam. The Algerian man was charged with taking
bomb-making materials into Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada. In
addition, federal prosecutors on Thursday linked Ressam with a
Canadian woman, Lucia Garofalo, arrested Dec. 19 at a remote
Vermont border crossing and charged with illegally entering the
United States with an Algerian man accused of using a false
passport.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of an attack has led law enforcement agencies in the
nation's capital to set up unprecedented security measures for the
White House's ``Millennium Gala'' on the Mall. The event will
feature some of America's most famous artists and actors, as well
as President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had to deal with this kind of
celebration with this many stars and politicians and with such a
threat of a possible attack,'' said Sgt. Rob MacLean, U.S. Park
Police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument looked like a cross between an outdoor rock
concert and a minimum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the Lincoln Memorial, construction workers building
the stage and bleachers for the show gingerly avoided police dogs
sniffing for explosives. On the street, groups of flannel-wearing
welders stood beside groups of men in dark suits and sunglasses
with wires coming out of their ears. And watching all of it from on
top of the memorial were several men in black uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But many among the hundreds of tourists watching the
celebration's preparations seemed pleased by the security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that they need so many police, but I'm glad they're
here,'' said Michelle Farland of Nashville, Tenn., who added that
she would be on Mall on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Lubbecker, who traveled from Darmstadt, Germany, to be
in the United States for New Year's Eve, said the possibility of a
terrorist attack would not keep him away from the celebration.
``You do not fly across the ocean to sit in a hotel room,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said Park Police officers already are on round-the-clock
patrols in the areas where the president and his guests will appear
during the New Year's Eve celebration. Police also will shut off
access to the Vietnam Veterans and Korean War memorials _ both of
which are located near the Reflecting Pool _ on Friday to allow the
sniffing dogs to sweep the entire area.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean also said the streets immediately around the Mall will
be closed Friday and that people attending the celebration will
have to pass through checkpoints. Officers also will be looking
inside coolers, backpacks and any other packages that could conceal
a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C.'s police and the Park Police have said they
will have nearly every officer and agent on duty that evening. The
city's force has more than 3,600 officers and the Park Police have
about 500 officers in the Washington area. The Secret Service also
will be out in force guarding the president, but that agency would
not disclose its numbers on duty.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the security forces, about 300 National Guard soldiers
will be working in shifts around the clock from Friday through
Sunday. The troops will be at 150 locations throughout the city,
directing traffic and helping with crowd control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If all goes well on New Year's Eve, a daylong celebration will
begin at 11 a.m. on Friday with performances on the Mall by youth
choirs, the U.S. Marine Corps Band and other performers. The
president and first lady will unveil the ``National Millennium Time
Capsule,'' containing artifacts representing America at the end of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., the Clintons will host a dinner for 1,000 invited
guests at the White House. A select 320 _ including Elizabeth
Taylor, Robert De Niro and Muhammed Ali _ will sit down with the
first couple in the White House. The rest, including many members
of Congress, will dine in a heated tent in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Clintons and 500 guests will go to the Lincoln
Memorial for a three-hour ``America's Millennium Gala,'' which will
be televised live on CBS with actor-rapper Will Smith as the host.
</P>
<P>
   The gala will include entertainment by Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the
25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected
beside the Lincoln Memorial will show an 18-minute film, ``The
Unfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton will speak briefly and set off the evening's
pyrotechnic extravaganza. He will light a fuse that will burn its
way along the length of the Reflecting Pool, ending at the base of
the Washington Monument, now surrounded by an elaborate scaffold
because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Finally,10 successive bursts of brilliant white stars will rain
down the sides of the monument. At midnight, the entire monument
will be covered with ``a stunningly beautiful waterfall'' of white
pyrotechnics, said Philip Butler, who is producing the show for
Fireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, N.Y., company.
</P>

Friday through Sunday Washington is available at

&HT;     U.S, RUSSIANS CONDUCT Y2K MISSILE WARNING MISSIONS  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ Russian and American military crews
overcame a minor glitch Thursday as they wound up their first shift
at a special center designed to ensure that Y2K computer snafus
don't lead to an accidental launch of a nuclear missile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem involving a telephone ``hot line'' was blamed on
human rather that technological error.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cold War foes began 24-hour operations Thursday
morning in the so-called Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability,
a $4.5 million facility that allows both sides to observe missile
warning information collected from U.S. radar and satellites. The
facility is housed at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs,
headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and U.S. officers said that except for trouble with the
hot line to Moscow, the first shifts went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small glitch did not affect our work,'' said Col. Pavel
Saltanov, one of 20 Russian officers conducting the operations with
18 American personnel through mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Michael Luginbuhl, the senior U.S. officer at the Y2K
center, said that the hot line failed to ring in Moscow during a
final test. The line provides the Russian crews with direct and
secure communication to Moscow in time of nuclear crisis. Luginbuhl
said the problem was decidedly low-tech: someone had turned off the
ringer in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Sergey Kaplin, an air force officer and chief of the
Russian military delegation, added that ``it was the only glitch
and it lasted approximately two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had difficulties resolving hot line problems in the
months leading up to the New Year. In October, for example, six of
seven such hot line links failed Y2K tests, with most of the
problems occurring in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Y2K command post is not to detect a missile
attack against the United States. Rather, it is designed to
reassure Moscow that U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia, if that
is what aging Soviet-era military computers incorrectly indicate
because of a Y2K computer glitch. Russian officials maintain that
their key military computers are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   In order not to compound any potential Y2K problems, U.S.
officials here said that most countries with missile capabilities
have agreed to a moratorium on all launches of scientific and
military rockets through mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian crews will pay particularly close attention
to two time zones as Jan. 1 dawns. The first is 4 p.m. EST. Friday,
which is midnight in Moscow. Most of Russia's radar network,
satellites and missiles are keyed to Moscow's clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The second time zone of concern is 7 p.m. EST, midnight
Greenwich Mean Time. All key U.S. strategic weapons and their
computers are pegged to GMT.
</P>
<P>
   But Luginbuhl added that any potential computer problem might
take a while to materialize, perhaps several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts say there is the potential that computers and
software originally programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the
machines will assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K center at Peterson is a non-descript one-floor building
with a view of the Rocky Mountains. Except for the occasional
Russian officer wearing a Siberian winter fur hat entering the
building, the facility looks like any other U.S. military building.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center looks something like the bridge on the
television series ``Star Trek.'' At the front of a room, which is
about the size of a large boardroom, are three large projection
screens. The screens depict color maps of the world, various time
zones and the location of foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the large screens are two rows of light blue modular
office furniture, each with three large computer terminals, on
which are displayed real-time U.S. missile warning data. At each
terminal are a Russian officer, a U.S. officer, and an interpreter.
Each side also has a commanding officer on duty during the
eight-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian crews maintain direct contact with officials in
Moscow's early warning missile center by means of a black
telephone. The U.S. officers also have a hot line that provides
direct communication to commanders inside the nearby Cheyenne
Mountain Operations Center of the U.S. Space Command. During the
Cold War's superpower standoff, the Cheyenne Mountain center was
the headquarters of American efforts to detect Soviet missile
attack.
</P>
<P>
   On one wall of the center are clocks showing GMT and the time in
Moscow, Washington and Tonga in the Pacific, which is in the first
time zone to see Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that U.S. radar detects a missile launch, the
computer screens will display for the crews the location of the
launch, the altitude of the missile, the expected trajectory, point
of impact and time until impact.

PARTY CITY USA WONDERS WHERE THE REVELERS ARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Barbra did it. So did Bette and the Bellagio. Other
top-name entertainers and even budget motels adopted the pricing
plan, too.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Y2K was just a whisper, and resort cities everywhere
were expecting sell-out crowds, they set exorbitant rates for rooms
and shows over the New Year's weekend. Streisand's best seats cost
$2,500, Midler's $500. The Bellagio Hotel is charging $2,000 a
night for rooms that normally go for $159 to $499.
</P>
<P>
   With the countdown to what is being billed as the new millennium
down to hours, space is still available. And the latecomers are
getting bargains that no one _ not the hotels, not their guests _
expected to usher in the next century. Even Elton John and Tina
Turner, in concert together, haven't sold out yet. Quickie weddings
are also expected to be off this weekend, typically one of the
busiest for the chapels and casinos that dot the 24-hour-a-day
destination known as the Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, America's party hearty palace, has unexpectedly come
to symbolize concerns over the New Year and the nation's sudden
stay-at-home attitude toward the hoopla. While the celebration will
go on as planned, with hundreds of thousands of people expected on
the Strip, the people staying away this year are the ones who put
the city in sync with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Greg Smith, owner of the Little Church of the West, which
boasts that more celebrities have been married there than anywhere
else, put it, ``The rates on the Strip all year discouraged people.
Then there's all this Y2K hysteria. A lot of people have to work
this New Year's. And people just aren't traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimates from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority indicate that the number of out-of-town visitors will be
down 9 percent from last year, to 240,000. Ten days ago, hotels
reported being 85 percent full for New Year's weekend, although
with rates plummeting (from $900 a night several months ago to $399
now at the MGM Grand, for instance) and three-night minimums
voided, their occupancy rates are expected to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Room rates) are changing minute to minute,'' said Authority
spokeswoman Myram Borders. ``We have to wait and see whether it'll
be a disappointment. By New Year's Eve, it could be jammed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the gamblers who caused traffic jams at hotel
check-in counters Thursday are betting that Y2K will be no big
deal. Although some expressed fears about terrorism, if not in Las
Vegas than somewhere else in the United States, none worried about
being left without lights or automated slot machines, since the
casinos have back-up generators. And in a world where the
all-you-can-eat buffet rules, the hotel casinos are stocked with
enough food to feed people for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hospital where I work, they did a lot of extra stuff
because they think it's going to be a big disaster,'' said Heather
Irwin, a nurse from Nottingham, England. ``Most people here are
just out for a good party.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, precautions are being taken in Las Vegas, as they are in
other major cities where crowds are expected to swell the streets.
Unlike most other cities, however, Las Vegas is always a madhouse
on New Year's Eve, not to mention much of the rest of the year.
Security is always tight when stars perform or boxing title
contenders fight.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Las Vegas police will be out in force, with all
vacations and other time off canceled for the night of all nights.
Plainclothes officers will be on the street in standard-issue
uniform. Covert ``videographers'' will patrol the Strip, according
to police spokesman Steven Meriwether. Suspicious characters will
be stopped and questioned. Last year, with the crowd estimated at
300,000, there were 96 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is special this year, but we do this on a yearly basis and
we always plug in the terrorist threat,'' Meriwether said. ``So for
us, it's not something out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The precautions _ not the fear of violence _ have actually sent
some people packing. Theresa Nacka, a dental lab technician's
assistant from British Columbia, had planned to stay through the
weekend with her two children, ages 11 and 14. Then she heard about
the 6 p.m. curfew on the Strip for youths under 18 and decided to
go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We canceled the last day because our families were worried
about us flying out on New Year's Day and then there's the
curfew,'' said Nacka, who, along with her husband, paid $664 a
night in advance for a room at the Luxor Hotel that cost $59 for
walk-ins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Others are worried about getting home, too. One cab driver
complained that all he saw were cars with license plates from other
states, visitors who chose to drive to Las Vegas rather than risk
flying. John Harden, a building contractor, said he would have
driven the eight hours from Fairfield, Calif., anyway, but that
NASA's decision to park the space shuttle only reinforced his
decision. As he explained, ``If NASA doesn't want it up there, only
a moron would fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his friend, real estate saleswoman Val Innarello, ``If
something's going to happen, it's going to happen. You can't do
anything about it. But, no, I wouldn't fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainer Adarra Winters has her own worries, although not
enough to stop her from choosing Las Vegas's sunshine and 65-degree
weather over the cold back home in Columbus, Ohio. Describing
herself as ``somewhat religious,'' she said she fears someone will
open fire in a Vegas nightclub. Worse yet, she added, ``I'm worried
about the end of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Winters's biggest worry is deciding where to
spend New Year's Eve, which party to attend at what hotel. She said
she wants to be where the action is. Otherwise, why play the odds
by being away from home when the clock strikes midnight in the city
without clocks.

REMEMBERING WEALTH: LIFE IN POST-CRASH SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My New Year's Resolution is to file my columns early. This one
was written 10 years before deadline.
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, CALIF., Dec. 30, 2009 _ Only a decade ago, the Silicon
Valley of California was viewed as technology's promised land, a
place where bungalows cost $1 million and even the youngest
computer programmer had stock options that seemed likely to be
worth millions soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, years after the Internet crash of 2003, it has become a
region of jealousies and recriminations. Working relationships were
poisoned when employees learned that top executives secretly hedged
their positions, and thus did not suffer. Banks sued formerly
wealthy entrepreneurs, saying they hid assets to avoid paying their
debts.
</P>
<P>
   All that has happened even though many of the Valley's
technology companies remain very successful, and the Internet-based
economy continues to gain at the expense of the older
bricks-and-mortar economy. But few of the companies have lived up
to the high expectations that were factored into stock prices
before they fell. Many of the highest fliers have vanished from the
landscape, either going out of business or being acquired by
competitors for a fraction of the prices their shares once fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors, employees scarred by the collapsing value
of their stock options now prefer the certainty of higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fate of the once-bountiful stock options that has most
determined the current pecking order in Silicon Valley. At the top
are those who cashed in their options before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Next come those who worked for companies that prospered. Their
salaries have helped to offset the paper losses, and many companies
repriced their options after prices fell, thus saving some value
for the employees, before angry shareholders forced a halt to that
practice.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom, and perhaps the largest group, are those who did
not cash out and whose companies were not among the winners. While
many of them landed jobs at other companies, their wealth has
vanished and some have lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Housing prices fell sharply after the options lost value, and
have only recently begun to recover. Some financial institutions
were severely damaged when loans secured by stock options became
uncollectible.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable jealousies reflect the seeming randomness of
success and failure. There are tales of employees who did poor jobs
but ended up rich, while their more competent and creative
neighbors went bankrupt. Younger engineers are angry that they have
no chance for the quick wealth their elders gained and are scornful
of those who lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the effect on the economy has not been as great as
was feared. While some other regions with big stakes in the
Internet economy were hurt, most notably Seattle and New York City,
the effect on most of the country was limited.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers cut back, but not by as much as was expected
considering the declining value of investment portfolios. Growth
since 2003 has been far higher than it was in Japan in the years
after that country's bubble burst in 1990. In part, that was
because American nontechnology stocks were not nearly as
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have grown much more cautious. That is reflected in
the diminished amount of capital available for start-ups, and in
other ways as well. Even Microsoft, which became the world's most
valuable company long before it paid its first dividend in 2004,
now finds that it must raise its payout every year to attract
investors.

   &UR; Y2K CZAR PREDICTS FEW Y2K COMPUTER GLITCHES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.1999 Hearst Newspapers &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House's chief Y2K coordinator confidently
predicted Thursday that the rollover into the 2000 new year won't
bring major computer glitches in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   `This didn't happen by accident,'' said John Koskinen, the Y2K
chief, attributing the apparent lack of major Y2K problems to hard
work and billions of dollars invested by governments and the
private sector around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With a smooth transition in sight, Koskinen defended himself
against suggestions that the whole Y2K episode was a gross
exaggeration blown out of proportion by government safety officials
and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see some of the indications already arising where
people say, `Well, it was a lot of hype,''' Koskinen said. ``It was
not a lot of hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Koskinen said the Y2K threat ``has been a serious,
critical, major challenge to world systems that has been dealt with
for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned that the real Y2K test won't come until
Monday, Jan. 3, when millions of businesses and schools reopen
after the holiday weekend and use computers for the first time
since the millenium rollover.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects some ``minor hiccups or glitches'' in the
United States related to Y2K, but repeated his assessment that
large national or regional problems were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are doing as well as we are is a tribute to
the effort that's gone into it by the people who are actually
responsible for those (computer) systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's known as the Y2K problem stems from old computer
programming that expressed dates with two digits rather than four
digits to save space. This practice gave rise to fears that the
digits ``00'' would be interpreted by computers as the year 1900
rather than 2000. In turn, this could cause the computers to crash,
disrupting the financial, transportation, health-care industries
and other sectors dependent on date-sensitive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   To preclude such calamities, governments and private industry
have spent more than $100 billion upgrading their computers to
properly read the digits ``00'' as 2000. Private computer
consulting firms estimate that private industry and governments
around the world have spent close to $400 billion to prevent
potential Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said retailers and banks were reporting no unusual
changes in buying habits of food or gasoline or that people were
withdrawing large amounts of cash, as some bankers had once feared.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen predicted that stores would become crowded in the final
hours as consumers stocked up ond-water, batteries and food
for private New Year's Eve parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers continue to show more and more people are(going
to) celebrate at home with friends,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released Thursday showed that 71
percent of Americans surveyed had no special plans for the weekend
and that 66 percent of them were unlikely to take any special
precautions to guard against any Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has encouraged people to have enough food
and water on hand for three days as well as to pu
flashlights, batteries and a battery-powered radio. But opinion
polls show that more Americans seem to be concerned about
terrorism. The same USA Today poll showed that 61 percent of those
surveyed say a terrorist attack against the United States was very
likely or somewhat likely on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen will be the official U.S. Y2K spokesman during New
Year's weekend, providing regular briefings beginning at noon EST
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen coordinates a federal government command post that will
track any computer-related glitches around the world, beginning
with New Zealand, which becomes the first sizable country to move
into the New Year, turning past midnight at 6 a.m. EST on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not much is going on by the time we get to the middle of
the afternoon tomorrow, I think that will give us some increased
confidence that not much is going to happen here,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts say the United States and most other
developed countries were well prepared for the rollover into the
New Year. Some undeveloped countries may experience major
disruptions, such as failed electric power grids.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen warned that such events might not surface until later
in January because it takes time for problems in complex computer
systems to build up and cause a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Thursday, most federal agencies continued testing
their computers to see how well they will function on Jan. 1 and
beyond. The Federal Aviation Administration made last-minute
repairs to computers that process radar data and send it to air
traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   FAA Administrator Jane Garvey described the problem as a ``very,
very minor issue.'' But the union representing FAA employees _ the
Professional Airways Systems Specialists _ charged that the
computer problem was a bigger deal and ``nearly put passenger lives
in jeopardy.'' The union is currently in contract negotiations with
the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency assigned staffers to all
50 states and five territories to help respond to any large-scale
emergencies caused by possible Y2K computer problems. As is
normally the case in natural disasters such as hurricanes, FEMA
would only be called in after a state's governor asked President
Clinton to declare a federal disaster area.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY SEEN AT NATIONAL NEW YEAR'S SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While English crooner Tom Jones practiced his
classic song ``It's Not Unusual'' on the National Mall Thursday,
security officers scanned the two-mile-long site for anything
remotely unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of White House preparations for a star-studded
New Year's Eve celebration amid heightened concern here in the wake
of the arrest ofected terrorist earlier this month on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   To make the security agents' job easier, the U.S. Park Police
has fenced off a stretch of the Mall running from the Washington
Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, where 200,000 people are expected
to show up for the millennium extravaganza Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leaning over the fence by the (memorial's) Reflecting
Pool to see what was going on, and the next thing I know a police
officer popped out from the trees and told me to back away,'' said
tourist Michael Bolt of Cincinnati, Ohio. ``It didn't bother me
since I figured it was probably a good thing that people are
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI has said it has received no specific threats
against targets here, law enforcement agencies around the country
have been on high alert for a possible act of terror since the Dec.
14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam. The Algerian man was charged with taking
bomb-making materials into Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada. In
addition, federal prosecutors on Thursday linked Ressam with a
Canadian woman, Lucia Garofalo, arrested Dec. 19 at a remote
Vermont border crossing and charged with illegally entering the
United States with an Algerian man accused of using a false
passport.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of an attack has led law enforcement agencies in the
nation's capital to set up unprecedented security measures for the
White House's ``Millennium Gala'' on the Mall. The event will
feature some of America's most famous artists and actors, as well
as President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had to deal with this kind of
celebration with this many stars and politicians and with such a
threat of a possible attack,'' said Sgt. Rob MacLean, U.S. Park
Police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument looked like a cross between an outdoor rock
concert and a minimum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the Lincoln Memorial, construction workers building
the stage and bleachers for the show gingerly avoided police dogs
sniffing for explosives. On the street, groups of flannel-wearing
welders stood beside groups of men in dark suits and sunglasses
with wires coming out of their ears. And watching all of it from on
top of the memorial were several men in black uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But many among the hundreds of tourists watching the
celebration's preparations seemed pleased by the security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that they need so many police, but I'm glad they're
here,'' said Michelle Farland of Nashville, Tenn., who added that
she would be on Mall on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Lubbecker, who traveled from Darmstadt, Germany, to be
in the United States for New Year's Eve, said the possibility of a
terrorist attack would not keep him away from the celebration.
``You do not fly across the ocean to sit in a hotel room,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said Park Police officers already are on round-the-clock
patrols in the areas where the president and his guests will appear
during the New Year's Eve celebration. Police also will shut off
access to the Vietnam Veterans and Korean War memorials _ both of
which are located near the Reflecting Pool _ on Friday to allow the
sniffing dogs to sweep the entire area.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean also said the streets immediately around the Mall will
be closed Friday and that people attending the celebration will
have to pass through checkpoints. Officers also will be looking
inside coolers, backpacks and any other packages that could conceal
a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C.'s police and the Park Police have said they
will have nearly every officer and agent on duty that evening. The
city's force has more than 3,600 officers and the Park Police have
about 500 officers in the Washington area. The Secret Service also
will be out in force guarding the president, but that agency would
not disclose its numbers on duty.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the security forces, about 300 National Guard soldiers
will be working in shifts around the clock from Friday through
Sunday. The troops will be at 150 locations throughout the city,
directing traffic and helping with crowd control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If all goes well on New Year's Eve, a daylong celebration will
begin at 11 a.m. on Friday with performances on the Mall by youth
choirs, the U.S. Marine Corps Band and other performers. The
president and first lady will unveil the ``National Millennium Time
Capsule,'' containing artifacts representing America at the end of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., the Clintons will host a dinner for 1,000 invited
guests at the White House. A select 320 _ including Elizabeth
Taylor, Robert De Niro and Muhammed Ali _ will sit down with the
first couple in the White House. The rest, including many members
of Congress, will dine in a heated tent in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Clintons and 500 guests will go to the Lincoln
Memorial for a three-hour ``America's Millennium Gala,'' which will
be televised live on CBS with actor-rapper Will Smith as the host.
</P>
<P>
   The gala will include entertainment by Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the
25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected
beside the Lincoln Memorial will show an 18-minute film, ``The
Unfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton will speak briefly and set off the evening's
pyrotechnic extravaganza. He will light a fuse that will burn its
way along the length of the Reflecting Pool, ending at the base of
the Washington Monument, now surrounded by an elaborate scaffold
because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Finally,10 successive bursts of brilliant white stars will rain
down the sides of the monument. At midnight, the entire monument
will be covered with ``a stunningly beautiful waterfall'' of white
pyrotechnics, said Philip Butler, who is producing the show for
Fireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, N.Y., company.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the events and performances on the Mall from
Friday through Sunday Washington is available at

an accident at his home. Over the next three years he would have 30

the months he spent away from home at a hospital in Pulaski was his
first exposure to he world outside of tiny Fancy Gap, Va. It was

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to the limousine business, Vini Bergeman is a
legend. He has stretched vehicles from Lamborghinis to Lincoln
Navigators for celebrity clients like Mike Tyson and Sylvester
Stallone. His company, Ultra Coachbuilders of Corona, Calif., is
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having built the
world's longest limousine, a 105-footer with a putting green in the
middle and a Jacuzzi in the back.
</P>
<P>
   But at a recent limousine-trade gathering in Atlantic City,
N.J., Bergeman was prohibited from displaying his latest
masterwork, a super-stretch Hummer military vehicle, on the
showroom floor at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort. He had to park
it outside, because it had not yet been submitted to new
industry-enforced safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention hall, Bergeman stood at his booth and
defended his creation, which sells for about $225,000 and includes,
as standard features, a bed, two television sets and a microwave
oven. ``We probably have the safest car manufactured in this
country,'' he said. ``Besides, we're artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many in the limousine industry profess to having little
appreciation for Bergeman's kind of art. Riding a wave of
unprecedented growth, the industry is trying to promote a more
sober image directly at odds with Bergeman's traveling hot tubs.
What once was a vehicle for flashy Hollywood types is now a handy
tool for the masses _ a case of vicarious consumption becoming
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s and early '90s, people viewed the limousine
industry as being somewhat exclusive,'' said Ric Cohen, publisher
of Limousine Digest magazine. ``But today the limousine is the
common man's vehicle to avoid drinking and driving, to avoid the
hassles of rush-hour traffic or to drive to and from a sporting
event or a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Limousines have become a worldwide business with annual revenues
approaching $5 billion, including sales and rentals. Limousine
builders have been reporting annual revenue growth of 15 to 20
percent for the last five years. And two limousine operators, Carey
International and Precept Business Services, recently went public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our industry's golden age,'' said Scott Salombrino,
president of Dav El Chauffeured Transportation, the nation's
largest privately owned limousine operator.
</P>
<P>
   The limousine business has responded to the boom by going to
charm school. These days, the emphasis is on courtesy and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, you went to one of these shows and everyone was
in satin jackets,'' said Carl Geiger, an operator based in Atlantic
City and a board member of the National Limousine Association.
``Now everybody's in suit jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   While funerals, weddings and proms are still staples of the
limousine rental market, the strongest growth has been among
corporate clients, who are more likely to become repeat customers.
Manufacturers and operators are encouraging the use of limousines
for business travel by pointing to their practical benefits, like
the safety of having someone else do the driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often not only more efficient but more cost-effective to
send three or four executives in the back of a limousine _ with
their luggage safely tucked in the trunk _ to the airport as
opposed to three or four taxis,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing affordability of wireless communications systems
has helped spur the industry's growth. Even small rental agencies _
about 80 percent of limousine operators have fleets of just 5 to 10
cars _ can offer a professional level of service and response time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new interactive devices, not only do you guarantee
that the call gets to the driver, but you know when he gets it,
because you get a delivery receipt.'' said Jeffrey Thorson,
president of Paragon Systems, maker of a two-way communication
system.
</P>
<P>
   Even limousine construction has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, limousines were mainly the realm of mechanics and
auto-body specialists, who often owned and operated vehicles they
assembled. Twenty-five years ago, Cadillac began building
limousines on its own assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   These days, stretch work is done by independent builders, with
Lincoln-Mercury and Cadillac, the two main manufacturers, selling a
``base unit'' sedan for the livery trade. Lincoln-Mercury has 65
percent of the market in the United States, with Cadillac at 30
percent. The industry produces 6,000 stretch vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   To stretch a car, the builders slice a s half with a
mechanical saw and insert a segment that extends the chassis by 6
to 120 inches. About 20 builders nationwide are certified to do the
work.
</P>
<P>
   To stay under warranty, the builder must turn out a car that
conforms to weights and lengths set by the automaker and the
Limousine Industry Manufacturers Organization, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Limousines that are stretched longer than authorized by the auto
makers, as well as those made by companies other than
Lincoln-Mercury and Cadillac _ like Bergeman's Hummer _ must endure
crash tests to get the industry's stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, builders could stretch cars to almost any
length. Now industry publications will not accept advertising from
limousine builders that have not been certified, and trade shows
will not display their vehicles. Bergeman of Ultra, who has been in
business for 28 years, says the practice in effect prevents small
compike his from competing with bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   Another stretch builder, Bob Haswell, has filed an antitrust
suit in U.S. District Court in Springfield, Mo., against Ford
Motor, General Motors and members of the limousine association. The
main reason the automakers started the programs, said Gregory Beck,
director of engineering for Krystal Enterprises of Brea, Calif.,
the nation's largest manufacturer of stretch limousines and a
member of the association, was to force the industry to comply with
previously unenforced federal safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeman, pointing to a white Lincoln that he stretched to 34
feet long, said he had to spend $250,000 to crash-test its
prototype, because it exceeded the maximum approved length. ``And
they still didn't want the car in the show,'' he said. ``I had to
bring in hundreds of pages of documentation to prove it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the Missouri suit's outcome, it is unlikely that
the industry will change its course radically. For one, specialty
stretch vehicles account for only 5 percent of limousine sales.
Moreover, safety concerns are unlikely to dissipate. A few
high-profile accidents, like the 1997 crash of a stretch Lincoln
that seriously injured Vladimir Konstantinov of the Detroit Red
Wings hockey team, have been a public-relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The industry faces other hurdles. Barry Lefkowitz, a lobbyist
for limousine owners, said that in many states, local taxi
commissions ban limousines from transporting passengers over state
lines without an expensive permit. Limousines from New Jersey, for
example, at certain hours may drop off passengers at New York
airports, but may not pick up passengers for the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission in New York
said it could not vouch for the safety of vehicles it does not
regulate. But Lefkowitz said: ``The law has nothing to do with
safety. It's just a quick and dirty way to make money.''

PREPAREDNESS SPECIALISTS READY FOR THE ULTIMATE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight's the night. After years of preparation, midnight is the
moment businesses and government organizations around the world
will face a key test of their efforts to stave off the computer
software glitch known as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect blackouts or major disruptions come Jan. 1, 2000. But
in a worst-case scenario, Mark O'Leary will be the man to see if
you live in Holbrook, Mass. O'Leary is general manager of Taylor
Oil Co. and, as any student of post-apocalyptic movies like ``The
Road Warrior'' can u, in such situations power accrues to
those with the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday O'Leary was busy taking calls from the Massachusetts
Water Resources Authority, several highway depots, and other
organizations ordering up last-minute diesel deliveries in case
they need to run back-up generators.
</P>
<P>
   Most state agencies were supposed to have wrapped up their Y2K
preparations in June. But despite the last-minute rush to top off
tanks, O'Leary, whose company is one of the largest fuel suppliers
to the state government, believes there will be few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what will happen depends on the utilities, and I'm of
the opinion they've done their homework,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   New England's main power and telecommunications providers echo
that and say most services will operate through the date change.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they do, a hard Y2K landing seems unlikely. But like
other service providers around the country, Boston Edison, New
England Electric, and other suppliers say they can't make specific
promises about whose lights will stay on.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting uncertainty has made Y2K a political and
managerial problem as much as a technical one.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether many small problems could add up to serious
disruptions. Midnight will first arrive on the International Date
Line in the Pacific Ocean at 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. But its
arrival one hour later in the industrialized nation of New Zealand
will first draw the attention of television networks, business
newswires, and government officials, all anxious to see if key
infrastructure systems work as designed.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vulnerable are an estimated 70 billion computer
chips embedded in everything from credit-card readers to cardiac
defibrillators. If left unfixed, as some will surely be, many of
these chips could fail to recognize the unfamiliar digits of the
new year and could cause devices to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be watching anywhere we hear reports of debit-card
terminals or ATMs that may not work, or Web sites having
difficulty,'' said Jim Shepker, spokesman for FleetBoston
Financial, which has extensive operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The midnight deadline isn't everything; by some estimates the
window for problems related to Y2K will last well into the first
quarter of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems stemming from Y2K have already turned up, though
none were life-threatening. In October, about 2,000 new-car owners
in Maine received registrations for their ``horseless carriages''
after a computer wrongly assumed the vehicles dated from 1900. This
week in London, thousands of small retailers were unable to process
credit-card purchases after problems with a payment system.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of managing public expectations, however, getting
through midnight smoothly has become a central goal. Throughout
Boston's financial district and suburban office parks, thousands of
computer technicians will observe midnight on duty, bathed in the
soft glow of monitor screens. The head of the Federal Aviation
Administration, Jane Garvey, plans to fly across the country to
show the world that the air-traffic control system is safe.
</P>
<P>
   All the steps are meant to encourage public confidence and to
discourage hoarding, which itself could prove disruptive. ``One of
the largest remaining challenges we face is not compliance or
readiness, but rather the public's perception of such things,''
said Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd, vice chairman of the
Senate's special Y2K committee, in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say all the attention to calming fears has been
counterproductive in terms of readiness. Nationwide, only 15 to 20
percent of households have set aside the several days worth of
extra food and water that planners suggest, and the figure may be
only a little higher in Massachusetts, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Beach, publisher of CIO magazine in Boston, said he is
``disappointed'' that neither President Clinton nor Vice President
Al Gore has been more outspoken about preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have could raised the awareness issues when it was
needed, a year ago, and we could have had more households'' ready
for power and water outages, Beach said. ``Nobody knows how
dominoes will fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Beach said too few utilities have been
willing to release the internal audits they have commissioned of
their readiness work. Many small businesses also seem unprepared,
and relatively little data is available about the readiness of
chemical-manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Beach said he isn't so concerned that massive
problems will crop up Friday night. ``The bottom-line outlook is
that there are going to be Y2K problems, and maybe 85 percent of
them are going to be annoyances that are fixable in a day,'' he
said. ``The probability of having a catastrophic event happen near
you is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Washington yestersday, President
Clinton's top Y2K aide, John Koskinen, ran down a list of sectors _
government, telecommunications, energy, finance, and transportation
_ and said there have been no major problems to report.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, said Koskinen, are consumers rushing out to stock up on
gasoline, food, drugs, or other necessities, echoing reports from
large retailers in New England. And banks, he said, may even wind
up with an excess of cash on hand because Americans have not been
lining up to withdraw their money, as some had feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reports of any changes of any significance in
consumer buying habits,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the optimistic scenario holds true through midnight,
attention will turn to the outlook for companies opening for
business on Monday, Jan. 3. Will many small glitches add up to
something significant?
</P>
<P>
   In November, CIO's Beach surveyed computer specialists with the
help of Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown and one of the earliest voices of concern over Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found what they called ``widespread optimism
based on little hard evidence.'' Among other things, they found
that 42 percent of software upgrades weren't independently audited
and that 8 percent of respondents had no contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, few respondents expect serious problems.
Yardeni still thinks there is a 70 percent chance Y2K will lead to
a recession, but added that ``I can't ignore the fact that just
about every (information-technology) pro and Y2K policy official is
optimistic that it will be a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still worried? American Red Cross spokeswoman Leslie Credit said
there's still time to stock up a few days' worth of bottled water
and canned food, which the organization suggests households have on
hand anyway in case of storms.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Credit said, it's worth getting to know your neighbors
ahead of time. ``If something were to happen it's better to know in
advance who you might check up on, and who might check on you,''
she said. ``It's better if you're not a stranger.''

 &HT;    The great minds of science still have plenty of mysteries to
solve, ranging from what the smallest particle of matter within an
atom may be to whether life exists elsewhere in the universe
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, scientists in laboratories and field stations around
the world pursue what may be the noblest and most meaningful of all
human activities: The quest for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to find answers. But as the century turns, what
are the most pressing questions?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the history of science, from ancient Greek
philosophers pursuing the meaning of life to 20th century
physicists trying to find the tiniest bits of matter, fundamental
questions have been the driving force behind scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As we move into the 21st century, there is no lack of basic
science questions. How did life on Earth begin? Are we alone? How
does the brain work? How does a single fertilized cell become an
organism of trillions of specialized cells?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, when (and if) they come, will beget new questions,
much the way it has been since the dawn of science 2,500 years ago
in the world of the ancient Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century, a basic question was whether the Earth is
at the center of the universe, as many learned people had believed
for centuries. Nicolaus Copernicus dispelled that notion. The Earth
and the other planets revolve around the sun. In the 17th century,
people wondered what governed the movements of these heavenly
bodies and why, on the Earth, anything that was dropped fell to the
ground. Sir Isaac Newton proved in a remarkable series of
experiments a universal force called gravity was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, scientists pondered how physical
characteristics, such as black hair, blue eyes, skin color, passed
from one generation to the next. An Austrian monk named Gregor
Mendel studying peas in his garden concluded the secrets of
heredity lie in something he called dominant and recessive traits
passed on by what he called ``hereditary particles.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time Mendel was studying his peas, Charles Darwin
was pursuing another basic question: How did the astounding
diversity of life, from ants to elephants to humans, arise on the
Earth? In his revolutionary book, ``The Origin of Species,'' he
concluded organisms not only could pass on inherited acquired
characteristics but also could give rise to new species in a
process called evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin and Mendel were unaware of each other's research, but
other scientists later tied their theories together. Mendel's
hereditary particles were found to be bits of a remarkable
substance called DNA. The bits of DNA themselves were called genes,
which change over time to produce new characteristics that give
rise to new species.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists knew the basic
building blocks of DNA and all other forms of matter were atoms,
but they could not say what atoms are made of. We now know the
answer. They are made up of particles called neutrons, protons and
electrons, and some of those particles are made up of even smaller
things called quarks. But when scientists discovered the subatomic
particles, they realized Newton's laws of physics did not work at
the subatomic level.
</P>
<P>
   The question then was: What other laws govern the movements and
interactions of these particles? The answer: ``Quantum mechanics.''
Over the decades students of physics and chemistry have had to
grapple with the mind-boggling concept that in quantum mechanics,
particles are sometimes waves and waves are sometimes particles.
Physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and other leading scientists
used quantum theory to demolish and then rebuild the foundations of
physics. ``The major achievement of science in the 20th century is
quantum mechanics,'' says University of Maryland science historian
Stephen Brush.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the steady succession of scientific feats that have
changed the world, some say at the dawn of the 21st century that
the great discoveries have been made. What's left is tidying up
loose ends and filling in the blanks. That's a notion widely
advanced in ``The End of Science'' by science writer John Horgan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, numerous scientists denounce Horgan's opinions. They put
him in the same category with the late American physicist Albert
Michelson, who, in an 1894 speech at the University of Chicago,
lamented ``the more important fundamental laws and facts of
physical science have all been discovered, and these are now so
firmly established that the possibility of their ever being
supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly
remote.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech took place decades before the development of quantum
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta last March, at a meeting of the American Physical
Society, world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking was asked whether
the great questions in physics already had been answered. ``I
certainly hope that we don't know all that we are going to know,''
he replied. ``That would be very pessimistic, because there are
still gaps in our understanding.'' Hawking's lifework has been to
try to come up with a ``theory of everything'' that might explain
everything from behavior of the smallest particles of matter to the
largest galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel laureate T.D. Lee of Columbia University, who also
attended the meeting, was more direct. ``Even Einstein at his peak
could not predict the direction that physics would take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are the great questions of science researchers will try
to answer in the 21st century? Here are some of those riddles
culled from inquiries with leading scientists in several fields.
The list is by no means complete and does not cover every
scientific discipline or subdiscipline. It suggests, though, if the
20th century was a golden age of science, the questions that puzzle
researchers today will almost certainly lead to questions not yet
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Particle physics: What is the tiniest particle of matter? When
does matter become pure energy, as predicted by Einstein's
theories? We now know protons and neutrons in the nuclei of atoms
are not really fundamental particles but are composed of smaller
particles called quarks. In nuclear accelerators and colliders,
scientists are trying to find out what maaller than quarks.
The answer could lead to, among other things, new sources of energy
not even imagined today.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Theoretical physics: Are the four basic forces of nature _
gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force that holds atomic
nuclei together and the weak force responsible for radioactive
decay _ manifestations of a single force? And are they even the
only basic forces of nature that exist? The answers, pursued by
Hawking and other scientists, may be the springboard to a single
law of nature. Such a law could change our understanding of the
universe and perhaps help answer other fundamental questions: How
did the universe originate, and how might it end?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Astrophysics: Are we alone? Is there life elsewhere in the
universe? Only in the past few years have we been able to determine
other planets exist outside our own solar system. It's also only
been in the past decade or so scientists have attempted to
determine whether the conditions needed for life exist on nearby
planets such as Mars. The answer to the question of
extraterrestrial life would have profound philosophical impact for
us on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Biology: Why die? Why not live forever? The questions may
appear naive, but they address profound biological mysteries for
which scientists have no good answers. Why do we deteriorate as we
grow old, and are there genetic discoveries ahead that might affect
that process? Biologists are also grappling with other questions:
How does a single fertilized cell divide and then generate a person
with trillions of cells that make up the eyes, skin, muscles and
other specialized organs? Will genetic advances that have led to
the cloning of sheep, cows and other animals eventually lead to
human cloning? How does the brain work? The more we learn about our
most important organ, the seat of our consciousness and our
emotions and our very soul, the more questions we have.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anthropology: How did humans evolve from other creatures? What
is the very earliest human ancestor? The answer may lie in some yet
undiscovered fossil in Africa and may help satisfy mankind's
age-old urge to know where we came from. It could also help us
explain the origins of human behavior. How did life originate on
Earth? The answer would be the ultimate genealogy chart and could
give insight into how life may be possible elsewhere in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ecology and environmental science: How many people can the
Earth support? The ultimate fate of the human race may depend on
the answer. There have already been dire predictions that at the
beginning of the 21st century, the world would be so crowded living
on the planet would not be worth it. Paul Ehrlich declared in his
book ``The Population Bomb'' in 1968 the battle to feed humanity
had been lost, hundreds of millions would die in mass famines
throughout the 1970s, and by the 1980s most of the world's most
important resources would be depleted. Yet, as we enter a new
century and a new millennium, the United States, at least, is
enjoying unbounded prosperity.

CARROLL SAYS GLENN WON'T PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll's tough love routine with Terry
Glenn didn't soften Thursday when the coach said that whatever the
outcome of Glenn's appeal of his suspension, he would not play in
the regular-season finale Sunday vs. the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any comments about legalities and rules,'' said
Carroll. ``He's not playing in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Later it was learned through the NFL offices that the
arbitration hearing won't be held in time to get Glenn on the field
Sunday. Because of the holidays, the union and the management
council could not get arbiters together to hold a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't back down on any of his previous comments,
despite Glenn's different version of the events that led to the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll did not deny that Glenn had kept in contact with trainer
Ron O'Neil, but disputed Glenn's claim that he never spoke to
Carroll last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone with him,'' said Carroll. ``I had a guy
sitting right next to me and he gave me the phone. I talked to him
straight up. I can't imagine somebody saying I didn't talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coaches' decision. As far as I was concerned, it was
very clear what the circumstances and the situation were. The
actions I took were justified in my mind, clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had said that he felt some of his teammates were unfair in
their criticism of him before they knew his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's a part of this team and will always be in the eyes of
everybody in this room and I speak for everybody,'' said Shawn
Jefferson. ``He was never rejected from this room. Terry is family.
He's welcome with wide-open arms. I'm sorry he feels that way. I
can speak for the team that nobody's rejected him. We've been here
for Terry and we'll always be there for Terry. Terry is a great
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy said Glenn has always been accepted by his
teammates and would be again when he returns to the locker room,
though Milloy, an unresticted free agent, hinted he might not be in
it next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes about from losing,'' said Milloy. ``When the team
loses, all kinds of issues come up. It's just a product of losing.
If we were winning, none of this stuff would come up and it
wouldn't be so important to everybody. I've always liked Terry and
appreciated what he does on the football field. We'll accept him,
we've put up with things before.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jefferson or Milloy would comment about whether they
felt the treatment of Glenn by Carroll was unfair. Both players
felt they didn't know enough about the circumstances to comment on
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to pose the question to everyone, but I've never
been angry at him,'' said Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll hoped his punishment of Glenn would help the player
become more aware of the commitment it takes to play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anybody else in our program way back when I started, I
saw a guy with tremendous potential who could help the team win and
his future had no limits,'' said Carroll. ``Through this process,
when we've worked together, I've challenged him to bring out the
best at what he's had to offer. There has been no other player who
has put himself in this position. Not even close. As it came down
to this time and these sequence of events, the attitude that was
projected did not, in my opinion, warrant anything else but what
we've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the actions that we took will help this young man
understand where he fits with a team, and in the long run, it'll
make sense and help him comply with working with the team. I hope
it works for his betterment. There's no other reason to do this but
to help him along. I hope it makes sense. It's important for his
future and his relationship with this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he got the blessing of owner Robert Kraft on his
handling of Glenn just 20 minutes before his morning press
conference. He was asked if he had quizzed the owner about his own
job security, and he said the discussion was strictly about Glenn.

MILLENNIUM END BRINGS BOOM IN GUN SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with other industries, gun manufacturers have been
aggressively marketing their products as part of the solution to
possible Y2K madness.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the millennium nearing, some gun manufacturers
have been selling special models, including the Millennium
Protector, a custom .45-caliber handgun, and the Y2K Limited
Edition AR-15 assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say they are outraged by the suggestion
that people need to be well-armed to survive Y2K _ especially as
public officials at all levels are working to quell fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening to think they are appealing to people to
stockpile arms,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas
Reilly. ``It's more than unfortunate, it's irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun groups, however, deny that Y2K fears have played a prominent
role in promoting gun sales. Nancy Snow, ex director of the
Gun Owners Action League, said her group believes increased
interest in guns is ``more of a reflection of the good economy than
anything else.'' She declined to discuss industry ads promoting gun
sales by playing on consumer concerns about massive computer
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's clear that in the run-up to 2000, gun sales have been
brisk.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, nearly 10 million Americans requested the
instant background checks needed to purchase a gun in 1999. This
month alone, more than a million Americans requested such checks,
surpassing last December's applications by nearly 400,000. In
Massachusetts, more than 21,000 people requested background checks
this month.
</P>
<P>
   And while federal agents saw a sharp decline in background
requests after Christmas 1998, no such decline has occurred this
year. ``We expected to see a post-Christmas drop-off, but we
haven't seen that'' said Daniel Wells, acting operations manager of
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System based in
Clarksburg, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Wells noted that while federal law requires a background check
of a buyer before a gun can be purchased, it does not require a
reason for the purchase _ or the number of weapons being bought.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Smith &AMP; Wesson in Springfield, Mass. said ``sales
have been very strong this year.'' Like many in the industry, Smith
&AMP; Wesson officials attribute the surge in sales to consumer
concerns over pending gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed their company has not marketed weapons with a
Y2K-preparednesss theme, but shrugged off criticism of the
marketing tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it surprise anyone when every industry in the
country is using Y2K to sell to people,'' said Ken Jourgensen,
spokesman for Smith &AMP; Wesson. ``There are people who are concerned
about their security, and, right or wrong, they feel (more weapons)
is something they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1999, ads and articles in gun magazines have fueled
those fears. In one ad, for example, a gun manufacturer promises
``The New Millennium Protector will give you the security and peace
of mind in these uncertain times.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun magazines have been urging readers to ``prepare for Y2Kaos''
by stockpiling weapons as well as food. A recent article in
Handguns touted Smith &AMP; Wesson's Model 10 revolver as ``a good
choice for a Y2K handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Another article noted that amid shortages, homeowners might need
to ``quickly stop dogs who through starvation revert to wild
beasts.'' The article, ``Facing Y2K with a Colt Python,''
continued: ``Dogs take a lot of killing so a powerful round . . .
will be necessary should this distasteful task arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and their supporters argue the
consequences of such marketing efforts may be more long-lasting
than any Y2K computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for a bottled water company to play on Y2K
fears to sell a few extra cases, but it's entirely different when
the same marketing ploy is used with guns,'' said Marty Langley, a
policy analyst with the Washington Violence Prevention Center in
Washington and author of a recent study on Y2K gun marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, Y2K will be over. But the guns marketed this
way will remain in homes across the country for years to come,
increasing the risk of suicides, homicides, and accidental gun
injuries.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Kofi Annan, a soft-spoken aristocrat from
Ghana, was elected the seventh secretary-general of the United
Nations three years ago, the quiet insider with a gentle sense of
humor was welcomed as a healer in an organization raked by derision
from American politicians and unsettled by an ugly Clinton
administration campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two more years to go in his first term, Annan is
turning out to be one of the most provocative leaders the United
Nations has known.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who prefer tamer secretarys-general, Annan sets off
alarms with speeches and reports that castigate his own
organization and the world's major powers for doing nothing in the
face of predictable catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   He has brushed aside the notion that national borders are
inviolable and argued that the world has the right to intervene
when leaders abuse their people. He has given public support to
Israel in its battle to gain a full place in the United Nations and
talked tough to fellow Africans about their continent's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not at all what a lot of people expected,'' said Sir
Brian Urquhart, a former undersecretary-general for political
affairs who has written several books about the organization and
its leaders, including a biography of Dag Hammarskjold, whom he
sees as the last secretary-general to adopt this forthright style.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Brian said of Annan: ``He seems to feel that he's in a
position to say, in a perfectly civil way, things that other people
really might not have found the courage to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive in his beliefs? Assertive in style? Annan thought
those questions over in an interview on Monday and did not
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always tried to be that, but I've probably done it in my
own way,'' he said, adding that he gets attention because he has
``put issues on the table'' involving the action or inaction of
metions and the sharper scrutiny of past operations and the
lessons to be drawn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment,'' he said, ``one cannot have a real mission
without a sense of history. You need to look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work in an organization where one usually tries to avoid
conflict, but when the issues are that important and also that
persistent, one needs to find a way of getting them debated, and
move forward in a rational and perhaps more organized manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his zeal to air the unmentioned, Annan seems to have
antagonized both the Third World and influential foreign policy
experts in Washington, where he directs some of his blame for a
deteriorating international political climate. In October, after
the U.S. Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said
the move undermined American world leadership in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Like Boutros-Ghali, whom the Clinton administration believed had
to be removed because he had become a lightning rod for anti-U.N.
sentiment, Annan may be heading for a collision with vocal
Republicans wary of any powerful international voice, particularly
a critical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he continues down this road, ultimately it means
war, at least with the Republican Party,'' said John R. Bolton, who
was the Bush administration's assistant secretary of state for
international organizations and a leading conservative commentator
on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The new Annan shifted gears perceptibly in September, when he
stepped up to speak at the opening of this year's General Assembly
session, normally a ponderous and largely ceremonial affair, and
announced that it was time to stop letting governments hide behind
their routine declarations of national sovereignty if human rights
were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage was immediate _ initially from some predictable
countries like China and India, but the debate goes on around the
world, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear is not my idea of the new world order,'' Theo-Ben
Gurirab, the foreign minister of Namibia and president of the
General Assembly, told a diplomatic gathering soon after Annan's
speech. The idea of a right to ``humanitarian intervention,'' he
said, was an alarming threat to small nations and to the ``sacred
principles and purposes of the charter of the United Nations
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Annan turned the spotlight inward,
publishing two tough, unvarnished reports on U.N. disasters: the
murderous Serbian assaults in 1995 on areas of Bosnia that the
United Nations had declared ``safe havens,'' and the failure of the
organization to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994,
when hundreds of thousands, mostly ethnic Tutsi, were massacred by
Hutu-led militias.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then head of the U.N. peacekeeping department, which
took a beating in both reports. In neither case was any effort
apparently made to tone down the findings, which had often happened
in the past at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general publicly and readily accepted blame. But
the reports did not stop they implicated the powerful
Security Council _ in effect, a cabinet of nations led by the five
permanent members, the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain _ in the woeful lack of quick and active responses to clear
signs that horrendous catastrophes were in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders hailed his forthrightness. Others were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi Annan's courage in writing with such devastating
frankness and precision about the Srebrenica disaster'' in Bosnia,
``and assuming personal responsibility as well as responsibility
for the secretariat for its role in Rwanda, is nothing short of
revolutionary at the United Nations,'' said David Malone, a
Canadian foreign service officer who is now president of the
International Peace Academy, an independent research organization
in New York that instructs diplomats on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the silence from national capitals, which
were at least as heavily involved in decision-making over both
Srebrenica and Rwanda, has been deafening, with many of the
politicians, military leaders and diplomats involved in those
decisions making no moves to assume specific responsibility,''
Malone added.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton, now executive vice president of the American Enterprise
Institute, takes a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a growing and serious issue, the illegitimacy of the
secretary-general's commenting on the performance of U.N. member
governments,'' he said in an interview. ``Much of the substance of
the Srebrenica and Rwanda reports I agree with. The issue is
whether an international civil servant has or can be given
authority to criticize the performance of member governments.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said he sees an ``emerging pattern of behavior'' from the
secretary-general that is troubling. ``All international civil
servants in the U.N. system are employees of member governments,''
he explained. ``It's not to say you don't expect them to use their
imagination or their creativity, but they have no authority to act
outside a very limited scope of responsibility. He's well beyond
pushing the envelope on that score.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan says that ``one could not have told the story of
Srebrenica or Rwanda without looking at the role of all the
players.'' His next project, he said, will be a broad study of how
the United Nations does or should do peacekeeping in all its forms,
from unarmed monitoring to the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview this fall, Annan, who first attracted
American criticism for trying to negotiate with President Saddam
Hussein when he began to block the work of U.N. arms inspectors in
Iraq more than two years ago, put some distance between himself and
the Clinton administration as he reconstructed the motivations that
led him to go to Baghdad in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to disarm Iraq, it was important that we
retain the initiative,'' he said, recalling how he made his risky
trip with a threat of American bombing hanging over the venture.
``You can only retain the initiative by having people on the
ground. You cannot do it from the air. I think that once we get to
the situation where we have to use bombs, then we are on the verge
of losing the initiative. That's one of the reasons I kept asking,
`After the bombing, then what?'''
</P>
<P>
   But his mission failed in several ways. Iraq signed an
agreement, but that proved to be a hollow shell, and before the end
of the year there was bombing anyway. That ended the old inspection
system, and another year has since passed without any on-the-ground
surveillance of Iraq. Inspections may _ or may not _ resume
sometime in the year to come under a new Security Council plan
approved this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they didn't live up to the undertaking,'' he said of the
Iraqis. ``But does that mean we should not try diplomacy? I know
some people have accused me of using diplomacy. That's my job.
That's what I'm paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that his talks both with Saddam and later with
Moammar Gadhafi _ which led to the surrender of two Libyans for
trial in a special court on charges of blowing up Pan Am Flight 101
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 _ grew out of stalemates that the
Security Council seemed unable to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general, 61, a graduate of Macalester College and
MIT who has spent virtually all his working life within the U.N.
system, said problems with Security Council members arise when
countries, including the United States, seem to be working at cross
purposes with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general and the Security Council work very well,
and the U.S. and the Security Council work very well, on those
issues where their policies are in complete harmony,'' he said.
``In those situations where the U.S. is party to a Security Council
consensus and has its own national policy in addition to that _ and
is attempting to implement two policies _ one runs into
difficulties. Sometimes the secretary-general gets caught in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   At the International Peace Academy, Malone attributes a lot of
Annan's intellectual independence to the growing influence of key
outsiders he has brought into his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They include John Ruggie, an American on leave as dean of the
Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs;
Edward Mortimer, a Briton who was foreign editor of The Financial
Times and is now Annan's speechwriter, and Andrew Mack, an American
scholar who is head of an in-house think tank set up by Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he became secretary-general, he knew that his strength
was to be an insider,'' Malone said. ``But that was also going to
be a weakness. The outsiders have been playing a key role in
challenging not only how the U.N. does things, but also how the
U.N. thinks about itself. The U.N. is often self-satisfied, and the
secretariat adopts a victim position without necessarily thinking
issues through.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's deputy, Louise Frechette of Canada, is a
no-nonsense administrator with experience in Canada's defense
ministry who has little patience for the time-consuming posturing
of traditional U.N. behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who once worked for Ms. Frechette, said she stands in
stark contrast to the ``blathering of the U.N., where each delegate
thinks he or she has the sovereign right to natter on indefinitely,
whether it is related to the subject at hand or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan says he is only fulfilling a pledge. ``I did say from the
beginning that alone I could do nothing and we need to reach out
and work in partnership with civil society, the private sector,
foundations and others. I've done that.''

   In 1942, in the face of the bloody tyrannies and colonial

   For all the real power that political rulers, corporate masters

   Think how unprecedented that was. Before 1900, the middle class
in Europe and the United States was a relative drop in the bucket _
mostly small merchants and a sprinkling of professionals; it
scarcely existed elsewhere in the world. Few industrial workers
earned a living wage. The largest group of people, even in the most
advanced countries, still worked the land from dawn to dusk.
Domestic servants of the rich were another big part of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Aristocracies and caste systems were the order of the day.
Genuinely representative democracy existed in only a handful of
countries, and even in those, all women and many men, including
nearly all blacks in the United States, were barred from voting.
</P>
<P>
   For all our worries today about economic inequality, wealth in
the era before World War I was really concentrated. ``In the
half-century before 1914, most capital flows traced back to a few
thousand wealthy European families,'' David Hale, chief global
economist for Zurich Financial Services in Chicago, recently wrote.
``Today they are driven by fund managers allocating the savings of
hundreds of millions of people in pension funds and mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought about this revolutionary change, in which workers
themselves came to own much of the means of production? Many
things, of course, including the spread of democratic practices and
public education. And one product above all others powered this
transformation: the automobile, built on a moving assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, the horseless carriage was widely
derided: contemporary observers said it was simply a plaything for
the rich, a machine to impress the ladies. But in 1908, Henry Ford
introduced the Model T. And in paying his workers what was then the
princely wage of $5 a day to make a car selling for $850, he helped
create a consumer mass market at the same time he was offering
something to satisfy it. The combination released a torrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass-production automobile broke all the traditional
boundaries that held people in place,'' said Daniel Yergin,
president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of
``The Prize,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the oil
industry. ``Everywhere you go, it represents independence,
mobility, freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   So, before we bury the 20th century, let us praise its essential
icon. For despite the environmental ills that cars have brought in
their exhaust trail, nothing else so represents the empowerment of
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Ford knew exactly what he was after. ``I will build a motor car
for the great multitude,'' he said, ``constructed of the best
materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs
that modern engineering can devise.'' It would be, he added, ``so
low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own
one and enjoy with his family the blessings of hours of pleasure in
God's great open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe he miscalculated a bit on the open spaces. Our
bottomless demand to own and drive automobiles has transformed the
landscape almost beyond recognition, inexorably producing the
highways we crowd onto and the suburbs where most of us in America
now choose to live.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention devoted to computers and the Internet, the
auto industry still defies comparison. Roughly 7.5 million people,
about 6 percent of the American work force, are involved in
building, selling or repairing cars and light trucks, almost four
times as many as are employed by all electronics and computer
makers. Three of the four largest companies in the nation by sales
_ General Motors, Ford and Exxon Mobil _ make cars or fuel them. In
1999, Americans boughord 17 million of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is global; there are more than 550 million cars
around the world. Americans own the most _ one car for every 1.7
residents _ but even in crowded Japan there is one for every 2.1
people, and there is one for every 5.3 Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Do all these automobiles represent too much of a good thing?
Perhaps, but good luck persuading people to stop buying them. No
matter what is done in the form of taxes or regulation to
discourage their use, as soon as incomes in any nation reach a
certain level _ on average, around $6,000 a person _ sales of cars
invariably skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, higher gasoline taxes would at least
encourage the production of more efficient autos and slightly
restrain driving. New technologies, like
electric/internal-combustion hybrids and, eventually, fuel cells,
should help further reduce the air pollution they cause. But don't
expect more.
</P>
<P>
   As long as democracy and free markets persist, personal
transportation in some form will be ubiquitous. Why? Because that's
the way we want it.

 CARROLL UNPERTURBED DURING TUMULTUOUS TI (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ At the end, after absorbing question after
question about yet another unhappy _ and most messy _ episode in a
most miserable Patriots season, Pete Carroll raised both arms over
his head and said, ``I'm well aware of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not once, but twice Carroll repeated those words, ``I'm well
aware of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the questions about whether Terry Glenn is
telling the truth or Carroll is telling the truth about the
circumstances that led to Glenn's suspension Wednesday, about
whether Bobby Grier might be a better personnel man than the
PaRon Wolf if only Carroll had played Grier's draft picks
more, about whether Grier and Carroll have a healthy working
relationship, was a most peculiar subtext _ Carroll's imperiled
future as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mostly feel I can do anything now,'' said Carroll, almost
arguing that (itals)now(unitals) he is ready to be a head coach in
the NFL as his second chance seems to be ending. ``I feel I can
take on anything you can bring. There is nothing you can do to get
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm faster, I'm bigger, and and I'm stronger than I was when I
started. I'm just so much versed in what's going on and what to
expect . . . I'm so much better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Carroll's football team is neither faster, bigger,
stronger, nor better than when he started, so Carroll is ``well
aware'' that his future in New England may not last long after
Sunday's game against Baltimore. The Patriots' coach, though, shows
no public bitterness or cynicism, casts no stones, blames no fates,
and seems very mentally balanced as the hangman readies his noose.
``Unusually unperturbed'' might be the apt adjective.
</P>
<P>
   His fate may have been sealed two weeks ago in Philadelphia when
the Patriots played like a high school team _ and a bad high school
team at that _ but Carroll's reaction when he ran off the field in
Foxborough last Sunday after losing to the Bills was most
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll did not have his head down when he neared the den of din
near the runway to the team's locker room, where fans have poured
invective on losing New England players and coaches for years.
Instead, Carroll raised his head and looked up into the stands;
there was almost a twinkle in his eye and a slight smile on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, Carroll several times said some unusual words for
a man in his position. ``I honestly feel I can do anything,'' he
said. ``We've had our wins and we've had our losses, but you're
never going to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been asked if he or Glenn were telling the truth, a
delicate way of asking whether he or Glenn is lying, since Carroll
claims he talked to Glenn about Glenn's flu, but Glenn claimed the
coach never talked to him. ``Who are you supposed to believe? . . .
Do I take that literally? . . . I don't know . . . What you're
supposed to believe is what happened is that I talked to the guy on
the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   His story and Glenn's story are in such direct contradiction,
Carroll was asked, ``Is it possible Glenn didn't know it was you on
the phone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing this . . . this is like an inquiry,'' Carroll
replied. ``You're either going to have to take what I told you
either straight up or you're not. You do what you want. I'm just
telling you what happened. I just told you exactly, precisely, what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went. He was asked if he felt undermined by some players
going to Grier, and he was asked if he and Grier had consulted
about Glenn's suspension, and he was asked what happens to sinking
ships _ rats jumping overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I want to say is I'd never do that,'' said
Carroll, referring to the every-man-for-himself aura that so often
surrounds losing teams and was hanging over some of the Patriots
this week. ``I won't let myself do what you're talking about (every
man for himself). I don't want to be that person. So I'm not going
to separate; I'm going to hang on and hang together all the way
through because that's my nature and that's how I want to be.''
From time to time, Carroll would say, ``Let's talk about
Baltimore.'' But no chance of that.
</P>
<P>
   And from time to time, Carroll would come back to another theme,
that ``I'm much better prepared (as a head coach) now.'' This year,
with losses and controversy, has been difficult, ``but my fiar was much harder than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking over from Bill Parcells was difficult, as was his one
year as coach of the Jets and dealing with the New York media. Just
add this Glenn incident to the list. What all of this has done,
said Carroll, is prepare him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just different . . . I've been empowered by it,'' he said.
``I've grown by it. I don't have questions about it anymore . . .
I'm unwavered by it. Everybody asks how I'm doing . . . I'm doing
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll in the sinking days of 1999. Unusually unperturbed.

HOUSTON BALLET'S STEVENSON GETS ROYAL HONOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MOLLY GLENTZER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, he was a hilariously hefty Sugar Plum Fairy in ``The
Nutty Nutcracker.'' Today, for his more significant contributions
to dance, Houston Ballet artistic director Ben Stevenson has been
named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.).
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace announced that the 63-year-old native of
Portsmouth, England, is included in Queen Elizabeth II's New Year's
Honors List. He will be invested next summer in a ceremony in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The honor bestows no title on Stevenson, but the letters O.B.E.
can be used following his name. Houston Ballet associate
choreographer Christopher Bruce was honored with an O.B.E. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson is regarded as a major creator of full-length story
ballets. His ``Cinderella'' is in the repertories of 20 companies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 25 years, he has built Houston Ballet from a
small, regional ensemble into one of the world's most successful
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having lived in America for the last 30 years, this honor was
very unexpected,'' Stevenson said. ``Many people I've admired have
gotten O.B.E.s, so it's nice to join the club.''

   Sports at the Millennium: What the Heck?
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Hoffman
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   When we look back at sports in the 20th century, at the vast
panorama of athletic endeavor and competitive drama, one compelling
question comes to mind: Were John Rocker's parents brother and
sister?
</P>
<P>
   But our topic today is, How did sports change in the 20th
century, and where are they going in the 21st? And is there a
genetic malfunction with people who paint their faces team colors
and yell like constipated bison, ``C'MON BIG D!''?
</P>
<P>
   To identify the single biggest change in 20th century sports,
other than Tommy Lasorda's post-Slim Fast profile, look no farther
than one factor.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't money. Which is hard to believe, when the average
salary in football is $697 million a year. And that's for the
Gatorade vendors.
</P>
<P>
   It is technology. Aided by space-age gadgets, equipment, drugs,
diets and training methods, an average athlete today can run
faster, jump higher, throw harder, trash-talk quicker, groin-pull
more severely, drunkenly marry more ``Baywatch'' stars and get
longer jail sentences than once could have been dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bob Beamon astonishing the world in 1968 by
long-jumping more than 29 feet _ nearly two feet farther than
anyone had ever jumped, except for a lumberjack who sat on a bee?
Jumps of around that length are becoming common _ common! _ thanks
to advancements in nutrition, exercise and high-tech shoes made of
composite materials including Lycra, Spandex, Viagra and Flubber.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Bobby Jones' day, or Don Budge's, or Bronko Nagurski's,
or Ty Cobbs', observation was the best teacher. You looked at
someone good, and you imitated him.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth used to talk about how he copied ``Shoeless'' Joe
Jackson's swing; rumor has it he even tried going without shoes,
which made his teammates awfully relieved that his role model
wasn't ``Pantsless'' Ed Freudowski.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ruth'd get his coaches to videotape his swing. He'd get
his physiologists to analyze and improve it. He'd get his trainers
to devise exercises to develop the most anatomically targeted
muscles. And he'd get his agent to sell his video, ``Swatting With
the Oldies,'' for only $19.95, operators are standing by.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself: How much better might, say, Wilt Chamberlain have
been with Air Jordans, videotape and modern conditioning methods?
He might, by this time, have slept with every woman in the Western
hemisphere, right on the Internet. It makes you think.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, how good would Pete Sampras be with an old Spalding
wooden tennis racket? How many Grand Slams would Rod Laver have won
if he'd had one of the computer-designed, composition,
oversized-head marvels of today back in the 1960s? If John McEnroe
had had access to Androstenedione, the steroid preferred by Mark
McGwire, who knows how much more energetically profane his tantrums
might have been?
</P>
<P>
   Technology in the 21st century will go far beyond what is now
possible. As new, undetectable steroids are invented, as more
dynamic exercising systems are introduced, as gear becomes
infinitely sophisticated _ ``It's an athletic supporter AND a fax
machine!'' _ we'll see mediocre athletes play like superstars, and
superstars, one by one, start to spontaneously combust.
</P>
<P>
   This will make us long for the ``old days'' of the 20th century.
And when all is said and done, there will be two athletes who will
tower above all others.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Owens and Babe Didrikson Zaharias are what sports should
be about. Superbly, naturally skilled, they had the discipline,
courage and character that sports so desperately miss.
</P>
<P>
   All Owens did was leave Hitler's Master Race in the dust at the
1936 Berlin Olympics. Zaharias merely set half the track and field
records of her time, then went on to become one of the greatest
women golfers. Owens triumphed over racism. Zaharias valiantly
battled cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Each did well on the silly ESPN Athletes of the Century list _
Owens No. 6, Zaharias No. 10. Thankfully, each beat out Secretariat
(No. 35), Flipper (just off the list at 101) and the little dog on
the Taco Bell commercials (ineligible due to a contract dispute).
But their impact goes far beyond their skills on the fields of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has helped create physical titans, but it seems to
have outpaced the adaptability of the human heart. Today's whiny,
arrogant, greedy, ten-a-Penny multizillionaires would do well to
look back at Owens and Zaharias and realize that, without
sportsmanship, sports is a much shorter word.

GLENN UNSURE WHY SECOND HALF OF SEASON WENT AWRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Terry Glenn had visions of a record season with the
Patriots after the team won its first four games, but ``there was
something else going on'' that Glenn feels led to a second-half
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a chance to show what I could do in the second
half,'' said Glenn, who thought he could catch 120 balls. ``The
first five or six games I was in that zone that receivers get in
where you just think you're going to catch everything. Then, they
just stopped throwing me the ball. It seemed like they weren't
looking for me anymore. I don't know if it was because they felt
they needed to distribute the ball to other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough mentally when that happens because you're catching
so many balls and so many are coming your way, then five or six
weeks later you get a ball thrown to you and you should catch it,
but you don't see it quite like you did earlier when you were in
that zone,'' added Glenn, referring to the touchdown pass he
dropped in the Philadelphia game.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn won't blame offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese. He knows
Zampese made him the focal point of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said anything bad about Ernie, because I knew he
wanted to get me the ball,'' said Glenn. ``It just didn't work out
that way for whatever reason,'' said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he'll be as committed to the offseason program as he
was this past season. He'll do his workouts, work hard, and give it
everything he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few years I've gone home with screws and plates in my
bones with the worst injuries,'' he said. ``I've gone home and my
legs have ached until March. I thought I made a strong commitment
to the team this year. I thought I did everything they asked me to
do.''

 &HT;    Rome's Jubilee doors: Invitation to enter 2000 in hope
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   January is named after a Roman god of doorways. Janis is
depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions as one year
ends and another begins.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian doors look to the future. And many of them are
open for the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II presided at an ancient ceremony on Christmas
Eve at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to unseal the church's Jubilee
door. The glorious entry is opened only every 25 years for a
celebration of pilgrimage and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Open doors in religious tradition are signs of welcome,
redemption and sanctuary. Jesus said, ``I am the door,'' insisting
that he was a point of entry to the presence of God.
</P>
<P>
   Closed doors suggest rejection. And countless Christians
disappointed or in disagreement with the church feel that the door
to their church has been shut in their face.
</P>
<P>
   Even the legendary pearly gates can be a barrier to heaven's
pleasures. But the doors of the millennium are meant to be
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The papal ceremony last week intentionally included echoes of
reversing Adam and Eve's expulsion from Paradise. The Jubilee door
into St. Peter's, sealed for a quarter of a century by a masonry
wall, was breached as the Pope ritually broke down the barrier to
the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims flood daily into the Church through the door, which
will be sealed again in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee doors were also unsealed last week in three other
ancient churches of Rome in St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major and
St. Paul Outside the Walls.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic tradition claims that a pilgrim who prays in all
four churches in a Jubilee year can receive a plenary indulgence.
That frees the penitent from otherwise obligatory time spent in
purgatory preparing for heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee years are rooted in ancient Israel, where they were
scheduled every 50 years (Lev. 25:10). They were meant to be a time
of homecoming. The land was allowed to lie fallow and debts were
forgiven. But there is scant evidence of a Jubilee ever taking
place in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church adopted the celebration in the 14th century
and soon decided to promote the festival every 25 years and
incorporate Jubilee doors.
</P>
<P>
   Other doors have long been used as symbols of entering the
spiritual realm. Many medieval churches intentionally had five
doors painted a deep red.
</P>
<P>
   Each door represented one of the wounds of the crucified Jesus
(four nails and a spear in the side) Painted the color of blood,
the doors became signs of the Savior's wounds through which the
faithful entered the church.
</P>
<P>
   A special door in many medieval churches offered sanctuary for
those on the run. Criminals who sought sanctuary in the church
banged on the designated door, were admitted, and had as long as 40
days to agree to leave the country or face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Most church doors are not red today, sanctuary doors are no
longer in use and the pagan deity of doorways is two faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Rome's Jubilee doors are an invitation to enter the
millennium in hope.

   TERROR-U.S. _ Developments: A man arrested in a raid in Brooklyn
by the Joint Terrorist Task Force is charged with concealing his

court in Vermont, link the woman arrested in Vermont to the man

   U.N.-ANNAN (United Nations) _ When Kofi Annan, a soft-spoken
aristocrat from Ghana, was elected the United Nations' seventh
secretary-general three years ago, the quiet insider with a gentle
sense of humor was welcomed as a healer in an organization raked by
abuse from American politicians and unsettled by an ugly Clinton
administration campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali. Three years later and with two more years to go in

the ones who will be working. To be away from the office on this
New Year's eve is to be rendered, in Y2K argot, ``nonessential,''
and what executive wants that? Not Eugene R. McGrath, the president

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty or so kids, every one of them in full chatty, giggly
Christmas-vacation blossom, were at the Chinatown Library last week
putting tiny bits of history into baby-food jars.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Monument was launched in 1996, when artist
 &UR; Allyson Levy &LR;  began visiting Bay Area classrooms _ from
kindergarten to high school _ spending several sessions a month
talking to each class about history, memory and their own places in
the parade, and encouraging them to create time capsules, tangible
reflections of their thoughts on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   She was equipped with all kinds of scavenged crafts supplies as
well as new jars donated by Owens Brockway glass in Hayward, and
encouraged each maker to augment her staples with personal
memorabilia, nurturing the young historian/artists. Two thousand of
those capsules form the Monument, which went on display this week
at the Jewett Gallery of the San Francisco Main Library, where it
will remain  &LR; until the end of February. It will then travel to the
Museum of Children's Art in Oakland and to children's museums in
Chicago, Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Early sessions of the classroom visits involved more talking
than capsule-making. ``What were you like a year ago?'' ``How do
you connect to your grandparents?'' If you're a kid, and you
imagine growing up, ``how will you connect to your child?''
``What's your favorite activity or hobby?'' ``Does anyone like to
play? What?''
</P>
<P>
   As the children in Chinatown took their worktable seats, Levy _
by now practiced at putting the project into words _ began
explaining. The basic question, she said, is ``What is important
about now?''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat capsule-maker  &UR; Bailey Green &LR; , 11, created her first at
Cabrillo School in Pacifica. ``A time capsule,'' she said crisply,
``is a little jar and you put a lot of stuff in it, but you
probably forgot what you put in it, and it tells you what you were
like when you made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most kids didn't attempt profound solutions. Some jars contained
Barbie doll heads; many contained blue M&AMP;Ms, new when those jars
were created. A few older kids made miniature easels, to show they
were interested in art, or computer screens, keyboards and books.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's own capsule contains a piece of pasta (homage to her
husband, who she says can do anything with pasta), a family photo,
a yellow candy heart that says ``Fax Me'' (homage to her mother,
who is always sending her hearts though the mail), a lock of hair
(``because my hair is me,'' says the curly-topped Levy), a thimble
(because her  &LR; husband likes to sew), an A for Allyson, a barrette
and a piece of computer printout (made by her husband, who had
vowed not to use computers).
</P>
<P>
   First-graders almost always include a baby tooth, says Levy, but
in this library room, packed with first- and second-graders with
wide-open spaces in their wide-open smiles, there were no choppers
presented. These students, here to work on the project for a few
hours, hadn't had enough explanation to bring the teeth beforehand;
they brought miniature toys, dinosaurs, a ticket stub to ``Toy
Story 2.'' The visiting artists who had made previous jars were
better equipped.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Phoebe Marzan &LR; , now 14, was in sixth grade when she made one
capsule. ``The very first thing I put in was a little bag from
Barbie, from the Olympics,'' she says, wincing. ``Those days, I was
a little kid-ish.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she's started at Galileo Academy, attended Space
Camp in Huntsville, Ala., and decided she wants to be a Blue Angel
or Thunderbird pilot. She's brought along a miniature rocket, a
five-bead rosary, a picture of stuffed toys, a favorite Sanrio
character, several origami stars, a Microsoft logo ``cut out of my
computer manual,'' a new quarter and an old one, 32-and 33-cent
stamps, several pressed flower petals, a Beanie Baby tag and a Muni
youth pass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pauline Leung &LR; , who's 12 and in seventh grade, sits quietly,
peering intently at the tiny cut-out letters she's gluing onto
construction paper. On the table next to her jar are a few stamps
and coins, which she collects, and a pink heart. But her attention
is focused on the cut-and-paste message on the paper, no bigger
than a quarter-inch tall, individual letters forming words as
though they were part of a ransom note.
</P>
<P>
   The laboriously crafted message refers to the two girls sitting
across the table: ``Friends,'' it says, ``Annie'' and ``Helen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauline knows the importance of honoring one's pals and
remembering to take them along while moseying into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   So happy New Year, and see you in 2000.

WIFE OF MAN ABDUCTED IN '95 WANTS HIJACKERS QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS
FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With INDIA-HIJACK) 
(nk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the more than four years since Donald F. Hutchings was
kidnapped during a hiking trip in India-controlled Kashmir and
marched at gunpoint deep into the Himalayas, the clues relating to
his possible whereabouts have grown ever more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jane Schelly, last saw him on the banks of the Lidder
River in July 1995, when heavily armed militants raided a series of
campsites and ultimately grabbed six Westerners. One hostage, an
American, escaped. Another, a Norwegian, was beheaded. Reports of
the other four being herded from one remote hamlet to another
echoed through the region for four months, then faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found many people who had them in their homes prior to
December 1995,'' Ms. Schelly, 44, said Thursday in an interview.
``But nothing indicates life after that _ no sightings, no reports,
no communications with the group.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last last Friday,
however, abruptly resurrected the entire saga for her. The demands
of the hijackers, whose identity remains vague, mirror the demands
made by the militants who kidnapped her husband and the others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schelly is convinced that the hijackers probably know the
fate of the four hostages, or have links to people who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be able to provide definitive information about my
husband, I believe the probability is extremely high,'' she said in
a telephone interview from Orefield, Penn., where she is visiting
her mother for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The one unvarying demand of the plane's hijackers has been the
release of Maulana Masood Azhar, a Pakistani Muslim cleric who
helped recruit young men to join the fight against Indian rule in
Kashmir, a predominately Muslim area. The kidnappers of Hutchings
and the others had also repeatedly threatened to execute them if
Azhar, who was jailed by India in 1994, and other militants were
not released _ one of a series of violent actions they have staged
to win his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schelly, an elementary school teacher in Spokane, Wash., has
returned to the region six times to search for her husband. On one
such trip in 1996 she met with Azhar, who was in a jail in New
Delhi at the time. The cleric told her that he knew nothing about
the kidnappings as he had been imprisoned when they occurred. He
later issued an appeal for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was courteous to us, he spoke English well, was articulate,
intelligent,'' she said. ``I would say that this is not a person
who wielded a gun. He was a person of a pen and a voice. He mixed
religion and politics, and I believe his goal was to incite unrest
and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers evidently singled out Westerners because they
thought foreign governments would pressure the Indian government to
release the jailed militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accept our demands or face dire consequences. We are fighting
against anti-Islamic forces. Western countries are anti-Islam, and
America is the biggest enemy of Islam,'' said a note released the
day after Hutchings was kidnapped, quoted in the book ``Ransom: The
Untold Story of International Kidnapping'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co., 1998)
by Ann Hagedorn Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schelly said she has been glued to the coverage of the
hijacking, turning on the television on the hour and channel
surfing in search of updates. The plane, which had taken off from
Katmandu, Nepal, before it was hijacked, has been held since
Saturday at an airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Most of the
passengers are Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schelly has accepted that she will probably never again see
her husband, a neuropsychologist who worked with head injury
victims and would now be 47 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of my husband being alive are very slim,'' she
said, adding that the families of the others, Keith Mangan and Paul
Wells from Britain and Dirk Hasert in Germany, feel the same way.
``All the family members still hope that we find absolute proof one
way or another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the details about their possible deaths are sketchy,
there were reports of a clash between Indian forces in Kashmir and
the militants in December 1995. The militants, unable to climb high
into the mountains during the fierce winter or to hide in the lower
valleys, might have killed their hostages rather than get caught
with them, Ms. Schelly said, or just to prove they meant business
after so many threats.
</P>
<P>
   All four families want, at the least, to recover the bodies of
their loved ones and hope that the militants who hijacked the
airplane might further that quest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schelly stressed that she has no interest in intervening in
the negotiations to end the hijacking crisis, and that the first
priority should be gaining the release of all the passengers. But
once that is accomplished, if it is possible, she wants someone to
question the hijackers about what they know about the fate of the
kidnapped Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they weren't involved,'' she said, ``they certainly
must have the connections to know.''

 &HT;    A simpler turn of century
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My friend Cathy's grandmother is 106, and of
sounder mind, Cathy suspects, than she is herself, most days. So
Cathy will be spending New Year's Day with the woman who vividly
remembers the last turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother remembers her father shaking her awake. ``It's
1900!'' he cried, and the little girl heard the sounds of
celebrations in the streets of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of Y2K hysteria, we can't imagine the unbridled joy
of that celebration. The revelers had no fear of terrorists on
Times Square, computer meltdown, wayward nuclear missiles or
overhyped media events.
</P>
<P>
   But they faced daily terrors nearly inconceivable to us. They
didn't have to worry about some lunatic pulling a pistol on them at
the mall, but they knew they could be carried off any day by
influenza or pneumonia. Dying in childbirth or losing a child to
diphtheria were very real possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have to worry about Y2K, but they knew what it was
like to work 14-hour days, and to stoke a coal furnace.
</P>
<P>
   The things they feared _ and didn't fear _ tell us a great deal
about all that has been marvelous, and all that has been horrible,
about this century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world without airplanes _ and without the atomic bomb.
It was a world without penicillin _ and without presentiment of
world war, the Holocaust, Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine waking up to a new century without the leaden weight of
those realities, the Pandora's Box of knowledge we dare not open
very often. It's too painful.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why this year _ the biggest New Year of them all _
my heart hasn't been in it. And I usually love New Year's Eve _
none of this namby-pamby ``I just want a nice quiet evening by the
fireplace'' for me.
</P>
<P>
   At first I thought my indifference was a by-product of my desire
never to hear the words ``Y2K'' and ``millennium'' for the rest of
my natural-born days.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper reason is that I haven't wanted to take stock of the
past century. For you can't contemplate the Wright Brothers and the
Man on the Moon (pause a moment here for hometown pride) without
ring Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You can't celebrate Winston
Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi without confronting Adolf Hitler and
Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   What would it have been like, to wake up New Year's Day 1900,
with only optimism and hope for what the shining new century would
bring?
</P>
<P>
   If only I'd had the brains to ask my grandparents when I still
could. Instead, I called the one friend who was around that night _
revered local educator Evangeline Lindsley, 103, of Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   She spent New Year's Eve 1899 tucked in bed at her grandparents'
farm, where Needmore Road now crosses North Dixie, while her
parents celebrated at a neighborhood square dance. ``They didn't
make an awful lot of fuss about it,'' she recalls. ``They didn't
make such a big to-do about it as they do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memory stretches from the assassination of President William
McKinley to the Columbine massacre. In the 1920s, she told students
that Hitler would never be appointed prime minister, ``The German
people,'' she said, ``are too civilized to follow that man with the
funny little mustache.''
</P>
<P>
   Still an avid follower of the news, Lindsley grows disheartened
at times. Yet she has never lost faith that mankind can catch up to
the treacherous miracle of technology: ``They always have, haven't
they?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a hope to hold onto this New Year's Eve. That, and the
image of a small girl, shaken awake by her father _ ``It's 1900!''
_ and greeting the century, gleaming with promise like a newly
minted penny.

   NEW YORK STATE'S ONLINE TAX SERVICE, UNDER REVISION
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers noticed recently that the state Department of
Taxation and Finance had added a new feature to its Web site _
allowing taxpayers and accountants to check the state's tally of
estimated tax payments against their own records, which often do
not match. Accounts were available for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great service,'' said Jay Scheidlinger, an accountant
with Israeloff, Trattner &AMP; Co. ``We used it for a few clients and
it worked out perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, during an important time in the tax cycle, New
York's site has disappeared _ ``temporarily unavailable,'' visitors
are told, and it is not clear when it will be back. Marc Carey, a
spokesman, said the service was taken down to incorporate
improvements after a test period that ran from Dec. 2 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   A chief issue appears to be security. Access had been granted
simply on the basis of a name and Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   The state is now telling visitors to the site,
www.tax.state.ny.us, (then clicking on online services) that
``based on your suggestions, we're revising the estimated tax
account summary system.''
</P>
<P>
   While the state expects to restore the service this year, Carey
could not promise that it would be restored by Jan. 18, the
deadline for paying estimated taxes for the fourth quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York appears to be a pioneer in offering the service,
said Verenda Smith, government-affairs associate at the Federation
of Tax Administrators in Washington. ``It's the sort of application
people envision being on the Internet,'' she said.

   STOCK-OPTION WARRIORS
</P>
<P>
   For some executives, a yearly compensation package that includes
a cash bonus must seem positively quaint. These days, most chief
executives are asking for and receiving stock options as the
predominant form of long-term incentives, according to Howard
Goldsmith, vice president at the Segal Co., a human relations
consulting concern in Manhattan. In its annual executive
compensation report on companies with up to $200 million in
revenue, Segal found that the stock-option warriors _ those whose
compensation came primarily from stock options _ were in the
high-technology area.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, chief executives of these companies were paid 3,156
percent of their salary in stock options last year, Segal reported.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, stock options are well represented in all eight
industry areas tracked by Segal. On the low end, leaders of
companies in the fabricated metal/wood area had to settle for
options that amounted to just 37 percent of salary. Even so, those
chief executives earned $288,000, on average, in 1999, in salaries
and cash bonuses; that is $8,000 more than their high-tech
counterparts. ``Upside potential and risk,'' Goldsmith said,
``that's what stock options are all about.''

MILLENNIUM SPOOKED STOCKING UP

<P>
   LifeTabs, vanilla-wafer-sized disks of concentrated food that
take the place of meals: 125,000 jars sold, at $19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Survival pack for two, a year's supply of dried fruits,
vegetables, margarine, milk, and seeds for planting sprouts: 60,000
packs sold, at $1,695 each.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has been good to Sam Andy Inc., a Texas survival
food company that traditionally sells its wares to campers and
civil defense groups. Y2K pried the market wide open, said John
Sauer, the company's chief executive. By the start of 1999, sales
had risen by 1,200 percent; the company started running
round-the-clock shifts and opened new factories in three states.
</P>
<P>
   After a summertime lull, Sauer said, sales climbed again in the
last few months. The procrastinator market, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to tonight's final countdown, most
consumers faced the millennium with a collective yawn. When Shaw's
supermarkets put up signs announcing they were Y2K compliant,
customers didn't seem impressed, spokesman Bernie Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days _ moved, perhaps, by the looming deadline or
the crush of media coverage _ the public has paid more attention.
Stores across the region and the nation have  up on staples,
anticipating a wave of last-minute customers.
</P>
<P>
   A core of wary souls is way ahead of them. Across the region and
the country, the well-prepared few have been taking Y2K more
seriously, pouring their fears _ and their cash _ into supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer divides them roughly into two groups. There are the
regular stockpilers, who view food storage as a sort of insurance
policy, and there are the Y2K-watchers, from paramilitarists to
professionals, who are paying close attention to their cupboards as
the millennium nears.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Middelkoop, an industrial engineer in Amherst, Mass., counts
himself in the latter group. He doesn't expect a major crisis,
though, in engineer-speak, he says there's a ``nonzero chance of
Armageddon'' after Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Middelkoop said, he works closely enough with computers
to know what could go wrong. That's why he came up with his own Y2K
plan, which he posted on his Web site early last year.
</P>
<P>
   It started with figuring out where to spend New Year's Eve. It
ends with making sure he has ``marginal food sufficiency'' six
weeks after the Big Event.
</P>
<P>
   Middlekoop downgraded his plan slightly over time _ deciding,
for example, not to buy a Coleman portable stove. But over the
months, he has met most of his goals:
</P>
<P>
   --Hoard food? Check; a friend found Canadian Army rations at a
surplus store.
</P>
<P>
   --Buy batteries? Check; in a drugstore a few months ago, he
found 24-packs on sale for $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   --Acquire ``water storage device''? Check. ``Those office water
coolers? One of them disappeared from the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to be safe, agrees Mike Woodard, a Sam Andy
distributor in St. George, Utah. He started to think about
potential Y2K problems last year, he said, when he scanned the
Internet and came across tales of serious preparations.
</P>
<P>
   When he read about a man who had purchased a cave and was
planning to subdivide it, Woodard decided he needed a disaster
blueprint of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After a year's worth of reassuring news reports, Woodard doesn't
fear widespread chaos anymore. Still, he fully expects a recession,
which he believes will start with Third World countries and
breakdowns in the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   To ready himself, he has stocked up on supplies and made plans
to withdraw all his money from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that everybody would at least be prepared to feed
their family and kids for at least 90 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While three months' planning might be rare, researchers have
expected a steady flow of people to head to automatic teller
machines and supermarkets this week. Many government officials have
urged residents to fill their pantries.
</P>
<P>
   A September poll by the Gartner Group, a New York consulting
firm, suggested that many would: 55 percent of Americans planned to
withdraw two to six weeks' worth of cash, and 67 percent planned to
store enough food for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some have tried to turn that stockpiling impulse into a catalyst
for good works. Shaunti Feldhahn, a devout Atlanta churchgoer with
a background in risk management, decided last year that preparing
seemed wise, but was dismayed at what she viewed as an un-Christian
trend toward hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   So she started the Joseph Project 2000, a national organization
that urges churches to collect supplies to help the community.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area businesses and aid groups have made modest
preparations of their own, on the off chance that disaster strikes.
Area hospitals have stocked up on generators and dry ice. Some
``Meals on Wheels'' programs plan to give their clients extra food,
water, and flashlights for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And several mainstream retailers have made sure their shelves
are fully stocked, to accommodate last-minute Y2K fears. Many
supermarket officials say they have treated the millennium like the
best kind of winter storm, the one you know is coming three years
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than a northeaster or a blizzard or a
hurricane,'' said Rogan, the spokesman for Shaw's. It's a matter of
stocking the shelves with food that ``time and time again, our
customers seek out when a low-pressure area is approaching,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Shaw's, that means tapping into long-tested storm-preparation
plans and providing steady supplies of bottled water, canned goods,
and batteries. And white bread, which seems to sell out during
every storm, Rogan said. He figures it serves as a companion piece
to peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island-based CVS drugstores haven't stocked their shelves
any more than usual, said spokesman Mike DeAngelis; December is
always a big month for batteries, he said. The chain is confident
it won't face a run on prescription drugs, because pharmaceutical
companies typically keep 90-day supplies in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he doesn't expect much panic, because of the way
customers have behaved so far.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC aired its made-for-fear ``Y2K'' disaster movie last
month, he said, the CVS customer service office braced for
thousands of nervous callers. They didn't get one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most mainstream stores and businesses haven't seen much
interest in stockpiling Y2K survival goods, and haven't benefited
from a millennium boost, said industry forecaster Kurt Barnard,
president of the Barnard Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   Even hoarders won't bring in new retail revenues, he said.
They'll be bringing home goods they usually buy, just a few weeks
or months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're buying 20 boxes of cornflakes today, you certainly
have enough cornflakes to last you several months,'' Barnard said.
``Unless you're a cornflake freak.''

   READY-4Y2K -- With just a day to go, the question on everyone's
mind before the end of the century is: Are you ready? Lines at
ATMS, groceries and gas stations suggest that folks want to be

JESSE JACKSON JR.'S AGENDA: AN INCLUSIVE BULL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the 34-year-old congressman and
son of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, is not talking politics this
morning, nor is he talking civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the topic is investing, and he is talking about 401(k)
retirement plans and mutual funds, describing the benefits of
dollar cost averaging and explaining how African-Americans are
finally going to reach Wall Street, fulfilling what he and his
father call a long journey from sharecropper to shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to spread the message of financial independence
to African-Americans,'' the congressman says over a breakfast of
eggs Benedict at the Swiss Hotel. ``I want to market these
concepts, these time-honored traditions of how to build wealth in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He is doing this in a new book he has written with his father,
``It's About the Money'' (Times Business, $23).
</P>
<P>
   The book, published in December, is a how-to manual on investing
and personal financial management aimed primarily at minority
Americans, who the Jacksons say have largely missed out on one of
the greatest bull markets in history.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rep. Jackson why he and his father have ventured into a
field populated by so many Wall Street wizards, and you'll get a
funny look, a stare. The reply: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has an undergraduate degree in business from North
Carolina A&AMP;T and says he taught seminars in financial management
when he worked at Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, his father's civil rights
organization in Chicago. And the elder Jackson, who has made
``economic justice'' a pillar of his activism, is now heading up
the Wall Street Project, a campaign to lobby big business and Wall
Street financiers to share their wealth and expand minority
businesspeople's access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jackson, a husky man who, like his father, was once a high
school football star, calls the book the shared vision of father
and son. The lessons are simple: the Jacksons discourage the use of
credit cards, warn about investment scams and predatory lenders and
encourage readers to make disciplined financial choices and to
squirrel away money for retirement. Perhaps most emphatically, they
recommend investing in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've attempted to do this in our own home,'' Rep. Jackson
said, ``and this is our opportunity to show how others can become
responsible with their own finances.''
</P>
<P>
   For too long, he said, his target audience has been wasting
money on things like lottery tickets. His father likes to say that
blacks have ``more confidence in a bear lotto than a bull market.''
Rep. Jackson says their book faces the dual challenge of trying to
reach an audience that neither reads much nor trusts the stock
market _ an audience that would rather spend than save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about breaking some century-old habits,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides few clues about the Jacksons' own experiences
in the world of finance, beyond the elder Jackson's anecdotes about
his mother struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it reads like so many other personal finance guides.
Written with the help of financial journalist Mary Gotschall, it
includes a fair amount of reference material like telephone numbers
for various agencies and anodyne tips like, ``always write out a
check in ink'' or ``if anyone says you can receive a high return
without risk, be suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   (The authors are unlikely to get rich from the book; according
to the congressman, his father and Ms. Gotschall split a $60,000
advance; Rep. Jackson will draw the first $60,000 in royalties,
with any remainder to be shared by the three writers.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jackson's introduction to the world of investing came while
he was in law school at the University of Illinois in 1991. He saw
an infomercial for an investment seminar being led by Charles J.
Givens, the author of ``Wealth Without Risk.'' He bought the book
and attended one of Givens' seminars. ``I learned more about
personal finance in an hour-and-a-half seminar than I had in three
years in business school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Sandi, noticed, though, that they were the only
blacks in an audience of about 800 people. Now he is trying to
remedy that imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jackson wants low-wage workers to jump in, too. ``There are
some things that people who earn $30,000 can do to significantly
change the quality of their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to offer one caveat,'' he added. ``In no way am I
suggesting that `It's About the Money' is the answer to solving
poverty in America. I believe the only way to solve poverty in
America is to have a comprehensive full-employment program.'' He
went on for a few more minutes before realizing that he was no
longer talking the investing talk.
</P>
<P>
   But he is walking the walk, he said. He is following his own
advice, putting money away now, because his wife, a lawyer, is
seven months pregnant. With his daughter due soon, he said it's
important ``to invest $50 or $100 a month for her to go to the
college of her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he entered Congress in 1995, he said, he was an
``aggressive'' investor. Now, a financial adviser handles all of
his investments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says he's always looking for a good investment. As he
walks onto the sidewalk after breakfast, he greets a group of men
who shout out things like, ``Say hello to the reverend for me.''
Then he places his cellular telephone earplug in place and walks
away, only to trot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait,'' he calls out. ``One more thing. Invest in antiques!
That was something I learned from my mother.''

CENTENNIAL GETS INTEL FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Centennial Technologies Inc., continuing its recovery from a
1997 financial scandal, is buying Intel Corp.'s flash memory card
business.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial will give Intel a 16 percent stake in the company, as
well as $6 million in cash and a note, with another potential
payment of up to $4.5 million if certain contingencies arise. In
exchange, Centennial will gain Intel's technology for making flash
memory cards.
</P>
<P>
   Flash memory is a specialized kind of silicon memory chip. The
memory chips commonly used in computers are wiped clean when the
device that uses them is switched off. But flash chips can store
data for long periods of time, like a computer's hard drive, even
when they are not receiving electrical power. Additionally, flash
memory chips can send and receive data much faster than hard
drives, thus improving the performance of many devices.
</P>
<P>
   Flash chips are used in devices like digital cameras, but
Centennial makes flash memory cards for use in industrial products
ranging from sewing machines to medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's line of flash memory cards is manufactured for the
company by a third party. Intel will now abandon this business to
Centennial, but will continue to make the flash memory chips used
in such cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a business that we're bullish on,'' said Intel
spokesman Robert Manetta. ``We wanted to focus more on the core
silicon business.''
</P>
<P>
   Centennial will continue to sell Intel's existing line of flash
memory cards. The business has brought in $20 million in annual
revenue to Intel, a tiny fraction of the firm's 1998 revenues of
$26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial, of Wilmington, Mass., is already a major producer of
flash memory cards. But the firm is still in recovery from a 1997
investigation that led to indictments of top executives for
exaggerating the company's financial results in order to boost its
stock price. As a result of the scandal, the New York Stock
Exchange delisted Centennial's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Intel shares closed down 3/16 at 83 11/16 on the Nasdaq stock
exchange.

FEDERAL AGENTS QUESTION PEOPLE WITH POSSIBLE TERRORIST LINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With zero-hour fast approaching for the turn of the
millennium, federal agents across the country are conducting
interviews with people who may have information about possible
terrorist attacks, the FBI said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the questioning proceeded, authorities in New York
Thursday charged a man with aiding Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested
earlier this month on explosives charges as he entered Washington
state from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Ghani was charged with concealing his material support of
Ressam and conspiracy to traffic in, and use, fraudulent bank and
credit cards. The US attorney's office in New York said the arrest
was ``part of efforts to pursue all information regarding the risk
of any planned attacks but has not suggested any specific and
credible threats against any particular targets, either in New York
or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Information stemming from the Ressam investigation also led to
the arrest of five Algerian nationals in the Boston area Thursday.
However, the charges were related to immigration issues and not
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning of ``fewer than 100'' individuals nationwide is
part of the ongoing investigation of Ressam, who was arrested Dec.
14 as he crossed into the United Sates with explosives material,
said FBI spokesman Jim Davis. The interviews may go beyond the
Ressam case to involve other potential bombings or attacks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis cautioned that the questioning ``is not a sweep,'' and
added that ``the fact that we're interviewing these people doesn't
mean they're suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviews were conducted Thursday in Massachusetts, New
York, Washington state, Texas, and California, Justice Department
spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning ``sends a little bit of a message that the FBI
is watching here,'' Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of a possible New Year's terrorist attack has lent a grave
undercurrent to what is meant to be a festive occasion, although
law enforcement agencies insist they have no credible evidence of
any specific threat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerns of a terrorist assault have been fueled by the
arrests of Ressam and two others later detained at the Vermont
border. Authorities say both Ressam and one of the individuals
arrested Dec. 19 at the Vermont border, Lucia Garofalo, have links
to an Algerian extremist group.
</P>
<P>
   But Muslim Americans bristled at the questionings, complaining
that the FBI is singling out Muslim, Algerian-Americans. Ressam and
another man, Bouabide Chamchi, who was arrested with Garofalo, are
both Algerian nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims have been made the bogeyman of the day,'' said Ibrahim
Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in
Washington. He said he had received ``scattered reports'' of Muslim
Americans complaining they were intimidated by overzealous FBI
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope this thing will blow over,'' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities allege that Ressam and Garofalo are
connected to the Armed Islamic Group, known by its French acronym,
GIA.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA, considered a terrorist group by the State Department,
is the major Islamic extremist group involved in Algeria's nearly
eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The group has not, however, claimed responsibility for any
attacks in the United States, State Department and academic experts
note. The GIA's wrath is generally aimed at pro-secular government
forces in Algeria, and at France, which the GIA perceives as being
sympathetic to thian government.
</P>
<P>
   With large, New Year's Eve celebrations planned across the
nation, law enforcement officials aren't taking any chances on
security.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh met Thursday in Washington with
Canadian law enforcement officials to ``ensure continuing close
coordination on law enforcement and intelligence issues,'' said an
FBI statement. A Justice Department official played down the
meeting as any kind of master planning session to fight terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was something big, they wouldn't tell you about it,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, police sealed manholes, and removed mailboxes and
newspaper dispensers near Times Square to frustrate would-be
terrorists. Such precautionary measures, however, are taken every
New Year's Eve, said New York Police Department spokesman officer
Chris Cottingham.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, the city is putting 8,000 police on the streets
to patrol the droppping of the ball at midnight _ an event expected
to draw millions of revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were arrested in Brooklyn Thursday by a joint
antiterrorism task force of the New York police and the FBI. Both
the complaint and the charges against the four were sealed by a
federal judge in Manhattan, and New York Police Commissioner Howard
Safir would not discuss details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Washington were quiet Thursday, as police readied
the area around the National Mall for the concert, film and light
show planned for the capital celebration. President Clinton and
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are planning to participate in
the outdoor event as scheduled, regardless of fears over terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never discuss the particulars of security,'' said White
House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``Obviously, law enforcement has
taken the measures necessary'' to protect the Clintons and the rest
of the New Year's Eve celebrants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for Friday, the president hits strongly on a
favorite theme, unity and racial harmony. Citing the legacy of
Abraham Lincoln, Clinton says, ``Let us pledge that each year will
be closer to this, our founding principle. Let us pledge that the
new millennium will bring, in the words of the great emancipator, a
new birth of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to open ceremonies on the Mall this morning, speak to
children and to diplomats in the afternoon, and then host
millennial ceremonies late in the evening and into New Year's Day.

   But Rowe, who is the chief executive of Mount Sinai NYU Health,
has opted instead to work on Friday night at the two hospitals
under his tutelage. Sure, he spent most of 1999 delegating all the
technical and medical preparations for the big night. But he has no
intention of handing over ultimate authority now that it is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my identity,'' Rowe said. ``When people ask me, `Where
were you at the Millennium?' I can say, `I am an academic medicine
administrator and I was in my hospitals.''' And in the spirit of
homecoming week at a suburban high school, during which anyone who
is anyone is seen at the right party, he added: ``All of our senior
executives will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   At any other holiday season, power is measured by the number of
smart party invites received and the relative coolness of one's
vacation plans. Executives take calls from the office, but they do
so on their cell phones from a trendy brasserie in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   But in an odd twist in the corporate power equation, one that
will be played out all over Manhattan on Friday night, the most
important people in an organization are the ones who will be
working. To be away from the office on this New Year's Eve is to be
rendered, in Y2K argot, ``nonessential,'' and what executive wants
that? Not Eugene R. McGrath, the president and chief executive of
Consolidated Edison Inc. Of course he is working, he said. ``Isn't
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, with terrorist threats, computer glitches and
other specters of evil lurking about, an executive's importance in
the corporate hierarchy will often be determined by his skills at
dealing with the highly unlikely. To be essential means to hold the
key to technical problems that will probably not occur, or to have
the only voice at the other end of the line that nervous customers,
who almost certainly will not call, would want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   To be told to show up to do not much of anything denotes a
particular primacy in a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Goldberg, the executive vice president for operations
at Merrill admits that most of what he will do on Friday
night is ``watch the clock turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a subordinate could have been assigned to that task?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well why should I let him do it when I can do it with him?''
said Goldberg, slightly indignant. ``I feel it is an honor having
been given this responsibility to lead Y2K preparedness over the
last four years. That is why I am nervous and excited to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, McGrath of Consolidated Edison could have demanded a
minion crawl out of bed and make it to Times Square by 6 a.m. to
flip the switch that will light the famous falling ball. But why
take away all his fun? ``I want to be the one to do it,'' he said.
``This is a pretty exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   Who decides who is essential? Not the working bee herself,
hopefully. In January 1966, practically moments after he was
inaugurated, Mayor John V. Lindsay found himself in the middle of a
transit strike. The mayor begged commuters to honestly consider
their relative importance and to stay home ``if you're not
essential to your job.'' This was not good psychology. No one
listened anyway, and New Yorkers, who since the beginning of time
have prided themselves on their role in commerce, did not
appreciate the implication.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives have managed to show their best
anti-micromanagement face by boasting that they are leaving Friday
evening for the troops to handle. But many others pointed out that
it would seem a tad unappreciative to assign lower ranking
executives to a night of worrying or boredom while they flitted
about in St. Bart's or otherwise swilled the night away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to be here for several reasons,'' said Rowe,
who presides over Mount Sinai and New York University Hospitals,
which merged last year. ``First, to thank people for their efforts.
Also, I think that if something happens, either technical with Y2K
or in the city related to some disturbance, it is appropriate to
have the CEO there. If in fact something happened, how would you
feel if the CEO was in London?''
</P>
<P>
   Others still cannot quite articulate why they feel the need to
work, but also cannot imagine not being on the job. ``I don't have
to be here,'' admitted Xavier Lividini, the general manager of the
Mayflower Hotel on Central Park West. ``But when I became a hotel
manager, I never thought of New Year's Eve for anything else. My
father was a chef, so I don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many executives, this is the first New Year's Eve in
memory that they have been stuck at work. Most years, Goldberg has
taken advantage of the stony silence on Wall Street and spent the
holiday in his home in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   `I go there, read, walk on the beach and recharge my battery,''
he said. ``Then, I go to bed and get ready for the next walk on the
beach.'' But balmy temperatures and red snapper dinners would pale
in comparison with dinner in Merrill's data center and bringing in
the new century next to colleagues, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard A. Aubrey, president and chief executive of NYU Downtown
Hospital, said the last time he worked New Year's Eve was back in
the 1970s when he was a young budget analyst at the city's Office
of Management and Budget, when New York was suffering a severe
fiscal crisis. That work shift was certainly not a sign of his
power and influence, he recalled, and by the way, it was extremely
bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ``I am not annoyed at all,'' he said. ``It comes with
the territory. I absolutely cannot delegate. It is simply too
important. I feel entirely obligated that me and rest of the senior
management team have to be there.''

 &HT;        Not All Security Assignments Are Fair And Equal   By Laura
J. Winter   c. 1999 States News Service   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 -
<TEXT>
Camera-toting tourists snapping shots of the White House through
the South Lawn's black iron fence seemed oblivious today to what
seemed so obvious to capital residents - more pairs of eyes looking
for bad guys.
<P>
   Algerians arrested at the border, warnings issued by the State
Department. and Seattle's cancellation of its New Year's
celebration have led many here to wonder what will happen on the
Mall during the White House's ``America's Millennium Gala.'' Among
the estimated 2,800 Washington D.C. police officers, the 140
guarded intersections and the 127 emergency services sites, some
presidents have it better than others when it comes to security.
</P>
<P>
   The home of the living president, William Jefferson Clinton, had
every conceivable kind of security. Surrounding the White House was
an army of men in black fatigues and dark sunglasses. Large sport
utility vehicles blocked every point of entry, leading to another
point of entry and so on. Even the bicycle officers looked
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more of a New Year's police presence around,
on the street and up in the air,'' said Santos Tobar, a hot dog
vendor stationed just south of the presidential residence. ``For
now I think there is more security.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, two concentric circles of wood and wire fencing
surrounded the monument to the first president, George Washington.
A lone squad car stood atop the hill watching pyrotechnic
specialists prepare the fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Memorial is slated to serve as stage for the White
House-sponsored New Year's party, produced by Quincy Jones.
Headliners such as Tom Jones, Kenny Rogers and Steven Spielberg
will be surrounded by a maze of chain-linked fencing, grandstands
and security checkpoints manned by more men in black, from the
steps down to the Reflecting Pool.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Jefferson - a.k.a.: the philosopher of the American
Revolution, the third president and the author of the Declaration
of Independence - seemed to be a tidal basin too far to garner any
special protection. His Memorial is quiet but for a few tourists
making the pilgrimage across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity was nothing more than logical to Murray Bloom, a
lawyer for the Transportation Department. The 25-year resident said
he has been jogging through the Mall and to the Jefferson Memorial
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's going to be more people, there's going to be
more security. It makes more sense,'' Bloom said. ``There are a few
more police cars around But for a jogger there really isn't any
problem. You just have to run around more tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said he was going to join the 500,000 strong crowd
expected to attend ``America's Millennium Gala'' Friday night. The
F.B.I., the National Park Police and the other various forms of law
enforcement in and around the Mall aren't saying how many of their
number will watch over the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That was no matter to Paul and Debbie Padgett of Charles County,
Md. They said the president, Clinton, inspired them to attend the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the mayor of Seattle cancelled. And the president is
going to be here. So if he's not afraid, why should anybody else
be?'' said Debbie Padgett.

 &HT;    The best movies of 1999 that largely went ignored
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen and Jim Luksic
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on advance buzz and some of the best reviews of the year,
``The Iron Giant'' should have been one of the biggest hits of the
summer. Instead, the acclaimed animated fable sank like lead at the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers laid down their cash in 1999 for such big-budget
dreck as ``Wild Wild West,'' ``The Mummy'' and ``The Haunting,''
which sadly were among some of the year's top-grossing movies,
while many far superior films were left wanting for an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Daily News film critic Dave Larsen and free-lance
reviewer Jim Luksic list five choices each for films that you
shouldn't have missed this year but most likely did. You can still
catch them on video, and perhaps next time you'll listen to us.
</P>
<P>
   By Dave Larsen
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Iron Giant: The animated adventure about the friendship
between a boy and a giant robot is a rare family film that leaves
you all choked up and wanting to cheer, no matter what your age.
Adapted from the 1968 children's book by British Poet Laureate Ted
Hughes, the well-crafted film's strength is its intelligent story,
which is funny and remarkably moving. Its chief lesson is that
souls don't die.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Go'': Doug Liman's gritty, dark comedy proves that
``Swingers'' was no fluke. The sharp, edgy film involves three
interlocking story lines about young characters whose rash
decisions get them in over their heads, with startling violence the
usual result. Go's overlapping structure recalls ``Pulp Fiction''
as it retraces story elements to connect the tales and hilariously
bring them full circle. It's bravura filmmaking and a fun, wild
ride.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Election'': Fatally touted as a teen comedy, the smart
second feature from writer-director Alexander Payne (''Citizen
Ruth'') is a dark, biting satire of the 1992 U.S. presidential
race, set against the backdrop of a high-school student-council
election. The wicked and witty comedy is extremely funny but
remarkably subtle, allowing gags to emerge organically from the
story instead of beating you over the head with them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Run Lola Run'': A young German woman with a shock of bright
red hair has 20 minutes to reach er and somehow score
100,000 marks along the way, to save his life. Director Tom Twyker
takes us through three breathless scenarios involving a whirl of
dogs, nuns, babies and guns, each playing out in real time with a
different outcome. It's a heart-pounding thrill ride that leaves
one contemplating the capriciousness of fate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``eXistenZ'': David Cronenberg revisits familiar obsessions in
this oddly titled film about a virtual-reality game system that
accesses players' memories, but this time around the director
appears to be having a little fun with his fixations. The creepy,
gruesome sci-fi thriller is pervaded by anxieties about sexuality
and modern life. What's different is Cronenberg's satiric,
self-referential tone, which verges on darkly comic self parody.
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Luksic
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tony Bui's encouraging debut, ``Three Seasons,'' was the first
U.S. feature shot in Vietnam since the war _ and it deserved more
than a one-week stay here last summer. The director's dual tasks
(Bui also penned the script) showcase a keen eye and respect for
his native land. Harvey Keitel holds our interest as a G.I. in
search of his daughter, but the heartbreaker is Don Duong's noble
portrait of a cycle driver.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``My Life So Far,'' set in the rolling hills of Scotland, is
another refined period piece from Chariots of Fire director Hugh
Hudson. Those who couldn't swing a visit to Little Art Theatre last
month missed a poignant, witty drama, fortified by winning
performances from Colin Firth, Irene Jacob and youngster Robert
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amid the hoopla of Pokemon, the animated Japanese wonder
``Princess Mononoke'' got lost in the shuffle.r as its
premise is mature and multi-layered _ and its running time over two
hours _ the spectacle isn't exactly for little ones. That shouldn't
stop adults and adolescents from appreciating Mononoke's meaningful
story and grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  I would be remiss not to plug the French beauty ``Autumn
Tale'' again. Eric Rohmer's final chapter of his Tale of Four
Seasons quartet, a cinematic bouquet about love and its nuances,
should be studied by budding filmmakers and enjoyed by casual
viewers _ even those harboring a fear of subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last but not least is ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' which managed to
slip past the Dayton market entirely. Don't presume the worst: It's
a well-written, leisurely paced and intensely acted (Woody
Harrelson, Billy Crudup) western that examines passion, envy and
loyalty in a genuine, unflinching manner. Clint Eastwood and
novelist Max Evans would be proud.

   When the clock strikes 12, the future will arrive! In science
fiction and in popular superstition, the 21st century has long
signified the dark dawning of a sterile new age, a major
post-technological, post-informational, post-emotional something or
other. After Friday night, it will signify little more than a new
Month-At-A-Glance, and maybe a bit of a hangover. That was why the
Wachowskis set their futuristic blockbuster, ``The Matrix,'' in the
22d century. They knew the 21st was on the way to passe.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be television's style to let this major perceptual
shift occur without massive fanfare, now would it? Particularly
because surveys show that most of us plan to pass the apocalypse
quietly at home, greeting the future in the electronic warmth of
the global hearth. TV will milk the changing of the millennium for
all it's worth, with more ``statement'' programming and
oh-so-momentous news coverage than seems possible. Indeed, in a
rare feat, almost every single TV outlet will have the exact same
thing on its mind, as channels ranging from TBS and CNN to TCM and
MTV pay homage to the worldwide event in their own ways. Even the
Cartoon Network is joining the fray. Its choice? ``The Jetsons,''
natch.
</P>
<P>
   What will be on your screen at the moment the future arrives?
Here is a partial listing of options _ and there are many. Alas, a
few sound as exciting as Jerry Lewis's Labor Day telethon, so be
sure to keep your remote at hand. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Realism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Will he make it? Watching Peter Jennings survive 24 hours on
TV may be more interesting than ABC's Life-magazine-esque survey of
world cultures, past, present, and future. The idea is that
Jennings will anchor the endoadcast, and cut to reporters
like Barbara Walters and Sam Donaldson and performers like Elton
John and Andrea Bocelli in farflug places around the globe. The
``ABC 2000'' celebration begins at 4:50 a.m., and along its merry
way it will pay Dick Clark a visit for his Times Square countdown.
Go ahead, Peter, yawn.
</P>
<P>
   --CBS is taking more of a piecemeal approach. Today's news shows
will focus on things millennium, and news briefs anchored by Dan
Rather will pop in and out of regular programming every hour after
11 a.m. David Letterman's ``Late Show'' will air at the early time
of 8 p.m., followed inexplicably at 9 by a collection of special
moments in Grammy Award history. Then, at 10, the network will
shift into a three-hour special called ``America's Millennium,''
including live coverage of a Washington, D.C., gala featuring Will
Smith and a short film by Steven Spielberg. Oh yes, and a
Billennium address by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   --After expanding ``The Today Show'' to three hours, NBC will
pepper its regular programming with hourly remarks from
correspondents around the world. At 8 p.m., ``Dateline'' will offer
up predictions for the next millennium (how about: ``newsmagazines
will become extinct'') and at 9, Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw will
host the two-hour report ``Millennium Special.'' You know, Y2K
developments, celebrities spouting timeless profundities, and so
on. After local news at 11, and a monologue by Jay Leno on ``The
Tonight Show'' at 11:35, the network will head over to Times Square
for millennium mania until 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   --Does Fox, home of ``The World's Wildest Police Videos'' and
``Greed,'' have taste and restraint? Tonight, anyway, the network
is restricting its coverage to a 90-minute show called ``Fox
2000,'' with Paula Zahn and Brit Hume anchoring from Times Square.
Expect the Red Hot Chili Peppers in LA, the Neville Brothers in New
Orleans, and Y2K updates from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   --Pax TV, the network that thrives on reruns of ``Touched by an
Angel,'' is hipping itself up today with ``Millennium Live:
Humanity's Broadcast,'' beginning at 6 a.m. from Fiji. The 24-hour
broadcast features celebrations in 24 time zones, with performances
by Aerosmith, 'N Sync, the Bee Gees, the Spice Girls, and Santana,
and it will wind up in Hawaii. Technically, the show is produced by
an international consortium of broadcasters and Pax TV is the US
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-four hours? Big deal. PBS one-ups ABC and Pax TV with a
25-hour live special, beginning at 4:40 a.m. Called ``Millennium
2000,'' it will mark the new year every hour from a different
place, including the South Pole. Look for concert performances
along the way by Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt, and Sting, and a freedom
celebration with Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   --OK, CNN, you win. The cable channel's ``CNN Millennium 2000''
project will last for a whopping 100 hours and employ some 60
correspondents, beginning at 5 a.m. and ending on Tuesday morning.
After the first 24 hours, coverage will move from the New Year's
celebrations to reports on the last 1,000 years and guesses about
the future. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Escapism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to avoid the timely hype, then travel no
further than cable, where time never seems to matter anyway. Cable
is TV's archive, from the rock moments on VH1 to the film festivals
on American Movie Classics. And so many of these channels will mine
their catalogs for some witty, gimmicky, and self-promotional New
Year's Eve programming.
</P>
<P>
   --The Cartoon Network takes the clever prize, as it continues to
air episodes of ``The Jetsons'' nonstop until midnight. The
Hanna-Barbera series gives us a stereotypical American family in
the century we're about to enter, with utterly fantastic gadgetry
like talking computers and videophones. ``The Jetsons'' as
prophecy? I'll believe it when I meet Rosie the maid.
</P>
<P>
   --At the other end of the cartoon spectrum, Comedy Central is
airing a four-episode ``South Park'' minimarathon. Those
trash-talking kids would eat Elroy for dinner. Tonight they'll ply
their subversive trade from 10 to just before midnight, when the
channel will go ``live'' to South Park, Colo., for a bleeping
countdown.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're anxious about the start of the new millennium, you
won't find a more soothing, down-home figure than Andy Taylor,
loving dad, shrewd sheriff, respectful nephew, and all-round local
Buddha figure. TBS is airing back-to-back episodes of ``The Andy
Griffith Show'' until midnight, when the station loses the rights
to broadcast the series. Food for thought: What would Otis look
like the morning after his millennial New Year's fun?
</P>
<P>
   --Turner Classic Movies pays homage to the Most Famous Hip
Shaker and Bloated Icon of the Millennium, also known as Elvis
Presley. ``Rockin' in the New Year with Elvis'' is an eight-movie
King-a-thon, including ``Girl Happy,'' ``Jailhouse Rock'' and
``Viva Las Vegas.'' The festivities begin at 2 p.m. with ``The
Trouble with Girls.'' Memo to TCM: Thangyouverymuch.
</P>
<P>
   --Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk. After a 10:05 p.m. airing of ``A Shot in the
Dark,'' Blake Edwards's second Inspector Clouseau movie, American
Movie Classics will begin a four-hour ``Three Stooges Marathon.''
It's hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   --The Movie Channel is doling out horror thrills for those who
want to cloak themselves in denial on the eve of a possible
worldwide infrastructural disaster. Starting at 6 p.m., the ``Y2K
Go Away'' marathon features eight movies in the ``Friday the 13th''
series, finishing up with ``Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes
Manhattan'' at 4:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   --Meanwhile, beginning at 8 p.m., Showtime will be doing its
best to raise apocalypse fever with an ``End of the World
Marathon,'' including the movies ``Hard Rain,'' ``Deep Impact,''
and, at midnight, the 1998 remake of ``Godzilla.'' They named it
after that R.E.M. song, ``It's the End of the World as We Know It
(and I Feel Terrified).''
</P>
<P>
   --Bugged by the whole Y2K enchilada? The Discovery Channel is
running a seven-hour marathon of documentaries on bugs, from ants
and killer bees to cannibal mites and tarantulas. The swarm of
shows begins at 7 p.m. Can't wait for the bloodsucking parasites.
</P>
<P>
   --For real creeps, and intelligent creeps, of course, you can't
do better than ``The Twilight Zone.'' Beginning at 9 a.m., The
Sci-Fi Channel is airing ``Twilight Zone _ Chain Reaction,'' a
20-episode marathon of Rod Serling's classic modern-nightmare
series. The midnight episode is ``I Sing the Body Electric,'' in
which a widower buys his children a grandmother who isn't quite
human. Rosie the maid, I presume? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rockism
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to a concert this decade, never mind this
year, you can make up for it tonight. While most of the
telethon-styled network shows will include musical clips within
their overall millennial coverage, one or two outlets know what
really matters.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you think Whatshisname will sing ``1999''? And will he
change the lyrics from ``like'' to ``'cause''? ``The RAVE un2 The
Year 2000'' showcases The Artist in a pay-per-view concert from his
Paisley Park Studio in Minneapolis, at 10 p.m. Guests include the
Family Stone, the Time, and Mavis Staples. By the way, the Artist
won't be workingh of a sweat tonight: the concert was
recorded on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   --Par-tay, dudes! ``MTV 2 Large'' does justice to the Millennium
bash from MTV's Time Square Studio with a few hot teenybopper acts
in attendance, including Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys,
98 Degrees, and others. Also, Puff Daddy, arrested on a weapons
charge this week, is still planning to appear. And the beat goes
on, beginning at 5 p.m. &QL; 
 &QL; 
For kids
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --An online poll will determine the specific shows to be aired
on ``Z2K: Zoogin' New Yearz Eve Party,'' a five-hour marathon of
the young people's choice on the Disney Channel beginning at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   --A 24-hour commercial-free documentary called ``Nickellennium''
will begin on Nickelodeon at midnight. Kids from around the world
will share fears and fantasies about the future.

   BELMONT, Mass. _ If a wealthy couple were putting up the
69,000-square-foot edifice of finest Sardinian granite now rising
on the highest point of this Boston suburb, they might face
complaints from neighbors. But not a constitutional lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is under way, however, because the builder is a
church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and when
neighbors tried to halt construction, they found themselves blocked
by a state law that gives religious organizations, along with
certain other institutions, immunity from many local zoning
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Oral arguments are scheduled to be heard on Monday before the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. No matter how the
court rules, a lawyer for neighborhood residents said, the case
will probably to be appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the Belmont neighborhood have argued that a huge
institutional building, brightly lit and with more than 200 parking
places, does not belong in an area otherwise zoned for
single-family houses. They said the law violated the Constitution's
separation of church and state by giving religious groups an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As Mark A. White, a lawyer for the neighbors, put it: ``If an
atheist group wanted to put up a cathedral-size building to extol
the virtues of atheism and have chanting sessions about the virtues
of atheism, they couldn't do it. So there's no way you can't say
this is a huge advantage for religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church, backed by a panoply of other religious groups
from Jews to Roman Catholics to Baptists to Christian Scientists,
has countered that such zoning protections were needed to prevent
discrimination by local boards against religions they did not like.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Harvey, a spokesman on legal affairs for the Mormon
Church, said the Massachusetts law and others like it around the
country have helped to keep institutions like churches and schools
in residential neighborhoods, and that has helped foster strong
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something George Washington fought for; this is
something Thomas Jefferson wrote about,'' Harvey said, ``These are
fundamental principleso to the very fiber and meaning of
what this country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Two currents seem to collide in the Belmont dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church, which is expanding rapidly, is on a building
campaign, with 17 temples planned or under construction across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are about 100 temples worldwide, the church said.
They are used not as everyday churches _ the Mormons have about
16,000 of those, known as meeting houses _ but for special
ceremonies like baptisms and marriages. Only church members in good
standing are allowed in, and once inside, they change into white
clothing and go through ceremonies on behalf of themselves or their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, community groups have become more active and
have become increasingly concerned by special zoning treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be an increasing number of legal conflicts
between religious institutions and citizens who, for standard
land-use and quality-of-life reasons _ such as congestion, noise or
parking _ oppose the action the religious institution wants to
take,'' said Prof. Jerold S. Kayden, an urban planning expert at
Harvard University who is not involved in the Belmont dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case,'' Kayden said, ``the local community has been
deprived of a standard tool that it can wield for virtually any
other land use, and one has to ask why, why should religion get
this thumb on its side of the scale?''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's response: ``The state made a decision years ago that
some uses of property are so important they didn't want to give
local governments the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law, known as the Dover Amendment, says that
religious and educational institutions are not subject to the same
restrictions as other developments. So a church or synagogue, for
example, could be built in a single-family neighborhood, where a
supermarket or an office building could not.
</P>
<P>
   The law also gives such advantages to several other groups,
including day care centers, farms and homes for the elderly, which
shows, its defenders say, that it is not specifically pro-religion.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors opposing the building maintain that the law mainly
favors religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any significant evidence recently of
discrimination against Methodists or Presbyterians,'' said G.
Michael Pierce, a lawyer for the neighbors. ``And yet that's the
theory that runs through every amicus brief, that if this is struck
down, whole sections of every community are going to be made
inaccessible to major religions because of all the discrimination
against religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pierce said, ``People may attempt to regulate the
negative impact of massive construction in neighborhoods, but it's
not going to have anything to do with the fact that people are
against a certain religion. This turns the phrase `discrimination'
on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Bennett, bishop of the Belmont ward of the Mormon Church,
said some anti-Mormon sentiment had surfaced during the
neighborhood meetings about the temple, including some individuals
handing out pamphlets containing ``vitriolic anti-Mormon
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors also had expressed concern that Mormons would
flood the neighborhood, Bennett said, and he had explained that a
temple no more brings an influx of Mormons than a cathedral brings
an influx of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he was convinced there was no prejudice among the
residents, and ``I think the feeling would be equally strong if
this were a school or elderly housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which had owned the hilltop land for several years,
has tried to appease neighbors, Bennett said. It reduced the
building's size to 69,000 square feet from 94,000 square feet, cut
the number of spires to one from six and put a third of the
building underground.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for some neighbors, it has become a matter of
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I owned this land, I couldn't build an Elks' Lodge or a
Veterans of Foreign Wars hall because places of assembly are not
allowed in residential neighborhoods,'' said Charles Counselman, a
neighborhood resident and a professor of planetary science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``But just because the
temple was a religious institution, it was allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning battle here is similar to a fight in Harrison, N.Y.,
where a proposed temple has sparked neighborhood opposition.
</P>
<P>
   As the Belmont suit has made its way through the courts,
construction on the $26 million temple, meant to serve the 41,000
Mormons of New England, has continued. It is more than two-thirds
done and is expected to open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like a gamble to build with a lawsuit pending, but
the church decided not to delay. White admitted that even if the
neighbors win, ``Do I think the court will make them tear the
temple down? Doubtful.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (6-9) at Green Bay (7-8)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Cardinals have nine fumble giveaways. The Packers'
Dorsey Levens has 68 catches.Comment: It is impossible to truly say
that players in the violent sport of professional football, which
requires large amounts of courage, ever quit. But the Cardinals are
playing lackluster football right now and look as if they simply do
not care. The Packers win, and they are in the playoffs. Plus,
Arizona plays terribly in cold weather. This all adds up to a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Packers, 28-10
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (8-7) at New England (7-8)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Ravens' Rod Woodson has seven interceptions. The
Patriots have the No. 2 pass offense
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Brian Billick may have quietly done the best coaching
job in the league this year. The fact the Ravens could finish with
nine victories is stunning. Baltimore is doing it with defense,
allowing just three touchdown runs in the past 43 quarters.
Meanwhile, the Patriots suspended wide receiver Terry Glenn, their
main offensive weapon, for violating team rules and he will miss
the game. New England is struggling and coach Pete Carroll is on
his way out.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Ravens, 26-20
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (4-11) at Jacksonville (13-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Bengals are the No. 3 rushing team. The Jaguars
are the No. 2 rushing team.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell gets a rest and Jay
Fiedler gets the start. This is a dangerous game. The Bengals are
making their usual late-season run and the team is 9-5 in December
under coach Bruce Coslet. Jacksonville wins a close one for two
reasons. They average 130 yards a game rushing and the Jaguars have
won 27 of 31 games at home, as well as 14 of 18 division contests.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Jaguars, 22-21
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (8-7) at Minnesota (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Lions have six playoff berths this decade. The
Vikings average 6.25 yards on first down.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: One of a handful of games with serious playoff
implications. Both teams are in, with Detroit needing a victory to
clinch a first-round home game, and Minnesota needing a victory and
a Tampa Bay loss to win the division and a first-round bye. Coach
Dennis Green's abilities as a coach continue to be underestimated.
The Vikings are peaking at the right time and the coaching staff is
opening up the offense and protecting Jeff George by keeping in
more blockers. They won't blow this chance.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Vikings, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (13-2) at Buffalo (10-5)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Colts running back Edgerrin James has 1,503 yards
rushing. The Bills are 5-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Buffalo does well against division rivals at home,
winning seven of its last eight against AFC East opponents. This
game will be different. The Bills have clinched a playoff berth and
there is little they have to play for. The Colts, meanwhile, still
have a chance to clinch home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs. The team is somewhat embarrassed by how it barely beat
Cleveland last week. The Colts will be much sharper this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Colts, 16-13
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (3-12) at Carolina (7-8)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stat: The Panthers have the third ranked pass offense.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Carolina can still get a playoff spot but they need the
realignment of several celestial bodies to do so. The Panthers do
not need the sun and the moon to move to beat the Saints. New
Orleans did beat Dallas last week, but that was more because Dallas
took the sorry Saints for granted than anything else. The Panthers
win and then cross their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Panthers, 25-14
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (7-8) at Kansas City (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Raiders have the No. 1 rushing offense. The
Chiefs have a plus-20 turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: It is a lot to ask of the Raiders to travel to
Arrowhead Stadium and beat Kansas City when the Chiefs need the
game to make the playoffs. Kansas City is tough at home because
they like to run the ball on that beautiful grass field. Kansas
City can win the division with a Seattle loss or tie to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chiefs, 20-14
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (13-2) at Philadelphia (4-11)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Rams have scored 495 points. The Eagles have 39
takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Rams coach Dick Vermeil said this week that sometimes
he pinches himself, disbelieving just how fast and good this Rams
team is. They are also disciplined, which means there will not be a
letdown. Vermeil will cry himself another puddle returning to his
old coaching stomping grounds. When his team gets the 19 points it
needs to move into third place on the all-time season scoring list,
the tears will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Rams, 38-16
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (9-6) at Jets (7-8)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Seahawks have 31 interceptions in last 14 games.
The Jets have won seven of past eight December games
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Quarterback Ray Lucas is 5-3 as a starter. He is a
legitimate starter in the NFL . The reason the Jets are hot right
now is because of Lucas, who has thrown only one interception in
his last 187 attempts. Unfortunately, the magic runs out this week.
The Jets are out of the playoff race but Seattle is not. Running
back Ricky Watters is questionable with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Seahawks, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (10-5) at Chicago (6-9)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stat: The Buccaneers have won seven of last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The Buccaneers have already secured a playoff spot.
They are playing for the division title, and can win it if they
beat the Bears or if Minnesota loses. The team's division destiny
is in its own hands, which of course makes for a terrific
incentive. Tampa Bay rides its NFC best defense to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Buccaneers, 15-6

FIVE HELD FOR POSSIBLE LINK TO ALLEGED EXPLOSIVES SMUGGLING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal agents detained five Algerian nationals
Thursday after their names surfaced in connection with an Algerian
man accused of attempting to smuggle explosives from Canada into
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   All five were in custody on a variety of immigration offenses.
Sources said none of them have been tied to a terrorist plot, and
no weapons or bomb-making materials were recovered in searches of
several residences in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston arrests came during a coordinated effort among FBI
agents in cities from California to New York, looking for
associates of Ahmed Ressam, the suspect in the Washington
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   However, only the sweeps in Boston and Brooklyn, N.Y., however,
yielded any arrests, said Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of
the FBI's Boston office. The sweep came on the last day of the
year, just before federal courts closed for the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Boston US Attorney Donald K.
Stern said that each of the arrests was routine. But the morning
arrest in Boston's Brighton section employed an unusual display of
law enforcement resources _ including Boston and State Police, a
helicopter and federal agents with guns drawn as they chased a
fleeing suspect in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events suggest there is a heightened risk that
individuals might be planning attacks,'' said Mawn; therefore, the
bureau is ``aggressively pursuing all information and leads in
hopes of preventing any acts of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement authorities still lack ``specific, credible
evidence'' that terrorism is being plotted here or anywhere else in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the men were arrested a day before the holiday weekend,
Stern and Mawn discounted any suggestion that federal authorities
timed the sweep to keep them in custody during New Year's
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was more appropriate to have done it three days ago, the
bureau would have done it,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The undocumented immigrants taken into custody were Mouai
Badredine, who was arrested after a chase in Brighton, and Ouali
Mohamed Abdel Aziz 26, and Lahouari Haoud, 31, who were captured in
their homes in East Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Mouhamed Oukina, 35 and Amine Touarsi, 28, were also
taken into custody. FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkewicz did not know
the location of their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn declined to say what connection the five might have to
Ressam, but he said some of them know one another.
</P>
<P>
   While the offenses of the five ranged from carrying expired
visas _ a civil infraction _ to possession of fake immigration
documents, all will remain behind bars until at least Tuesday, when
bail hearings are scheduled for two of the men, and immigration
hearings are expected to be docketed for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Badredine, who was ordered to leave the country months ago,
faces immediate deportation, said Dennis Reardon, assistant special
agent in charge of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The drama unfolded Thursday morning when INS agents went to a
Brighton moving company to serve a warrant to deport Badredine. But
when Badredine recognized one of the INS agents, he sprinted toward
a row of apartment buildings in the 1400 block of Commonwealth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:15 a.m., the FBI asked Boston police for help and soon
there were dozens of police cruisers and police dogs combing the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who work for a uniform delivery service said they saw a
plainclothes police officer jump out of his unmarked cruiser on
Brighton Avenue and chase Badredine down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept walking like he was going to get coffee,'' said
Wil Rolfe, 30, driver of the uniform truck.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen police cars in pursuit, witnesses said,
Badredine ran into an apartment building at 1409 Commonwealth.
Residents said they were shocked to walk out of their building and
see a row of investigators with guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, Ed Thornburn, said he was frustrated that no one
would tell him what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police won't tell you in your own town what's going on,
but they got the shotguns out and they look like they're ready to
shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Badredine was cornered in a stairwell of the building and
brought out the rear entrance about 8:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   INS agent Reardon said Badredine came to the US aboard a
commercial freighter at least six months ago, jumping ship in
Boston. Badredine already had a hearing in immigration court and
was deported, but he apparently ignored the order.
</P>
<P>
   In East Boston, the arrests of Aziz, 26, and Haoud, 31, were
more orderly.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, who said he works as a gas station cashier, was taken into
custody after agents sent to question him at 7 a.m. discovered that
he has been in the United States illegally since October 1997, when
he swam ashore from an Algerian natural gas tanker docked in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Haoud, who said in court that he repairs electric motors at a
machine shop, was arrested when agents, alerted by his nervous
behavior, noticed that the green card he held actually belonged to
a Colombian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Haoud entered the US in March 1995 on a six-month tourist visa,
and said he recently paid $200 for a black-market green card to
help him get a better job, according to court records.

 UNDATED: Buccaneers, 15-6. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Giants (7-8) at Cowboys (7-8)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stat: Cowboys allow 3.4 yards per rush
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: All the Cowboys need to do is win and they make the
playoffs. But that was basically the situation when the team laid
an egg last week in New Orleans. It is difficult to tell which team
will show up against the Giants, the one that hammered Miami on
Thanksgiving Day or the team that was beaten by New Orleans. The
Giants will probably play one of their best games of the year. New
York players said this week that their practices were as sharp as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Giants, 24-21
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-6) at Washington (9-6)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: Dolphins kicker Olindo Mare has 140 points. The
Redskins have made 320 first downs
</P>
<P>
   The story lines in this game are numerous. It could be the last
game for either Dan Marino or Jimmy Johnson or both. Redskins coach
Norv Turner will return next year but much of his staff may not.
What matters most is that Miami is not playing well right now.
Their defense, once one of the best in the AFC, has fallen apart.
And the team probably still has not recovered from losing to the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Redskins, 30-20
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (7-8) at Denver (6-9)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Chargers have won three of their last four. The
Broncos have recorded 47 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The angriest man on the planet right now is San Diego
linebacker Junior Seau. He did not make the Pro Bowl despite having
an excellent year and Seau is making opponents pay for the
oversight. He leads a defense that allows just 85.1 yards a game on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Chargers, 18-14
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (12-3) at Pittsburgh (6-9)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The Titans have won 14 of their last 15 division
games. The Steelers have the second-ranked pass defense
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Pittsburgh has won four of the last five home games
against Tennessee but this is a different Titans team. Quarterback
Steve McNair is playing with extreme confidence and running back
Eddie George's 13 touchdowns are the most in franchise history
since Earl Campbell had 13 in 1980. This is a team on a roll that
may go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: Titans, 25-10
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (4-11) at Atlanta (4-11)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stats: The 49ers have scored 100 points in their last four
games. The Falcons have allowed an NFL-low 104 return yards.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The only good news coming from this miserable game is
the fact that Jerry Rice is playing well again. His reception
streak continues as he has caught at least one pass in 208 straight
games. Atlanta's only hope is to use their speed, especially at the
wide receiver position, and physically pound a very bad Sanisco offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Game Score: 49ers, 17-10

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the glittering envelope arrived earlier this
month, Dr. John W. Rowe admitted he was tempted. It held the
invitation for a fancy New Year's Eve party in London, to be given
by some old friends. His wife leapt to pull out the suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowe, who is the chief executive of Mount Sinai NYU Health,
has opted instead to work on Friday night at the two hospitals
under his tutelage. Sure, he spent most of 1999 delegating all the
technical and medical preparations for the big night. But he has no
intention of handing over ultimate authority now that it is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my identity,'' Rowe said. ``When people ask me, `Where
were you at the Millennium?' I can say, `I am an academic medicine
administrator and I was in my hospitals.''' And in the spirit of
homecoming week at a suburban high school, during which anyone who
is anyone is seen at the right party, he added: ``All of our senior
executives will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   At any other holiday season, power is measured by the number of
smart party invites received and the relative coolness of one's
vacation plans. Executives take calls from the office, but they do
so on their cell phones from a trendy brasserie in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   But in an odd twist in the corporate power equation, one that
will be played out all over Manhattan on Friday night, the most
important people in an organization are the ones who will be
working. To be away from the office on this New Year's Eve is to be
rendered, in Y2K argot, ``nonessential,'' and what executive wants
that? Not Eugene R. McGrath, the president and chief executive of
Consolidated Edison Inc. Of course he is working, he said. ``Isn't
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, with terrorist threats, computer glitches and
other specters of evil lurking about, an executive's importance in
the corporate hierarchy will often be determined by his skills at
dealing with the highly unlikely. To be essential means to hold the
key to technical problems that will probably not occur, or to have
the only voice at the other end of the line that nervous customers,
who almost certainly will not call, would want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   To be told to show up to do not much of anything denotes a
particular primacy in a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Edward L. Goldberg, the executive vice president for operations
at Merrill Lynch, admits that most of what he will do on Friday
night is ``watch the clock turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a subordinate could have been assigned to that task?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well why should I let him do it when I can do it with him?''
said Goldberg, slightly indignant. ``I feel it is an honor having
been given this responsibility to lead Y2K preparedness over the
last four years. That is why I am nervous and excited to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, McGrath of Consolidated Edison could have demanded a
minion crawl out of bed and make it to Times Square by 6 a.m. to
flip the switch that will light the famous falling ball. But why
take away all his fun? ``I want to be the one to do it,'' he said.
``This is a pretty exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   Who decides who is essential? Not the working bee herself,
hopefully. In January 1966, practically moments after he was
inaugurated, Mayor John V. Lindsay found himself in the middle of a
transit strike. The mayor begged commuters to honestly consider
their relative importance and to stay home ``if you're not
essential to your job.'' This was not good psychology. No one
listened anyway, and New Yorkers, who since the beginning of time
have prided themselves on their role in commerce, did not
appreciate the implication.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives have managed to show their best
anti-micromanagement face by boasting that they are leaving Friday
evening for the troops to handle. But many others pointed out that
it would seem a tad unappreciative to assign lower ranking
executives to a night of worrying or boredom while they flitted
about in St. Bart's or otherwise swilled the night away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to be here for several reasons,'' said Rowe,
who presides over Mount Sinai and New York University Hospitals,
which merged last year. ``First, to thank people for their efforts.
Also, I think that if something happens, either technical with Y2K
or in the city related to some disturbance, it is appropriate to
have the CEO there. If in fact something happened, how would you
feel if the CEO was in London?''
</P>
<P>
   Others still cannot quite articulate why they feel the need to
work, but also cannot imagine not being on the job. ``I don't have
to be here,'' admitted Xavier Lividini, the general manager of the
Mayflower Hotel on Central Park West. ``But when I became a hotel
manager, I never thought of New Year's Eve for anything else. My
father was a chef, so I don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many executives, this is the first New Year's Eve in
memory that they have been stuck at work. Most years, Goldberg has
taken advantage of the stony silence on Wall Street and spent the
holiday in his home in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   `I go there, read, walk on the beach and recharge my battery,''
he said. ``Then, I go to bed and get ready for the next walk on the
beach.'' But balmy temperatures and red snapper dinners would pale
in comparison with dinner in Merrill's data center and bringing in
the new century next to colleagues, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard A. Aubrey, president and chief executive of NYU Downtown
Hospital, said the last time he worked New Year's Eve was back in
the 1970s when he was a young budget analyst at the city's Office
of Management and Budget, when New York was suffering a severe
fiscal crisis. That work shift was certainly not a sign of his
power and influence, he recalled, and by the way, it was extremely
bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ``I am not annoyed at all,'' he said. ``It comes with
the territory. I absolutely cannot delegate. It is simply too
important. I feel entirely obligated that me and rest of the senior
management team have to be there.''

   New year to send Florida man up, up, away
</P>
<P>
   By Ron Hayes
</P>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Unlike those of us who are very Y2K cautious _
or even Y2K cowardly _ Paul Herrick is actually looking forward to
being in the air when the clock strikes midnight tonight on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a plane, you understand. In the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like an obvious thing to do,'' he says in a
quiet, no-big-deal voice, ``after 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1959, Herrick and two fellow
paratroopers jumped from an Army helicopter at Fort Campbell, Ky.,
timing the leap so they'd be free-falling through space as 1960
began.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, they did this for a very good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a publicity stunt,'' Herrick explains.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick and his colleagues were helping develop the army's HALO
program for special forces units. High Altitude, Low Opening. Jump
high, open low, and you're less likely to be seen by the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   That New Year's Eve, they jumped at 8,000 feet, opened their
chutes at 2,000 feet and landed just the kind of publicity the U.S.
Army wanted in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick was 21 then. The Jupiter resident is 61 now, a retired
aeronautics engineer for Pratt &AMP; Whitney, and this New Year's Eve
he's going to do it again, HALO.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time it was ever done,'' he reasons, ``and
this will be the first time it was ever done by a person who did it
40 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Herrick won't have a military helicopter to
jump from, or Fort Campbell, Ky., to land on. He'll have a
six-passenger, twin-engineer Piper Seneca and North County Airport.
The plane will be piloted by his friend, Dave O'Brien, who'll be in
contact with Palm Beach International Airport, which will be in
contact with the National Bureau of Standards clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'll know exactly when it's 15 seconds to midnight, and
I'll dive out the door and free-fall for 30 or 40 seconds,''
Herrick says. ``That's what I did before, and what I want to do
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he'd like to have recreated the jump back at Fort
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the army said it was a good idea, but then as it got
closer and closer, they backed out of it,'' Herrick says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an e-mail that said the 18th Airborne corps commander
was concerned about having his aircraft in the air at midnight New
Year's Eve.''
</P>

RICE PRICES HIT SIX-YEAR LOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The price of unmilled rice this week bumped the bottom
on the futures and cash markets, hitting a six-year low for the
food crop.
</P>
<P>
   What is termed ``rough rice'' settled Thursday at $5.14 per 100
pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade, after dropping to $5.06 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   January's futures contract has been drifting continuously
downward, with only an occasional blip in either direction since
the contract high of $7.15 in June, according to Jay Davis of East
Bernard Rice Marketing in eastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very cheap prices,'' said Davis, who also is a
commodity broker. Cash prices closely follow the futures price, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go back to the first half of 1993 to find lower
prices, when rough rice futures were as low as $4.75 to $4.86 per
hundredweight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem then was overproduction of rice in 1992, combined
with one of the poorest export markets in a long time, Davis said.
But by December 1993, the price was up to $13 because of small
plantings in the United States and a scare about bad growing
weather in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly this year, there were big rice crops harvested in the
United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the Mississippi delta regions of Arkansas, Missouri
and Mississippi boosted their rice acres this spring as they cut
back on too-cheap soybeans, grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Texas, where the amount of harvested rice shrunk by
24,000 acres from the year before, the harvest was bigger because
of favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
   Government statisticians estimate the Texas crop at 16.3 million
hundredweight vs. 15.8 million in 1998, gathered from 259,000 acres
vs. 283,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   As the result of a big national harvest, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is predicting that the amount of rice being carried
over from one season to the next by farmers and mills will be more
than twice the size of the previous carryover.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has good export markets, but they are
relatively fixed in size and are unable to take this excess
production out of circulation, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is still fighting sanctions that deter sales to
Iran and Cuba, two potentially huge markets, Davis said. Iran
recently bought 300,000 metric tons from Thailand, an export
competitor, he said, and two delegations sent to Cuba have failed
to produce sales there.

RICH, FAMOUS FLOCK TO CUP FETE, DATELINE EVENT

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ All ``Millennium Eve Day,'' as local
radio stations hyped it, the Bill Gates-watch was on along this
teaming America's Cup waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. A pantheon of the rich and famous _ many in their
mega-yachts _ have converged here to take part in an unorganized
flotilla to mark the turn of the century at the port city closest
to the International Dateline.
</P>
<P>
   While Auckland is about 400 miles away from the dateline, the
New Zealand island of Chatham is virtually astride it, making the
small Pacific atoll a convergence points for boats and airplanes
chartered to take partiers to the first second of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got married three years ago,'' said Fran Laconte, a Los
Angeles attorney who spent Thursday worrying whether the stormy
conditions would scrub her plans to take a charter flight over he
dateline. ``We put off our honeymoon until now. We've had this
planned for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Gates was to take his place among the other glitterti _
or if he had slipped in without a yacht of his own _ even
waterfront officials were not sure. The billionaire software
magnate remained present in rumor only.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, hundreds of thousands of spectators
converged on Viaduct Basin, the heart of the Auckland waterfront,
which has been rebuilt in the last five years to accommodate the
largest America's Cup to be held in the 150-year history of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   And while the yachts were gathering here from as far away as the
Mediterranean, South Africa, and the Cayman Islands, spectators
gawked along the waterfront walkways as a big northeasterly wind
billowed the flags and banners suspended high over the port from
crane booms.
</P>
<P>
   Present and preparing to party Thursday was the Dutch built
``Itaska, chartered by former William Simon, former US treasury
secretary. Down the row of docks was the 175-foot ``Hyperion''
owned by Netscape founder Jim Clark and already legendary from its
role in the best-selling book ``The New New Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roller Bearings magnate John Thompson had his 150-foot launch
``Affinity'' stern-to in its dock right beside ``Independence,''
the yacht of Amway founder Richard DeVos.
</P>
<P>
   Yachtless at the moment, but very much present on this
waterfront scene was Bill Koch, winner of the 1992 America's Cup
who founded the first all-women's sailing team in 1995. Some may
remember him more for a vivid legal wrangle he had with a mistress
over the matter of trying to evict her from a condominium he owned.
</P>
<P>
   Having done a tune up sail with America's Cup challenger Dawn
Riley in her San Francisco boat ``AmericaTrue'' on Wednesday, Koch
said he was just as happy to spend the millennium land-bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to be sailing on'' a cup contender again, he
said. ``But it was also great at the end of the day to step off the
boat and leave it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world's eyes train on this city, possibly as the canary
in the coal mine at Y2K hour, Auckland natives admit to becoming
somewhat self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinea pigs,'' is how Gary Henry terms he and fellow Kiwis.
Henry is general manager of the National Women's Hospital, was being carefully monitored electronically by hospitals around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Auckland's Y2K Readiness Commission was poised, as the hours
clicked down, to send vital information out to the international
community regarding computer electronics and any other relevant
data arising from the millennium midnight.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Kofi Annan, a soft-spoken aristocrat from
Ghana, was elected the seventh secretary-general of the United
Nations three years ago, the quiet insider with a gentle sense of
humor was welcomed as a healer in an organization raked by derision
from American politicians and unsettled by an ugly Clinton
administration campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with two more years to go in his first term, Annan is
turning out to be one of the most provocative leaders the United
Nations has known.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who prefer tamer secretarys-general, Annan sets off
alarms with speeches and reports that castigate his own
organization and the world's major powers for doing nothing in the
face of predictable catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   He has brushed aside the notion that national borders are
inviolable and argued that the world has the right to intervene
when leaders abuse their people. He has given public support to
Israel in its battle to gain a full place in the United Nations and
talked tough to fellow Africans about their continent's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not at all what a lot of people expected,'' said Sir
Brian Urquhart, a former undersecretary-general for political
affairs who has written several books about the organization and
its leaders, including a biography of Dag Hammarskjold, whom he
sees as the last secretary-general to adopt this forthright style.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Brian said of Annan: ``He seems to feel that he's in a
position to say, in a perfectly civil way, things that other people
really might not have found the courage to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive in his beliefs? Assertive in style? Annan thought
those questions over in an interview on Monday and did not
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always tried to be that, but I've probably done it in my
own way,'' he said, adding tgets attention because he has
``put issues on the table'' involving the action or inaction of
member nations and the sharper scrutiny of past operations and the
lessons to be drawn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment,'' he said, ``one cannot have a real mission
without a sense of history. You need to look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work in an organization where one usually tries to avoid
conflict, but when the issues are that important and also that
persistent, one needs to find a way of getting them debated, and
move forward in a rational and perhaps more organized manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his zeal to air the unmentioned, Annan seems to have
antagonized both the Third World and influential foreign policy
experts in Washington, where he directs some of his blame for a
deteriorating international political climate. In October, after
the U.S. Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, he said
the move undermined American world leadership in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Like Boutros-Ghali, whom the Clinton administration believed had
to be removed because he had become a lightning rod for anti-U.N.
sentiment, Annan may be heading for a collision with vocal
Republicans wary of any powerful international voice, particularly
a critical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he continues down this road, ultimately it means
war, at least with the Republican Party,'' said John R. Bolton, who
was the Bush administration's assistant secretary of state for
international organizations and a leading conservative commentator
on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The new Annan shifted gears perceptibly in September, when he
stepped up to speak at the opening of this year's General Assembly
session, normally a ponderous and largely ceremonial affair, and
announced that it was time to stop letting governments hide behind
their routine declarations of national sovereignty if human rights
were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage was immediate _ initially from some predictable
countries like China and India, but the debate goes on around the
world, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear is not my idea of the new world order,'' Theo-Ben
Gurirab, the foreign minister of Namibia and president of the
General Assembly, told a diplomatic gathering soon after Annan's
speech. The idea of a right to ``humanitarian intervention,'' he
said, was an alarming threat to small nations and to the ``sacred
principles and purposes of the charter of the United Nations
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Annan turned the spotlight inward,
publishing two tough, unvarnished reports on U.N. disasters: the
murderous Serbian assaults in 1995 on areas of Bosnia that the
United Nations had declared ``safe havens,'' and the failure of the
organization to prevent or stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994,
when hundreds of thousands, mostly ethnic Tutsi, were massacred by
Hutu-led militias.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then head of the U.N. peacekeeping department, which
took a beating in both reports. In neither case was any effort
apparently made to tone down the findings, which had often happened
in the past at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general publicly and readily accepted blame. But
the reports did not stop there: They implicated the powerful
Security Council _ in effect, a cabinet of nations led by the five
permanent members, the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain _ in the woeful lack of quick and active responses to clear
signs that horrendous catastrophes were in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders hailed his forthrightness. Others were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi Annan's courage in writing with such devastating
frankness and precision about the Srebrenica disaster'' in Bosnia,
``and assuming personal responsibility as well as responsibility
for the secretariat for its role in Rwanda, is nothing short of
revolutionary at the United Nations,'' said David Malone, a
Canadian foreign service officer who is now president of the
International Peace Academy, an independent research organization
in New York that instructs diplomats on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the silence from national capitals, which
were at least as heavily involved in decision-making over both
Srebrenica and Rwanda, has been deafening, with many of the
politicians, military leaders and diplomats involved in those
decisions making no moves to assume specific responsibility,''
Malone added.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton, now executive vice president of the American Enterprise
Institute, takes a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a growing and serious issue, the illegitimacy of the
secretary-general's commenting on the performance of U.N. member
governments,'' he said in an interview. ``Much of the substance of
the Srebrenica and Rwanda reports I agree with. The issue is
whether an international civil servant has or can be given
authority to criticize the performance of member governments.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said he sees an ``emerging pattern of behavior'' from the
secretary-general that is troubling. ``All international civil
servants in the U.N. system are employees of member governments,''
he explained. ``It's not to say you don't expect them to use their
imagination or their creativity, but they have no authority to act
outside a very limited scope of responsibility. He's well beyond
pushing the envelope on that score.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan says that ``one could not have told the story of
Srebrenica or Rwanda without looking at the role of all the
players.'' His next project, he said, will be a broad study of how
the United Nations does or should do peacekeeping in all its forms,
from unarmed monitoring to the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview this fall, Annan, who first attracted
American criticism for trying to negotiate with President Saddam
Hussein when he began to block the work of U.N. arms inspectors in
Iraq more than two years ago, put some distance between himself and
the Clinton administration as he reconstructed the motivations that
led him to go to Baghdad in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to disarm Iraq, it was important that we
retain the initiative,'' he said, recalling how he made his risky
trip with a threat of American bombing hanging over the venture.
``You can only retain the initiative by having people on the
ground. You cannot do it from the air. I think that once we get to
the situation where we have to use bombs, then we are on the verge
of losing the initiative. That's one of the reasons I kept asking,
`After the bombing, then what?'''
</P>
<P>
   But his mission failed in several ways. Iraq signed an
agreement, but that proved to be a hollow shell, and before the end
of the year there was bombing anyway. That ended the old inspection
system, and another year has since passed without any on-the-ground
surveillance of Iraq. Inspections may _ or may not _ resume
sometime in the year to come under a new Security Council plan
approved this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they didn't live up to the undertaking,'' he said of the
Iraqis. ``But does that mean we should not try diplomacy? I know
some people have accused me of using diplomacy. That's my job.
That's what I'm paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that his talks both with Saddam and later with
Moammar Gadhafi _ which led to the surrender of two Libyans for
trial in a special court on charges of blowing up Pan Am Flight 101
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 _ grew out of stalemates that the
Security Council seemed unable to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general, 61, a graduate of Macalester College and
MIT who has spent virtually all his working life within the U.N.
system, said problems with Security Council members arise when
countries, including the United States, seem to be working at cross
purposes with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general and the Security Council work very well,
and the U.S. and the Security Council work very well, on those
issues where their policies are in complete harmony,'' he said.
``In those situations where the U.S. is party to a Security Council
consensus and has its own national policy in addition to that _ and
is attempting to implement two policies _ one runs into
difficulties. Sometimes the secretary-general gets caught in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   At the International Peace Academy, Malone attributes a lot of
Annan's intellectual independence to the growing influence of key
outsiders he has brought into his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   They include John Ruggie, an American on leave as dean of the
Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs;
Edward Mortimer, a Briton who was foreign editor of The Financial
Times and is now Annan's speechwriter, and Andrew Mack, an American
scholar who is head of an in-house think tank set up by Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he became secretary-general, he knew that his strength
was to be an insider,'' Malone said. ``But that was also going to
be a weakness. The outsiders have been playing a key role in
challenging not only how the U.N. does things, but also how the
U.N. thinks about itself. The U.N. is often self-satisfied, and the
secretariat adopts a victim position without necessarily thinking
issues through.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's deputy, Louise Frechette of Canada, is a
no-nonsense administrator with experience in Canada's defense
ministry who has little patience for the time-consuming posturing
of traditional U.N. behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who once worked for Ms. Frechette, said she stands in
stark contrast to the ``blathering of the U.N., where each delegate
thinks he or she has the sovereign right to natter on indefinitely,
whether it is related to the subject at hand or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan says he is only fulfilling a pledge. ``I did say from the
beginning that alone I could do nothing and we need to reach out
and work in partnership with civil society, the private sector,
foundations and others. I've done that.''

 &HT;    As christianity enters a new era, scholars say it will continue
to reshape and renew itself
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Saturday, Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   During the two millenniums since a Jew named Jesus lived and
gathered 12 men to follow him, according to Scriptures, the faith
he founded has become worldwide. About 2 billion people claim to
worship in his name.
</P>
<P>
   One church has split and multiplied into countless
denominations. In the United States, Christianity is the dominant
religion _ at least nominally. In Africa and Asia, it is exploding,
coming toe-to-toe with other major faiths such as Islam and
Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   As the world enters 2000, we asked some highly qualified
scholars, denominational leaders and religious journalists to
assess the landscape of Christianity in the near future. Here are
four major trends they cited:
</P>
<P>
   DIVERSITY WITHIN THE FAITH
</P>
<P>
   Internationally and nationally, ethnically and denominationally,
theologically and liturgically, Christianity is taking on new
shapes and faces. In the United States, the increasing number of
Latinos will play a major role in determining the church of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the next 25 years, we're going to see the
coming of age of the Latino Protestant church,'' said Tim Morgan,
senior associate editor with Christianity Today magazine, an
evangelical publication founded by the Rev. Billy Graham. ``There's
going to continue to be a tremendous growth in the number of
Hispanic Americans, from immigration as well as family formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the leadership of many traditional Christian groups
is shifting from Western Europe and the United States to Africa,
Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   An aging John Paul II, leader of the Roman Catholic Church, will
probably not last too far into the next century, and he could be
replaced by a Third World pope. ``That would not only make the
church less Eurocentric but bring a different experience to the
papacy,'' said Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and
Catholic studies at Georgetown University and author of ``Roman
Catholicism in America'' (Columbia University Press, 1999, $35).
</P>
<P>
   PROSELYTIZING VS. TOLERANCE
</P>
<P>
   With increased world travel and immigration to the United
States, Christians are encountering other faiths to a new extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pluralism rages on,'' said Wade Clark Roof, professor of
religion and society at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, and author of ``Spiritual Marketplace'' (Princeton
University Press, 1999, $24.95). ``We have to learn to live with
the fact that not everybody lives or thinks the way we do. Often
it's the people next-door who are different.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly diverse population means a greater likelihood of
intermarriage between people in different religious groups, causing
concern that Christianity will be diluted in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians now borrow aspects of other faiths, such as
Eastern meditation, said Nancy Eiesland, assistant professor of
sociology of religion at Emory University's Candler School of
Theology and co-editor of the book ``Contemporary American
Religion'' (AltaMira Press, 1997, $24.95). But Christians have also
come into conflict with practitioners of other religions they
attempt to evangelize.
</P>
<P>
   As the church spreads in Africa, it comes head-to-head with
Islam; as Southern Baptists evangelize in the United States, Jews
and Hindus are offended.
</P>
<P>
   Christians now have to ask, ``What does it mean to be Christian
in a context where Christians are regularly in conversation with
people who proclaim very different truths?'' said Eiesland.
</P>
<P>
   LOOSELY DEFINED
</P>
<P>
   `SPIRITUALITY'
</P>
<P>
   More than eight in 10 Americans feel the need to experience
spiritual growth, according to a recent Gallup Poll. In the South,
the figure is even higher _ 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirituality they seek is often ``free-floating and
vague,'' said Michael Lindsay, Gallup's consultant for theology,
religion and culture and co-author with George Gallup Jr. of
``Surveying the Religious Landscape'' (Morehouse Publishing, 1999,
$17.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of the church for the next century, I think, is
to capitalize on this almost fever-pitch intensity of spirituality
and channel it to encourage people to be involved in local houses
of worship,'' said Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the church is already succeeding. Some spiritual
journeyers find their way to very traditional faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox is that people kind of choose their faith at
first, then a lot of them buy the whole package,'' said Richard
Cimino, publisher of Religion Watch newsletter and co-author with
Don Lattin of ``Shopping for Faith _ American Religion in the New
Millennium'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1998, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``They like what strict churches give them,'' Cimino said.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKDOWN OF
</P>
<P>
   OLD CATEGORIES
</P>
<P>
   Once many Christians identified themselves by denominational
labels and were likely to attend the brand of church in which they
grew up. Today, however, distinctions are blurred and many people
hop from one pew to another. Statistics show that nearly
one-quarter of American adults have switched denominations since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Christian groups are reaching across ancient chasms _ witness
the Oct. 31 covenant between Lutherans and Catholics that wiped out
lines drawn during the Protestant Reformation. And within
traditional denominations, special interest groups are thriving on
both the conservative and liberal ends of the spectrum and hooking
up with other groups of similar mind-set in other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   People are likely to participatograms at more than one
church and through so-called parachurch organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Churches that describe themselves as ``nondenominational'' are
flourishing, and some large congregations affiliated with religious
groups are eliminating denominational titles from their names,
often adopting the term ``community church,'' said Scott Thumma, a
postdoctoral researcher at Hartford Institute for Religion
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Statistician David Barrett, whose new edition of ``World
Christian Encyclopedia'' is scheduled for publication this year,
estimates that what he calls ``postdenominational'' U.S. churches
claim more than 15 million Christians _ making the movement neck
and neck with the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's
largest Protestant group.
</P>
<P>
   CONCERN OVER MORALS AND VALUES
</P>
<P>
   Once Americans were more concerned with peace and prosperity,
said Michael Lindsay of the Gallup polling organization. But with
the United States at peace and the economy healthy, that concern is
shifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the last century, people were placing their hope
in human accomplishment and scientific progress,'' he said. ``While
we've made tremendous advances technologically, we're in the same
state morally if not worse than in 1900. Despite all the
technological achievements and scientific feats, people still
recognize the importance of moral values and virtues in life.''
</P>
<P>
   INCREASING ROLE
</P>
<P>
   OF LAITY
</P>
<P>
   In large Protestant churches, professional clergy will
increasingly become advisers and trainers to laypersons who carry
out many of the ministries of the church, predicts Donald E.
Miller, professor of religion at the University of Southern
California and author of ``Reinventing American Protestantism''
(University of California Press, 1997, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Among American Catholics, the laity will take increasingly large
roles, predicts Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and
Catholic studies at Georgetown University. ``Part of this is just
lack of clergy. Part is that the laity have been empowered since
Vatican II,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For aging baby boomers, the increased role of the laity may
evolve into a third career, a ``rediscovery of their '60s
altruism,'' said Tim Morgan of Christianity Today magazine. ``The
big trend is to move from success to significance.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING ROLE
</P>
<P>
   OF WOMEN
   ``Women are going to play a larger role in providing leadership
for the church,'' predicted Lindsay of Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catholic Church, ``although it's not inevitable, I think
it's very likely that the role of women will increase, and there
will be ordained women despite the present pope's strong
resistance,'' said Gillis. ``I think there are significant internal
pressures that could lead to this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large growth of women ministers in the Episcopal
Church, United Church of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America,'' said Richard Cimino, publisher of Religion Watch
newsletter. ``Even in churches that don't allow women as priests,
there are women administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in leadership are generally ``more democratic'' and have a
``more nurturing influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the marginalization of men in groups where women's
influence is increasing, some denominations are attempting to
strengthen their men's ministries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   The Internet not only allows people in traditional Christian
groups to share information more quickly, connecting missionaries
in far-flung fields almost instantaneously with denominational
headquarters at home, it also facilitates the formation of new
groups and networks. And it exposes people to a wider variety of
religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a powerful tool that has already reshaped the
religious and spiritual life of the United States, maybe even in
the long run more than Gutenberg's movable-type press,'' said Scott
Thumma of Hartford Institute for Religion Research. ``It introduces
a whole new way of interconnecting in community. It shrinks the
globe to our mousepad.''
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
</P>
<P>
   DISPUTES
</P>
<P>
   Before 1940, only six cases dealing with religious liberty went
before the Supreme Court, which at the time was the only court that
could hear such cases, according to the First Liberty Institute.
Since then, hundreds of cases have popped up in state and federal
courts, and more than 90 opinions have been handed down.
</P>
<P>
   With new groups and different religions in the marketplace,
issues of zoning and attempts to regulate religious practices are
likely to grow, said Cimino.
</P>
<P>
   Souchers for parochial education and questions of whether
and how to teach religion in school will also continue to be issues
into the next century, he predicted. In many cases, Christian is
pitted against Christian in defense of different positions.
</P>
<P>
   PENTECOSTAL,
</P>
<P>
   CHARISMATIC CHRISTIANS
</P>
<P>
   ``They're usually regarded as off-center,'' said statistician
David Barrett. ``They're not off-center at all. They're right in
the middle of Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern California's Miller, who traveled to
Asia, Africa and Latin America last year, said he saw firsthand the
mushrooming of Pentecostal and charismatic churches in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest-growing, most vital churches were inevitably
Pentecostal,'' he said. ``I see no reason that this is going to
slow down in terms of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   MEGACHURCHES AND SMALL GROUPS
</P>
<P>
   So-called megachurches, frequently defined as those with regular
attendance of more than 2,000, will continue to multiply, predicted
Miller, ``in part because once these churches get up to a certain
scale, they can provide all kinds of services to their members,
ranging from recreation to education to social services, that small
congregations have a hard time realizing. Particularly in an urban
society, there's a sense in which the church will become
one-stop-shopping in a metaphorical sense. Thumma, who has studied megachurches for about 15 years,
estimates that there are 500 to 550 around the country today. ``I
think the phenomenon is going to be around for at least several
more decades,'' he said. Within megachurches, it's usually a
small-group structure that offers a sense of belonging.
</P>
<P>
   One in four Americans is involved in some kind of faith-based
small group, said Lindsay of Gallup. ``We've become so isolated in
our rapidly changing, completely mobile lifestyles,'' he said.
``The small group provides a sense of community. I think that will
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SERVICE WORK
</P>
<P>
   With welfare being cut, ``you see the beginnings of churches
going into partnership with the government on things like that,''
said Cimino. ``I think that may grow.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trend come concerns about whether churches have to
``trim down'' their identity to be able to accept government funds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMERIST RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   From Deepak Chopra to James Dobson, religion is big business,
said Nancy Eiesland, assistant professor of sociology of religion
at Emory University's Candler School of Theology. ``It's going to
become even bigger business.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians are full participants in the trend,
buying books on how to incorporate Scripture into everything from
running a business to losing weight. The CBA, formerly known as the
Christian Booksellers Association, reported in 1999 that Christian
retailers are doing more than $3 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL, ETHICAL ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   The questions of whether to ordain homosexuals and bless
same-sex unions that have occupied the attention of mainline
Protestant groups during the 1990s are still unresolved at 2000.
Advances in human reproduction and medicine raise new concerns. And
an emphasis on the environment seems to be growing in several
different segments of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   But Christians do not all see eye to eye on what their role and
responsibility should be. ``It seems to be an area of conflict as
well as interest,'' said Cimino.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING WORSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Pipe organs that gave way to acoustic guitars and folk songs in
the 1960s are now replaced by synthesizers. Praise choruses,
repetitive lyrics with catchy tunes, ring out from sanctuaries with
stained glass windows. Even some congregations with the staidest
reputations are adopting styles of worship that originated in
Pentecostalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we're in the middle of a worship
revolution in this country, and it shows no sign of ending soon,''
said Morgan of Christianity Today. ``There are still die-hard
traditionalists, but church buildings increasingly will hold more
than one congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS COMMITMENT
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's young people say they anticipate that they will be
more charitable and more religious than their parents,'' said
Lindsay of Gallup. ``As we track them, we're finding out they are,
and we think they will continue to be.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also likely to be more open to the mystical aspects of
the faith than their parents and grandparents, said Miller. ``I
think they're going to turn away from the more dogmatic,
text-based, propositional religion,'' he said.

 &HT;    Director Anderson talks about his new film, `Magnolia,' and
working with Cruise, Robards
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 2.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Thomas Anderson, the 30-year-old big gun among Hollywood's
new cinematic wave of young auteurs, is finally putting his feet up
in his Los Angeles home, smoking Camels, drinking Diet Cokes and
getting a spy flick fix watching Sterling Hayden in 1957's ``Five
Steps to Danger'' on Turner Clavies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacation has now begun!'' he shouts. On this day, the
writer-director of 1997's Oscar-nominated ``Boogie Nights'' and
this season's ``Magnolia,'' which opens Friday in metro Atlanta, is
happy.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind to the day before, and Anderson is decidedly unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   He's in his car, careening around L.A., barging into movie
theaters to wheedle staffers into showing his newest movie, which
has already opened there for Academy Award consideration, just like
he wants it shown. Sound way up. New prints ordered if he spots
imperfections on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job's not over when the movie's made,'' Anderson says.
``The irony is that there's all this effort and all this money and
all this time spent making a movie just so and then the theaters
drop the ball. My overprotective father gene kicks in, and then I
cajole the projectionists to make it look and sound just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Anderson is a control freak. He doesn't argue the
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are my life and they mean so much to me,'' he says. ``I
just don't take it lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   And with ``Magnolia,'' a three-hour whirl of a movie with nearly
a dozen interconnected characters and a head-spinning plot
involving, among many other things, moral choices, a TV quiz show,
a motivational guru and an amphibian assault of biblical
proportions, Anderson has controlled just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted Tom Cruise and Jason Robards Jr. for his film and got
them both. He talked New Line Cinema, which green-lighted
``Magnolia,'' into conceding him final cut of the film. He got his
way with the movie's poster. And the theater trailer. And he's had
his hand all over the TV marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a film school dropout, gets all these things, in part,
because he and other young, visionary directors like him _ Spike
Jonze (``Being John Malkovich''), Kimberly Peirce (``Boys Don't
Cry'') and David O. Russell (``Three Kings'') _ are creating a kind
of directorial renaissance that Hollywood hasn't seen since the
emergence of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Journal film critic Joe Morgenstern has already
anointed ``Magnolia'' the best movie of the year. The New York
Times' Janet Maslin was decidedly more mixed, finding fault with
Anderson's risky move to have each of his ``Magnolia'' cast members
sing the same short line from an Aimee Mann song. ``It's
astonishing to see a film begin this brilliantly,'' she wrote,
``only to torpedo itself in its final hour.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Golden Globes, ``Magnolia'' received only two
nominations _ Cruise as best supporting actor and Mann for her song
``Save Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wuz robbed,'' Anderson jokes, repeating the same line
Warren Beatty used in 1967 when the actor's much-heralded ``Bonnie
and Clyde,'' up for 10 Oscars, won only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is I was bummed out for about two
minutes,'' Anderson says. ``Listen, honestly, getting Aimee
nominated for `Save Me' was my main objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, since ``Boogie Nights,'' Anderson has been the ``It''
director of Hollywood (as The New York Times Magazine recently put
it, he's ``a sort of baby brother to Quentin Tarantino''). He's
consistently praised for being a technical whiz and gifted writer.
Even before he got a screenplay nomination for ``Boogie Nights,''
the Sundance Film Institute invited him to its directorial workshop
in Utah to help develop ``Sydney,'' his intriguing treatment of Las
Vegas gambling and a fatherly ex-mobster that later became ``Hard
Eight,'' his first feature-length film.
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson recently took a brief holiday break from marketing
``Magnolia,'' he talked by phone about an array of subjects,
including working with Cruise and Robards, meeting his idol Stanley
Kubrick and the reason he walked out of New York University film
school years ago after just a couple of days of study.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About the song your actors sing in ``Magnolia.'' That was a
risky move. Did you meet with any resistance from them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm really surprised everybody wants to talk about the song
and that they think it's so gutsy. I consider it a very real thing,
a very natural thing in the context of the reality of this movie.
We've all sung along to a song. When you feel good and even when
you feel bad. You sit in it and wallow in it, and it helps make you
feel better or sadder. I had no resistance from the actors going
into it, but Bill Macy and Tom Cruise admitted to me later they
were wondering what in the hell was this? It was funny. But I think
the best part of it was that Julianne Moore shot first. If you were
ever going to do something strange, the thing to do is start with
her. She can just sell it, whatever it is. She set the stage. After
her, everybody got it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like working with Tom Cruise?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's my dream and not just because it's him but because he
can do everything you ask him to do. I'm being silly, but if you
say, ``Can you stand on your head and do it in Yiddish,'' he'll
say, ``Yeah, sure.'' He's so gung-ho for the work. I was happy to
meet my match in work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We kept hearing how Cruise's part was small and then was
later expanded.
</P>
<P>
   A: The part is exactly as it was written. I actually cut a few
scenes of Tom's out. We called it a cameo early on so people
wouldn't think it was a Tom Cruise movie. Actually, Tom was sweet
about all of it, telling us early on about ``the baggage of having
me in your movie.'' We realized what he was trying to say when all
these people just showed up on the set, all these fans that came
from nowhere. He said, ``I'm so sorry.'' We had to do a lot of
safety precautions and things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Cruise invited you to the set of ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' What did
you and Stanley Kubrick talk about?
</P>
<P>
   A: We talked about movies, but not much really. He kept his
cards pretty close. He had seen ``Boogie Nights.'' He asked if I
wrote it, too. And when I said yes, he seemed to like me a lot
more. I was really inspired looking at him and how he worked. He
had a very small crew. He was someone who was doing it his way. He
could shoot for two years because he only had a crew of eight. That
said to me, ``Pick a way that works for you and do that.'' I was
inspired by that and certainly by seeing him control every aspect.
It's a director's obligation to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you land Jason Robards?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had written the part thinking of Jason. He's such a great
actor. I went to Jonathan Demme and said, ``Listen, I know you know
him. Would you mind calling him and telling him I've written this
art for him?'' Jon really liked the script and passed it
along to Jason.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the extra features on the ``Magnolia'' DVD going to
be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm still thinking about it. I won't be doing a commentary
tract. One promise that I will make is that the seminar (conducted
by Tom Cruise's character) will be the full version _ you know, as
one of those deleted scene extras. I'm going to definitely put the
music video and the teaser and trailer on it. There was a
documentary made of the making of ``Magnolia.'' And I have to see
if I come off handsome and eloquent enough.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie, Henry Gibson's character is named Thurston
Howell. You have a ``Gilligan's Island'' fetish?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the same thing I did with Rollergirl (Heather Graham in
``Boogie Nights''). Sometimes in the script I'll put a placeholder
_ the kind of guy he is. I sort of wrote it like he was a Thurston
Howell-Dorothy Parker-Truman Capote kind of character. It just
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've got a dozen interconnected characters in this movie.
And the way you write, you usually have three or more options that
you consider for what a single character might do. And that means
even more multiple options for the other characters and vice versa.
Did you go mad?
</P>
<P>
   A: There were maybe two or three panic moments where I couldn't
get it under control. It's much more a blur than the other movies
I've done. I don't get writer's block. It's writer's block in
reverse. I just remember a few moments of total confusion. The
answer is always just wait. And then five days later everything is
fine again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It looks like you've put everything you know into
``Magnolia'' _ and not just visually. You put your soul into the
script. You're the cop character John Reilly plays. You've made
yourself vulnerable to the world. Right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Totally and completely vulnerable. But it's helping me build
up good ammunition for not feeling vulnerable. It's the whole
cliche of making myself happy first.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But making yourself happy first doesn't usually mean big box
office and Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm just hoping that at some moment in time what I'm thinking
everyone else is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've referred to film school as ``a complete con.'' What
happened at New York University to make you want to leave after
only a couple of days?
</P>
<P>
   A: I sat in this class and this arrogant professor said, ``If
there is anyone here who wants to write `Terminator 2,' you can
leave now.'' I thought that was a rude thing to say. Plus, it's a
dynamite movie. Second thing is, we were assigned to write a page
of script with no dialogue. I got a page from (David) Mamet's
`Hoffa' and turned it in as my own. I got a C+. `If Mamet's getting
a C+, I thought, I ought to get the hell out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As part of your Sundance workshop, you got to talk a lot with
John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy''). What did you learn from
him?
</P>
<P>
   A: He said something to me that I always forget until after I've
finished a movie. ``With background action, it must always
complement whatever the movie is about.'' And I'll always forget to
do that while I'm making a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Then I'll discover some Schlesinger film on TV and see what he's
talking about and then I'll think, ``I've got to remember to do
that next time.'' You get little pieces like that at Sundance. It's
much more helpful than any film school because the people who are
talking to you are actually making movies. And you get practical
stuff about how to deal with unions. At film school, they teach
film in a very heady way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You just don't like film school, huh?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel bad sometimes, because I got very lucky. Maybe a
little talent, a little timing and a little luck. Film school
actually could be a way out of something for somebody. A way for
them to get to do this all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will we ever see ``Rollergirl: The Musical''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wouldn't that be great. When I'm 70 years old and I've lost
the rights and somebody comes along and does that. That would be my
dream. That would be so funny. I could go see it. And say, ``This
is miserable. You people are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, during ``Boogie Nights'' I actually thought for a
half-second that we should make a Rollergirl spinoff.

 &HT;    Town makes the most of its claim to fame
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM, N.C. _ Here in America's only Millennium, the Rev.
Paul Edwards is running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   His is a burden for the ages, bending and twisting a mess of
copper wire and aluminum tubing into an 8-foot-tall dove. Wrapped
in white lights, the flat metal bird will rise 80 feet above a
barren patch of broom straw.
</P>
<P>
   In the first moments of the new year marking the millennium, the
dove will illuminate the darkness of this obscure, hardscrabble
patch of northeastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hopeful symbol of peace. Edwards, 45, hopes to get it all
done.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, this is one celebration that Millennium doesn't want
to mess up.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand McNally commercial atlas lists this Hertford County
community, on N.C. 11 between Aulander and Ahoskie, as the only
place in the United States named Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we bear the name, let's play the game,'' local historian
Henry Lassiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others planning the biggest New Year's Eve festivities in
this unincorporated community's 90-year history, 56-year-old
Lassiter believes the 750 people who live here are ready for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the recent wave of publicity will put Millennium on
the map. That's something few road maps have done since a pair of
Pentecostal Holiness preachers wandered here in 1910 and began
winning the souls of dirt farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards figures to finish the dove by Friday, in time for a
trial run on the industrial lift he borrowed from a nearby steel
mill. Others are working hard to prepare the open-air wooden
tabernacle of the Millennium Pentecostal Holiness Church for Friday
night's gathering of several hundred people.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's assistant fire chief, Phil Terry, who is
``dynamite-certified,'' is in charge of the fireworks display that
will accompany the dove's ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, pastor of the Pentecostal Holiness church, sees
significance in the bird's direction. Rather than descend as
Atlanta's peach and Time Square's ball do on New Year's Eve, the
dove will rise toward heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Y2K worry? Whether anybody will steal the two green
``Millennium'' road signs.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hurdle, a 54-year-old church member, stashed so many jugs
of water in his attic that his living room ceiling cracked. He's
also got canned food and firewood, but he figures the precautions
will prove unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter as long as I am prepared with the
master,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's oldest resident, 98-year-old Evie Outlaw, is
growing excited. She said she feels lucky to be alive and lucky to
live just across the two-lane road from the grassy oak grove where
the festivities will take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to get out of the door,'' Outlaw said, though
she doesn't figure to be awake to welcome the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Outlaw was born in 1901, a decade before the Revs. J.B. Williams
and George Stanley began preaching and baptising Christian converts
here during tent meetings. Followers built a wooden church, since
replaced by a red-brick sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of Millennium's few commercial buildings, along with a
sawmill, country store and firehouse. The nearest post office is
across the Bertie County line in Aulander.
</P>
<P>
   The community _ formerly called Talky Town, after its gossips _
adopted the name Millennium in the early 1960s when it decided it
was big enough for its own volunteer fire department. To gain a
state charter, the department needed a name.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion was ``Midway,'' but the community wasn't midway
between anything. The men's brotherhood of the Pentecostal Holiness
church suggested ``Millennium,'' reflecting the church's belief
that Jesus Christ will reign in peace on earth for 1,000 years _ a
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The name stuck, and today it gives Millennium reason to
celebrate, in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Women of the church are baking cookies for Friday night. There
will be gospel music, hot dogs and Pepsi, and games. The volunteer
fire department will sell T-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with
``A place in time'' and ``A community in celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, after all his effort, hopes for nothing out of the
ordinary. ``I believe if we do something crazy,'' he said, ``that
is what we might get.''

CELLUCCI OPEN TO FEDERAL POST IF BUSH WINS PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci refused Thursday to commit to
serving out his current four-year term, leaving the door open to
acceptance of a federal appointment if Republican George W. Bush
becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who heads to New Hampshire to campaign for Bush next
week, promised to devote most of his time as governor to
Massachusetts business during the presidential race even if Bush
gains the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor, clearly excited by the presidential effort,
also said he has informed Bush operatives that he stands ready to
help in a national campaign _ especially with fundraising and
wooing Italian-Americans across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm available if needed,'' Cellucci said, noting that he is
the nation's only sitting Italian-American governor. ``I go back a
long way with the Bush family, as you know. I think they're the
best we have in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci made the remarks during a State House interview with
the Globe while seated near a portrait of the late John A. Volpe, a
Republican governor named by former President Richard M. Nixon to
be Secretary of Transportation and, later, ambassador to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci called Volpe ``a hero'' and, pressed on several
occasions, refused to rule out following in Volpe's footsteps to
Washington if Bush is elected president. ``I'm not going to talk
about it,'' he said. ``I'm not going to talk about it at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was Massachusetts coordinator for former President
Bush's 1988 campaign, and already, he has awed fundraising experts
by generating over $1.5 million from Massachusetts donors for the
president's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of Republican who can win the White House and
who can lead this nation,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Bush becomes the nominee, Cellucci is planning to
spend much of his time campaigning next year, as he and Lt. Gov.
Jane Swift crusade for a ballot initiative that would reduce the
state income tax 5.85 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax cut is going to be the primary focus for Jane Swuift
and I,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who recently declared he would adopt an ``outside the
State House'' populist strategy designed to elevate him above
legislative battles, said his other priorities for the coming year
include increasing accountability for education spending, and
searching for ways to ease the housing crisis in Boston and other
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci hinted that his push for greater accountability under
the Education Reform Act, which has raised state aid to local
schools from $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the last seven
years, will emphasize boosting student test scores and, perhaps, a
renewed push for more teacher testing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also indicated that any administration program
designed to make housing more readily available would be directed
at incentives for new construction. The administration has been
criticized by some advocates for neglecting the the housing
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of huge subsidies and I'm not a fan of rent
control,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for specifics, Cellucci said he would provide them
next month, when he delivers his State of the State address and
files his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But he called winning voter approval of the income tax cut his
number one goal for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said that, working with Swift and the organization
Citizens for Limited Taxation, he would base his campaign on four
arguments, saying an income tax rollback would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Make Massachusetts more competitive with other industrialized
states participating in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Impose fiscal discipline on the state legislature by ``taking
money off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide an average of $600 of additional income to the
average Massachusetts family.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep a ``promise'' made during the fiscal crisis of the early
'90s to return the income tax rate from 5.95 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there's strong support for it among the citizens of
the state,'' Cellucci said of the tax rollback proposal. ``We're
going to spend a lot of time reenforcing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's assertion is contradicted by a recent Mass
Insight poll taken for the state Republican Party, which showed
that most voters, when given a choice, prefer more state spending
on specific programs over a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, only 18 percent favor a tax cut while 23
percent support increased funding for highways and other public
building projects and 55 percent prefer more state spending on
education, child care, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the poll, Cellucci said he will remind voters
that state spending on education has increased dramatically even
though a variety of state taxes have been cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a false choice,'' he said. ``People will say that you
can't improve education if you have tax cuts but I would suggest
that people just look at what we've done over the last seven
years.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to site his own most important accomplishment of the
past year _ his first since winning election _ Cellucci cited the
confirmation battle to have Margaret H. Marshall named chief
justice of the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination was opposed by groups against abortion rights and
was initially questioned by Cardinal Bernard Law, who raised
questions about whether Marshall held anti-Catholic feelings. But
the Executive Council ultimately voted to approve Cellucci's
nomination of Marshall on a 6-3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an historic day for Massachsuetts,'' Cellucci said.
``It's the first time a woman has headed a branch of state
government.''

 &HT;    105-year-old Marion Smith Johnson of Atlanta, with the new year
on Saturday, will have lived in three centuries
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sitting ramrod straight at a polished brown piano, her
tiny, gnarled fingers softly clinkety-clinking across the ivories,
Marion Smith Johnson pecks out ``Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' for a
bevy of cackling ``young'' relatives, all in their late 60s to
early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   For the 105-year-old Smith, it's been a favorite song ever since
it topped the pop charts in 1911, when she was 16, living in the
rural town of Forsyth south of Atlanta and dreaming of a future in
the big city.
</P>
<P>
   She never learned to read sheet music like her sister Genevieve
did, but hunted and pecked and practiced until she could play by
ear. To this day, she entertains friends and family by playing
dozens of tunes that still ring in her head.
</P>
<P>
   And though her voice is high and squeaky, she can still carry a
tune, and needs no help remembering lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Atlanta, is just hours away from living in
three centuries, the 1800s, 1900s and 2000s. Shrunken to 4-foot-8
from her teenage height of 5 feet, the feisty, bright-eyed
75-pounder gets up every morning, dresses herself in her ``Sunday
best,'' puts on her pearls and tries hard to keep busy, playing
bingo, exercising and attending concerts and religious services
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   She has outlived five siblings by more than 20 years, and her
husband, who died at 92 in 1989. ``I've never had an ache or a
pain,'' she crows. Still, she gets a little peeved that people
think she's special just because she's lived so long.
</P>
<P>
   When told at a recent party in her son's Atlanta home that she's
one of fewer than 800 Georgians who is 100 or older, she shrugs.
``Big deal. Who cares? I'm not special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I'm 100,'' declares Johnson, clad at the party
in a bright green dress, an expensive three-strand pearl necklace
and matching earrings. ``I feel maybe 85. Of course, I'm not young,
but I do practically all the things I've done all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe Smith, activities director at the Renaissance on
Peachtree, the tony Atlanta high-rise where Johnson lives, says the
centenarian is ``basically self-sufficient,'' often visiting
friends and playing piano for them, and also is a competitive bingo
player. She lives on an assisted living floor but needs little
assistance, Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   So what's her secret?
</P>
<P>
   She ponders, stroking her silky white hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``A close, loving family,'' she says firmly. ``Few people have
this many nice people. And friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Coke. I've had a Coke every day for a hundred years, just
about. I drink one Coke every day I want one. And I want one every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Robert, breaks out laughing: ``Every time she drinks a
Coke, she says, `That's the best one I've ever had.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since she doesn't see herself as special, answers have to be
coaxed from her by strangers as well as persistent family members,
who chuckle at every word she utters, especially when she cocks an
eyebrow at what she considers a dumb question.
</P>
<P>
   And most questions about her life, she feels, fall into that
category.
</P>
<P>
   What was the most important innovation of the 20th century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Electricity,'' she fires back. ``I think to have lights
without matches was the biggest thing. You had to light kerosene
lanterns with matches. There wasn't any electricity when I was a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   And the telephone was another biggie.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers that calls used to come in at the Western Union
station, and a runner had to be sent to her house to fetch a family
member. Usually, she adds, such calls brought news of death. Good
news came by mail.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget running water, Johnson smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a well in the back yard,'' she says. ``We wanted water,
we brought it in by buckets. That was the only way. I had a pitcher
of water in my bedroom. That was the way. But I reckon we had fun
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, earnest woman, Johnson's stubborn streak becomes
obvious as strangers and family members ask her questions about
what she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you remember?'' she blurts. ``It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words and manner of speaking make it clear she's no mere
80-year-old. She refers to Atlanta's old streetcars as ``cars'' and
remembers moving to Atlanta in 1919, when she was 25, with her
furniture and other belongings hauled by a mule-drawn wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she'd agreed to sing at a wedding, but her father wouldn't
let her take the family horse, so she had to hook up a buggy to a
mule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to use a hatpin to get that mule to go,'' Johnson says
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite stories involves attending church in Atlanta
after giving all her ``car money'' away for the needy. ``So we went
over to the Capitol, and a man gave us car fare home,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Johnson took a job as a piano teacher at the current
site of 1 Atlantic Center (more commonly known as the IBM Tower)
and also taught kindergarten and Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a spinster because she stayed single until 33, she
married Aubrey Johnson in 1927, after being introduced by a mutual
friend. She later wrote a book of poetry, including some poems
about him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson no longer remembers many of the stories she told her
only son, Robert, 70, who was born when she was 35.
</P>
<P>
   He says she used to talk often about the time her father, at age
13, camped out in the woods in 1864 when Union Gen. William Sherman
marched south from Atlanta to the sea. And, he says, she recalled
listening to her grandfather, a Confederate soldier who fought in
the Battle of Chickamauga and walked home after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains, at least in part, why she's always been a
Democrat, last voting in a presidential contest for Jimmy Carter.
Old-time Southerners viewed Republicans as carpetbaggers, notes
Robert, who lives five minutes away. Her husband felt that way, and
so did she, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some of the news she sees on TV, she insists the world
is a better place now than it used to be. ``We have so much.
Lights. W kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   What's one of her fondest 20th century memories?
</P>
<P>
   When her mother worked at a manual sewing machine: ``I used to
sit under my mother when she was sewing, pushing the pedals,'' she
grins.
</P>
<P>
   What's she think about living in her third century?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here. I don't have time to think of
things like that. There's no telling what they're going to think of
next. We'll get things new and different all the time, just like we
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson experienced more than most folks in her younger days.
``I had a trip to Europe on a plane,'' she says. ``We flew all
across the ocean. And I flew to New York. I went to the Chicago
World's Fair (in 1933) and the New York World's Fair (in 1939).''
During a private tour of the White House, she took a seat in
President Kennedy's favorite rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   Does she have any regrets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone does, but I can't think of any. I'm certain there are
things I would change. But I'm happy. I don't cry. I don't
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first memory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the cotton in my father's cotton warehouse,'' she
says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   One last question: Any thoughts about 2000?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it much,'' she says. ``It's just another
year.'' And she has no plans to stay up late to see 1999 end.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, sorry, one more question.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a New Year's resolution?
</P>
<P>
   ``Same as always,'' she says. ``I'll try to make the next year
better than the one before.''

 &HT;    So let's get the future started: An edgy world on brink of 2000
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here we stand on the precipice of 2000, caught in an
updraft of hope, nostalgia, a twinge of fear and perhaps a growing
sense of enough already!
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we feel fortunate to witness the ultimate New Year's Eve,
and an odometer roll of seismic proportions. But the hype, it's
been heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the prizefight they've been hyping for a year; let's
just get on with it already,'' said Steve Mitchell, a 27-year-old
telecom salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty neat cottage industry for Shylocks to
create a scare and then fix it,'' said Dean Sisk, an auto mechanic.
Sure, there will be a few glitches, he said, ``but what does that
mean? I can't get my e-mail for a week?''
</P>
<P>
   Ringing in year 2000 was supposed to be The Big One, as New
Year's celebrations go. But the endless news video of bomb squads
practicing and folks filling carts with bottled water has turned
out to be one big buzzkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gala 2000'' at the Gwinnett Civic Center outside Atlanta died
for lack of interest. Seattle cancelled its celebration because of
terroristic bogeymen. Even Michael Jackson cancelled his Hawaii
gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking it'd be the biggest blowout in history;
instead, it's somewhat anti-climactic,'' said Atlanta attorney Jack
Martin, who won't be climbing a pyramid with a sparkler in hand.
Instead he'll pop a cork on his living room couch with his wife and
a few friends. ``I don't know if it's a disappointment or maybe it
just humbles you.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 54, isn't frightened by the doomsayers. He grew up in
the shadow of The Bomb and remembers a school drill where parents
came to pick up their children and hide them out on the other side
of Kennesaw Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a time of reflection, that things have gone so
well,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   He also might pick up a couple gallons of water. And hopes his
neighbors don't rush to fill up their bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Bell, a 43-year-old homeless man smiled when asked about
the hubbub over Y2K: ``People are worried about the lights going
out. We don't have no lights out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Azani isn't worried about being in the dark. The Israeli
immigrant who owns a deli plans to relax at home with his wife and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Azani, 54, lost a son, Golan, in 1995 while serving in the
Israeli army and doesn't want to dwell on the past. ``I always look
forward, always forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next year promises to be eventful. He will move his deli,
and his wife of four years is pregnant with his second child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered about 2000 and where I'd be. I'm here in
America. I have a new wife, a new daughter. I look forward to a new
baby, a new business, a new life and a beautiful future.''
</P>
<P>
   Many folks are giddy to be living in a time of exploding
technology and a skyrocketing Dow. Year 2000 represents a door
opening up to endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this century, you saw a life-changing invention every
century or so, now it seems to be every decade,'' said Charles
Miller, a 55-year-old airline pilot. ``You have to be naive not to
think that it will go forward at a more accelerated rate. That's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the familiar 1900s slip away, we glimpse our own
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking about it when they were closing a time
capsule _ we won't be around when they open them up,'' Miller said.

IS INDEXING LOSING ITS ALLURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD TEITELBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors, long smitten by the low-cost, near market-matching
attractions of index funds, may finally be losing some of their
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., the research firm, net new investments
in index funds that track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
fell considerably for November, to $600 million from $3.25 billion
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper said that was the slowest pace of cash inflows into index
funds since the summer of 1998, when the stock market was in a
sharp correction. But the most recent slowdown occurred during a
month when equity markets were rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the money could well be going into individual growth and
technology stocks, or into funds that specialize in those kinds of
stocks, said Edward Rosenbaum, research director at Lipper. Indeed,
science and technology funds saw net flows of $8 billion in
November, nearly two-thirds of the net flows into equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, large-cap growth and multicap growth funds returned
35.8 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively, through Dec. 23, far
ahead of the 19.4 percent gain of the average S&AMP;P 500 index fund.
Mid-cap growth and small-cap growth funds did likewise, returning
67.6 percent and 55.6 percent, respectively. Science and technology
funds returned 128 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such fund-hopping does not make much sense, Rosenbaum
said. ``Taking money out of the S&AMP;P 500 to play growth or
technology is a silly thing,'' he said. ``People may not be aware
of how growthy the S&AMP;P is.''

(REFILING TO CORRECT GARBLE) 
 
RESOLVE TO PRACTICE SELF-ACCEPTANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELJTE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow marks the start of a brand new year, indeed, a brand
new century. And so, as we are wont to do at this time each year,
Americans are gearing up for a spate of New Year's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Time to turn over a new leaf. Start afresh. Transform into that
always-together, in-shape, healthy, mentally balanced, spiritually
centered, organized superperson we know ourselves deep down to be.
If we could just get past the layers of our slovenly, weak-willed,
petty, perpetually exhausted regular self to it.
</P>
<P>
   Trend-watchers say this year promises a bumper crop of New
Year's resolution-making, a veritable national avalanche of them,
thanks to the triple-zero significance of what almost everyone is
celebrating as the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than in years past, folks will be rabid about making
and keeping New Year's vows to lose weight, give up smoking, clean
their closets, stop yelling at their kids, and/or prove that you
really can have a Martha Stewart life on a Kmart budget.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Why? Why go to all the trouble to improve
yourself, especially in light of the annual waves of guilt and
remorse that inevitably follow when we fall short? There are
certain benefits to self-acceptance. Just think of the pluses if
you decide to eschew self-betterment and embrace your Inner Slob:
</P>
<P>
   --You won't have to buy new clothes when you lose all that extra
weight.
</P>
<P>
   --You've screwed it up so many times before, not making a
resolution means you won't be a failure two weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   --No searching for things you've misplaced or thrown out after
cleaning your closet.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Klingenberg, author of ``Yes, I Am Happy Now!'' (Firebaugh
Communications;$25) says it's old-fashioned guilt _ a sense of not
deserving to be happy _ that underlies the American bent toward
self-improvement. The answer, he says, rests in simply choosing to
be content with yourself, as you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `I have to lose 20 pounds, then I will be
happy,' or `I have to make more money first,' '' he says. ``But
plenty of rich or thin people are still unhappy, angry, worried,
stressed out or just plain miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Accept reality, he says. Get happy. In other words, read his
book.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah. We know this line of thinking is anathema at this
time of year. (We suggest clipping this article and re-reading it
Feb. 12). So what if you decide to go ahead and indulge
resolutional leanings?
</P>
<P>
   John C. Norcross, a psychologist at the University of Scranton,
qualifies as Mr. New Year's Resolution Man. He has done extensive
research into the subject of the annual
change-for-the-better-craze, even co-authored a book on it. He says
that each year, 40 percent to 50 percent of American adults make
resolutions, for an average of 1.8 resolutions apiece. Within six
months, more than half have thrown in the towel. After two years,
only about 20 percent have stuck to their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, most people fail at their resolutions.
Miserably.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some tricks to the new-you trade, he says. Chief
among them: Be realistic. Don't tell yourself you're going to lose
80 pounds. Tell yourself you'll lose 10. Small steps build
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the best predictive elements for success are having
realistic confidence in your ability to change, and, second, a
readiness to change,'' Norcross says.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, you have to really want it. (Norcross says that the
average smoker tries to quit seven times before finally
succeeding.)
</P>
<P>
   According to his studies, people who are successful
``resolvers'' have certain characteristics. They develop a specific
plan of action, not just some hazy notion of how they will attain
their goals.
</P>
<P>
   The next characteristic is really important: Every bad trait or
habit they seek to wipe out, they replace with a healthy trait or
habit. For example, if you smoke cigarettes to relieve stress, you
need to develop relaxation techniques or other methods to deal with
your stress. Otherwise, hello Marlboro Man.
</P>
<P>
   Here are more tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Reward yourself for making small steps and sticking with it.
</P>
<P>
   --Rearrange your ``environment'' to help rather than hurt you.
(For example, don't take a coffee break with the friend who still
smokes.)
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid ``wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsuccessful resolvers use a lot more wishful thinking,'' he
says. ``They began to wish rather than work, and then they start
beating up on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As for willpower _ sure, it helps to have it, but willpower
alone won't carry you through the months to come. You must use
these other tricks.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to slipping up, or relapsing, it will please
you to know that successful ``resolvers'' slip as much as
``unsuccessful resolvers'' in those first few months, Norcross
says. The difference is that they get right back on the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross did a recent study that compared the success rates
among those who made New Year's resolutions and those who didn't
but still wanted to make change during the year to come. The
resolvers did better. That extra bit of initiative seems to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does pay to make resolutions,'' he says, ``as long as
you're realistic and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's a lot to be said for self-acceptance. ...

 &HT;    Signs of the times: MARTA speaks many languages
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, MARTA officials wanted to tell its passengers
about bus and train schedules for New Year's Eve. Soon all 36
stations had signs _ one side in English, the other in Spanish _
explaining the holiday plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual signs are tangible evidence of a city that
increasingly views itself as home to people from all over the
world. They also underscore Atlanta's efforts to court foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA began printing signs in languages other than English just
before the 1996 Olympics. After the international athletes and
spectators left, the agency realized that many residents who take
the bus and train speak Spanish far better than English, so it
decided to print many of its signs in both languages.
</P>
<P>
   Mitzi Rutledge, senior marketing associate for MARTA, said it
makes sense to explain bus and train timetables in languages that
users understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a bilingual population, and as MARTA serves Atlanta
as an international city, we felt it would be to our best advantage
to inform all our customers _ in Spanish and English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not have estimates of the number of Spanish-speaking
MARTA passengers. But in DeKalb and Fulton counties, where MARTA
operates, estimates of the Hispanic population range from 51,200 to
94,100.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also offers information in other languages on its Web
site (www.itsmarta.com) and by phone. In addition to information in
English and Spanish, the Web site has sections in Chinese, French,
German, Japanese, Spanish and English. People who call MARTA's
customer information line (404-848-4711) can get answers in
English, Spanish, Japanese, French and German.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that
581,000 international visitors came to Atlanta in 1997. About
115,600 were from Germany, Austria or Switzerland; 109,800 from the
United Kingdom, and 108,000 from other Western European countries.
It estimated that 62,000 came from Japan and 64,000 from other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   About 52,000 tourists were from South America, but the tourism
industry expects that number to rise now that Delta Air Lines has
added flights between Atlanta and Lima, Peru; Caracas, Venezuela;
San Jose, Costa Rica; Panama City, Panama; San Salvador, El
Salvador and Guatemala City, Guatemala.

 &HT;    South Floridians prepare for new year
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many 9-to-5 managerial types, Wayne
Groves' plans for this evening have been altered by the Y2K
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   The director of engineering at the Brighton Gardens by Marriott
senior home in West Palm Beach originally planned to spend tonight
getting married, going to dinner and attending a New Year's Eve
party.
</P>
<P>
   But his boss told him in November that he had to work the
midnight shift tonight in case the date change causes problems.
</P>
<P>
   His employer is trying to make his assignment palatable.
Obviously not expecting any computer calamities, Brighton Gardens
General Manager Joan Berzner suggested Groves and his fiancee,
Linda Sponburgh, exchange nuptials at the assisted living and
nursing facility at one minute past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if we had to work, we ought to do something,''
Berzner said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the least Berzner and other bosses can do for a chunk of
the workforce that's being asked to give up New Year's Eve plans
for a night of crushing boredom at best or cyber-cataclysm at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Juno Beach-based Florida Power &AMP; Light has 2,100 of its 10,000
employees working or on standby tonight. The FPL workforce for a
typical New Year's Eve is about 300.
</P>
<P>
   It's a massive just-in-case action by FPL, which pronounced
itself Y2K-ready in June after spending $50 million on computer
fixes. The utility will pay its employees overtime or give them
compensatory days off, Swank said. FPL is offering child care, food
and drawings for prizes and is promising some type of New Year's
festivities later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   At one of Palm Beach County's largest computer operations, the
National Council for Compensation Information in Boca Raton, 75
employees will work over the weekend shutting down the system today
and restarting it in phases beginning Saturday. NCCI, a
clearinghouse of information for the insurance industry, manages
about 20,000 computer programs and procedures, spokesman James
Wolfe said. NCCI employees who work over the weekend will get comp
days, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will, I'm sure, have a party afterwards,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Republic Security Bank employees gathering at the bank's West
Palm Beach headquarters tonight will eat barbecue from Red Hot &AMP;
Blue while keeping an eye out for Y2K problems. After midnight, 15
two-person teams, accompanied by security guards, will visit
automatic teller machines to make sure they are working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers pressed into New Year's Y2K duty will at least have
the satisfaction of seeing their bosses working as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Lawnwood Regional Medical Center and St. Lucie Medical Center
in St. Lucie County, none of the top executives escaped weekend
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``All four Os _ the CEO, the CFO, the CNO and the COO _ will be
here,'' said Lawnwood spokesman Beth Tuttle. ``Just in case there
are any issues, then they're here to assist. But in addition to
that it is providing moral support to all the employees who are
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Sheriff Bob Neumann and his top brass will be
at headquarters tonight, spokesman Paul Miller said. More than 500
deputies in uniform will be out on the streets, compared to about
140 on a normal New Year's Eve, said Capt. Al Musco.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies aren't allowed to take vacation today or tomorrow. The
deployment will be handled with some overtime and some
restructuring of shifts and will continue as long as officials see
a need, Musco said. Miller said extra personnel costs could be
$75,000.
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, where at least 35,000 partiers are expected
on Clematis Street, 60 city police will patrol the area, compared
to the usual eight for a Friday night or 12 for Clematis By Night
on Thursdays.

ON THE RETIREMENT ROAD, 65 IS STILL THEIR LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
Fred Brock is an editor at The New York Times. His column on the
approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each
month. 
E-mail: fbrock(AT)nytimes.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time some policy strategist or ivory-tower academic
suggests raising the retirement age to 70 for collecting full
Social Security benefits, I wish he would get up from his
ergonomically designed chair, go to Bloomfield, N.J., and spend a
day with William Gelenites or John Cuffari.
</P>
<P>
   Gelenites, 35, a carpenter, and Cuffari, 37, a laborer, wong the rising girders of an office building. Their jobs are
physically difficult, especially during the winter cold. And in
their circle of workers, the idea of staying on the job until 70 is
not exactly catching fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you reach 55 or 60 in the heavy construction
business, most contractors don't want you,'' Gelenites said. ``You
just can't do the hard work after years of getting banged around.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuffari pointed to a huge supermarket nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blocks they used to build that with weigh 105 pounds
each,'' he said. ``I lifted 90 percent of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelenites said there was pressure from contractors to keep
working hard all day. ``I've been on jobs where they get mad if you
take too many drinks of water,'' he said. ``It's go, go, go. If you
don't feel good and slack off, that's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   They work, often outside, in rain or snow. And they get paid
only if they work. ``There are no paid holidays, no vacation, no
sick days,'' Gelenites said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who are union members, also cite safety as an
especially acute issue for older construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuffari should know. In 1991, when he was 29, a scaffold on
which he was working collapsed, sending him crashing 20 feet to a
concrete floor. He suffered head injuries, his back was broken in
three places and his collarbone was fractured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been 66 or 67, I'd have been done for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to spend much time talking with people who build
our buildings, pave our roads, clean our office toilets or tote our
garbage to see clearly the contrast between them and people who
work in comfortably heated and air-conditioned offices. And guess
where those who make the retirement-policy decisions work?
</P>
<P>
   The notion of retiring at 65 is already slipping away, at least
as far as Social Security is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Changes made by Congress in 1983 are ratcheting up the
retirement age for people born after 1937. For instance, workers
born in 1942 must wait until they are 65 and 10 months to get full
benefits. Those born in 1960 or later must wait until they are 67.
Workers can still take early retirement at 62, but benefits are
reduced by 20 to 30 percent, depending on the year of birth.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration has a Web site (www.ssa.gov)
that lets you plug in the year you were born and find out when you
can retire under current law. I clicked on the year I was born,
1944, and discovered that I cannot get full retirement benefits
until I'm 66. Well, OK, I guess I can roll myself up to my keyboard
for a year longer than I had planned. But if I were operating a
jackhammer for a living . ...
</P>
<P>
   There is talk, of course, of raising the full retirement age to
70 _ a move that is always presented as necessary for ``saving''
Social Security, whether it needs it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Weisbrot is one of a growing number of economists who
thinks it does not. He is the co-director of the Center for
Economic and Policy Research in Washington and co-author, with Dean
Baker, of a new book, ``Social Security: The Phony Crisis''
(University of Chicago Press). They argue that even with economic
growth projections for the next 75 years that are only half the
last 75 years' average annual rate of 3 percent, the system will
experience only a small shortfall. That gap won't appear until 35
years from now, they say, and can be bridged with only minor
changes. At a growth rate of 3 percent, they contend, there will be
virtually no shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people believe Social Security is in trouble because they
have been told so by politicians in search of issues and by
right-wing ideologues who have opposed the whole notion of social
insurance since the New Deal and are looking for excuses to make
cuts,'' Weisbrot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, a big part of the push to increase the retirement age to
70 is simply that the policy crowd doesn't work at jobs in which
they're spent by the time they're 65.''
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you hear people calling for raising the
retirement age to 70, ask them what they do for a living.

LATIN AMERICAN STOCKS: A WILD BUT UPBEAT RIDE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
(bl) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Veteran investors in Latin American
stocks know to keep their seat belts buckled. There is a lot of
risk south of the border, and the stock price charts are wont to
zigzag wildly.
</P>
<P>
   That they did in 1999, a year that began with most of the region
enveloped in a deep recession set off by the 1998 Asian and Russian
currency crises.
</P>
<P>
   Major indexes approached the end of 1999 with substantial gains,
coming off the low levels of the previous year and helped by a
year-end rally. For the year through Thursday, Mexico's Bolsa index
was up 80.1 percent, Argentina's Merval was up 28 percent and
Brazil's Bovespa was up 151.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year begins, Latin American corporate profits remain
spotty, but a group of new Wall Street reports succinctly showcase
Latin America as a place where investor opportunities look
promising.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Merrill Lynch report had an ebullient subtitle: ``We've
had the Pain; Now for the Gains . . . The Stage Is Set for a Big
Year in 2000.'' And a Goldman, Sachs report urged investors to take
a close look at both stocks and bonds, predicting that total
returns ``will likely exceed those in both mature markets and
possibly non-Japan Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks _ from a possible inflationary spike in Brazil to
worries about Argentina's fiscal deficit _ bring with them the
potential for profits, especially because price-to-earnings ratios
in Latin American stocks are roughly half those found among big-cap
stocks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The positive view of the region is based on an improving
regional macroeconomic picture. Rising prices in agricultural and
industrial metal prices are improving trade balances in many
countries. Inflation is expected to be very low in most of the
region over the next several months, which should continue to bring
down interest rates and tempt local pension funds to move their
money from bonds to stocks. Most currencies in the area _ with the
exception of Argentina's _ are competitive on international
markets.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, some new governments have or will be
taking power over the next few months with fresh policies that Wall
Street expects to be investor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, Sachs, the change in the region's gross
domestic product will swing from a decline of 0.1 percent in 1999
to 4 percent growth in 2000. The firm also predicts that $38
million in new portfolio investment will flow into Latin American
stocks in 2000, up from $24 billion last year _ this in markets
with a total capitalization of barely $400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see some modest but potentially very powerful
increases in global investor allocations to Latin America in
2000,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, an equity analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. Those inflows, he noted, began in mid-October, prompting
the end-of-the-year rally in the regional stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the region, not surprisingly, range greatly. Wall
Street analysts generally favor Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico and
Argentina, while they are generally bearish on Venezuela and
Colombia, two countries with uncertain political outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   James Upton, Latin American equity strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston, said he liked the outlook for two Mexican companies
involved in construction. One, Cemex, has a strong and growing
market share in Mexico, has no real competition and has ``a
brilliant distribution system,'' he said. It was trading near 52
Mexican pesos late last week; Upton says it can hit 61 pesos in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Corporacion GEO, is a housing construction company that
is poised to take advantage of the country's pent-up demand for
low-income housing; Upton says it could rise 35 percent by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Upton also recommends Tele Centro Sul and Tele Norte Leste, two
cellular phone spinoffs of Telebras, Brazil's state telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Pineda, a portfolio manager of Merrill Lynch's Latin
America and Developing Capital Markets funds, said she was
cautiously optimistic about 2000, although ``we're always very
skeptical when we have these strong rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she likes the Brazilian fixed-line and cellular
telephone companies _ particularly Embratel _ as well as CBD, a
Brazilian retailer. She also likes Televisa and TV Azteca, the two
Mexican television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Heap, vice president for Latin American equities at
Deutsche Bank, likes the growth potential in several of the
region's banks. She particularly favors Bradesco in Brazil, since
it trades at a significant discount to its competitors and has
several industrial holdings it can sell to increase earnings. The
stock, trading around 11.5 reals late last week, could reach 15
reals in 12 months, Ms. Heap said.
</P>
<P>
   She also saw Banco Galicia of Argentina and Bancomer of Mexico
as two banks that could benefit from increased consumer demand for
products like credit cards and mortgages. Ms. Heap thinks they will
rise 30 and 42 percent, respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
   But as always with Latin American stocks, there is that note of
caution. ``Is stability ever assured?'' Ms. Heap asked. ``Well,
prospects have certainly brightened.''

THE FANTASY AND THE FACT OF NEW STOCK OFFERINGS

 Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His New York Times column on
investment strategies appears every other Sunday. E-mail:

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to initial public offerings, rarely have investor
expectations diverged as much from reality as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy, of course, is that you can get rich quickly _ that
all you have to do is buy a new issue at the offering price and you
have it made.
</P>
<P>
   In this dream, the shares will double, triple or more on the day
the company goes public, as they did in early December for VA Linux
Systems. Better yet, the stock's potential after that first day is
even larger _ as has been the case with Cisco Systems, prime fodder
for the fantasy. It is up some 84,000 percent since it went public
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But it is time for a dose of reality. Assuming you are lucky
enough to be among the few allowed to participate in the offering
at its opening, the odds are still slim of being able to double or
triple your money on the offering day. And even if you can, the
chances are even less favorable that the stock will continue to
perform well.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the average first-day premium on a new issue _ that is,
the amount that it rises above its offering price during its first
day of trading. Historically, that premium has been quite modest,
according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of
Florida. During the 1970s and '80s, he found, it averaged just 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And though the average first-day premium has risen somewhat in
the 1990's, it still is a far cry from the investor fantasy: from
1990 through 1999, according to Ritter, it averaged just 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all that's wrong with the fantasy. Over their
first few months of trading, as many new issues decline in price as
rise, he finds. Indeed, 57 percent of the new issues in 1998 were
trading below their offering prices on Dec. 31 of that year. Nor
was 1998 unique. The average for each of the two previous years was
close to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the fantasy isn't hard to figure. During 1999, new
issues performed far better, on average, than in any year since
1975.
</P>
<P>
   The average first-day premium of new issues during 1999 was 70
percent, nearly five times the average for the rest of the the
1990s. Furthermore, as of Dec. 22, according to Professor Ritter,
just 27 percent of the year's new issues were trading below their
offering prices, compared with about 50 percent for previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, last year was the exception that has led many investors
to forget the rule.
</P>
<P>
   If you still believe that the 1999 results will become the norm,
remember that all this data assumes that investors are allowed to
buy into each new issue at its initial offering price. That is
unrealistic. So consider what would have happened if an investor
had bought each of the new issues of 1999 at the closing price on
its first trading day _ in contrast to its offering price. His
return would have been 81 percent as of Dec. 28 _ still impressive,
but less than half the 199 percent he would have made from buying
at the offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, more than half the time, an investor would have done
better last year buying an unmanaged Nasdaq composite index fund
than buying an initial public offering at the close of the first
day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter notes another reason that the biggest new issues of 1999
are unlikely to keep producing huge percentage gains: today's new
stocks tend to have far larger market capitalizations from Day One
_ meaning that they often don't have as much room to grow.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cisco had a market cap of just $300 million at the
end of its first day of trading. By contrast, 14 of the nearly 500
new issues last year had market caps of more than $3 billion after
their first day of trading, accounting for more than half the total
initial market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   I'm willing to bet that these recent issues won't produce gains
over the next decade anywhere close to 84,000 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who predict the future should be condemned to live in it.
But having passed a large, if arbitrary, signpost in time, it's a
good occasion to look forward, to see what the world could be like
a quarter of the way through the century that starts today.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, you can bet that more transformative
technologies like the 20th century's Internet, birth-control pill
and microwave ovens will blindside us, gulping chunks of our lives
and spitting out something very different.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Daily News talked to a couple of dozen people who
spend their days at the edge of now, looking forward. Life will be
different, and probably in a lot of ways, they told us.
</P>
<P>
   But we can probably count on one thing: It won't be much like
the lives of that ``typical family of the 21st century,'' the
Jetsons, with their airborne flivvers and space-age styles.
Instead, we offer a more likely vision of a typical morning in
2025:
</P>
<P>
   The gentle woof of your AIROBOT mechanical dog wakes you at 7
a.m., your LycraLethr slippers gently gripped in its drool-free,
carbon-fiber mouth. Its eyes literally light up as you arise.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom sensor of your HausFrau smart-home network also
notices you're awake, and reverses the polarity of polymer linings
in the house's south- and east-facing windows, blinking them from
dark to transparent to let the morning sunlight in.
</P>
<P>
   Still a bit woozy from the exertions of last night's Netgame of
Eco-Defender on your PlayStation 8 home media controller, you
stumble into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, at 55, you're getting a little old to hang with the kids
in the big Eco-Defender fragfests. It may be time to buy a better
avatar and a gaming exoskeleton to boost your performance. After
all, you never can tell who may be watching the contest, especially
during tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   Noting your groggy demeanor, the HausFrau has already set the
coffee maker to brew the java a little stronger this morning. Its
melodic female voice also suggests you take a couple of extra
``nutriceuticals,'' the hancing drugs you get through the
government-run Personal Care HealthNet established after the big
HMO bustout of 2009.
</P>
<P>
   You normally take the anti-aging blend preferred by your elders,
the baby boomers, who are still clutching their faded youth even as
some of them lurch toward a relatively fabulous 80. Today, with
some demanding work ahead, you add a couple of the Memory Pakk tabs
your children prefer, especially on test days, to boost their
ability to retain and recall information.
</P>
<P>
   You sit down to your SmartReader personal
communicator-organizer, which has filtered through the ocean of
available information fmix of world and business news you
like.
</P>
<P>
   It also pulls down sports stories about your alma mater, any
pieces about you or your friends, and, because you're divorced, ads
by potentially compatible singles from within your Geographic
Acceptability Radius. You've also tweaked the SmartReader's
Serendipity Filter to randomly mix in some unexpected stories, vid
programs and music.
</P>
<P>
   The SmartReader is voice activated, whispering to you through
the tiny EarDrop microphone/speaker in your ear. It has a thin,
touch-sensitive, high-resolution screen, but you chose a thicker
model, with its reassuring booklike solidity, for reasons of
nostalgia as much as anything.
</P>
<P>
   Your children actually prefer sheet-thin Sony VAIOmats that they
can also slip in an inner pocket of their brilliantly colored
Levi's cotton/NuRon ThinkJackets. The VAIOmats even run the
jackets' graphics programs, splashing the latest downloaded designs
and music across the fabric's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Today's news is, unsurprisingly, a bit grim in many parts of the
world:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Indonesian archipelago, with its hundreds of languages and
thousands of islands, has been Exhibit 1 in the bloody worldwide
wave of secession movements that have erased many of the old
post-colonial political boundaries. The archipelago, which has
already spawned 17 new countries in 26 years, is facing another
messy breakup that requires the presence of the UN World Police.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Arabian peninsula, dissident Shi'ite guerillas keep
lofting ballistic missiles laden with nasty chemicals into Saudi
settlements and tourist resorts. The guerrillas want the trillions
of dollars in Saudi assets accumulated before hydrogen fuel cells
rendered the worldwide oil shortage moot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another huge F5 tornado ripped through several exclusive Texas
enclaves built to house the nation's many elderly, well-off
retirees. The winds are part of a worldwide pattern of powerful
storms blamed in part on continued global warming.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United Nations Information Secretariat announced a new
effort to control the proliferation of private currencies, the
increasing popularity of which had been blamed for the dollar's
2009 and 2017 collapses. Given the many pirate data havens such as
the Turks and Caicos Islands, however, observers said the new
effort would fail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Locally, South Los Angeles Mayor Janice Hahn-Rivera said Dee
Dee Buss had agreed to bring her L.A. X-Flyers extreme sports team
to the Coliseum, installing a halfpipe and motocross track among
other improvements to the historic structure. Preservationists
worried that the hill required for the street luge would endanger
or obscure the structure's famous peristyle.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Flyers would be the Coliseum's first pro-tenant since
football died out and Major League Soccer team owners refused to
grant L.A. a second franchise because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Done with the news, you also check your stocks' performance in
Tokyo's Nikkei and Paris' Le Bourse exchanges. You pulled out of
Hong Kong's Hang Sen exchange last month to protest the violent
crushing of south China's secessionist movement. The world boycott
had sent tremors through the Chinese Red Army's financial holdings,
and led to a purge the past two weeks of political officers blamed
for the fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   You also note with satisfaction the money you made overnight
selling surplus power from your house's fuel-cell generator to the
grid.
</P>
<P>
   After your shower, you look in the mirror. Chances are the
person looking back at you will be older, single or divorced,
bilingual, Latino, possibly with biracial children whose mixed
heritage is unremarkable in the region's mish-mash of cultures.
</P>
<P>
   You pull on the new temperature-sensitive shirt you bought
yesterday at Nordstrom's mind-blowing Shopping Experience store.
The shirt's changing colors will go nicely with the roller shoes
your shopping-agent software plucked off Ross/Marshall's surplus
site last month.
</P>
<P>
   You empty the last of the milk into a glass, then toss the jug
into the trash can, where it is compacted and sorted into a
recyclables bin. The trash can's bar-code reader also tells
HausFrau to order more milk from the WebPod grocery delivery
service.
</P>
<P>
   While munching your no-cholesterol eggs from genetically
enhanced free-range chickens, you use the SmartReader to
investigate the cost of a weekend singles getaway to NEO-Universal,
the Near-Earth-Orbit space hotel and theme park stationed about 40
miles overhead.
</P>
<P>
   In space, you'll give your weary bones a break from the rigors
of earth's gravity, while trying ultimate bungee jumping and
Universal's new immersion adventure, Terminator 8: Beyond Outer
Space. And of course, maybe you'll meet someone else on the singles
cruise interested in exploring other beneficial aspects of zero
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use the SmartReader to send and read messages, pull
up the text of what used to be books and newspaper articles, make
voice calls, maintain your finances, schedule appointments to see
your children, play games, gamble at an Indian casino, shop, tell
HausFrau to handle basic chores and security, and watch Netvids.
</P>
<P>
   After a nice walk, you head to work, which is two doors down the
hall from your bedroom. You slide your SmartReader into its cradle,
kick on the big wall display, and check the overnight progress by
your overseas subcontractors in Bangalore and Singapore, review the
latest work orders from your clients and check your schedule of
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Your scheduler reminds you that you have a parent-teacher
conference later in the day at the cram school for your boy, Elroy.
The scheduling software has already made sure your ex, Jane, can
attend as well.
</P>
<P>
   Your eldest child, daughter Judy, is dealing with a very
different kind of educational experience since she graduated from
high school. During her midday break from troubleshooting traffic
problems on the Internet 4 ultra-high-speed data backbone, she's
using a remote connection to catch an Electric University
professor's lecture on neural nets.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to head to Elroy's school, you'll unplug your
electric car from its dock in the garage and pull silently into the
street. Golden light beams warmly through the sun roof. Life is
good. &QL;

VISIONARIES LOOK AT LIFE IN 2025
</HEADLINE>

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To get a handle on what life will be like in 2025, we talked to
a number of experts. Here's what they had to say: &QL; 
ERA OF THE SMART WAR
</P>
<P>
   _ Bart Kosko, information scientist, University of Southern
California, author of ``The Fuzzy Future'':
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be around 10 billion people on earth, and about 85
percent of all remaining oil will be on the Arabian Peninsula. The
big change will be when hydrogen fuel cells or some other
alternative energy source is developed. Until then, there will be a
huge exponentiation of profits for those (Arabian Peninsula)
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an era of smart war, where, for the first time, it
will be cheaper to attack than to defend. Cruise missiles are an
example of that. Everyone is picking them up. And there's the onset
of nanotechnology. The easiest thing to do with nanotechnology is
to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is now at 193 countries. I'll put it
comfortably at 300 by then. Then there's the question of Israel. I
think it'll be overrun two or three times by then. And the question
of Muslim radicalism has to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ```The world will have to figure out who owns the oceans,
perhaps by randomly assigning an equal volume for each country to
oversee with surveillance satellites to control pollution and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is evaporating, too. My belief is the Internet,
instead of being the door to digital freedom, is the entering edge
of a true world government'' because it gets around national
efforts to control information, taxation, financial transactions
and more. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VISUAL LITERACY
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiffany Shlain, director of the Webby Awards:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we go in the direction of a more Orwellian society?
Whenever everyone has the ability to watch everyone else, do we
have any privacy left? One issue is how connected do you want to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer use a phone in my home. That's become my sacred
space. I need to set my own new boundaries for connectivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be more important to be visually literate. Knowledge
will no longer be what you know, but what you can look up. You'll
be able to control your dreams, in part because of developments in
brain mapping. Currently, we know almost nothing about the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll have smart trash cans and a contact lens that
will project a heads-up display on your eye with information.
Instead of click- throughs, you'll have blink-throughs.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARTIFICIAL PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Trowbridge, show producer for Universal Studios Creative
Division and a creator of its Spider-man ride in Orlando, Fla.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of new options for image
delivery systems in 25 years; it's quite possible we'll have
realistic holographic imagery, so you can have real people and
artificial people sitting in the same room with you. If we were
doing T2 (the Terminator 2 3-D ride) in 25 years, what if that
monster reached out and speared the 'guy' next to you and tossed
him off to the side? That would make you feel the impact.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALWAYS CONNECTED
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Schwartz, futurist and chairman of the Global Business
Network:
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal communicator device is here, and one of the big
changes in life will be that to be disconnected is a matter of
choice, rather than to get connected. Today you make some gesture
of connection. In the future, you're connected all the time, and
the question is when do you disconnect?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will cure a lot of things, like heart disease. The other
(big medical change) is the growth of medical enhancements to the
quality of life,'' as has already happened with Viagra and laser
eye surgery. People will live longer and be in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power will erode from large institutions of all kinds, from
military generals to electrical companies to big universities. And
managing our money will become a big part of each day's routine,
with more than half of all Americans already stockholders.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE WORLD AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Boyl, professor of digital media at UCLA's School of
Theater, Film and Television:
</P>
<P>
   ``We could start designing characters with real consciousness.
Not just characters that look like Mickey Mouse, but how does
Mickey think, how does he act, what does he feel? Can we copyright
his persona?''
</P>
<P>
   Interactivity (video gaming) and connectivity (the Internet)
will merge more fully. And you'll ``have the information of the
world at your fingertips. You really don't need to go to the
office; the office is around you. You're free to move around the
country. Cities are a lot less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say about Los Angeles, which is all set up with
the infrastructure of production. It used to be, 'We have the
studio, you have to come to us.' That's not the case anymore. That
really turns the whole paradigm on its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filmmaking is starting to become a lot more like writing a
book, where everybody has access to the technology. It comes down
to the creativity, to what you have to say.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
INFINITE WEB
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Williams, president of Sony's Digital Studios Division:
</P>
<P>
   Digital technologies in filmmaking are already ``creating new
business opportunities, especially in the content creation and
distribution side. It's evolved into restoration, new editing
techniques, now increasingly into visual effects and
photo-realistic animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the distribution sphere, we're finding tremendous
opportunities in the new horizon of broadband delivery. In the
future, we'll have traditional linear content, but that will be
just scratching the surface. We'll have a menu of additional
content. The ability to access and really personalize your
entertainment is what is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now talking about an infinite-channel Web. There is room
for a lot of new content _ and not just content defined as movies
and TV. My sense is the greater levels of access from lowered
barriers to content generally is a good thing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VERY 3-D
</P>
<P>
   _ Al Teller, CEO of online record label Atomic Pop, former head
of CBS Records and MCA Music Group:
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the (music) business is concerned, I think it's
going to be completely reinvented. The only constants are the
artists and the people who buy their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience will be so much more sophisticated than it is
today. It will be very 3-D. You'll stroll down the aisles of a
(virtual) store. Touch an album, and it's there _ and it's
instantly available wherever you want it. You'll get charged some
tiny fraction for playing it one or two times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will expand the music business but also expand the music
business possibilities for people who did not have power in the old
paradigm. The traditional record companies aren't going to
disappear, but they're going to have to adapt. Whatever the market
share of the companies is right now, looking out 25 years it's
going to be a radically smaller market share.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THERMO-REACTIVE CLOTHES
</P>
<P>
   _ Suzanne Achtemeier, Cotton Inc. trend spokeswoman, and Molly
Vanden Bosch, trend spokeswoman for Cotton Inc.'s Lifestyle
Monitor:
</P>
<P>
   Achtemeier: ``Cotton will have a new future with reflective and
thermo-reactive finishes. And feng shui principles will be used in
apparel to ease the path to inner harmony through clothing with
tranquil silhouettes and the use of symbolic or archetypal prints
that excite or calm the mind and senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Bosch: ``We continue to see a movement toward luxury and
elegance _ not opulent and exaggerated, but discreet, precious and
feminine. There is an increased emphasis on surface and texture.
Even smooth surfaces will be given finishes to achieve visual
texture such as metallic, luminescent and opalescent treatments.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LOW-MAINTENANCE COMFORT
</P>
<P>
   _ Gerald Celente, author of ``Trends 2000,'' editor/publisher of
the Trends Journal newsletter:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll want low-maintenance comfort in our homes. For instance,
houses will be one floor only and built ramp-ready. Younger people
will be very appliance-oriented, because they grew up in the wide
world of computers. Their homes will be designed so that you walk
into a room for a three-dimensional, virtual reality online
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt there will be space-age fashion made of plastic or
paper, because this is real life, not science fiction. But I do
predict more and more microfibers that will repr blend with
natural fibers.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRACTICAL AND FLATTERING
</P>
<P>
   _ Leon Hall, spokesman for the Fashion Association:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's out in 2025 will be tattoos, because there's nothing
sadder than a sagging tattoo on a mature body, but we'll still be
poking ourselves with needles, as collagen and botox injections
will be commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, people will be less concerned about what's trendy
and more concerned about what's practical and flattering. For
instance, leather with Lycra will make us all look better, plus
keep our shoes looking newer. Platinum is the metal of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bargain hunters will shop the Internet, but retail won't be
dead. Customer service and such things as tailoring will be key for
the store of the future.''

LONDON DOME FAILS TO MAIL MANY TICKETS FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE
CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The government's elaborate plan to transport 10,000
people into the Millennium Dome on New Year's Eve has stumbled
badly, it emerged on Thursday, because the company that was
handling the tickets failed to mail them all out in time.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several thousand guests will have to stand in line,
possibly for hours, at two designated subway stops early Friday
evening to pick up their tickets before traveling on special buses
to the dome, which was built at a cost of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New Millennium Experience Co., Debbie
Read, said the logistical problems were caused by the failure of
guests to return their elaborate application forms for tickets on
time. The forms were long questionnaires that required, among other
information, mothers' maiden names and required guests to provide
recent photographs and photocopies of a drivers' licenses or
passports.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were quite slow at getting back security forms by the
deadline,'' Ms. Read said. ``That's what delayed everything. We
didn't want the rest of the tickets to get caught up in the post
between Christmas and New Year's, and we took the decision that if
the deadlines weren't met, we'd have to hand them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10,000 tickets, 4,500 have been mailed, 2,500 have been
distributed by staff members, and 3,000 have not been sent and will
be distributed at the subway stops, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are to include an array of celebrities, politicians and
dignitaries, including the entire British government and Queen
Elizabeth, as well as several thousand people from around the
country who won tickets in regional competitions.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve is sure to present a major logistical headache
for people who are trying to celebrate in London, anyway. The city
is on a tight security alert because of fears of possible terrorist
attacks, including from renegade groups unhappy with the prospect
of long-term peace in Northern Ireland, and many roads and bridges
in and around London will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The subway stop closest to the dome will also be closed, forcing
all guests to arrive and depart on buses that will take them to
cars that they will have parked outside the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Britons have generally been skeptical about the dome and the
news on Thursday did not help its image. The Evening Standard
called the mix-up a fiasco and said although the millennium
celebration might still prove wonderful, ``the dome's bosses are
cutting it very, very fine.''

 &HT;    60 years later, a second `lovely mind trip' from Disney
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1940, decades before the era of music videos, Disney Studios
merged animation and classical music in a ``concert feature''
called ``Fantasia.'' Even before it was released, Walt Disney
announced his intention to revisit the concept at frequent
intervals, generating new installments.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie met with the scorn of critics who called it a
``vulgarization of art'' and the indifference of a public that was
used to more low-brow and cuddly cartoon fare. Disney later
remarked of ``Fantasia,'' ``If we had it to do all over again, I
don't think we'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet 60 years later, after the original film became a financial
success through videocassette sales, the notion of such a sequel _
Disney animation staffers prefer the label ``continuation'' _ has
reached fruition. On Saturday, ``Fantasia/2000'' opens in scores of
IMAX large format theaters, prior to wide release in 35mm prints
this June.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1940 ``Fantasia,'' this new version is a series of
short, non-verbal, often non-narrative animation sequences,
depicting such diverse subjects as a flying pod of whales, Noah's
ark and flamingos with yo-yos, set to existing music selections by
Beethoven, Stravinsky and Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined is whether today's younger generation is
willing to sit for serious music. ``I think classical music has, in
some sense, lost its audience,'' says Don Hahn, producer of ``The
Lion King'' and ``Beauty and the Beast,'' who was in charge of the
transitional sequences of ``Fantasia/2000'' that feature performing
arts celebrities from Bette Midler to James Earl Jones. ``If you
were to go, certainly in Los Angeles, to a symphony concert, it's
not packed with kids. So I think some of our hope is to let
audiences, and especially kids, know that classical music is their
music too. It's not just the music of their grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually every Disney feature, ``Fantasia/2000'' is aimed
at all ages, from tots to seniors, to those children of the '60s
who made a re-issue of the original film popular in that era
because of its hallucinatory images. Hahn is aware of that market
segment, but he insists they have not been specifically targeted
for the new feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't sit down and say, 'What will the reefer crowd think
of this?' But it's a chance to just go way out there with images,''
notes Hahn. ``I mean, look at something like (composer Ottorino
Respighi's) ``Pines of Rome'' with its flying whales. I think the
audience, no matter where you're at, you can go to the film and
appreciate it on your level, because it's just a lovely mind trip
through some beautiful art and beautiful music.''
</P>
<P>
   Animators had long lobbied for a new ``Fantasia,'' which allowed
them more artistic latitude than the usual Disney subjects. ``For
us, and for me personally, it was a chance to do something
experimental that maybe you couldn't do in the course of a movie
like ``Lion King'' or ``Tarzan,'' ' says Hahn. ``You can branch out
and do something very abstract. To be able to just let images
unfold on the screen is really liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reviewers will even be liberated from those negative
reactions to the 1940 ``Fantasia'' and to the novel use of serious
music with cartoons, which was so controversial. ``Always, when you
do art you leave yourself open to that,'' says ``Fantasia/2000''
producer Donald W. Ernst. ``And we've edited the music, which some
people will say, 'Gee, you've ruined the music' or 'You've
bastardized the art,' but that's what we do. We are trying to do
something that is artistic and when you do that there are some
people that aren't going to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a way to make ``Fantasia/2000'' more of an event,
Disney motion picture group chairman Dick Cook came up with the
idea of releasing it first in IMAX format. Created with numerous
computer-generated imagery (CGI) sequences, it was a relatively
simple matter to transfer it onto IMAX stock, which is 10 times
larger than conventional 35mm film. ``The cost is honestly not
tremendously higher,'' says Ernst. ``I mean the stock is more
expensive, but you don't have to go back and re-do the artwork or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At 75 minutes, it becomes the first feature-length film released
in IMAX, whose screens are as much as eight stories high. Still,
that means that for the first four months, ``Fantasia/2000'' will
play at only 60 theaters in North America and another 17 overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiating with IMAX theaters, many in science centers that
play several different films throughout the day, Disney insisted on
exclusivity for ``Fantasia/2000.'' Several venues balked at the
stipulation, including the California Science Center, the only
permanent IMAX theater in Los Angeles. With a thumb to its nose,
Disney has built its own steel-and-fiberglass tent IMAX theater for
the movie at a cost of some $4 million, expecting to tear it down
after April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty, isn't it?,'' remarks Hahn. ``It really is the heart
leading the head a little bit. It's that kind of bravura that I
love as a filmmaker, because I know there's a company behind my
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   You could screen ``Fantasia/2000'' around the clock and not
recoup its costs in four months. ``Oh, absolutely not,'' says
Ernst. Still, Disney execs will be poring over the box office
numbers, using this as a test of future IMAX release strategies.
</P>
<P>
   As to the original ``Fantasia,'' it was intended not only as an
experiment in music and animation, but also as a vehicle to put
Disney's franchise rodent, Mickey Mouse, back in the spotlight. The
first segment ever created was ``The Sorceror's Apprentice,'' set
to the music of Paul Dukas, and it has been brought back for
``Fantasia/2000.'' Next to the new sequences, though, it looks
somewhat muddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little grainy,'' concedes Hahn. ``They certainly hadn't
envisioned IMAX when they made it back in the late '30s. But that
was something that we really felt that we had to include.''
</P>
<P>
   Also intended to be reprised was the ``Nutcracker Suite''
sequence, with its dancing straws, mushrooms and hippos. In test
screenings, however, it seemed to slow the movie's momentum. ``We
just didn't feel it was working, and so we took it out,'' says
Ernst tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined is whether ``Fantasia/2000'' will signal
a return to Walt Disney's dream on a series of such movies, more
often than every 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oddity for us as a movie,'' says Hahn, ``(but) it's
kind of the crown jewel, the heart of Disney.'' A factor in whether
there are future ``Fantasia''s will surely be the box office
results, but as Hahn points out, ``If that were a consideration for
the original ``Fantasia,'' we never would have done another one.''

DISNEY SCORES WITH `FANTASIA/2000'

<P>
   ``Fantasia'' is back, and it's bigger than ever. Louder and more
technically advanced, too.
</P>
<P>
   But better?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: If Walt Disney's 59-year-old effort to
marry classical music with cartoon animation was kitsch that later
generations mistook for cinematic art, future audiences may
consider ``Fantasia/2000'' art. What it is at the moment is a
state-of-the-sciences introduction to great and marginally great
music for kids, a good deal of fun and not quite as imaginative as
you'd like it to be.
</P>
<P>
   And, as mentioned, ``F2K'' is big. It's screening exclusively at
IMAX theaters through the end of April, including a brand spanking
new one that the Disney company built just for this run off the 405
Freeway at the Howard Hughes Parkway, down around where Culver City
meets Westchester. The movie should hit standard-size screens later
this year, but a key part of the experience _ except in the forlorn
case of one segment _ is seeing the beautifully wrought drawing
dance across, practically, your entire field of vision. ``F2K'' is
the first non-documentary, feature-length production presented in
IMAX, and it certainly doesn't waste the medium's capacity for
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Depth is a somewhat different matter. ``F2K,'' which contains
seven new animated segments and the Mickey Mouse ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice'' sequence from the original, gets off to an impressive
start with computerized bits from the first ``Fantasia'' flying
around a studio where the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, under the
leadership of James Levine, is tuning up for the upcoming toons.
This leads into the film's most abstract and arguably most
successful segment, a semi-psychedelic symphony of light and
patterns set to Beethoven's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Then we get Steve Martin, the first and funniest of several
segment hosts, pushing his two-week master musician study course
and introducing a variation _ to put it mildly _ on Respighi's
``Pines of Rome.'' No Italian trees in sight in this heavily
computerized vision of flying whales romping through arctic seas
and skies. Marked by rich cloud and water formations and stunning
perspective shifts, it's an accomplished presentation that never
quite transcends its visual origins, which can basically be found
at any tourist gallery on the island of Maui.
</P>
<P>
   The film's approach to Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' is
certainly apt. Based on the flat line drawings of celebrity
caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, it follows several residents of
Depression-era New York through their day and daydreams.
Conceptually inspired all the way around, but the characters'
adventures unfortunately add up to very little.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better put-together pieces sets Hans Christian
Anderson's ``The Steadfast Tin Soldier'' to a section of
Shastakovich's second piano concerto. Though much of it is
computer-generated, this particular toy story has a richly shaded
and colored, classic animation look, plus a fast, eventful and
wonderfully sustained pace.
</P>
<P>
   Low points immediately follow. A quick thing involving flamingos
and a yo-yo set to Saint-Saens seems like so much animal slapstick
_ and it can't help but compare unfavorably with the lyrically
loony hippo ballet from the first ``Fantasia.'' But just when
they've got you longing nostalgically, up comes ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' which, all splotchy and grainy on the humongous
screen, becomes that forlorn piece mentioned earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``F2K'' somewhat regains its footing in the stretch, with an
amusing Donald Duck as Noah's assistant ark-filler while some
``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches play. Things crescendo with
another mystical/environmental/New Agey bit, in which a water
sprite accidentally awakens Stravinsky's Firebird and sees her
forest turned to ash. Like most of the new film's segments, this
one echoes a piece from the original _ the genuinely chilling
``Night on Bald Mountain'' _ and seems to echo it faintly at that.
</P>
<P>
   But even if ``F2K'' doesn't initially sing to us as vibrantly as
we felt ``Fantasia'' did, it certainly does not lack the kind of
artistry that could resonate with future viewings and future
audiences. And there can be no question that as much care and love
went into creating this extension of Disney's dream as Uncle Walt
lavished on his first, now-classical-by-consensus attempt. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market was the story in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite roared, largely on the strength of
technology stocks. Initial public offerings soared, especially
those of money-losing Internet companies. Investors rewrote the
rules of how to make money in stocks. No revenues? No earnings? No
problem!
</P>
<P>
   And so it is time again for the Augustus Melmotte Memorial
Prizes, named for the scoundrel of questionable lineage at the
center of ``The Way We Live Now,'' by Anthony Trollope. Melmotte's
stock manipulation scheme lured some of London's most established
families, and the awards go to some of the most alluring men and
women of business for various feats and foibles in the last year of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   THE MR. AMBIDEXTROUS AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Halfway through the year, he began to raise interest rates, hoping
to brake the economy before it reached inflation's gate. Then, to
forestall Year 2000 problems, he flooded the nation's banking
system with money, canceling out the slowdown that he hoped to
create with his three rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   THE ``WHERE IS MIKE MILKEN WHEN I NEED HIM?'' AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon. Struggling under a
crushing debt load, Perelman put Revlon on the block. Yet he found
no one willing to pay his asking price for the company. It's a
shame that Milken can no longer bail him out with a
sure-to-sell-out junk bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEDGING HER BETS AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Jill Barad, the beleaguered chairman and chief executive of
Mattel Inc. Her job is on the line, thanks to a stream of earnings
disappointments and the botched $3.8 billion acquisition of the
Learning Co. in May, which resulted in $105 million in losses four
months later. Despite the problems, Ms. Barad announced in November
that she had recently bought 65,000 shares of Mattel stock at about
$13.75 each. While some investors saw the buys as a sign of her
confidence that the stock had bottomed, others surmised that Ms.
Barad was simply hedging. If she managed to cling to her job, she
would retain her over-the-top compensation ($4.75 million in 1998).
But if Mattel's board were to bounce her, the company's stock would
no doubt jump, making her newly bought shares worth much more than
she paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   THE INGENUITY IN ACCOUNTING AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Donald Trump, real estate developer, would-be president of
the United States and chairman of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts.
In announcing its third-quarter results Oct. 25, the company said
its net income had more than doubled from the corresponding quarter
a year earlier. The stock rose more than 8 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   Only later, when a fixed-income analyst tried to delve into the
numbers, did it emerge that the rise in revenue was really just an
example of accounting moxie. Upon the closing of an Official
All-Star Cafe in the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J.,
the casino was given use of the restaurant's fixtures and
memorabilia for four months. Presto change-o, and Trump added $17.2
million to its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   THE LESS IS MORE AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Carly Fiorina, the new chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
Under her leadership, the company _ which had been known as a model
for full disclosure of quarterly results _ has significantly
reduced the amount of data it gives to investors and analysts in
its conference calls. In its fourth-quarter conference call Nov.
17, HP said it would henceforth provide actual figures on
companywide orders only when it thought they were meaningful.
``What we want to do is spend time providing accurate, insightful
information,'' said Marlene Somsak, manager of media and financial
communications for Hewlett-Packard, ``not information that is
potentially misleading.'' It was not immediately clear how
dispensing more information could be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   THE WHAT GOES UP KEEPS GOING UP AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To the Nasdaq composite stock index, the highest flier by far of
the major indexes in 1999. The Nasdaq, which trounced both the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average,
benefited greatly from the mania for initial public offerings of
technology stocks. Almost every time a hot new stock came out, it
went directly into the stratosphere and the Nasdaq. Because 1999
broke all records for both issuance of initial public offerings and
first-day jumps in the prices of the issues, it is little wonder
the Nasdaq was up 84 percent as the year was drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   THE CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR TRYING AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Howard Schultz, chief executive of the Starbucks Corp. In
May, the java-meister told analysts that Starbucks was going
Internet and would start a ``destination'' portal to sell
furniture, kitchenware and other household gear in time for the
Christmas selling season. As happens when any company makes known
its e-plans, the stock rose smartly on the news. That is, until
late June, when the company announced that the online plan would
hammer earnings. Investors fled the stock. Even a July announcement
that the Internet plan had been sharply scaled back didn't help.
The shares are still in need of a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   THE THROUGH-THE-LOOKING-GLASS AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To fledgling Internet companies at the center of an investing
mania unlike any other, one that convinced investors to turn
traditional stock valuation methods upside down. Before the
Internet came along, losses were something investors did not like
to see on a company's books. Here and now in wonderland, the
greater the losses, the higher the stocks fly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE MY MARKET'S BETTER THAN YOUR MARKET AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, and
Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the Nasdaq stock market. In the race to build the
biggest, best, most global and influential market in the world,
both men wanted to be the first to issue stock in their operations
to the public. As often happens with ambitious plans, however, the
details proved too devilish to work out by year-end. The race was
called off. Temporarily, of course.
</P>
<P>
   THE DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO AWARD
</P>
<P>
   To Harvey Houtkin, self-proclaimed father of electronic day
trading and proprietor of the All-Tech Investment Group, a
brokerage firm that teaches individual investors the joys of
trading stocks furiously all day. Anybody with $25,000 and a dream
can make a living day-trading stocks, Houtkin proclaimed on his Web
site. Never mind that even the master trader himself lost $392,558
day-trading for All-Tech in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   THE ``WHO SAID INSURANCE ISN'T SEXY?'' AWARD  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Martin Frankel, the nerdy Greenwich, Conn., financier. He is
accused of plundering troubled insurance companies to secure the
hundreds of millions of dollars that made him the chick-magnet he
knew he could be. Frankel and a female companion were apprehended
in Hamburg, Germany, in September, four months after he fled his
Greenwich manse, leaving a pile of documents smoldering in the
fireplace. While investigators try to sort out Frankel's financial
dealings, he is cooling his heels in a German jail.
</P>
<P>
   THE DECADE'S MOST EXPENSIVE HANDSHAKE AWARD  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Henry met Walter _ Henry Silverman, chairman of HFS, and
Walter Forbes, chief executive of CUC International _ neither knew
that the encounter would place them firmly in the record books. The
two men merged their companies into the Cendant Corp. in late 1997,
but the total cost of the deal didn't register until 1999, when
Cendant agreed to pay $2.8 billion to settle shareholder lawsuits _
the biggest such settlement ever _ that grew out of accounting
irregularities uncovered at the former CUC. And don't forget the
$335 million that Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm, agreed to pay
to settle accusations that it had certified CUC's questionable
bookkeeping. (BOX) &QL;

HOUSTON BALLET'S STEVENSON GETS ROYAL HONOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MOLLY GLENTZER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, he was a hilariously hefty Sugar Plum Fairy in ``The
Nutty Nutcracker.'' Today, for his more significant contributions
to dance, Houston Ballet artistic director Ben Stevenson has been
named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.).
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace announced that the 63-year-old native of
Portsmouth, England, is included in Queen Elizabeth II's New Year's
Honors List. He will be invested next summer in a ceremony in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The honor bestows no title on Stevenson, but the letters O.B.E.
can be used following his name. Houston Ballet associate
choreographer Christopher Bruce was honored with an O.B.E. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson is regarded as a major creator of full-length story
ballets. His ``Cinderella'' is in the repertories of 20 companies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 25 years, he has built Houston Ballet from a
small, regional ensemble into one of the world's most successful
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having lived in America for the last 30 years, this honor was
very unexpected,'' Stevenson said. ``Many people I've admired have
gotten O.B.E.s, so it's nice to join the club.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Between 1997 and 1999, Texas has gone from 85th in the
nation in total defense to sixth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between 1997 and 1999, Louisiana State has gone from 9-3 and a
first-place tie in the Western Division of the Southeastern
Conference to back-to-back losing seasons that cost coach Gerry
DiNardo his job.
</P>
<P>
   These seemingly unrelated situations have one common denominator
_ defensive coordinator Carl Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Reese coached the defense in three consecutive bowl seasons at
LSU before joining coach Mack Brown at Texas and transforming the
Longhorns' defense from laughingstock to a unit respected and
feared by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Many LSU fans believe the beginning of the end for the Tigers
was the day Reese left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all that stuff, but I don't know if it's that
simple,'' Reese said. ``When things go bad somewhere, people are
always looking for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sad about how things turned out at LSU, but I'm
very fortunate to have ended up here before things got bad over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU was 26-9-1 from 1995-97 with Reese as the defensive
coordinator. The Tigers went 7-15 in the two seasons after he left.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is 18-7 in those two seasons with a vastly improved
defense that has helped the Longhorns reach the Cotton Bowl for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo hired Lou Tepper as Reese's replacement after Tepper was
fired as coach at Illinois. But the LSU defense struggled after
Reese's departure, causing some fans to revolt. A few fans formed a
group called Students Against Lou Tepper.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate responsibility lies with the head coach, and
DiNardo was fired at LSU last month when the Tigers were 2-8 with
one game to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry DiNardo is a good guy, but he bad-mouthed me pretty good
when I left there,'' Reese said. ``He basically said, `Good
riddance. We don't need him anyway.' I haven't talked to him since
then, but I understand what he was doing. He has to protect his
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese worked with DiNardo for four years at Vanderbilt before
joining him at LSU. Brown first noticed Reese at Vanderbilt, where
Reese made the Commodores' defense a strong unit without a lot of
blue-chip players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to go up against some very good teams,'' Brown said.
``But Carl did things at Vanderbilt that you wouldn't have thought
were possible against some of the SEC teams they had to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese continued that success at LSU, but he jumped at the chance
to join Brown at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Gerry for seven years, and that was long
enough,'' Reese said. ``We didn't have philosophical differences,
and he didn't tell me what plays t call during a game. But it was
the conversations we had during the week that could make things
difficult. He could wear you slick sometimes. He would want to sit
on your head. Gerry is pretty much a control freak, and he would be
the first one to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese has found a more comfortable situation working under
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack is the boss, and I run things within his guidelines, but
he lets you do your job,'' Reese said. ``If you produce for him,
he's a great guy to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese, 56, has produced at a higher level than anyone could have
imagined when he took the job at Texas two years ago. The Longhorns
allowed 399.2 yards and 33.3 points per game the year before Reese
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got thrashed playing that read stuff before coach Reese got
here,'' said free safety Greg Brown. ``We couldn't stop anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese had 14 freshmen and sophomores on the two-deep roster in
1998, and the defense improved somewhat, allowing 364.4 yards and
29.6 points per outing.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic improvement for the Longhorns came this season
as they have allowed only 286.7 yards per game. After allowing
241.5 yards rushing per game in 1997, UT has allowed just 105.7
yards rushing per game this year.

   ``Coach Reese coming here was huge for us,'' said defensive end
Aaron Humphrey. ``Our whole attitude changed when he got here. He
brought in a much more aggressive style of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he came, we were running a read-and-react defense and
trying to play off what the offense was doing. Now we penetrate the
line of scrimmage and go after people. I don't have to wait to make
a play. I can just pin my ears back and use my speed to get to
people. It's a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey said Reese makes it clear to each player what he
expects from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be tough, but he's not going to grab your facemask and
scream at you like some coaches do,'' Humphrey said. ``Coach Reese
will get your attention and let you know if you mess up and do
something wrong. Basically, if you can't execute the play, he will
find someone else who can.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he tells us is, `You need the ability to have
dependability.' If he can't depend on you, then you won't be out
there. You have to get it right or get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas players are getting it right most of the time while
playing for a defensive coach they respect in a system they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know if we execute what coach Reese has for us, we should
win the game,'' Humphrey said. ``It NO CARRIER

</P>
<P>
   KENWOOD, CA - Award-winning television producer and broadcasting
executive Ray Hubbard, who was committed to using TV for education
and social change, died Monday in Kenwood, Calif., at the age of
75. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for over 20 years and
had been active up until the last two years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   During his life, he had received almost every major broadcasting
award, including the Emmy, DuPont, George Foster Peabody, Freedom
Foundation, National Conference of Christians and Jews and Action
for Children's Television.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Marion, said her husband had a fascinating and
rewarding career, most importantly the work he did in education and
on documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``''He had a marvelous life. He loved every minute of it. He
said ``There's never a day I don't want to go to work,' &QL; t &QR; '' said
Marion Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly thrilled in 1994 to win his first national
Emmy for ``''Roman Wall,'' an hour-long film for PBS from the
children's books of David Macaulay. The film was produced by
Unicorn Projects Inc., a nonprofit educational programming company
he formed after his retirement to Kenwood in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``''He had won many awards for local productions. He loved the
fact that even in his old age he was able to win a national Emmy,''
his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree at
California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and then a
master's degree in theater and communications from Stanford
University. He taught art in Redwood City schools before entering
broadcasting as the art director in 1951 at Westinghouse Group W
and KPIX in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to WBZ in Boston in 1956 and produced ``''Shadow of a
City,'' the first TV documentary on inner city decay and the poor.
He moved back to KPIX in 1958 as program director.
</P>
<P>
   His documentary, ``''The Innocent Fair,'' on the 1915 Panama
Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, ended with a
nostalgic look at the crumbling Palace of Fine Arts and resulted in
support that saved the building that was to have been demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Educational shows included ``''Discovery,'' a look on
contemporary art with the San Francisco Museum of Art, ``''Black
Cultures,'' programs in cooperation with Morgan State University in
Baltimore and ``''Children's Spectaculars,'' a series of specials
featuring performers like Zero Mostel and Boris Karloff.
</P>
<P>
   He produced the award-winning ``''The Reading Show,'' which used
a silent serial to help children read what the actors said.
</P>
<P>
   He was at Post-Newsweek cable from 1969 to 1976 where in
Washington, D.C., he hired the first African American, Max
Robinson, and first woman, J.C. Hayward, to anchor a newscast.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bicentennial in 1976, he created ``''The American
Documents,'' a series on lesser known aspects of American culture,
such as women's suffrage and immigration and Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1994, he and his wife were able to travel
extensively, many times in the Baltic area in small boats. In 1996,
the couple went to Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 49 years, he is survived by three sons,
Bruce Hubbard and Stephen Hubbard, both of Pasadena and Gregory
Hubbard of Wells, Maine; and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A private memorial service will be in Washington, D.C, and a
memorial service in Kenwood will be announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is a war story with a happy ending, although
in a way it hasn't ended at all.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Sept. 9, 1944, when Tech. Sgt. Nathan Hoffman and an
Army buddy went to New York City for a little fun before shipping
overseas. Nathan Hoffman was in his late 20s, used to the quiet
ways of his hometown, Waco, Texas. He was awed by the crowds and
lights of the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Hoffman's buddy was from New York and introduced him to a
cousin, Evelyn Giniger. Evelyn had grown up in the Bronx and liked
to dance, as did Nathan. The two had a good time that first night,
and the next _ five nights of dancing near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I see you tomorrow?'' he asked after the fifth night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, an orchid was delivered to Evelyn's door. ``I'll be
seeing you,'' a note from Nathan said. The men of the 12th Armored
Division had been restricted to base just north of New York. Hours
later, they were on a troop ship headed for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In leaving, I have only one regret _ that I was unable to see
you just one last time,'' Nathan wrote Evelyn on Sept. 18, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote each other virtually every day for the 16 months he
was gone. They were getting to know each other, courting, actually.
The letters led to marriage, but Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman never
imagined that a half-century later the letters would become part of
Washington's celebration of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, they had their hundreds of letters
published in volumes for their son, two daughters and five
grandchildren. ``We were just trying to leave something behind,''
Mrs. Hoffman explained the other day in their Washington hotel
room, as the couple relaxed after the trip from their home in Waco.
She is 76. Her husband turned 85 on Dec. 22 but has the look and
energy of a man a decade younger.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Andrew Carroll, a Washington writer and historian,
heard about the letters. Carroll has been collecting and preserving
wartime correspondence in an effort he christened the Legacy
Project. He found the letters valuable not just for the sentiments
they expressed but because there were so many from Evelyn. Too
often, letters from the homefront were lost or discarded because
the soldiers and sailors had no place to keep them all.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg heard about the letters. Carroll sent copies to
the filmmaker, whose ``Saving Private Ryan'' has intensified
interest in World War II. Spielberg included the Hoffmans in his
short documentary ``The Unfinished Journey,'' to be shown on New
Year's Eve in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will be there, as will famous people from
Hollywood. The Hoffmans will be there, reading from their letters.
</P>
<P>
   The young Nathan had trouble putting his deepest feelings on
paper, at first. ``But the censors limited what we could write home
about,'' Hoffman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So, having to fill up the paper somehow, he turned to his
emotions. On Oct. 26, 1944, he wrote, ``Baby, I am not asking you
to make any promises with regard to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, of course. But he need not have worried. ``Every day, I
miss you a little bit more,'' Evelyn wrote on Dec. 27, 1944. She
knew that Nathan was a clerk-typist behind the lines, but she was
still afraid. ``The knowledge that you're getting closer to the
front makes me tremble every time I think of it,'' she wrote that
Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   There was reason to worry. Thermored Division had been
placed under Gen. George Patton's Third Army, which was in the
thick of fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, and lots of
clerk-typists were being given rifles and put into foxholes.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Hoffman remained a clerk-typist, but it was not easy
duty. A headquarters is a busy place in war, and he went 36 hours
without sleep. While he was not supposed to be in combat, the
German artillerymen didn't know that. ``Shells would land near the
building, every seven minutes,'' he said. ``The Germans were very
methodical.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Evelyn had dropped out of college. She wrote Nathan
about her work in a plant that made freezer components for the
military. On April 30, 1945, she asked Nathan if he was thinking of
her as much as she was thinking of him. ``I do love you more deeply
and differently every day,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, 1945, with the war in Europe all but over, Nathan
wrote of his visit to a concentration camp at Landsberg, Germany.
``We took a little side trip to see some of the atrocious work that
Hitler and his ilk have imposed on the world,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the impersonal words were part of an emotional shield.
The other day, he said that the rags and bones and smells of the
camp bother him more now than they did a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The letters of Nathan Hoffman and Evelyn Giniger did not end, as
so many others did, with a heartbreaking telegram from the War
Department. They ended when he came home to Waco in January 1946.
She had gone there to wait for him, and they were married a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Hoffman prospered in his family's wholesale-produce
business. Life has been wonderful to them, and Mrs. Hoffman agreed.
They acknowledged that they are a little old-fashioned, nostalgic
for a time when they were young and Americans pulled together for a
great cause, a time when people wrote letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who writes letters anymore?'' Mrs. Hoffman said.

 &HT;    Music, animators' magic mix for sequel to a Disney classic
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you think of dinosaurs every time you
hear Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring'' or you associate Tchaikovsky's
``Nutcracker Suite'' with dancing Chinese mushrooms, you are
probably in the target audience for ``Fantasia/2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years after Disney's original merger of classical music
and animation, now featuring the many advances of computer
generated imagery and the sensory overload of IMAX, the
``continuation'' movie that opens Saturday is the first noteworthy
film of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, it is a combination of high and pop art,
bits of serious music grafted onto such cartoon icons as Donald
Duck and Mickey Mouse, plus yarns by such scribes as Hans Christian
Andersen and an homage to pen-and-ink artist Al Hirschfeld.
``Fantasia/2000'' skirts dangerously close to kitsch, but
ultimately succeeds as a visual and aural treat as well as a great
deal of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute movie consists of seven new, independent segments,
plus a remastered, though antiquated version of ``The Sorceror's
Apprentice'' _ Mickey and the water-toting broomsticks _ from the
original ``Fantasia.'' The sequences vary in graphic style, tone,
degree of abstraction and, inevitably, quality. But there really
are no duds in the bunch and the best are truly awe-inspiring
animation that should appeal to all ages.
</P>
<P>
   It begins, after a superfluous explanation of the concept and
the first of several unnecessary celebrity host introductions, with
a free-form color-and-motion sequence set to Beethoven's ``Symphony
No. 5.'' Swarms of vibrant triangles dart about in time to the
music. If you take them to be butterflies, you'll probably get no
argument from the Disney gang.
</P>
<P>
   The film concludes with a stunning depiction of the brute power
of nature and the compensating restorative forces, all set to
Stravinsky's Firebird Suite. A volcano dramatically erupts and
spews destructive magma, a dark, violent scene that seems to
parallel the original movie's Night on Bald Mountain. Eventually,
however, a forest sprite with wondrous transformational skills
flits about and helps the land renew itself.
</P>
<P>
   In between is a grab-bag designed to satisfy all tastes. Of
particular note is a 1930s New York sequence, accompanied by
Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' and drawn with the line king
elegance of Hirschfeld. The sight-and-sound jazz piece follows four
aspiring souls, and includes numerous hidden Hirschfeld-esque
visual jokes. For those into New Age spirituality, there is
Respighi's ``Pines of Rome,'' turned into the eerie,
computer-generated sight of vast numbers of whales flying through
air. And those seeking the giddy glee of those ballet-dancing
ostriches from the original ``Fantasia'' will probably embrace the
brief playful view of flamingos with yo-yos, set to Saint-Saens'
``Carnival of the Animals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia'' is most effective when it is least literal, which
explains why a scene of Andersen's ``The Steadfast Tin Soldier,''
married to Shostakovich's ``Piano Concerto No. 2,'' and a Biblical
ark sequence with Donald Duck as Noah's apprentice are
comparatively flat. Still, if ``Fantasia'' wants us to think of
music in new ways, the ark scene does take Elgar's ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' away from its graduation march moorings.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the visuals of ``Fantasia/2000'' are on a par with
the best of Disney's popular ``classics'' of the past decade. And
if the movie sparks added interest in serious music or in animation
as art, those wouldn't be bad feats for the future.
</P>
<P>
   FANTASIA/2000
</P>
<P>
   3 -1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated G: No objectionable material
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Stunning animation sequences merge with stirring
classical music in a welcome new edition of the high brow-pop
culture experiment.

 &HT;    Rider suspended; might be just one game
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ A half-hour after he was suspended for
Thursday night's game against Detroit, Hawks guard Isaiah Rider
walked into the Palace, ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected this,'' he said. ``I hate that they can take
my money for this game ($60,000 or 1/90th of his $5.4 million
salary). I had every intention of playing tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspended last month when he missed a practice, Rider faces an
open-ended suspension, originally set for at least two games,
general manager Pete Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Rider agreed to participate in a players-only meeting
mandated by the GM, Babcock took a step back. ``We'll meet as a
staff on the flight home and make a decision about the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Rider might play Tuesday in Milwaukee provided he
participates fully in practices Sunday and Monday, Babcock said
that is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock clearly was disappointed that Rider did not arrive
sooner and that he made no effort to contact him following a long,
conciliatory phone call Wednesday night after Rider missed the team
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at 5:57 p.m. if Rider would be suspended, Babcock said,
``I'm hoping he arrives in the next three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider actually walked into the locker room as a players-only
meeting was about to start without him, Babcock, coach Lenny
Wilkens and his staff and the team trainers going out to the
corridor when Rider walked in. After a hurried conversation in
which he was told to meet with his teammates, Rider did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them what I thought,'' he said. ``I told them I never
questioned them as players. I never said they were losers. What I
said was I didn't like the laughing that went on the last four
minutes of (a 116-89 loss Wednesday to Indiana). I told them
winning matters. I hate to lose and I didn't appreciate three or
four of them on the bench having a good time while our second unit
was on the court.''
</P>

   Rider would not single out the teammates who offended him. ``I
don't want to make it personal,'' he said.

<P>
   Rider said he arrived five minutes after the departure time of 6
p.m. ``But the plane never leaves on time. They're always loading
food, fiddling with the steps. I was standing there and the plane
backed away. I think they knew I was there, but Pete was mad about
what he thought I said and I think he told them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said that was not the case. Having heard about Rider's
tirade, he said, the assumption was that he would not be coming.

DESPITE MILLIONS, FORBES CAMPAIGN LANGUISHES AS IT WAITS FOR A
BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa, S.C.)  (With FORBES-CAMPAIGN-BOX)

<TEXT>
<P>
   On late-night television last week, David Letterman and Tom
Brokaw were bantering about the presidential candidates. Letterman
was repeatedly ridiculing George W. Bush and jokes were flying over
the Al Gore-Bill Bradley debate over whether to debate every week.
Even John McCain took some hits over his temper.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere in this exchange was any mention made of another
presidential candidate, Republican Steve Forbes, even if in jest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending nearly $38 million of his own money in his
long-shot quest for the Republican nomination in 1996 and another
$16 million in this campaign, Forbes is in danger of becoming an
inconsequential candidate, someone who cannot even be the butt of a
joke on late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he doggedly crosses the primary states of New Hampshire,
Iowa and South Carolina in his ``New Birth of Freedom'' bus
cavalcade, Forbes has failed to generate strong poll numbers,
grass-roots enthusiasm or a national identity _ anything to
indicate the wealthy magazine publisher might have a chance of
reaching his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Languishing is the best term for his campaign,'' said Larry J.
Sabato, a political science professor at the University of
Virginia. ``The irony is that Forbes is a much better candidate
than he was four years ago and he has finally broken into the inner
circle of conservatives. And yet he has made very little progress
in this election and is worse off today than he was at this point
four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Forbes entered the Republican primaries late in
the game and, and after gaining a reputation as a spoiler for his
harsh attacks on Bob Dole and earning a small, but respectable
showing, he calculated that the 2000 election might just be his
moment. He figured that, with his $440 million fortune and a
broadened conservative message that incorporated social issues as
well as his signature call for an overhaul of the tax code, he
could appeal to the right wing of the Republican Party and position
himself an alternative to the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas. He saw himself as carrying on in the Reagan tradition as
Bush tried to steer the party to more centrist ground.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not turned out that way. ``I think his message is a
correct one,'' said Rich Galen, a former aide to Newt Gingrich and
now a conservative columnist. ``But it might be the wrong
messenger. Or it is the right message but for a different time. And
I don't see how Forbes' people can pull it out. He's got a lot of
smart people on his campaign staff and he is spending a ton of
money. But he needs some kind of a remarkable breakthrough, and
there's nothing to suggest that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with his enormous resources, his willingness to do battle
in every primary state and his record of harsh television
advertisements against fellow Republicans, Forbes remains a force
within his party, even if a negative one. And while he may not win,
he is able to inflict damage on other candidates: He is forcing
Bush to spend time and money in Iowa, a state where Bush would
sweep handily if not for Forbes, and Forbes has upped the ante on
campaign costs for all Republicans with his lavish spending.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Republicans remember Forbes' harsh attack
advertisements against Dole in Iowa four years ago that left Dole
victorious but wounded, and are fearful that Forbes might do it
again closer to the Jan. 24 Iowa caucus. So far, Forbes has
restrained himself, but Galen said that if Forbes fell too far
behind by mid-January, that might change. ``He might just turn his
mother's picture to the wall and go for it,'' Galen said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the latest polls show Forbes barely in
double-digit territory, far behind Bush and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. In Iowa, where Forbes came in second in a highly promoted
straw poll in August, with 20 percent of the vote, recent polls
show him with about the same amount of support.
</P>
<P>
   But given the unusual nature of that state's caucuses, polls are
not always reliable, and a candidate with a strong organization
like Forbes' can come up with a surprise. That said, Bush is also
well organized and, polls show, a lot more popular with Iowa
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the race is between Bush and McCain, with
Forbes not even breaking double-digits, despite much recent
campaigning there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Forbes staff remains optimistic. William Dal Col, the
campaign manager, predicts that if Bush and McCain start taking
shots at each other in New Hampshire, then the large number of
independent voters could become disgusted and switch to Forbes,
who, Dal Col predicted, could take up to 30 percent of the New
Hampshire vote. In Iowa, Dal Col predicts that the strong Forbes
organization will turn out enough voters on the caucus night to put
Forbes ``in a solid second place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all that does not happen? ``We just keep running,'' Dal Col
said. ``We are prepared to go through with this. It's a marathon
and we will continue to be in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what has hurt Forbes is the appearance on the Republican
primary scene of McCain, considered far too much of a maverick by
conservative Republicans. As a result, many conservatives have
flocked to Bush, who they find acceptable on their conservative
scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Bush is potentially electable and many
conservatives fear if they do not support Bush, then McCain might
overtake him. And after having backed many losing candidates _ Pat
Buchanan, Pat Robertson _ many Republican conservatives are now
trading ideological purity for viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of why Forbes is doing so poorly is the Bush juggernaut
and the other part is the McCain phenomenon,'' said Sabato of
University of Virginia. ``He's neither, while the juggernaut and
the phenomenon are filling the television screens. And social
conservatives are badly divided this time. They need a winner this
time because they are tired of losing. So they have signed onto
Bush out of desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Forbes' conservative economic message _ a call for
a flat tax, less government and the ouster of the Federal Reserve
chairman, Alan Greenspan _ is proving to be a tough sell in one of
the most robust economic cycles in this century. With the federal
budget balanced, interest rates falling, the stock market hitting
record highs and federal taxes having been lowered, it is hard for
Forbes to make much headway with his call for drastic economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in peace, prosperity and 4.2 percent unemployment,''
said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist and chief executive of
Policy Impact Communications, a Washington lobbying firm. ``The
worst harbinger for Forbes right now is not the polling data, but
the strength of the retail sales figures this Christmas.''

</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Forbes himself, a man who has never held public
office, who remains awkward in debates and whose campaigning
skills, while much improved, are still stiff. Despite this, Forbes
is on the road, almost nonstop. Not only is he campaigning in New
Hampshire and Iowa, but also in Alaska, California, Florida,
Arizona, Delaware and South Carolina, almost any state with a
primary. And his television advertisements and two-bus caravan of
blaring music and campaign workers in Forbes uniforms have become
fixtures in the early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually all his presentations, Forbes remains wedded to his
stump speech, rarely straying from his scripted words, even down to
the highly practiced laugh lines. He limits his contact with
reporters to tightly controlled 15-minute sessions, and seems to
hold his supporters at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, for instance, while campaigning one fall
morning at the Belmont Restaurant in Manchester, a place where
nearly every presidential candidate has gone to shake hands, Forbes
awkwardly went around the room to introduce himself while voters
munched on their toast and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he was finished, rather than sit down at one of the
large communal tables filled with voters and engage them in a
discussion, something nearly every politician has done, he quietly
sat down at a table to eat with his wife, Sabina, and two local
supporters, seemingly oblivious to everyone else in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain enjoys spending large amounts of time on the
campaign trail talking to reporters or while Bush hardly passes a
supporter without touching them and giving them a squeeze, Forbes
keeps himself closeted off on the campaign trail, riding on a
separate bus from the press and his supporters, except for the
occasional brief interview or formal press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential politics is almost as much about personality as
policy,'' said Gillespie, the Republican strategist. ``I think it
is difficult for voters to relate to Steve Forbes, partly because
of his moneyed background and also because of his style. His style
is not consistent with the American public's perception of the U.S.
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in debates, Forbes, who was the first candidate to come out
swinging against Bush, has since seen his role shrink as more air
time is given to McCain and Bush _ so much so that the Forbes
campaign has been complaining that moderators asked him fewer
questions by half than these two candidates in the last debate,
which was moderated by Brokaw in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps one of the biggest laugh-getters of the current
series of debates was a line about Forbes, not by him. In a Des
Moines debate two weeks ago, Forbes said of Democratic proposals,
``That usually means hold you wallet.'' A rival candidate, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, turned to Forbes and interjected: ``Steve, I
couldn't even lift your wallet.''

PUTIN ASSERTS NATIONAL PRIDE IS AT STAKE IN CHECHNYA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, standing in for
President Boris Yeltsin at a Kremlin ceremony, said Thursday night
that Russia's ``national pride'' was at stake in the war to retake
rebellious Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the Kremlin's favored candidate in the presidential race
next summer, said Russia was duty bound to crush the rebels after
their ``brazen and impudent'' invasion of a neighboring region in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said at a New Year's reception, ``not
everyone in Western nations understood this. But we will not
tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russians or any
threat to the integrity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian generals, in interviews published Thursday, said that
the war in Chechnya was intensifying in the regional capital of
Grozny and along mountain passes to the south, where rebels are dug
in, fighting what the Russians say are last-ditch battles in a
three-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen commanders conceded Thursday that they had lost ground
in Grozny and the mountains. But President Aslan Maskhadov warned
Moscow in an interview that it would not be able to conquer
Chechnya, ``even if the war goes on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why I remind the Kremlin that its action will lead it
nowhere,'' Maskhadov said in an interview with the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which began soon after Putin took office, is the main
reason for a surge in his popularity, and for the success of
pro-government parties in recent parliamentary elections. Putin's
invocation of patriotism Thursday fits the picture of a leader who
has been presented by pro-Kremlin media as a tough defender of
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, troubled by poor health, was inexplicably absent from
the reception. But spokesmen said that he would be at work Friday
and that he was proceeding with plans for a one-day visit to Israel
to attend millennium services in Bethlehem on the eve of the
Russian Orthodox Christmas, on Jan. 6. In his most recent statement
on the war, Yeltsin, who awarded medals to top commanders, said its
conduct was faultless, ignoring repeated appeals from Western
governments to halt the offensive and move toward a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has said it will not negotiate with Maskhadov until he
disavows the Chechen warlords who were responsible for an attack in
August on Dagestan and who have been faulted for a series of
terrorist bombs that killed more than 300 people in Russia in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov said Thursday that rebels remained in control in
Grozny, a city reduced to ruins by steady bombing, where tens of
thousands of civilians are stranded without heat, water or
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chechen official, Movladi Udugov, told a radio station
in Moscow that the Chechen units in Grozny had enough arms and
ammunition to turn around the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military spokesmen said their forces were making slow
but steady progress. One report said troops were within 2
kilometers, or 1.2 miles, from the center of Grozny. The military
also said ``fierce fighting'' was continuing in the mountainous
areas around Vedeno and Karachoi, where rebels, many united under
militant Muslim leaders, have made their bases.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of heavy combat near the Argun Gorge
near the Chechnya border with Georgia, an independent state that
has been acy Russia of allowing Chechen rebels on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper,
the commander of Russian forces in the northern Caucasus region,
Col. Gen. Victor Kazantsev, said Russia had succeeded in cutting
off Chechnya's borders, in particular with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is completely sealed off, and it is impossible to
penetrate Russian territory,'' said Kazantsev, who added that
federal forces had blocked repeated attempts by the rebels to break
through the encirclement.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Russian Air Force, Anatoly Kornukov, said
airstrikes were increasing in intensity, with 60 to 70 missions a
day. ``It is practically impossible to hide from airstrikes,'' he
said Thursday on a visit to a military hospital. ``The bandits
should not count on finding refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy head of an anti-terrorist unit in the Russian
domestic security services, Vladimir Kozlov, said the top Chechen
warlords, including Shamil Basayev, were in their traditional
southern mountain strongholds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, American banks and regulators have been bracing for
a year-end rush of withdrawals by depositors fearful that Year 2000
computer problems might cause teller machines to fail or credit
card transactions to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of extra money have been printed by the federal government
and shipped to banks here and abroad. Normally, about $150 billion
in cash sits in the Federal Reserve and American bank vaults
worldwide. But this year an extra $70 billion _ or about $255 for
each man, woman, and child in the United States _ has been printed,
dispatched by planes and armored cars and stored in vaults,
awaiting the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   And there it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's largest banks say they have not
experienced unusual demand for cash at their branches or automated
teller machines. On some days recently, these banks said, cash
demand has been lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to date, we have seen no increased demand for cash,'' said
Thomas Sladowski, vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan's
automated teller machine network. ``We're all hoping this will be
the biggest nonevent of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all that cash ultimately isn't needed, banks will return
it to the government, to be recirculated some day or shredded and
left in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The complacency about cash is just the latest sign that the
public is taking the prospect of Year 2000 computer disruptions in
stride. Of course, problems could yet occur as the new year arrives
that send depositors flocking to their local branches. Bankers and
regulators acknowledge this, noting that even in a world grown
accustomed to the pleasures of plastic credit cards, there is
nothing quite as reassuring as cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest variable in the equation remains public
perception,'' said Doug Tillett, a spokesman with the New York
Federal Reserve. ``We really don't know how people will react.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little to give consumers pause, although
flare-ups have occurred. On Tuesday, about 20,000 credit card
terminals in Britain began to stall because of computer glitches,
holding up holiday shoppers. An spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings, the
large British bank that operates most of the terminals, said that
they could not recognize the year 2000 but that the problem will be
resolved by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at least in the United States, bankers feel well
armed against Year 2000 headaches and are satisfied that they have
plenty of cash to dole out should people want it.
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting all that cash into the system has been a
challenge. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department directed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to begin
printing the extra billions. And banks were directed by regulators
to order more cash for their vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $220 billion in reserve cash is held in Federal
Reserve coffers around the country, awaiting orders from banks
should they need it. A smaller portion, about $72 billion, is
already in bank vaults, about $20 billion more than banks typically
keep on hand this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Few banks want to keep that extra cash around very long because
it is not money they can lend.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the all-clear is sounded, banks will quickly ship
that vast pool of extra cash back to the Federal Reserve _ setting
the vast conga line of planes and armored cars back in motion.
</P>
<P>
   its part, Chase has set up 27 special command centers to
monitor its banking network 24 hours a day between Dec. 31 and Jan.
11. The bank even boosted its paper supply in the event that a
flurry of receipts or bank statements needed to be printed, and it
has been funneling extra cash into its branches since October.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, which is based in New York, said it planned for increased
cash demand of 30 percent in October and November and an increase
of 200 percent in December, but that none of that demand has
materialized. Still, extra cash is in the branches, and that
presents security concerns for Chase, other banks and the armored
car companies that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and armored car companies say they have increased security
to protect this momentary cash hoard. ``The holiday season is
always tough, but with additional money out there we're putting
more security on the street and around our cars,'' said Kevin
Dunbar, chief operating officer of Dunbar Armored, an armored car
company that operates from 80 locations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Banks also have been simulating crises to prepare themselves for
a range of computer-related disasters, not just a run on cash.
Wells Fargo, the large San Francisco bank, has completed three
practice runs in which its personnel had to negotiate 25 potential
problems. The last one was completed a month ago and Wells Fargo
said it had ``developed a strong sense of confidence'' about its
ability to handle anything that arises as 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks already have had a taste of crisis management. In the
fall, Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., had to rush cash
to branches on the Atlantic coast so depositors could get their
money before evacuating in advance of a hurricane. That event
involved a rapid series of armored car trips to the coast and back
_ excellent preparation, a spokeswoman said, for any Y2K hysteria
that might surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oversight for Citigroup, one of the largest and most ubiquitous
financial institutions in the world, is a tad more complex. The
bank said it had seen no heightened cash withdrawals at its global
branches _ but it has to monitor activity in 100 countries. To do
that, Citigroup has set up a special central command center in an
undisclosed location in the United States. Information about the
bank's activities is fed to that center from 15 regional command
centers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most banks in the United States are just keeping
their fingers crossed. And counting on consumers to keep their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to make it clear to people that the safest place
for your money is in the bank,'' said Steve Dishart, a spokesman
for Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. ``People seem to be taking that at
face value.''

<P>
   CASH ON HAND: The campaign cash balance as of Sept. 30, 1999,
was $1.8 million. But since Forbes, with a net worth of over $400
million, is financing his own campaign, his cash resources are
pretty much what he wants them to be. Since 1996, he has spent more
than $53 million running for president.
</P>
<P>
   TOP CAMPAIGN STAFF: The political director is James Tobin, the
former northeast political director for the Republican National
Committee. The campaign manager is William Dal Col, who ran the
Forbes presidential campaign in 1996 and was chief of staff for
Jack Kemp's vice-presidential bid that year. The deputy campaign
manager is Ruth Kistler, former deputy executive director of the
National Republican Congressional Committee. The senior
communications director is Greg Mueller, communications director
for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   PROMINENT ADVISERS: Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defense for
President Ronald Reagan, on foreign policy, and Paul M. Weyrich,
head of the Free Congress Foundation, on social policy. His
economic advisers include Alvin Rabushka, a flat-tax theoretician
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University; Gary Robbins, a
former economist in the Reagan Treasury Department; Lawrence Kudlow
of Schroeder's Investments; L. Brent Bozell, an economic adviser at
the Media Research Council; and Stephen Moore, a taxation expert at
the Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   BIGGEST COUP: Endorsement by The Manchester Union Leader, New
Hampshire's largest newspaper, which calls him ``God-fearing,
respectful of innocent life, and determined to restore a sense of
decency to the White House.'' At the same time, however, the
editorial says Forbes ``looks like a geek.''
</P>
<P>
   BIGGEST MISTAKE: Still haunted by a 1996 decision to run
scorched-earth television advertisements against Bob Dole, which
hurt Dole among voters in general and tarred Forbes with the
reputation as a spoiler in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGE AHEAD: Turning all that money into votes.

`BEYOND THE PRAIRIE' LOOKS AT LIFE OF LAURA INGALLS WILDER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Sunday, Jan. 2. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To my surprise, I discovered that I have lived an interesting
life,'' Laura Ingalls Wilder (Meredith Monroe on camera, Tess
Harper in voice-over narration) declares, presumptuously, in
``Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder.'' In
the approximate vernacular of the movie: Whoa, there, little missy
_ let's not call a nag a stallion.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls Wilder, of course, is the author of the ``Little House
on the Prairie'' book series, beloved in particular by young girls.
Why the filmmakers thought her ideal audience shouldn't be privy to
her life story is a little bewildering. (There's a discreet
suggestion of lovemaking, and the late time slot isn't exactly
conducive to getting children to watch.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Prairie'' is something of a misnomer _ it's almost
exclusively concerned with the prairie, not the big woods, the Plum
Creek or the Silver Lake that Ingalls Wilder also essayed in her
books. It's a fairly conventional biography with a now-typical
theme of female self-empowerment (Laura refuses to say the word
``obey'' in her wedding vows). Her sister tells her, ``You're the
one who can make a mark.'' She endures with her family the long
winters of the Dakota Territory and a couple of house fires. She
spiritedly excels at school and becomes a teacher (there's
disarming comedy when she meets her boss's shrewish wife).
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, she meets a cute, rugged farmer boy (Walton
Goggins) with whom she survives crop failure and disease. It's all
handled in a desultory and discursive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps it watchable is Richard Thomas' performance as
Laura's pop, Charles. Thomas, currently consigned to hosting a
religious reality series on the Pax network, was apparently cast in
an effort to confuse dim viewers into thinking this is a project
with some sort of official endorsement from some earlier beloved
series. (In fact, he was on the (BEGIN ITAL)other(END ITAL)
wholesome period family show skewing to rural audiences in the
'70s.) Nonetheless, Thomas, in a full beard and far spryer than one
remembers him as John-Boy, assumes a colorful, blustery demeanor
and looks like he's having a grand old time.
</P>
<P>
   The same, alas, can't be said for the rest of the cast. Lindsay
Crouse is wasted as Laura's mother, a pinched woman with only one
dramatic scene of note. Monroe is far too contemporary-looking for
the role of Laura, sort of a cross between Calista Flockhart and
Cate Blanchett, and doesn't quite project Laura's frontier
assertiveness suggested in the script. When things go awry, she
gets sulky, as if the bouncer didn't let her into the Viper Room.
Goggins has great, teeming rows of distractingly, almost
impossibly, white teeth. You fear for poor Monroe when she nuzzles
with Goggins _ should he nibble on her neck, he'll almost certainly
leave phosphorescent burns.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for her but not for the romantics in the audience,
there's not much chemistry between them. ``Beyond the Prairie''
covers its territory with competence, but won't make anyone
nostalgic for Ingalls Wilder's happy, golden years. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls
Wilder.'' &QL;

Prairie'' book series. &QL;

Crouse. &QL;

A LONG FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA GETS LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIERRA MADRE, Calif. _ As fire criss-crossed the hills just
above their home in this Los Angeles suburb on Monday night, fire
officials gave Laurie and Tom Daly the option of leaving. Not only
did they stay, they went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another example of crazy Californians unwilling to accept
the reality of the world they live in? No. It was a difficult
decision, Ms. Daly said, and ultimately it came down to a simple
vote of confidence in the firefighters who would spend the night in
the cul-de-sac at the end of their driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came over the hill, I said to my husband, `Should we
really stay?' He said: `Yes. The firefighters are right out
there,''' Ms. Daly said on Wednesday as she unloaded belongings she
had stowed in her car just in case. ``They said, `We'll get you up
if you need to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   With national forests stretching for miles around Los Angeles,
the threat of fire is constant, particularly in the summer as the
ground becomes increasingly parched and the chaparral dry.
Firefighters are highly skilled at handling such situations and
have extensive plans in place, but this year is becoming
increasingly problematic.
</P>
<P>
   The fire season typically ends in mid-November, ``but this year
it's just continued on,'' said Greg Greenhoe, the forest fire
management officer for Angeles National Forest, which makes up
about a third of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half inch of rain has fallen in the Los Angeles area
since July _ about four inches is considered normal _ and rainfall
that generally comes in the winter months has not occurred. At the
same time, high winds like the Santa Anas that blow in off the
desert pick up during the winter, and can make fighting fires
extremely difficult and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest concern now is that New Year's Eve revelers
using fireworks could set off wildfires in the tinder-like brush
that covers the hillsides surrounding many communities that abut
land managed by the Forest Service, which is part of the Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fires are always a concern in the national forests, but we're
especially concerned now because many of our visitors may not
realize the danger they pose during dry winter months,'' the Forest
Service's fire chief, Mike Dietrich, said in a news release
reminding the public that fireworks are prohibited in national
forests.
</P>
<P>
   The reckless use of illegal fireworks isblamed for a fire
in the Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County that burned
some 4,300 acres and destroyed a house last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen national forests cover about 20 percent, or 20 million
acres, of California. The threat of fire is highest now in Southern
California, where it has been so dry.
</P>
<P>
   The fire danger in Southern California ranges from very high to
extreme, said Matt Mathes, a spokesman for the Forest Service. The
service is planning increased patrols this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rain in sight, said the service's forecasters, who
work with the National Weather Service. Winds are expected to be
light from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely on high alert,'' Mathes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials predict that this will be the second
worst fire season on record; more than 500,000 acres have burned
this year. The worst year on record was 1987, when 747,000 acres
burned.
</P>
<P>
   But there have not been many ``catastrophic'' fires this year.
Officials note that not all fires are bad and that the overall
impact will be assessed through environmental studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's ecosystem depends on fire to regenerate itself,''
said Mathes, who calls Southern California ``one of the two or
three most flammable places on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Because millions of people live in that ecosystem, firefighters
are faced with a major challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an intricate network of agencies is in place to
keep firefighters where they belong and out of people's back yards.
An operations center coordinates efforts of the Forest Service, the
California Department of Forestry, and various county and local
fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of the fire that started on Monday in the
Angeles National Forest above the Sierre Madre and Arcadia suburbs,
1,000 firefighters were trying to extinguish the blaze or were
stationed in neighborhoods to attack it if it spread.
</P>
<P>
   But that number of firefighters is small compared with what the
departments can muster. Mathes said 5,000 to 10,000 firefighters
could be called up within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, weather forecasters and fire behavior specialists
are dispatched to advise on how the fire should be fought.
</P>
<P>
   Still, firefighters cannot keep every home safe. That was clear
to residents at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of
Los Angeles, where about 500 residents were evacuated on Monday as
fire raced through the hills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In many respects, residents got lucky because the winds remained
low.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Winchell, who watched the fire from her front yard and
left voluntarily, said fire officials told her that if the winds
picked up and moved the fire down the mountain she would have about
five minutes to get out of its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to our door and said get ready to evacuate,'' she
said. ``We were going as fast as we could, dumping drawers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ms. Winchell returned to her house but had yet to
unpack her van as smoke continued to rise from an area just over a
nearby hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not fun,'' she said. ``It's very stressful. I'd much
rather have an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Winchell said she had no thoughts of leaving her
scenic neighborhood. She plans to organize her personal papers on
more portable computer disks and to insure the things she values
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you choose to live in California you learn to put up with
it,'' she said. ``But you have to plan ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even further than she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhoe, the Angeles National Forest fire management officer,
noted that once the rains began a new threat would develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize it, but more property will be
destroyed by flood than by fire,'' Greenhoe said. ``This fire in
Arcadia has some potential to damage homes from mudslides.''

<P>
   Business-to-business, the sale of goods and services to other
companies rather than to the public, has flourished for centuries.
But the Internet has lent the sector, known as B2B, a cachet that
has sent some of these companies' stocks soaring.
</P>
<P>
   So when Penton Media, the old-line publisher of IndustryWeek and
other B2B trade journals like Machine Design and Hydraulics &AMP;
Pneumatics, began operating popular Web sites and producing major
industry trade shows in the last year or so, it was bound to catch
the eyes of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an erratic stock price, it has attracted holders like
Gabelli Funds and Baron Capital. Now at $24.25 a share, the stock
is inexpensive, , many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Penton, based in Cleveland, is a product of corporate
restructurings. It was spun off to shareholders of the Pittway
Corp., a maker of alarms, in August 1998, starting trading at
$16.25 a share. In November 1998, Penton acquired Mecklermedia
Corp. of Westport, Conn., becoming a big force in the trade show
business and increasing its Internet presence. Mecklermedia
produced InternetWorld, a big trade show, and held a 27 percent
stake in Internet.com, an online company that brings together
vendors and buyers in technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Trade magazines, trade shows and the Internet have solid growth
prospects, analysts say, but they believe that the combination of
the three constitutes Penton's biggest asset. ``Magazines publicize
the trade shows and vice versa, and both drive eyeballs to the Web
sites,'' said Karl Choi, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   After a low of $18.25 on March 3, shares of Penton peaked at
$27.75 on April 16. Analysts attributed the slide that followed to
a secondary stock offering last May and modestly disappointing
second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   William Bird, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the
selloff offers a buying opportunity. He said Penton would ``have
ample opportunities to continue to complete acquisitions that are
accretive to earnings and cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts credit management, led by Thomas L. Kemp, the chief
executive, with steering Penton toward the highly profitable trade
show business. Choi estimated that 29 percent of the company's $324
million in revenues in 1999 would come from trade shows, versus
just 5 percent in 1997. And Kemp said in an interview that Penton
should post Internet revenues of $35 million by 2002, although it
plans to sell about half its Internet.com stake.
</P>
<P>
   Penton is relatively small, with a stock market value of just
$476 million, and only 54 percent of the shares trade publicly.
Analysts say the company will have to take on debt to make
acquisitions. But Bird pointed out that current cash flow is a
comforta times annual interest expense.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Greenberg, manager of the Baron Small Cap fund, whose
portfolio is 3 percent invested in Penton, called its
consumer-oriented Web site, Healthwell.com, geared to health
issues, ``hidden assets'' that should add to Penton's value.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg says the stock will trade at 12 times next year's
estimated cash flow, or $30 a share, within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Gamco Investors, a money management firm, owns 18 percent of
Penton's shares. Mario Gabelli, chief executive of Gamco, thinks
that Penton is an acquisition target.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, who has a 12-month price target of $25 on the stock, said
strong revenues from trade shows in the fourth quarter or
Internet-related acquisitions could light a fire under the shares.

 &HT;    We find out tonight: As sun sets on 20th century, Y2K
predictions face ultimate test
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This is true: George Washington _ yes, the Father
of Our Country George Washington _ told people he once had an
apocalyptic vision about how America would be in the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   During the dark days of the Revolutionary War, Old George
imagined he saw a beautiful woman in his office whom he at first
mistook for the Grim Reaper, but who instead gave him a glimpse of
the future. He saw dark clouds gathering over the country, and
frightening armies coming across the ocean to terrorize our shores.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadful fighting ensued, and then an angel came down and
sprinkled water over the troubles. Then there was peace _ after
which the woman in the general's office presumably went back to
wherever she came from.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so no armies arrived, and things didn't turn out that way _
which is one of the many blessings we can count during this
otherwise anxious and slightly angst-ridden New Year's Eve. The
Washington story, however, comes from a fun little book, just
published, called ``Uncle John's Indispensable Guide to the Year
2000.'' And the very existence of such a book containing such a
weird anecdote gets right to the heart of all the strangeness we've
endured over the last 12 months or so _ fears of technological
meltdown (these could be the very last words you ever read!);
worries about terrorism outbreaks (beware unknown mail from
Frankfurt!); debates over how to read the very calendars we've
relied upon to remind us that this is a special date (it's not the
millennium till next year!).
</P>
<P>
   There's been tons of coverage, mountains of hype _ enough,
perhaps, for us to remember that whether we're marking the proper
moment in time or not tonight, there's no time like the present to
look back for lessons from the past.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years ago, things were simpler and life was harsh. In
the year 1000, the Chinese were putting the finishing touches on
gunpowder, a fateful invention. The Vikings were finding their way
across the stormy Atlantic to the very shores on which George
Washington would someday have bad futuristic dreams. The Mayans
were building observatories in Mexico, a Japanese woman wrote the
world's first novel, Africans were making beautiful gold jewelry
and Polynesians were fanning across the Pacific in canoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where early Christians were always worried about the
end of the world, the years 999 and 1000 may have brought a lot of
fears _ depending upon whom you ask. Some historians say there was
mass hysteria and panic; others point out that without a
standardized calendar in place, let alone mechanized clocks, most
common folk wouldn't have had any real idea just when to get their
knickers in a pre-millennial twist. Provided they wore knickers
back then, that is.
</P>
<P>
   They did have reliable timepieces by the turn of the 20th
century, however, civilization having moved pretty well along in
the next 900 years.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, this debate we moderns have been having with
ourselves about when the millennium starts also happened in 1899. A
story in the Dayton Evening Herald on Dec. 30 of that year notes,
``It is of interest to learn that at the close of every century of
which we have records, there has been the same debate that goes on
to some extent now.'' They settled theirs differently, though.
According to old Dayton Daily News clippings, the advent of the
20th century was generally recognized to be Jan. 1, 1901 _ but
then, the significance of double 00's didn't matter as much if you
weren't worried about your computer going kablooey.
</P>
<P>
   What did they worry about, then? Well, the 1890s had been a rich
and expansive time for the United States, but at least one
editorial writer was wistful: ``Something indefinably sad attached
to the going of the century which has been marked with the greatest
events in the world's history'' _ sound familiar? _ ``and the
coming of the new, laden with such vast and promising
possibilities.'' Even the weather in Dayton seemed portentous: Dec.
31, 1900, had been gloomy and dark; Jan. 1 dawned pretty, crisp and
sunny. Around the city, there had been midnight masses, watch
meetings, dances and parties galore.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11:38 a single factory whistle started the music and from
ur until long after midnight the din continued with unabated
fury. Bells, chimes and whistles combined fantastically to make the
night one long to be remembered. While all the noise was in
progress in all sections of the city, many persons were kneeling in
prayer,'' the unnamed DDN writer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of the sadness encircling the passing of the century,
there should be great joy in the celebration of the advent of the
new. Dayton . . . is stepping into a new era which is certain to be
distinguished by a development incomparable with anything of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, if only he'd known. It would be a little less than two years
later that two of the city's sons would know they had changed the
world forever, and start to humbly spread the word.
``Incomparable'' was right.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what awaits us in the next 100 years, or the next
1,000 _ or even the next two or three? We do know that predictions
don't usually amount to much, fun though they may be. But it's nice
to wonder if the next century's world-changing ingenuity might once
again be in our midst as we all break out the bubbly this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Happy New Year.

IT'S NEVER JUST BLACK OR WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 2) 
Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His New York
Times column tilting at conventional business wisdom appears the
first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney(AT)nytimes.com.

<P>
   The ads are stark. Created by the American Civil Liberties Union
in its battle against racial profiling by police, they show a white
face and a black one, side by side, followed by a question: ``Which
man looks guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   To the insurance industry, the answer is both of them. While the
police practice of stopping minority motorists solely on account of
their race has rightly been condemned, some businesses conduct
their own forms of profiling with evident impunity. Among them is
the practice of charging young men higher premiums for automobile
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For years, men up to age 25 or even 30 have been guilty until
proven older. They are automatically hit with higher insurance
rates because, as a group, they have more accidents _ a rationale
that sounds suspiciously like the police practice, widely denied
and just as widely criticized, of stopping young black and Hispanic
men because, as a group, they are more likely to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As a former payer of high auto rates based not only on my age
but also on my unmarried status at the time, it always struck me as
strange that the insurance industry didn't go further. Isn't it
possible that left-handed drivers, in a world made for righties,
may be more accident-prone? Or that short people, perhaps less able
to see the road, may also be riskier risks? For that matter, do we
know for sure that different races and religious groups don't have
differing claims experiences?
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry maintains that it charges different
premiums for different people based only on strong evidence of
different loss levels. But insurance companies don't seem to be
trying very hard to find out, say, whether left-handed Zoroastrians
or short white people make good or bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no statistics that show that one race is likely to
have more accidents than the other,'' said Steven Goldstein, a
spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in
New York. ``That's something that has not been studied by the
insurance industry and I don't think it will be studied. People
would find such a study unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Goldstein noted, the insurance industry isn't the only one
that penalizes the young and presumably reckless. Just look at the
rental car industry, he suggested. Indeed, a spokeswoman for Hertz
said that, except in New York State, where such policies are
forbidden, her company and its major competitors turn away
customers of both sexes who are under 25.
</P>
<P>
   But the rental car companies at least act without regard to
whether a customer is a man or woman. How is it that the insurance
companies, like the police, are allowed to make judgments about
groups based on sex and age but not race?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that this kind of pricing is taken for
granted. And it may even be defended as appropriate _ auto insurers
and car rental companies have a plausible rationale for treating
young people differently, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But what possible justification, then, can there be for that
granddaddy of discriminatory pricing, the senior citizen discount?
These discounts amount to a tax on youth. They also are racially
discriminatory: as a group, white women live substantially longer
than black men, who are therefore less likely to get the discount.
</P>
<P>
   Though senior discounts are apparently sacred, other forms of
pricing bias are under attack. Several cities and states, for
example, have considered or adopted legislation aimed at preventing
dry cleaners and hairdressers from charging women more than men,
even though businesses in these fields say that women's blouses and
heads are more costly to work on.
</P>
<P>
   As for auto insurance, the industry shows no signs of charging
on the basis of height, hair color or especially ethnicity, but the
industry is getting more creative in rating the risks posed by its
customers. Some insurers, for example, have begun taking a driver's
credit rating into account when figuring premiums, because
statistically, people with bad credit have more accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In American life, race remains the great taboo, and gender
profiling will fly when racial profiling won't. Just ask the
American Civil Liberties Union. Its ads show the faces of two men,
after all, not women. Like the police, the ACLU assumes that if
somebody's guilty, it has' to be a he. (BOX) &QL;

CHINA'S ARREST OF HISTORIAN BASED IN U.S. STIRS PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk)

<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese scholar based in the United States who was
collecting historical documents from Mao's disastrous Cultural
Revolution has been arrested here and charged with ``illegal
provision of intelligence to foreigners,'' his wife and American
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the scholar, Yongyi Song, a researcher and
librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., has drawn protests
from American politicians, the State Department and scholars who
say he was pursuing legitimate academic research.
</P>
<P>
   Song has written a book and articles on the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, but is best known for his exhaustive bibliographic work
on the subject. He was in China this summer collecting old
newspapers of the radical Red Guards and other documentary sources
when he was detained in Beijing on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was formally charged under legal provisions that
could bring a sentence ranging from fines to more than 10 years in
prison, depending on how the court defines the severity of his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Song had passed all hurdles to becoming an American citizen and
was to have taken his oath last September.
</P>
<P>
   His case has been taken up by Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, who sharply questioned the charges at a news
conference Thursday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case appears to me to be very flimsy,'' Specter said in a
telephone interview. ``At a time when the Chinese government is
looking for legitimacy, trying to get into the World Trade
Organization and talking about improving its criminal judicial
system, this is a sharp about-face.''
</P>
<P>
   Song's wife, Helen Yao, a jewelry designer, was detained along
with her husband in Beijing, held for more than two months and then
released. In a telephone interview Thursday, Ms. Yao said that she
was hiring a Chinese defense lawyer for her husband but that she
had not been informed of a trial date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accused my husband of having secret documents, but he
pointed out to them that everything he collected had already been
published in newspapers, books or other open sources,'' Ms. Yao
said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what touched off Song's arrest is unclear. The Cultural
Revolution _ when radical forces unleashed by Mao led to the
persecution or deaths of millions and nearly destroyed the economy
_ remains one of China's most sensitive historical subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official verdict on that era is that it was a
tragic mistake, primary blame has been affixed on a small group of
leaders, notably Mao's wife and other members of the ``Gang of
Four,'' who were purged after Mao's death in 1976. Publications
discussing it are tightly controlled, while documents that might
shed embarrassing light on the role of Mao or other top leaders
remain top secret.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese and foreign scholars have gradually unearthed more
details of the events, and many have pursued sources and topics
similar to those of Song without trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome A. Cohen, an authority on Chinese law who is advising
Song's family, called the case ``an important one.'' He said that
it was encouraging that a security case appeared to be proceeding
under normal criminal procedures, but that it remained to be seen
if a defense lawyer can play a meaningful role.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions in cases relating to national security here are
virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Weissman, academic dean at Dickinson, said Thursday that
the charges against Song ``amount to an attempt to turn a respected
historian into a criminal simply for meeting his professional
responsibilities as a librarian, bibliographer and scholar.''

   To Be Michael Jordan's, Or, Perhaps, Not to Be ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had he envisioned the modern-day legal system, Shakespeare might
have thought twice before so cavalierly asking, ``What's in a
name?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Chicago's Silverberg brothers and Michael Jordan,
the basketball legend, are fighting over. As of early last week,
Michael Jordan's Restaurant on Chicago's La Salle Street, owned by
Gene and Joe Silverberg, is closed, but boy, does the memory linger
on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Jordan agreed to give the Silverbergs the sole right to
use his name on a Chicago restaurant. After a few good years,
business tailed off, and a lot of suing began.
</P>
<P>
   The Silverbergs have repeatedly accused Jordan of ``abandoning''
the restaurant by refusing to make frequent appearances, and of
unreasonably blocking a move to the Palmer House Hotel. Jordan's
lawyers counter that he was never obliged to visit, that he and his
family were harassed when they did, and that the Palmer House is in
a weaker location.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the dispute, Jordan is a partner in One Sixtyblue,
a more upscale eatery two miles away. Jordan's name and athletic
paraphernalia are nowhere to be seen there, but the Silverbergs
contend that One Sixtyblue infringes on their exclusive rights, and
said so in a court hearing Tuesday. The Jordan camp said the
Silverbergs had publicly denigrated Jordan in violation of their
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is having an easier time in New York, with a steak house
in Grand Central Terminal that he partly owns but rarely visits.
The Silverbergs have said they will reopen soon, using the name of
a new hero, Sammy Sosa.

<P>
   Gregory Maffei's resignation as chief financial officer of
Microsoft won't extricate him from a legal tangle that has put his
interests at odds with those of his sister, Anne.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is leaving Microsoft to become chief executive of
Worldwide Fiber, Maffei, 39, will remain as non-executive chairman
of Expedia, an electronic travel service that Microsoft spun off in
November. Ms. Maffei, 32, went to work last summer as an executive
with Priceline WebHouse Club, an online grocery-shopping service
affiliated with Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Anne has much to gain, and Greg to lose, if Priceline stops
Microsoft from letting consumers bid on goods.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Priceline sued Microsoft and Expedia, contending
patent infringement. Expedia said in its stock offering document
that a decision in Priceline's favor ``would seriously harm our
business'' and in December asked a federal court in Connecticut to
dismiss Priceline's suit.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, Priceline contended that Microsoft had spent a
year trying ``to learn as much about Priceline.com's business as it
possibly could.'' If so, why hire the sister of Expedia's chairman?
A Priceline spokesman said Ms. Maffei was not privy to matters
related to the suit; Maffei could not be reached for comment.

   Another Cover Curse at Time Inc.?
</P>
<P>
   If one bit of history is any guide, you might be wise to avoid
Amazon.com stock in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the curse of being named person of the year by Time
magazine, which for 1999 picked Jeffrey Bezos, founder of Amazon,
the money-losing Internet retailer that the market thinks is worth
$27 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Walter Chrysler was Time's man for 1928; the next
year, the whole market crashed, Chrysler by 78 percent. Undeterred,
Time chose Owen Young, chairman of General Electric, in 1929, for
his role in negotiating World War I debt settlements. GE stock
skidded 18 percent in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Harlow Curtice of General Motors saw his stock decline 4
percent in 1956, and Ted Turner's eponymous broadcasting company
lost 16 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Only one executive has ducked the curse, not unlike the one that
haunts athletes featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Intel
stock rose 69 percent in 1998, after Andrew Grove was featured.

 &HT;    Bush releases record-setting fund-raising totals
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush,
pursued by a rival building momentum on campaign finance reform,
took another stab Thursday at positioning himself as both the
candidate with the biggest bucks and Mr. Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced that he has raised $67 million this year, more
than twice as much as any other presidential candidate has raised.
He collected more than $10 million in the final three months of the
year. Bush also reported heavy spending _ $17 million for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has emerged as Bush's top GOP
competitor, raised $6.1 million in the quarter, pushing his total
for the year to $13.6 million, not counting $2 million transferred
from his Senate campaign fund and $6.2 million in federal matching
money he expects.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is not taking federal matching money, ends the year
with about $31 million in the bank. McCain, who has pulled ahead of
Bush in some New Hampshire polls, has about $1.5 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to touting the contributions from more than 171,000
people, Bush made clear Thursday that he wants voters to see him as
the candidate doing the most about the perceived evil of big money
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bush became the first presidential candidate
to post his donor list on his Web site (www.georgewbush.com) before
the Federal Election Commission quarterly reporting deadlines. On
Thursday, the Bush campaign retooled the site to get the donor
lists posted within a week (instead of the previous two-week lag).
The format was changed to a searchable database.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a new law for a candidate to post campaign
contributions on the Internet every day,'' Bush said, gigging
McCain's call for major overhaul of campaign finance laws. ``It
just takes a commitment to full public disclosure. One of the best
campaign finance reforms is to let the sun shine so that people can
see for themselves the amount and source of a candidate's campaign
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign took Bush's interest in campaign finance
reform as a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it interesting that campaign finance reform, which they
said was not much an issue, has become a dominant issue for them,''
said spokesman Howard Opinsky. ``Any time your campaign can set the
agenda for the campaign you know you have been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not joined Bush in posting donor lists as quic
feasible. Opinsky said the McCain campaign does not have sufficient
staff to put the lists on its Web site (www.mccain2000.com).
Instead, McCain posts on his web site his quarterly FEC reports, as
does GOP contender Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Democrat Al
Gore do not post contribution information on their Web sites.
Democrat Bill Bradley links from his web site to the FEC site.
``Senator McCain supports looking at disclosure issues as part of
campaign finance reform,'' Opinsky said. ``But until we get a
handle on the special interest and union money that floods in
through the soft-money loophole most of these other issues will be
moot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday he is ``humbled and honored'' by the money
that has poured in to his campaign. But the press release touting
the numbers was dedicated largely to Bush's efforts to counter
McCain's growing reputation as the nation's leading champion of
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has made the topic the cornerstone of his
campaign, calling for an end to unregulated, unlimited
``soft-money'' contributions that go to political parties and find
their way to presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Democratic candidate Bill Bradley have said they
would accept no soft money if they are their party's nominees. Bush
has not joined that pledge, though he favors a ban on such
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain agree on most campaign finance reform issues,
including a ban on soft-money contributions from corporations and
labor unions. Bush, however, has not joined McCain's call for an
end to soft money from individuals. Before Bush, the top
presidential fund-raiser was former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, who raised
$32 million for his campaign for the 1996 GOP nomination.

   Physicians fight new abortion law
</P>
<P>
   By Scott S. Greenberger
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A lawsuit that has blocked Texas _ at least
temporarily _ from broadening its licensing rules for abortion
providers is part of a wider effort to roll back state laws that
put a heavier regulatory burden on doctors who perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy,
which is paying for the Texas lawsuit, is supporting similar
efforts in Tennessee, South Carolina and Louisiana. Janet Crepps, a
lawyer for the group, said passing laws like the one in Texas has
``moved to the top of the anti-abortion agenda'' in recent years.
But supporters of such laws say the goal is to guarantee the safety
of women seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey on Wednesday ruled in favor of
five Texas physicians, two from Austin, who argued that the state's
new licensing requirements are unconstitutional. Under a 1985 state
law, health-care providers offering abortion services must get a
special license, except for hospitals and private doctors whose
practice is less than 50 percent abortion-related. This year,
lawmakers expanded the rules to cover any doctor who performs 300
or more abortions in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians who are covered by the new rules must be licensed by
Jan. 1. But Rainey ruled that the law violates the U.S.
Constitution's equal protection clause because it sets apart
doctors who perform abortions from those who perform other
outpatient surgeries. He also decided that provisions requiring
doctors to enhance the dignity and self-esteem of the women they
treat are unconstitutionally vague.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey rejected, however, the plaintiffs' claim that the law
deprives patients of their due process rights.
</P>
<P>
   The judge granted a temporary injunction, which puts the law on
hold. If Texas Attorney General John Cornyn appeals the ruling, a
trial is likely. A spokeswoman for Cornyn said Thursday that he
hasn't decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   All physicians in Texas must be licensed, and unlike in some
other states, they are the only ones allowed to perform abortions.
Facilities such as hospitals and health clinics also must be
licensed. Private doctors who perform outpatient procedures such as
plastic surgery and oral surgery don't need special licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, and abortion-rights activists, argue that the
new abortion-licensing rules are such a heavy burden that some
doctors will stop performing abortions, limiting women's access to
what the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is a constitutional right. To
get the license, doctors must pay a $2,500 annual fee and must
follow certain rules, such as training office personnel in
infection control. The doctors' offices are subject to surprise
state inspections, and their names, social security numbers and
other personal information are published in state records.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing of the information is particularly problematic,
opponents of the law say, because anti-abortion activists will be
able to use it to target abortion providers for protests _ or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are published as a licensed provider of abortions, which
with the crazies out there requires that you have some sort of
security in place,'' said Kae McLaughlin of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said many doctors will stop performing abortions to
avoid being picketed by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas lawsuit is worded broadly enough so that lawyers can
attack the state's 1985 law, not just the 1999 amendment, said
Crepps of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. But the
plaintiffs in the case weren't covered under the earlier law, so
the focus is on rolling back the new requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal here is to ensure that abortions remain accessible to
women in Texas, and we see the requirement that private physicians
be licensed as a threat to that,'' Crepps said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the new requirements say the issue is safety,
not access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern really is the safety of women. These laws are
designed to protect women from unlicensed, predatory doctors,''
said Joe Kral, legislative director for the Texas Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Steve Ogden, who co-sponsored the bill, said it
sparked little controversy in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking was, regardless of your philosophical position,
we need to make sure that abortion clinics are conducting their
business in a way that protects public health,'' said Ogden,
R-Bryan. ``It seems amazing to me that that would be
unconstitutional.''

   BELMONT, Mass. _ If a wealthy couple were putting up the
69,000-square-foot edifice of finest Sardinian granite now rising
on the highest point of this Boston suburb, they might face
complaints from neighbors. But not a constitutional lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is under way, however, because the builder is a
church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and when
neighbors tried to halt construction, they found themselves blocked
by a state law that gives religious organizations, along with
certain other institutions, immunity from many local zoning
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Oral arguments are scheduled to be heard on Monday before the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. No matter how the
court rules, a lawyer for neighborhood residents said, the case
will probably to be appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the Belmont neighborhood have argued that a huge
institutional building, brightly lit and with more than 200 parking
places, does not belong in an area otherwise zoned for
single-family houses. They said the law violated the Constitution's
separation of church and state by giving religious groups an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As Mark A. White, a lawyer for the neighbors, put it: ``If an
atheist group wanted to put up a cathedral-size building to extol
the virtues of atheism and have chanting sessions about the virtues
of atheism, they couldn't do it. So there's no way you can't say
this is a huge advantage for religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church, backed by a panoply of other religious groups
from Jews to Roman Catholics to Baptists to Christian Scientists,
has countered that such zoning protections were needed to prevent
discrimination by local boards against religions they did not like.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Harvey, a spokesman on legal affairs for the Mormon
Church, said the Massachusetts law and others like it around the
country have helped to keep institutions like churches and schools
in residential neighborhoods, and that has helped foster strong
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something George Washington fought for; this is
something Thomas Jefferson wrote about,'' Harvey said, ``These are
fundamental principles that go to the very fiber and meaning of
what this country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Two currents seem to collide in the Belmont dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon Church, which is expanding rapidly, is on a building
campaign, with 17 temples planned or under construction across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are about 100 temples worldwide, the church said.
They are used not as everyday churches _ the Mormons have about
16,000 of those, known as meeting houses _ but for special
ceremonies like baptisms and marriages. Only church members in good
standing are allowed in, and once inside, they change into white
clothing and go through ceremonies on behalf of themselves or their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, community groups have become more active and
have become increasingly concerned by special zoning treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be an increasing number of legal conflicts
between religious institutions and citizens who, for standard
land-use and quality-of-life reasons _ such as congestion, noise or
parking _ oppose the action the religious institution wants to
take,'' said Prof. Jerold S. Kayden, an urban planning expert at
Harvard University who is not involved in the Belmont dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case,'' Kayden said, ``the local community has been
deprived of a standard tool that it can wield for virtually any
other land use, and one has to ask why, why should religion get
this thumb on its side of the scale?''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's response: ``The state made a decision years ago that
some uses of property are so important they didn't want to give
local governments the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law, known as the Dover Amendment, says that
religious and educational institutions are not subject to the same
restrictions as other developments. So a church or synagogue, for
example, could be built in a single-family neighborhood, where a
supermarket or an office building could not.
</P>
<P>
   The law also gives such advantages to several other groups,
including day care centers, farms and homes for the elderly, which
shows, its defenders say, that it is not specifically pro-religion.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors opposing the building maintain that the law mainly
favors religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any significant evidence recently of
discrimination against Methodists or Presbyterians,'' said G.
Michael Pierce, a lawyer for the neighbors. ``And yet that's the
theory that runs through every amicus brief, that if this is struck
down, whole sections of every community are going to be made
inaccessible to major religions because of all the discrimination
against religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pierce said, ``People may attempt to regulate the
negative impact of massive construction in neighborhoods, but it's
not going to have anything to do with the fact that people are
against a certain religion. This turns the phrase `discrimination'
on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Bennett, bishop of the Belmont ward of the Mormon Church,
said some anti-Mormon sentiment had surfaced during the
neighborhood meetings about the temple, including some individuals
handing out pamphlets containing ``vitriolic anti-Mormon
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors also had expressed concern that Mormons would
flood the neighborhood, Bennett said, and he had explained that a
temple no more brings an influx of Mormons than a cathedral brings
an influx of Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he was convinced there was no prejudice among the
residents, and ``I think the feeling would be equally strong if
this were a school or elderly housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which had owned the hilltop land for several years,
has tried to appease neighbors, Bennett said. It reduced the
building's size to 69,000 square feet from 94,000 square feet, cut
the number of spires to one from six and put a third of the
building underground.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for some neighbors, it has become a matter of
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I owned this land, I couldn't build an Elks' Lodge or a
Veterans of Foreign Wars hall because places of assembly are not
allowed in residential neighborhoods,'' said Charles Counselman, a
neighborhood resident and a professor of planetary science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``But just because the
temple was a religious institution, it was allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning battle here is similar to a fight in Harrison, N.Y.,
where a proposed temple has sparked neighborhood opposition.
</P>
<P>
   As the Belmont suit has made its way through the courts,
construction on the $26 million temple, meant to serve the 41,000
Mormons of New England, has continued. It is more than two-thirds
done and is expected to open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like a gamble to build with a lawsuit pending, but
the church decided not to delay. White admitted that even if the
neighbors win, ``Do I thinkurt will make them tear the
temple down? Doubtful.''

MEXICAN INDIANS LOSE ANOTHER CHURCH ALLY AS BISHOP IS MOVED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Over the years, the Vatican has made no secret of
its displeasure with the outspoken socialist theology of Bishop
Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who has presided for four decades in a
turbulent, predominantly Indian diocese in the state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   So no one was surprised when the Holy See made it clear, as Ruiz
reached the official retirement age of 75 on Nov. 3, that he would
get no special extensions and should be ready to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the Vatican dealt Ruiz and his many followers a
blow they did not expect. In a communique, it announced the
transfer of Bishop Raul Vera Lopez, who Ruiz hoped would succeed
him in Chiapas, to another state.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is sending Vera to head the largest diocese in the
country, based in Saltillo in the northern desert state of
Coahuila, with a population of 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good pastor and deserved the reward of a more serene
diocese,'' said Archbishop Justo Mullor, the Vatican representative
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Vera, 54, has shared the Chiapas diocese with Ruiz since 1995.
When Vera arrived, many of Ruiz's followers feared he was a
watchdog sent by Pope John Paul II to restrain their leader's
ardent advocacy of the rights of Indian parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   But after only a few months of witnessing the unabashed
discrimination against the Indians in Chiapas and the heavy
presence of government troops in their villages, Vera began to
sound very much like his firebrand colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Vera came around to Ruiz's view that the government was
responsible for fomenting chronic violence by waging what they have
both called a ``low intensity war'' to extinguish the Zapatista
rebel movement, made up mainly of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Thursday in Chiapas, Ruiz acknowledged that
he was upset but accepted the Vatican's bidding and urged his
followers not to view it as political.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subservient are never wrong when they obey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See moved swiftly to contain the shock from its
decision. In the communique, it said that its reasons were ``purely
ecclesiastical'' and that Vera's transfer ``in no way diminishes
the church's commitment'' to Indian rights and peace negotiations
with the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Mullor held a news conference in Mexico City to explain the
pope's position, which was quickly seconded by the Mexican Bishops
Conference. Vera was flying to Rome on Thursday morning, Mullor
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas, some followers of Ruiz said they were tempted to
feel abandoned but pledged to respect the authority of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Vera came face to face with violence in Chiapas. He was shot at
several times, narrowly escaping without harm from a mountainside
ambush by pro-government enemies of Ruiz in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997, his diocese was told by frantic Indian
parishioners of a massacre under way in a remote hamlet. Chiapas
authorities ignored the diocese's pleas for help. In all, 49
Indians were killed.

   Letter from prison: A night of drinking, a life of regret
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Andrew Papke, the writer of this open letter, will be in
prison until 2036. His letter first appeared in The Austin
American-Statesman, Austin, Texas. Moving to (a) General news and
(l) Lifestyle categories.)
</P>
<P>
   By Andrew G. Papke
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TO COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   I was a pretty wild 19-year-old, having fun, partying, cruising
around town, drinking beer and just hanging out. I knew better, but
everyone was doing it, right?
</P>
<P>
   It was June 29, 1996. I had drunk a lot of beer, even for me.
And I had been hanging out most of the afternoon with people I
considered friends. It was relatively early, 10:15 p.m. or so.
Going home so early would be very unusual, but I wanted to be at
home with my fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Under a blue moon, the black 1991 Acura Integra I was driving
made its way down a stretch of rural two-lane road. At 10:40 p.m.,
the Acura struck another car head-on. The teen-aged couple in that
car were on their way home from a date. There was no chance for
survival. Their lives abruptly ended.
</P>
<P>
   The collision happened in less than a second. I vividly remember
a loud ``pop'' that pierced my eardrums. The white shadow of the
air bag seemed surreal and smeared with redness. I later learned
the car did not have an air bag and I believe an angel saved my
life. I remember the gurgling screams of my friend in the front
seat next to me. My first response was to get to him and keep him
calm. But when I tried, I couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a fear and strength I've never known, I broke the dash
and steering column and managed to free my legs from under the
firewall. I smashed and kicked my door just enough to squeeze out.
My passenger was pinned in his seat with his legs wedged between
the floorboard and the crushed engine compartment. I couldn't see
his lower half and blood was coming from his ears, mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
   I became angry and cursed at the people in the other car. I
blamed them and did not want to believe this could be happening to
me. Dazed and in shock, reality came crashing in.
</P>
<P>
   I was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the car were not moving. The stillness was eerie,
and at the sight of the other car lying crippled on its side, I
felt faint. As I went nearer, I saw the driver slumped over the
dashboard. I passed out. I remember the searchlight of the
emergency helicopter as it made its descent. My passenger and I
were airlifted to Brackenridge Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The other car was a Volkswagen that belonged to a guy who was
about my age, and whom I had recently met. We worked as pizza
delivery drivers for the same company, but at different locations.
His car looked like a twisted mangle of metal and rubber. The body
of the Acura, which belonged to my fiancee, had completely buckled
upward mid-frame, with very little room to support life.
Investigators later said that, given the speed and weight of both
cars, the impact equaled one car hitting a barrier at just under
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, doctors told me md was injured, but
would survive. I had six broken ribs, a slight concussion, a
puncture in the palm of my left hand the size of a quarter and
suspected spinal injuries (later found to be compressed fractures
in two vertebrae). I also had a cracked tibia, several sprains and
abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   This was nothing compared to the post-traumatic stress and
emotional strain many people would suffer for a long time. The
ripple effect of my actions will haunt me the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours in the ``crash'' room at the trauma center,
covered in glass, blood and other body fluids, I was handcuffed and
wheel-chaired into the custody of the Texas Department of Public
Safety and booked on charges of intoxication manslaughter and
intoxication assault. I was reeling in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The next day my bail was set at $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In jail, the haze of drinking began to lift. I was transferred
to Travis County Correctional Complex, where I was observed and
admitted into an open-psych ward.
</P>
<P>
   A new day
</P>
<P>
   Until that day, I had not considered anyone but myself in life.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, I began to drink and go to parties. I quit going
to church. Alcohol became somewhat of an addiction for me. I liked
to be drunk. It seemed to make it easier for me to talk to people
and make friends. But I was into a downward spiral, making poor
judgments with no regard for others' welfare and success, or my
own.
</P>
<P>
   I was on the brink of self-destruction. In an instant, I had
managed to suck four families into a nightmare and rip them apart.
I wished I had died as well.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmares and severe depression that followed were an
emotional roller coaster. How could I have been so stupid _ after
all the videos, assemblies, commercials and warnings? I spent a lot
of time thinking and crying in my cell.
</P>
<P>
   Then it dawned on me. For some reason, I had lived.
</P>
<P>
   I started attending Alcoholics Anonymous. I knew I never wanted
to drink again, and to do that I would need help. Through AA, I
learned that no human power by itself could have helped me. I
needed a complete change of thinking and heart.
</P>
<P>
   I met a volunteer who guided me through all of my questions and
skepticism. Nothing was left to do but sit, listen and begin to
learn about new rules for living. It's hard to see why, but I know
that it is by God's will only that I live. I have come so close to
the edge of life. I have another chance to do good and help others.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, 1997, I pleaded guilty to two counts of
intoxication manslaughter. I was sentenced to 20 years on each
count. The intoxication assault charge was dropped. I have the
maximum sentence possible. My mandatory release date is Dec. 16,
2036.
</P>
<P>
   I am a little older now, 22. I know the lonely hollowness of
being without close family. There's not much happiness now.
</P>
<P>
   However hard times may be, I still try to make each day count by
talking to others. I think the only resolution is to share my
experience and try to help people, like you, to stop making foolish
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   I often think of ``what ifs'' and wish I had stayed home that
day. I never meant to hurt anyone. I know that my words probably
will not help the victims' families and friends, but I truly am so
very sorry. And to write that down severely minimizes, even
insults, the depth of this tragedy. I know I can't trade places
with them, though I wish I could. And I know I can't bring them
back no matter how hard I pray. I will never be able to restore
their places in the hearts of their loved ones. I have the guilt
and knowledge of those families' grief resting on my soul.
</P>
<P>
   As I sit here in my cell, I wonder if you are listening enough
to think about this the next time you drink. Ask yourself. ``Is it
worth it?'' ``Do I want to wake up tomorrow a murderer?'' ``Do I
want to wake up tomorrow at all?'' If you do cause a tragedy like
this, you will be lucky if it only kills you.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor and listen. If not, well, from all of us
here in Huntsville, we'll leave the light on for ya'.

<P>
   There is, after all, a market for those Year 2000 bears and
millennium sweatshirts languishing on store shelves. At least two
international corporate barter companies, which swap surplus goods
and services among a large roster of clients, see profits in
millennial castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our opinion that some of these items will become
collectibles,'' said Bill Levitz, a managing director of Argent
Trading in New York. Argent, he said, may hold onto any promising
stock up to 13 months, hoping that it will accrue value.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby competitor, Atwood Richards Inc., isn't confining
itself to millennial trinkets. The company is also buying older
computers and medical monitors that might not be Year 2000
compliant, said Moreton Binn, the chief executive. Atwood upgrades
the machines and sells them to Eastern European countries that
aren't too picky, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond speculation, why do people want millennial surplus?
``It's like, what do you do with the Easter Bunny after Easter?''
Binn said. ``You move it to places where people don't give a hoot
about bunnies _ all they care about is chocolate.''

ALGERIAN ARRESTED AND CHARGED AS ACCOMPLICE IN BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>

TERROR-ALGERIANS) 
(sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Storming a shabby Brooklyn apartment block at dawn on
Thursday, an anti-terrorist task force seized a man they charged
was an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian caught trying to
smuggle powerful explosives and four sophisticated timing devices
across the border near Seattle two and a half weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man arrested on Thursday, identified as Abdel Ghani, a
31-year-old Algerian, traveled to Seattle earlier this month to
meet with Ressam as part of an elaborate Islamic terrorist bomb
plot, torities said. But the plan was foiled when Ressam,
nervous, suddenly bolted off a ferry at the border when a Customs
agent looked in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani's arrest came on a day when agents from the FBI fanned out
to question, and in some cases detain, Algerian immigrants in
several cities. In Vermont, federal prosecutors linked a Canadian
woman arrested while crossing the border with another Algerian man
to Ressam. What the Algerian man and the Canadian woman, Lucia
Garafolo, had in common, prosecutors said in successfully arguing
she be kept in federal detention, was friendship with Said Atmani,
identified in court papers as a member of the Armed Islamic Group,
`'a violent Algerian terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents acknowledged privately that they hoped the sweep
would serve as a warning or a deterrent to potential terrorists. In
Boston, federal officials arrested five men, one of whom fled from
his workplace, prompting a chase with guns drawn, but they were
charged only with immigration violations, not anything related to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani was charged with helping Ressam's efforts to bring
explosives into the country. But at a news conference on Thursday
night after the charges where announced, Lewis D. Schiliro,
assistant director of the FBI in charge of the New York office,
said, ``We are aware of no specific and credible threats to any
targets in New York City or elsewhere, and that no explosives or
explosive devices were found in connection with the arrest and
investigation of Abdel Ghani.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, federal law enforcement officials said they had
concluded that the Ghani and Ressam were part of a broad plot. They
speculated that because Ressam was caught in mid-December, he could
have been contemplating an attack close to New Year's, but
acknowledged that they had no evidence indicating that such an
attack had been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday's arrest did not mean the ring was
broken up. `'The most interesting thing is there are more,'' one
official involved in the investigation said. `'We know there are
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The question left unanswered was why the Algerian Islamic Group
would plan a strike in the United States. The criminal complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Thursday said that
based on information from a confidential source, federal agents had
concluded that Ghani and another associate believed that ``Allah
will shake up this world, that a new generation will punish
America, and that Islam's renaissance will rise from Algeria.''.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint was based on an affidavit submitted by
Bradley S. Morrison, an FBI agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist
Task Force of the FBI and the New York Police Department. In it,
Morrison states that because this affidavit was only intended ``for
the limited purpose'' of establishing probable cause to arrest.
Ghani, ``it does not include all the facts that have been learned
during the course of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint did offer a broadbrush image of the plot,
although much of it cites a confidential source. The plan was
carefully compartmentalized, according to the criminal complaint,
so that in case of an arrest, each person involved would only know
the tasks of two others. Ressam, was to leave the car, with its
cargo of bomb-making material and the keys, in a parking lot where
someone else would drive it away. Then he and Ghani were to go to
Chicago and other places on a `'fund-raising'' mission, the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam is believed to be part of a gangster-terrorist underworld
that committed a series of armed robberies and shoot-outs with the
police in northern France and later set up a Canadian base in
Montreal, according to French anti-terrorism investigators. The
French authorities say the organization grew out of the Armed
Islamic Group, part of a bloody insurgency in Algeria and of Arabs
who fought on the Muslim side during the war in Bosnia.

BURGER KING NAMED IN LAWSUIT OVER POKEMON TOYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (editors: accent over ``e'' in Pokemon) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Burger King, under fire from the federal government for
failing to recall a potentially hazardous Pokemon toy distributed
with its children's meals, was named in a nationwide class-action
lawsuit Wednesday filed by a Dallas woman who bought several of the
meals for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Winder filed the suit in Dallas County Court-at-Law
after hearing news reports that Burger King had refused to recall
the toys until the death of a 13-month-old Sonoma, Calif., girl was
suffocated by a piece of the Pokemon toy covering her mouth and
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Winder could not be reached for comment, but her attorney, Jeff
Rasansky, said she contacted him after a partial recall was made
Monday and ``asked what we could do about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided this was the proper course,'' Rasansky said of the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit did not specify damages, and Rasansky said a dollar
amount will be determined after more information is obtained
through the discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   After the California child suffocated on Dec. 11, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission asked Burger King, based in
Miami, to recall the toys or to stop distributing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused on both counts,'' commission spokesman Russ Rader
told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Kansas man reported that he found his 18-month-old
daughter with half a Pokemon ball covering her mouth and nose. He
removed the object before she was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King announced a partial recall Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious that those toys pose a significant risk to
young children,'' Rasansky said. ``I think it is appalling that
Burger King has used this promotion to market and sell millions of
dollars worth of dangerous toys to children.''
</P>
<P>
   His client, he said, purchased several of the children's meals
solely for the Pokemon toys, and was outraged when she learned that
were potentially deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials could not be reached for comment Thursday.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Graham, co-author of ``Security Analysis,'' the 1934
bible of value investing, long ago put his finger on the most
dangerous words in an investor's vocabulary: ``This time is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricing in the stock market today suggests that things really
are different. Growth stocks, especially those associated with the
information revolution, have soared to dizzying heights while the
stocks of companies associated with the older economy have tended
to languish. Well over half the stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq are selling at lower prices today than they did
on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual today for new Internet issues to begin trading
at substantial multiples of their offering prices. And after the
initial public offerings, day traders rapidly exchange Internet
shares as if they were Pokemon cards for adults.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter the new millennium, how can we account for the
unusual structure of stock prices? Does history provide any clues
to sensible strategies for today's investors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we are living through an information revolution that
is at least as important as the Industrial Revolution of the late
19th century. And much of the current performance in the stock
market can be traced to the optimism associated with ``new
economy'' companies _ those that stand to benefit most from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The information revolution will profoundly change the way we
learn, shop and communicate. But the rules of valuation have not
changed. Stocks are only worth the present value of the cash flows
they are able to generate for the benefit of their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   It is well to remember that investments in transforming
technologies have not always rewarded investors. Electric power
companies, railroads, airlines and television and radio
manufacturers transformed our country, but most of the early
investors lost their shirts. Similarly, many early automakers ended
up as road kill, even if the future of that industry was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway and a
disciple of Graham, has sensibly pointed out that the key to
investing is not how much an industry will change society, but
rather the nature of a company's competitive advantage, ``and above
all the durability of that advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Internet must rely for its success on razor-thin
margins, and it will continue to be characterized by ease of entry.
A drug company can develop a new medication and be given a 17-year
patent that can be exploited to produce above-average profits.
</P>
<P>
   No such sustainable advantage will adhere to the dot-cverse of companies. Moreover, the ``old economy'' companies may
not be nearly as geriatric as is commonly supposed. We still need
trucks to transport the goods of e-commerce, as well as steel to
build the trucks, gasoline to make them run and warehouses to store
the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Precedents of recent decades offer many valuable lessons to
today's investors. Consider the ``tronics boom'' of 1960-61, a
so-called new era in which the stocks of electronics companies
making products like transistors and optical scanners soared.
</P>
<P>
   It was called the tronics boom because stock offerings often
included some garbled version of the word ``electronics'' in their
titles, just as ``dot-com'' adorns the names of today's favorites.
More new issues were offered than at any previous time in history.
But the tronics boom came down to earth in 1962, and many of the
stocks quickly lost 90 percent of their value.
</P>
<P>
   Another parallel to today's market was seen in the 1970s, when
just 50 large-capitalization growth stocks, known as the Nifty 50,
drew almost all the attention of individual and institutional
investors. They were called ``one decision'' stocks because the
only decision necessary was whether to buy; like family heirlooms,
they were never to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of that decade, price-to-earnings multiples of
Nifty 50 stocks like IBM, Polaroid and Hewlett-Packard rose to 65
or more while the overall market's multiple was 17. The Nifty 50
craze ended like all others; investors eventually made a second
decision _ to sell _ and some premier growth stocks fell from favor
for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology boom of the early 1980s was an almost perfect
replica of the microelectronics boom of the 1960s. Hungry investors
gobbled up new issues to get into the industry on the ground floor.
P/E ratios gave way to price-to-sales ratios, then to ratios of
potential sales for products that were only a glint in some
scientist's eye. Stock prices surged.
</P>
<P>
   Again, as sanity returned to the market and more realistic
estimates of potential profits were made, many biotechnology
companies lost almost all of their value by the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons here are clear. Occasionally, groups of stocks
associated with new technologies get caught in a speculative
bubble, and it appears that the sky is the limit. But in each case,
the laws of financial gravity prevail and market prices eventually
correct. The same is likely to be true of the dazzling stocks in
today's market.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Internet darlings will ever justify their current
valuations, and many investors will find their expectations
unfulfilled. Even supposedly conservative index-fund investors may
be surprised to know that very significant shares of their
portfolios are invested in information technology companies whose
P/E and price-to-sales ratios vastly exceed even the sky-high
multiples reached during those past periods of market speculation.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, investors might well start the year by
examining their portfolios, to see if their asset allocations are
appropriate for their stage in life and their tolerance for risk.

LIFE IN A FASTER LANE: PRIVATE ROADS TO RICHES ARE PAVED WITH
TOLLS 
</HEADLINE>

(ART ADV: Photo NYT37 was sent Dec. 29 to NYT photo clients.

or 888-346-9867.)

 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Everybody knows that France exports wine, cheese and
fashion. But toll booths?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few private toll road companies are successful, but if
the customer is pleased, he'll pay gladly,'' said Alain Estiot,
vice president for international activities at Cofiroute, the
biggest French private highway operator. He is also deputy managing
director of an experiment in Orange County, Calif., to privately
finance road construction by building pay lanes down the median of
a freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The project, for which Cofiroute provided technological
knowledge and $135 million in financing, lets motorists pass from
the toll-free lanes to the pay lanes with the help of an automated
toll-collection plan much like E-ZPass, a system that is
increasingly popular in the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a further innovation, Cofiroute introduced different rates
according to the time of day and day of the week, a system now
being studied by other toll-road operators, including the New
Jersey Turnpike Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The highway _ built on the Riverside Freeway, or State Route 91,
on a stretch known for gridlock _ is called 91 Express Lanes. It is
the first in the country to compete with an adjacent free public
road, and Cofiroute is so far the only European concern with such a
private-road investment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenues from toll receipts on the highway are
expected to be $20 million for 1999, the fourth year of the
system's operation, up from $6.5 million two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That is a drop in the bucket of the company's total annual
revenue of about $750 million. But the project is a sign of
restlessness in the age-old business of building and operating
highways, as governments run out of money for such enterprises and
private companies take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Cofiroute, for instance, is now building 10 miles of
double-decker tunnel to close a gap in the western part of the
beltway around Paris. It is also building French parts of a key
east-west route across Europe and of a north-south highway that
will let travelers from, say, Britain or the Netherlands reach the
French Riviera or Spain more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The California project also illustrates how companies that build
and sometimes operate roads are casting about for new sources of
revenue and new ways to enhance traditional sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the trend is spawning investment opportunities, as
private and government-owned highway operators begin to sell shares
on the stock market. Cofiroute is wholly owned by several French
banks and construction concerns, but other companies, like Brisa
Auto-Estradas de Portugal SA and Autopistas del Mar Nostrum SA of
Spain, have been taken public in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In December, in the biggest such offering yet, Italy sold off
virtually all the shares in its national highway management
company, Autostrade SpA, for almost $7 billion. (The remainder,
less than 5 percent, will go to management in the form of bonuses.)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there have been no similar privatizations,
but interest in private road financing is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Schuster, executive director of the International Bridge,
Tunnel and Turnpike Association, an industry group based in
Washington, said there was a ``recognition that there is not enough
money'' for governments to finance road upkeep and new
construction. With private companies willing to play a role, he
said, governments are increasingly asking, ``Why not let the
private sector become involved?''
</P>
<P>
   Cofiroute's entry into the United States road market came after
California enacted legislation in 1989 authorizing pilot projects
in which private companies could demonstrate their ability to
finance and operate highways.
</P>
<P>
   Cofiroute's partners in in the venture, called the California
Private Transportation Co., are Level 3 Communications, a former
subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons, and Granite Construction. The
partners were stymied last month in their efforts to reap a $90
million profit by selling the toll road to a nonprofit company.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of other projects, industry experts say, is a result
of many factors, including government delays in studying pilot
projects and enacting enabling legislation, as well as the
increasing availability of less radical cost-control measures, like
E-ZPass. For its 10-mile stretch of highway in California,
Cofiroute imported from its French operations a system of
drive-through tolls with variable rates based on studies of traffic
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Cofiroute and other highway companies are not only operating and
financing roads in Europe; they are also designing and building
them. In Spain, for example, private companies, including
Autopistas del Mar Nostrum, are finishing the beltway around
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain is still underdeveloped in terms of road
infrastructure,'' said Conor O'Shea, an analyst at Paribas
Securities in London. And Portugal, he said, lags behind Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern Europe, where road construction languished under
communism, private financing and toll collecting are seen as the
sole means of supporting badly needed construction.
</P>
<P>
   But even in countries with more public resources and much road
construction, highway operators see opportunities _ and do not see
their activities ending on the road. That is what makes them
attractive to some investors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at the end of the day, it is the cash flow that makes
these shares interesting,'' said Alfonso Zuloaga, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
</P>
<P>
   The cash, he said, can be expected to flow in from various
directions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many highways have telecommunications cable to
connect toll plazas, emergency roadside phones, road maintenance
points and other services related to running the roads. Some
highway operators are trying to exploit such cable networks through
leases with telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   In one such instance, Brisa, the Portuguese concern, has sought
alliances with local phone companies to make its highway
communications system the backbone of a fixed-line phone network.
</P>
<P>
   And in Italy, Autostrade has begun selling capacity on its 2,000
miles of fiber optic lines to data and multimedia providers; it
also owns around one-third of Blutel SpA, a cell phone service
provider that will begin operating next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Autostrade and other big highway operators are also looking
beyond telecommunications for ways to deploy their highway assets
and expand their revenue sources. Roughly one-third of Autostrade's
shares were acquired by the Benetton apparel family, whose advisers
see enormous potential in toll roads as retailing outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Seven million Italians use Autostrade roads at least once a
month, and of those, 2 million hold a toll payment card called
ViaCard, which lets them pay tolls automatically but also provides
a huge customer base for selling other things, from film tickets to
furniture. One idea is for minimalls at highway rest stops.
</P>
<P>
   And Cofiroute, Estiot said, is building on a commercial radio
station it operates to supply motorists with highway information.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the French automakers Renault and Peugeot, the
company is developing an information system that will, for
instance, know when a motorist turns on the windshield wipers or
fog lights, thus prompting instant weather reports to broadcast to
other drivers and sell to other commercial stations and weather
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to survive in this business,'' Estiot said, ``you
have to keep pace with the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no doubt that the cash is there to pay for it. A few
months after 91 Express Lanes opened, ``we were cash-flow
positive,'' he said, ``and by 1998, the project paid for its
operation and the repayment of debt.''

 By LESLIE KAUFMAN with SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In summing up this year's electronic Christmas, most everyone
uses the same adjective: big.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were as pumped up as Stone Cold Steve Austin's
biceps. Total sales tripled. Total traffic doubled. And if some
merchants seemed musclebound _ Wal-Mart and Toys ``R'' Us, both
retailing giants, couldn't meet the demand for Christmas deliveries
_ at least they were in a game that a year ago seemed to be passing
them by.
</P>
<P>
   So: Ho, ho, ho. But what were the lessons of this
hypercompetitive holiday selling season, and what do they say about
the future of e-commerce? Even before the wrapping paper had
reached the nation's Dumpsters, retailing executives were back in
their offices dissecting sales patterns for clues.
</P>
<P>
   The season's most elementary truism was ``Invest in Delivering
On Time, Stupid!'' _ the sequel to last year's ``Don't Let Your Web
Site Crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trends were subtler. First, television, it is clear, can
no longer be relied on to create successful brands out of thin air;
almost all the big gains went to long established retailers, not
e-commerce start-ups with huge ad budgets. Second, not just
anything sells on the Web; toys triumphed, while gifts sank and
apparel disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the race to grab new customers, retailers may
finally have given too much away, straining the credulity of
investors and perhaps ushering in a new era of common sense _
unless it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such first impressions come loaded with caveats.
Returns, which can amount to a third of holiday purchases, are just
starting. Most e-merchants will not officially report sales and
traffic data until mid-January or later. And by the time
conventional wisdom solidifies about what works on the Web, the
playing field will probably change _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Bye, Bye Ally
</P>
<P>
   When the shopping season started, all eyes were glued to the
tube. Internet companies big and tiny were spending all their
revenues _ if not all their venture capital or IPO financing _ to
advertise on top-rated television programs like ``Ally McBeal,''
``Frasier'' and ``Monday Night Football.'' The expectation was that
national television exposure could play fairy godmother; after all,
a television ad campaign for eToys a year earlier had turned a
barely known $2 million start-up into an industry leader
practically overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the two dozen Internet users convened in a focus
group for The New York Times on Dec. 21 described the dot-com ads
as little more than a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember there were a lot of ads,'' said Jim Griffin, a
school administrator in Phoenix, Md. ``I do not remember for
whom.'' The focus group was arranged by NFO Interactive, a research
firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this dot-com clutter, there was no happy ending for many
would-be Cinderellas.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there appeared to be no correlation between the
volume of television advertising and online dominance of a shopping
category.
</P>
<P>
   KBkids.com, owned by Consolidated Stores, topped the Nielsen
Media Research list of top television advertisers, which is based
on ``impressions'' _ an estimate of how many times each ad was
seen. The company itself said it spent some $40 million to promote
its Web site. Yet for all the money spent, KBkids ended up third in
visitors among toy sellers, behind eToys and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Pets.com, which flooded the air with the comic antics of a dog
puppet, had a similar story to tell. According to Nielsen, Pets
ranked seventh among all e-commerce companies in its volume of
television advertising _ and first by far among Internet pet
stores. Still, it got much less visitor traffic than either
Petsmart.com or Petstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, dividing visitors into advertising outlays for some of
the most ubiquitous Web sites produces truly outrageous
calculations. Send.com spent $20 million in November and December
combined to draw attention to its gift site. Yet while the private
company will not release how many visitors it had, Nielsen
Netratings says it attracted less than 0.1 percent of the Internet
audience in any given week _ so low that the site did not register
in Nielsen's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   If Nielsen is right, Send.com easily spent more than 4 times its
revenues on advertising _ a ratio that would promptly bankrupt any
mortal retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com chief executive Mike Lannon said those numbers are
wrong and that he has no regrets. The company's goal, he argued,
was not $20 million sales, but making itself the best-known gift
site on the Internet, a marker that he believes he reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to go to my board and tell them we were the lead
story on the `CBS Evening News' the day after Thanksgiving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he noted, the costs of entry are not going to be any
less expensive next year. ``I would hate to have to be building a
brand next Christmas,'' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that he is shifting his ad dollars in
2000 away from national television to more radio and print, in
geographic areas with proven interest in his product. Not
coincidentally, that strategy is fast becoming the mantra of much
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Internet companies spent the majority of their ad
dollars online. Last year, they spent the majority on network radio
and television and national print advertising, building brand
identity.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, said Mike Goldstein, chief executive of Bluelight.com,
the new joint venture of Kmart and Yahoo, ``everyone is talking
about spending money in focused local markets.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big Stores, Big Sales
</P>
<P>
   If start-ups could not buy themselves traction in the online
market with advertising, just how did they snare visitors this
season? The inescapable answer was this: Have an established brand
name to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the list of the holiday season's 50 most-visited sites
was dominated by retailers that did nothing but e-commerce _
companies like Amazon, eBay and eToys. That left many Web
executives to crow that if the bricks-and-mortar set did not get
with the e-program and ditch their real estate, they were going to
be whipped in the brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, both Mediametrix's and Nielsen's lists of the
season's 50 top sites read like a Who's Who of land-based
retailing. JCPenney.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Gap.com, Wal-Mart.com
and Victoriassecret.com were among the clicks-and-mortar merchants
that made the grade. With few exceptions, the dot-coms that thrived
amid this onslaught were already fixtures in their own right _
eBay, Amazon, and CDnow, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little afraid of Internet-only stores,'' said Jim
Nault, a retiree in Tampa, Fla., during the focus group last month.
``I tend to trust more those that have stores that I frequent in
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top clicks-and-mortar players did not spend money
explicitly to promote their Web sites; their stores, and ads for
their stores, got that job done.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web traffic numbers may not tell the whole story of
these retailers' triumph. A New York Times/CBS News poll found that
some 17 percent of Americans shopped on the Web during the holiday
season, up from 7 percent the year before. If that is true, why did
online sales account for only about 2 percent of Christmas retail
purchases? One answer is that the Web is being used primarily as a
search engine. After people study online, they shop off line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the real killer application of the Web in 2000
will be helping customers to make decisions online and in driving
traffic,'' said Steve Markowitz, chairman of MyPoints.com, which
gives shoppers points for online purchases that they can cash in at
stores. ``The bricks-and-mortar establishment aren't dead. In fact,
the key challenge for 100 percent dot-com retailers will be
competing with the offline merchants.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anything as Long as It's Pokemon
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago _ when the Net was the new, new thing _
conventional wisdom held that customers would only buy items that
were known quantities, like books and CD's, but would steer away
from products like clothing or lipstick, which needed to be sampled
for fit or color. Last year, such thinking was discarded as
outdated, and many companies set out to compete for business in
traditional touch-and-feel areas, from couture fashion to diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is fresh evidence that the original supposition was
right after all. While all kinds of merchandise were sold over the
Web during the holidays, customers clearly preferred items that
were ``standard issue'' _ namely, toys, electronics and, well,
toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The categories that really exploded were relatively narrow,''
said a disappointed-sounding Bill Bass, vice president of
e-commerce for landsend.com, the second most visited apparel site,
according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have thought it would be more widespread,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Last, executive vice president for Internet commerce
solutions at J.C. Penney, whose sited ranked third in visitors
among apparel sellers, co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still difficult to buy fashion, so customers are
trending toward the basics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Word: Infrastructure
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the No. 1 problem for e-merchants was Web sites that
crashed. Thanks to an enormous investment in computing power, such
malfunctions were infrequent in the just-concluded holiday season.
Instead, the primary bugaboo was failing to deliver paon
time.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us blamed its warehouse for its embarrassing
announcement, three days before Christmas, that it would be unable
to deliver all the holiday gifts its customers had bought. The toys
were sitting on its shelves, but the company could not pack and
ship the orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us longer to get through the complex process of
fulfilling orders than anyone expected,'' John Barbour, the chief
executive of Toysrus.com, explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to matter whether an e-merchant outsourced the
order-filling process _ called ``fulfillment'' in the trade _ or
invested in building up its own facilities. Rather, the key to
success this season, and perhaps in seasons to come, was planning
audaciously enough for demand.
</P>
<P>
   Outpost.com, an electronics site that promised free overnight
deliveries, was one e-merchant that won generally high marks for
its promptness. ``Analysts said we'd be up double from last year's
sales, but we planned and tested for four times last year,'' said
Outpost.com chief executive Bob Bauman. ``Plan for phenomenal
success, no matter what anyone says,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   There were two other lessons related to order filling: automate
everything, and be prepared to ship as late as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we threw bodies at the growth,'' said Ken Seiff,
chief executive of Bluefly.com, an online store specializing in
cut-rate designer fashions that says its sales doubled this holiday
season. ``This year, we planned much more in advance and automated
_ and still had to throw bodies at the growth.'' Seiff said his
entire staff of 70 spent part of the shopping peak period either
answering customer phone calls or in the warehouse in Niles, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, because we are growing so quickly, I don't think we
will be able to solve problems like that,'' he said. So Bluefly
plans to automate as many functions as possible, including the task
of responding to customer queries.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants also learned that Christmas shoppers want to make
last-minute purchases on the Internet, just like they do in stores.
So, many e-retailers said they would take steps to make that
possible next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ashford.com, a site that sells luxury goods like expensive
watches and diamond jewelry, offered free shipping for orders
placed until 4 p.m. on Christmas Eve _ and concluded that was not
late enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people calling and really wanting $3,000 watches at the
last second,'' said Kenny Kurtzman, Ashford.com's chief executive.
``So next season, we are going to have couriers standing by
Christmas Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   And Free Shipping for All
</P>
<P>
   Americans love a bargain, and Web shoppers are no exception. To
lure customers during the holidays, retailers offered everything
from below-market prices to generous coupons to gifts with each
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most ubiquitous perks was free shipping _ so common
that Internet shoppers are coming to expect it. ``It is becoming an
addiction,'' said Goldstein of Bluefly. And like the enablers of so
many addictions, Web merchants may quickly come to regret their
role.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores have learned that lesson the hard way. To
compete with the up-and-coming discounters in the 1970s, big chains
like Macy and Sears, Roebuck began offering customers deep
discounts on a few choice items to get them into the store.
Fast-forward to the 1990s, when most customers will not go into a
department store unless there is a sale. Running 20-percent-off
clearances has become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   E-businesses face the same conundrum with all their discounting.
For retailers with low average sales and slim-to-nonexistent profit
margins, giveaways like free shipping may prove unsustainable.
Those that have held out, meanwhile, figure that if they provide
better service, customers will come anyway. A gift shipped free
that arrives after Christmas ``is not worth much,'' said eToys
chief executive Toby Lenk.
</P>
<P>
   The durability of a Web site's business plan is certainly an
issue to which Wall Street and the capital markets are becoming
attuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a serious look at marketing expense,'' said Safa
Rashtchy, a senior analyst with U.S. Bankcorp Piper Jaffrey.
Promotional gifts, or offering coupons, or giving away shipping may
get you one-time customers, Rashtchy said. The question is whether
a site has an affordable model for keeping customers coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we'll be watching,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly four years later, all that remains of the shootout in
Roubaix, France, is a facade of burned-out row houses in dull red
brick, charred roof beams with leafy seedlings etched against the
sky, and screens of cinder blocks sealing every doorway. Passers-by
hastening through the rain to Friday prayers at a nearby mosque pay
little heed to 59 Rue Henri Carette.
</P>
<P>
   The inferno that erupted amid gunfire before dawn on March 29,
1996, killed four young men of Algerian origin wanted by the French
police after a series of armed holdups and the killing of a
motorist who resisted an effort to hijack his car. In a three-month
helter-skelter of attacks on supermarkets and other targets, the
Roubaix gang, operating like common hoodlums, netted barely
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But French investigations revealed something more menacing, that
the Roubaix victims were part of a radical Islamic underground
linked to the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla organization
fighting an Islamic holy war against the military-dominated
government in Algeria. The group, known as GIA, its French
initials, is considered brutal, and is thought to be responsible
for many of the 100,000 victims, mostly civilians, who have died in
the Algerian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA network, law enforcement sources in France and elsewhere
say, has long tentacles. While deeply rooted in Western Europe,
especially in Belgium, Britain, France and Italy, it also has
connections in Afghanistan and Turkey, and perhaps most important,
in Bosnia, where a lawless environment during and after the war in
the first half of the 1990s provided Islamic radicals with secure
hideouts, and access to Bosnian passports and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, authorities say, there are signs that the Algerian
connection may have reached the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For years, associates of the young men who died in Roubaix were
known to have extended their activities to Quebec, where relaxed
immigration rules and the Algerians' familiarity with French made
Canada's French-speaking province an inviting haven. Canadian and
French law enforcement agencies say they were aware of the Quebec
operations and kept them under at least sporadic surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA is not known to have directed any of its operations at
the United States over the last several years. But two weeks ago,
the arrest by U.S. customs officials of Ahmed Ressam, a 32-year-old
Algerian who had been living in Montreal, seemed to indicate that
the Algerian underground had widened its field of operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal indictment, Ressam arrived in Port
Angeles, Wash., on Dec. 14 off a ferry from Victoria, British
Columbia, with bomb-making equipment in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a 31-year-old Algerian man was arrested in Brooklyn
and charged with being an accomplice of Ressam in what federal
officials contend was an elaborate terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, federal prosecutors asserted that Lucia Garofalo,
a 35-year-old Canadian woman who was arrested on Dec. 19 on the
Vermont border, belonged to the same GIA cell as Ressam. It remains
unclear whether Ressam and Ms. Garofalo, whose husband is Algerian,
were collaborating with each other when they were arrested; the
prosecutors provided no specific information.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded not guilty to many federal charges, including
making false statements to U.S. customs officials, using a Canadian
passport with a false name, smuggling explosives and carrying
unregistered firearms. U.S. officials say he has disclosed little,
leaving them to puzzle out what his target might have been, whether
it was linked to the millennium celebrations, and whether he had
associates who may still be at large in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, American officials are trying to figure out why
the GIA would plan a strike in the United States when its units in
Algeria are reeling from offensives by the Algerian military, which
appears to have the upper hand in the conflict. One theory is that
Ressam and his associates may be part of a loose group of
free-floating mujahadeen, or holy warriors, some Algerian, some
not, who share a hatred of the United States and bomb-making skills
honed as volunteers in the fighting in Afghanistan, Bosnia or
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Although much about Ressam remains murky, officials in Europe
say they have known about him for several years, and that he is
part of an international network of Islamic militants willing to
use terror to promote their vision of an Islamic world order.
Interviews with officials in Europe and the United States, along
with scholars who specialize in Islamic radicalism, have also
offered a broader picture of the ideology, tactics and targets of
the Algerian underground, and of the GIA in particular.
</P>
<P>
   From these sources, scattered pieces of the jigsaw of Ressam's
life can be assembled. Canadian investigators, for example, say
that in 1998 he shared an apartment in Ville Anjou, a suburb of
Montreal, with Fateh Kamel, a 39-year-old Algerian with GIA links
who was jailed in France this year on charges of terrorist
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on Kamel. A French official said his Montreal telephone
number was found in the address book of Christophe Caze, a
28-year-old medical school dropout from Lille, an industrial city
next to Roubaix. Caze converted to Islam, fought with an
international brigade of Muslim fighters in Bosnia in the early
1990s, then became leader of the Roubaix gang. After the 1996
shootout, Caze, fleeing into Belgium, was shot dead at a police
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   French prosecutors say Kamel was active in the GIA support
networks, and that he had links to the militants in Roubaix,
although what these were remains unclear. One French official
described him as the group's ``spiritual leader.'' Another French
official said the truth about his ties died with Caze. ``We can't
say exactly what the role of Fateh Kamel was because Christophe
Caze is dead, and he's the only one who knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators, especially, have been galvanized by a
GIA-led campaign of violence in France, which included a plane
hijacking in Algiers in 1994 that envisaged crashing the Air France
jet into the Eiffel Tower, a disaster averted when French commandos
stormed the plane in a stopover in Marseilles. In addition, there
was a bombing of the Paris subway in 1995 that killed eight, part
of a four-month terror campaign that included other bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The most audacious of the Roubaix group's ventures, a car bomb
that was to have exploded in front of the police commissariat in
Lille on March 28, 1996, spread alarm that the Algerian militants'
activities might have broader targets than Algeria and France.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was set to go off the day before leaders of the Group
of Seven industrial nations, including President Clinton and French
President Jacques Chirac, gathered for a summit meeting in Lille.
</P>
<P>
   After the Peugeot car packed with explosives was disarmed, it
was traced to the militants living in Roubaix, setting up the
shootout in which the four Algerians died.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to French antiterrorism experts, a major problem in
penetrating the GIA networks has been their diffuse nature. These
officials say that, unlike some other terror groups, the GIA is
split into separate cells, each composed of shifting groups of
people who use Islamic code names, has no central leadership, and
has little coherent policy.
</P>
<P>
   A French official cited the Roubaix group as an example.
</P>
<P>
   While the French investigation had shown that the Islamic
radicals in the Roubaix group had ``close relations with the GIA,''
he said, it was not clear that they were under GIA control. ``The
GIA is not an organization like Action Directe or the Red
Brigades,'' he said, referring to terrorist groups active in France
and Germany in the 1980s. ``It's not an organization that's very
structured, it's a collection of disparate units that act
relatively autonomously.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite this, law enforcement agencies across Europe say that
raids on GIA cells revealed a common operational pattern that has
echoes in the Ressam case. Among these is Ressam's suspected use of
false documents. Canadian authorities say he used a false French
passport to enter Canada in 1994, and American authorities say he
used a false Canadian passport to enter the United States.
Investigators believe he might have used other false documents to
make trips among Canada, Europe and the Middle East while he was
petitioning unsuccessfully for refugee status in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in France, Belgium and Italy say that GIA-linked
cells have drawn on a network of passport factories and dozens of
clandestine couriers. According to French court documents, one
characteristic of GIA recruiting procedures in Europe has been to
confiscate the passports of young militants and recycle them for
use by others in the network. American prosecutors asserted in
court Thursday that one document forger the GIA relied on was Said
Atmani, an Algerian who, with Kamel, was Ressam's roommate in
Montreal for several months before being deported to Bosnia in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French charges against Kamel, involvement in
this passport-forging ring was a major part of his underground
work. The French indictment, which was used to extradite Kamel from
Jordan in the spring, accuses him of ``trafficking in false
administrative documents,'' meaning passports and other identity
papers, including some from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy,
Turkey and Britain, ``to facilitate the movement of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   European experts also were alarmed by the bomb-making equipment
found in Ressam's car. In recent years, investigators in Belgium
and Britain, in round-ups of suspected GIA terrorists, have seized
do-it-yourself terrorist manuals that have included details on how
to produce deadly toxins, how to handle high-powered weapons, and
how to make nitroglycerin, the explosive RDX, the chemical
fertilizer urea, and wristwatch timers, materials U.S. prosecutors
say Ressam was transporting when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In anpage manual contained on a computer diskette that
the Belgian police seized from a GIA member in1995, there is
a similarly detailed description of how to make explosives and how
to blow up buildings, bridges and public monuments. The manual
opens with a dedication to Osama Bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi
Arabian hiding in Afghanistan whom American officials consider the
world's most dangerous terrorist leader and whom groups like the
GIA consider a charismatic figure.
</P>
<P>
   According to European investigators, another aspect of the
Ressam case _ the deportation to Bosnia in 1998 of Atmani, who is
suspected of sharing the Montreal apartment with Ressam and Kamel _
highlights still another feature of the Algerian underground: its
links to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   During the war there, and after, the investigators say, the
Balkan country was a GIA sanctuary and a source of Bosnian
passports and weapons. In addition, for many young Algerians, it
served the same radicalizing purpose as the war in Afghanistan had
for a previous generation of young Muslims in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After Ressam's arrest, American anti-terrorist experts suggested
there might be links in the case to Bin Laden, who has been out of
view since the United States accused him of masterminding the
bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed 220 people in August 1998, and posted a $5 million reward
for his capture. American officials said they first became aware of
Ressam when he was spotted meeting in Montreal with known
associates of Bin Laden, who issued a fatwa, or religious decree,
in February 1998 calling on followers to attack Americans anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   These links may yet prove significant. But the picture offered
by law enforcements officials probing Ressam's connections in
Canada, France and elsewhere suggests that the men to whom Ressam
was closest in Montreal, men like Kamel, had their own geographical
and political frame of reference that would have needed no
prompting from Bin Laden to harbor suspicions about the West.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants have had little problem recruiting in cities
like Roubaix, where many of France's 4 million Muslims have faced
racial discrimination, high unemployment, and the powerful
influence of some local mosques, which have served as
indoctrination schools for radical forms of Islamic belief.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors to the Sunna mosque around the corner from the scene
of the Roubaix shootout soon discover, the influence of Islamic
radicals is strong enough to discourage open conversation on the
subject. ``If you talk about those things, death will find you,''
said a 17-year-old self-professed drug dealer who gave only his
street name, Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Events in Algeria, too, have had a radicalizing effect. In 1992,
after the military-led government canceled parliamentary elections,
which a radical Islamic party was on the verge of winning, civil
war erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the guerrilla struggle was led by the armed wing of
the Islamic Salvation Front, the group denied victory in the
election. But by the mid-1990s the insurgents had split, with the
GIA emerging at the cutting edge of the violence. From the outset,
the GIA turned to Algerians in France as one of its main sources of
money and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Kepel, a French scholar specializing in radical Islam,
said that 1989, the year the Berlin wall came down, was a watershed
year for many young Muslims in the poorer districts of France, a
moment when many chose Islam as the third way between
American-style capitalism and socialism. ``These kids were
drinking, taking drugs, dropping out,'' Kepel said in an interview.
``They found Islam in the mosque, or in prison. Embracing Islam was
an assertion of the self. It was the French version of the story of
Malcolm X.''

motorist who resisted an effort to hijack his car. In a three-month
helter-skelter of attacks on supermarkets and other targets, the
Roubaix gang, operating like common hoodlums, netted barely
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But French investigations revealed something more menacing, that
the Roubaix victims were part of a radical Islamic underground
linked to the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla organization
fighting an Islamic holy war against the military-dominated
government in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The group, known as GIA, its French initials, is considered
brutal, and is thought to be responsible for many of the 100,000
victims, mostly civilians, who have died in the Algerian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA network, law enforcement sources in France and elsewhere
say, has long tentacles. While deeply rooted in Western Europe,
especially in Belgium, Britain, France and Italy, it also has
connections in Afghanistan and Turkey, and perhaps most important,
in Bosnia, where a lawless environment during and after the war in
the first half of the 1990s provided Islamic radicals with secure
hideouts, and access to Bosnian passports and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, authorities say, there are signs that the Algerian
connection may have reached the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For years, associates of the young men who died in Roubaix were
known to have extended their activities to Quebec, where relaxed
immigration rules and the Algerians' familiarity with French made
Canada's French-speaking province an inviting haven. Canadian and
French law enforcement agencies say they were aware of the Quebec
operations and kept them under at least sporadic surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA is not known to have directed any of its operations at
the United States over the last several years. But two weeks ago,
the arrest by U.S. customs officials of Ahmed Ressam, a 32-year-old
Algerian who had been living in Montreal, seemed to indicate that
the Algerian underground had widened its field of operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal indictment, Ressam arrived in Port
Angeles, Wash., on Dec. 14 off a ferry from Victoria, British
Columbia, with bomb-making equipment in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a 31-year-old Algerian man was arrested in Brooklyn
and charged with being an accomplice of Ressam in what federal
officials contend was an elaborate terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, federal prosecutors asserted that Lucia Garofalo,
a 35-year-old Canadian woman who was arrested on Dec. 19 on the
Vermont border, belonged to the same GIA cell as Ressam. It remains
unclear whether Ressam and Ms. Garofalo, whose husband is Algerian,
were collaborating with each other when they were arrested; the
prosecutors provided no specific information.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded not guilty to many federal charges, including
making false statements to U.S. customs officials, using a Canadian
passport with a false name, smuggling explosives and carrying
unregistered firearms. U.S. officials say he has disclosed little,
leaving them to puzzle out what his target might have been, whether
it was linked to the millennium celebrations, and whether he had
associates who may still be at large in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, American officials are trying to figure out why
the GIA would plan a strike in the United States when its units in
Algeria are reeling from offensives by the Algerian military, which
appears to have the upper hand in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that Ressam and his associates may be part of a
loose group of free-floating mujahadeen, or holy warriors, some
Algerian, some not, who share a hatred of the United States and
bomb-making skills honed as volunteers in the fighting in
Afghanistan, Bosnia or Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Although much about Ressam remains murky, officials in Europe
say they have known about him for several years, and that he is
part of an international network of Islamic militants willing to
use terror to promote their vision of an Islamic world order.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with officials in Europe and the United States, along
with scholars who specialize in Islamic radicalism, have also
offered a broader picture of the ideology, tactics and targets of
the Algerian underground, and of the GIA in particular.
</P>
<P>
   From these sources, scattered pieces of the jigsaw of Ressam's
life can be assembled. Canadian investigators, for example, say
that in 1998 he shared an apartment in Ville Anjou, a suburb of
Montreal, with Fateh Kamel, a 39-year-old Algerian with GIA links
who was jailed in France this year on charges of terrorist
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on Kamel. A French official said his Montreal telephone
number was found in the address book of Christophe Caze, a
28-year-old medical school dropout from Lille, an industrial city
next to Roubaix.
</P>
<P>
   Caze converted to Islam, fought with an international brigade of
Muslim fighters in Bosnia in the early 1990s, then became leader of
the Roubaix gang. After the 1996 shootout, Caze, fleeing into
Belgium, was shot dead at a police roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   French prosecutors say Kamel was active in the GIA support
networks, and that he had links to the militants in Roubaix,
although what these were remains unclear. One French official
described him as the group's ``spiritual leader.'' Another French
official said the truth about his ties died with Caze. ``We can't
say exactly what the role of Fateh Kamel was because Christophe
Caze is dead, and he's the only one who knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators, especially, have been galvanized by a
GIA-led campaign of violence in France, which included a plane
hijacking in Algiers in 1994 that envisaged crashing the Air France
jet into the Eiffel Tower, a disaster averted when French commandos
stormed the plane in a stopover in Marseilles. In addition, there
was a bombing of the Paris subway in 1995 that killed eight, part
of a four-month terror campaign that included other bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The most audacious of the Roubaix group's ventures, a car bomb
that was to have exploded in front of the police commissariat in
Lille on March 28, 1996, spread alarm that the Algerian militants'
activities might have broader targets than Algeria and France.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was set to go off the day before leaders of the Group
of Seven industrial nations, including President Clinton and French
President Jacques Chirac, gathered for a summit meeting in Lille.
</P>
<P>
   After the Peugeot car packed with explosives was disarmed, it
was traced to the militants living in Roubaix, setting up the
shootout in which the four Algerians died.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to French antiterrorism experts, a major problem in
penetrating the GIA networks has been their diffuse nature. These
officials say that, unlike some other terror groups, the GIA is
split into separate cells, each composed of shifting groups of
people who use Islamic code names, has no central leadership, and
has little coherent policy.
</P>
<P>
   A French official cited the Roubaix group as an example.
</P>
<P>
   While the French investigation had shown that the Islamic
radicals in the Roubaix group had ``close relations with the GIA,''
he said, it was not clear that they were under GIA control. ``The
GIA is not an organization like Action Directe or the Red
Brigades,'' he said, referring to terrorist groups active in France
and Germany in the 1980s. ``It's not an organization that's very
structured, it's a collection of disparate units that act
relatively autonomously.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite this, law enforcement agencies across Europe say that
raids on GIA cells revealed a common operational pattern that has
echoes in the Ressam case. Among these is Ressam's suspected use of
false documents. Canadian authorities say he used a false French
passport to enter Canada in 1994, and American authorities say he
used a false Canadian passport to enter the United States.
Investigators believe he might have used other false documents to
make trips among Canada, Europe and the Middle East while he was
petitioning unsuccessfully for refugee status in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in France, Belgium and Italy say that GIA-linked
cells have drawn on a network of passport factories and dozens of
clandestine couriers. According to French court documents, one
characteristic of GIA recruiting procedures in Europe has been to
confiscate the passports of young militants and recycle them for
use by others in the network. American prosecutors asserted in
court Thursday that one document forger the GIA relied on was Said
Atmani, an Algerian who, with Kamel, was Ressam's roommate in
Montreal for several months before being deported to Bosnia in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French charges against Kamel, involvement in
this passport-forging ring was a major part of his underground
work. The French indictment, which was used to extradite Kamel from
Jordan in the spring, accuses him of ``trafficking in false
administrative documents,'' meaning passports and other identity
papers, including some from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy,
Turkey and Britain, ``to facilitate the movement of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   European experts also were alarmed by the bomb-making equipment
found in Ressam's car. In recent years, investigators in Belgium
and Britain, in round-ups of suspected GIA terrorists, have seized
do-it-yourself terrorist manuals that have included details on how
to produce deadly toxins, how to handle high-powered weapons, and
how to make nitroglycerin, the explosive RDX, the chemical
fertilizer urea, and wristwatch timers, materials U.S. prosecutors
say Ressam was transporting when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8,000 page manual contained on a computer diskette that
the Belgian police seized from a GIA member in March 1995, there is
a similarly detailed description of how to make explosives and how
to blow up buildings, bridges and public monuments. The manual
opens with a dedication to Osama Bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi
Arabian hiding in Afghanistan whom American officials consider the
world's most dangerous terrorist leader and whom groups like the
GIA consider a charismatic figure.
</P>
<P>
   According to European investigators, another aspect of the
Ressam case _ the deportation to Bosnia in 1998 of Atmani, who is
suspected of sharing the Montreal apartment with Ressam and Kamel _
highlights still another feature of the Algerian underground: its
links to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   During the war there, and after, the investigators say, the
Balkan country was a GIA sanctuary and a source of Bosnian
passports and weapons. In addition, for many young Algerians, it
served the same radicalizing purpose as the war in Afghanistan had
for a previous generation of young Muslims in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After Ressam's arrest, American anti-terrorist experts suggested
there might be links in the case to Bin Laden, who has been out of
view since the United States accused him of masterminding the
bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
killed 220 people in August 1998, and posted a $5 million reward
for his capture. American officials said they first became aware of
Ressam when he was spotted meeting in Montreal with known
associates of Bin Laden, who issued a fatwa, or religious decree,
in February 1998 calling on followers to attack Americans anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   These links may yet prove significant. But the picture offered
by law enforcements officials probing Ressam's connections in
Canada, France and elsewhere suggests that the men to whom Ressam
was closest in Montreal, men like Kamel, had their own geographical
and political frame of reference that would have needed no
prompting from Bin Laden to harbor suspicions about the West.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants have had little problem recruiting in cities
like Roubaix, where many of France's 4 million Muslims have faced
racial discrimination, high unemployment, and the powerful
influence of some local mosques, which have served as
indoctrination schools for radical forms of Islamic belief.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors to the Sunna mosque around the corner from the scene
of the Roubaix shootout soon discover, the influence of Islamic
radicals is strong enough to discourage open conversation on the
subject. ``If you talk about those things, death will find you,''
said a 17-year-old self-professed drug dealer who gave only his
street name, Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Events in Algeria, too, have had a radicalizing effect. In 1992,
after the military-led government canceled parliamentary elections,
which a radical Islamic party was on the verge of winning, civil
war erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the guerrilla struggle was led by the armed wing of
the Islamic Salvation Front, the group denied victory in the
election. But by the mid-1990s the insurgents had split, with the
GIA emerging at the cutting edge of the violence. From the outset,
the GIA turned to Algerians in France as one of its main sources of
money and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Kepel, a French scholar specializing in radical Islam,
said that 1989, the year the Berlin wall came down, was a watershed
year for many young Muslims in the poorer districts of France, a
moment when many chose Islam as the third way between
American-style capitalism and socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were drinking, taking drugs, dropping out,'' Kepel
said in an interview. ``They found Islam in the mosque, or in
prison. Embracing Islam was an assertion of the self. It was the
French version of the story of Malcolm X.''

 By JANE GROSS and JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The millennial celebration in Times Square began a
day ahead of schedule, filling Midtown Manhattan with hundreds of
thousands of merrymakers and forcing police officers to divide
their attention between unexpected crowd control and last-minute
security preparations, including vehicle searches and harbor
patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Times Square is a ghostly place on Dec. 30, once
neighborhood office workers sneak out early in anticipation of the
holiday. The police department had anticipated more foot traffic
than that this year, but nothing like what materialized on a day
set aside for security sweeps: Sealing trash cans and mailboxes,
searching the tops of buildings and cars entering garages, and
setting out the sawhorses and concrete barricades that would
contain a New Year's Eve crowd that is expected to reach two
million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by midday Thursday, the sidewalks between 52nd and 42nd
streets were all but impassable, as tourists and New Yorkers alike
craned their necks trying to see the unlit Waterford crystal ball,
took snapshots of each other taking snapshots and donned glittery
hats and cardboard 2000 eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen these streets like this the night before,''
said a lieutenant at the Times Square police substation, who
estimated a crowd of half a million at the party before the party.
As he spoke, several officers burst into the room, begging for help
managing the tangle of people and cars, which had yet to be banned
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleury and Perez can't do this just the two of them,'' said
the officer, hoarse from hours with a bullhorn at the corner of
Seventh Avenue and 43rd Street. ``Pull somebody from the north
post.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people milling about in Times Square in the late
afternoon said they had come to savor the historic moment, give or
take 30 hours, and planned to be cocooned at home when the ball
actually fell. Others were just passing through, heading to the
subway or to Grand Central Terminal and muttering at the
inconvenience, as New Yorkers love to do. But a surprising number
had come to get the lay of the land, figure out the optimal viewing
spot when the big show really started and decide how early to show
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked hundreds of times, `Where's the best place to
stand? What time do I have to get here? Where's the stage at?'''
one officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that they had anticipated people turning
up in Times Square ahead of schedule, although not necessarily in
these numbers, and had staffed the area accordingly for the last
four days. ``This is a special and bigger celebration,'' said
Marilyn Mode, the department's spokesperson. ``There's a tremendous
influx of very happy tourists. But it's still under control and
orderly; people are moving along.''
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd and the officers in Times Square were jovial _
one woman commiserated with a policeman about his long hours and he
assured her he'd earn enough overtime to go on a cruise _ the
serious business of securing the city moved into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the activity was expected, like the removal of garbage
cans and the welding shut of manhole covers. But there were also
previously unpublicized security measures, like Coast Guard patrols
of the waters around Manhattan Island, with special attention to
historic monuments like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island,
which may be the target of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   There were also random searches of cars entering the city via
bridges and tunnels, dogs patrolling terminals at the three area
airports, hundreds of extra state police officers in New Jersey
patrolling highways between Philadelphia and New York and a
helicopter hovering over Gracie Mansion, the mayor's home, as it
has done for the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   In the Times Square area, where cars were to be banned at
midnight, police officers were posted at garages to examine
automobiles for bombs or other dangerous materials. The officers
crawled under vehicles, opened trunks, looked beneath floor boards
and took license numbers, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing surprises me, with all the concerns about security,''
said Kyong Park, a musician, who was parking his car at a garage on
West 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The officers at the garages, working in pairs, tried to deflect
drivers' anger at the time-consuming searches with humor. Examining
the hot-dog cart of Ladde Kasteridipis, one officer asked, ``Is
that really a propane tank or is it anthrax?'' a joke that might
have raised alarms had it come from the mouth of a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented phalanx of medical personnel and equipment was
also being massed at Times Square. The Fire Department's normal New
Year's Eve complement of 19 ambulances has been expanded to 48,
fire officials said. And for the first time ever, the department
will have 20 buses on standby _ 10 at the Jacob Javits Center and
10 at Bellevue Hospital _ to transport any seriously injured people
from Times Square. The buses could also be used as mobile units,
for treating minor injuries on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Fire Department has bought 10 golf cart-type
vehicles _ small and maneuverable with room for two passengers _
that can be steered through the most congested areas to pick up
injured revelers. The use of the buses and carts will keep
ambulances free for more serious situations, said Fire Commissioner
Thomas Von Essen.

CONTINENTAL ACQUIRES MINORITY STAKE IN GULFSTREAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental Airlines said Thursday it bought a
minority stake in one of its partners, Gulfstream International
Airlines, a privately held Florida regional carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither airline would reveal the amount of the transaction, but
Gulfstream said Continental's stake is about 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Continental and Gulfstream began a code-sharing agreement in
1997. They sell tickets for some of each others' flights, feeding
each other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream, which operates turboprop planes and is based in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., flies in Florida, the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
It is expecting about $83 million in revenues this year.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said the deal will not affect Gulfstream's other
code-sharing agreements, which include arrangements with United
Airlines and TWA.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream has given Continental passengers access to desirable
destinations, Greg Brenneman, Continental's president and chief
operating officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new deal will allow the carriers' established
relationship to grow over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between the two has been beneficial to Gulfstream,
said Tom Cooper, Gulfstream's president and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   He described the deal for Continental to buy a stake ``as just
one of those evolutionary things.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, American banks and regulators have been bracing for
a year-end rush of withdrawals by depositors fearful that Year 2000
computer problems might cause teller machines to fail or credit
card transactions to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of extra money have been printed by the federal government
and shipped to banks here and abroad. Normally, about $150 billion
in cash sits in the Federal Reserve and American bank vaults
worldwide. But this year an extra $70 billion _ or about $255 for
each man, woman, and child in the United States _ has been printed,
dispatched by planes and armored cars and stored in vaults,
awaiting the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   And there it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's largest banks say they have not
experienced unusual demand for cash at their branches or automated
teller machines. On some days recently, these banks said, cash
demand has been lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to date, we have seen no increased demand for cash,'' said
Thomas Sladowski, vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan's
automated teller machine network. ``We're all hoping this will be
the biggest nonevent of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all that cash ultimately isn't needed, banks will return
it to the government, to be recirculated some day or shredded and
left in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   The complacency about cash is just the latest sign that the
public is taking the prospect of Year 2000 computer disruptions in
stride. Of course, problems could yet occur as the new year arrives
that send depositors flocking to their local branches. Bankers and
regulators acknowledge this, noting that even in a world grown
accustomed to the pleasures of plastic credit cards, there is
nothing quite as reassuring as cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest variable in the equation remains public
perception,'' said Doug Tillett, a spokesman with the New York
Federal Reserve. ``We really don't know how people will react.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little to give consumers pause, although
flare-ups have occurred. On Tuesday, about 20,000 credit card
terminals in Britain began to stall because of computer glitches,
holding up holiday shoppers. An spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings, the
large British bank that operates most of the terminals, said that
they could not recognize the year 2000 but that the problem will be
resolved by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at least in the United States, bankers feel well
armed against Year 2000 headaches and are satisfied that they have
plenty of cash to dole out should people want it.
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting all that cash into the system has been a
challenge. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
Department directed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to begin
printing the extra billions. And banks were directed by regulators
to order more cash for their vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $220 billion in reserve cash is held in Federal
Reserve coffers around the country, awaiting orders from banks
should they need it. A smaller portion, about $72 billion, is
already in bank vaults, about $20 billion more than banks typically
keep on hand this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Few banks want to keep that extra cash around very long because
it is not money they can lend.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the reserves are not drawn down, the mere printing of
extra cash has no inflationary effect. For banks, holding more of
their assets in extra cash means that they can lend less and thus
earn less money. So far analysts are not concerned that the impact
on bank earnings or the economy itself will be substantial, as long
as the need for extra wads of cash remains a short-term event.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the all-clear is sounded, banks will quickly ship
that vast pool of extra cash back to the Federal Reserve _ setting
the vast conga line of planes and armored cars back in motion.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Chase has set up 27 special command centers to
monitor its banking network 24 hours a day between Dec. 31 and Jan.
11. The bank even boosted its paper supply in the event that a
flurry of receipts or bank statements needed to be printed, and it
has been funneling extra cash into its branches since October.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, which is based in New York, said it planned for increased
cash demand of 30 percent in October and November and an increase
of 200 percent in December, but that none of that demand has
materialized. Still, extra cash is in the branches, and that
presents security concerns for Chase, other banks and the armored
car companies that serve them.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and armored car companies say they have increased security
to protect this momentary cash hoard. ``The holiday season is
always tough, but with additional money out there we're putting
more security on the street and around our cars,'' said Kevin
Dunbar, chief operating officer of Dunbar Armored, an armored car
company that operates from 80 locations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Banks also have been simulating crises to prepare themselves for
a range of computer-related disasters, not just a run on cash.
Wells Fargo, the large San Francisco bank, has completed three
practice runs in which its personnel had to negotiate 25 potential
problems. The last one was completed a month ago and Wells Fargo
said it had ``developed a strong sense of confidence'' about its
ability to handle anything that arises as 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks already have had a taste of crisis management. In the
fall, Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., had to rush cash
to branches on the Atlantic coast so depositors could get their
money before evacuating in advance of a hurricane. That event
involved a rapid series of armored car trips to the coast and back
_ excellent preparation, a spokeswoman said, for any Y2K hysteria
that might surface.
</P>
<P>
   Oversight for Citigroup, one of the largest and most ubiquitous
financial institutions in the world, is a tad more complex. The
bank said it had seen no heightened cash withdrawals at its global
branches _ but it has to monitor activity in 100 countries. To do
that, Citigroup has set up a special central command center in an
undisclosed location in the United States. Information about the
bank's activities is fed to that center from 15 regional command
centers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most banks in the United States are just keeping
their fingers crossed. And counting on consumers to keep their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to make it clear to people that the safest place
for your money is in the bank,'' said Steve Dishart, a spokesman
for Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. ``People seem to be taking that at
face value.''

   Extra Cash Awaits a Rush That Has Not Materialized
</P>
<P>
   For months, American banks and regulators have been bracing
themselves for a year-end rush of withdrawals by depositors fearful
that Year 2000 computer problems might cause automated teller
machines to fail or credit card transactions to be rejected. In the
last several months, extra money has been printed and sent to banks
in the United States and abroad. Normally, about $150 billion in
cash sits in the Federal Reserve and United States bank vaults
worldwide. But an extra $70 billion has been printed and stored in
vaults this year, and there it sits. Several of the country's
largest banks say they have not experienced unusual demand for cash
at their branches or teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Pull Back From Records
</P>
<P>
   Stocks drifted lower, with most market gauges slipping back from
the records set on Wednesday. Early gains evaporated as demand
waned in the last full session of 1999. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 31.80 points, to 11,452.86. Broader stock indicators
were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index finished with a modest loss
of 4.59 points but remained above the 4,000 level at 4,036.87. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.01 points, to 1,464.47. In
the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue fell to
6.42 percent from 6.44 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bird Dispute Worries Utilities
</P>
<P>
   The criminal prosecution of Moon Lake Electric, a Utah utility
company, for causing the deaths of birds has raised concerns among
electric companies, particularly in the West. Utilities say they
could face large expenses, possibly running into millions of
dollars, if they are forced to prevent the electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   Work Becomes Holiday Power Sign
</P>
<P>
   During any other holiday season, power is measured by the number
of party invitations received and the relative hipness of one's
vacation plans. But in an odd twist in the corporate power
equation, one that will be played out all over New York City on
Friday night, the most important people in an organization are the
ones who will be working.
</P>
<P>
   26-Year Low for New Jobless Claims
</P>
<P>
   Fewer workers are seeking jobless benefits than at any time in
more than a quarter-century. The number of new claims fell by
9,000, to 274,000, in the week thaton Dec. 25. That brought
the four-week average down to 279,750 last week, the lowest since
Dec. 15, 1973. A separate report by purchasing executives showed
that manufacturing in the Midwest expanded in December, while fewer
companies reported being charged higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Air Capitalizes on Image
</P>
<P>
   A deal by Singapore Airlines to acquire a 49 percent stake in
Virgin Atlantic ends a long search to expand its route network.
Analysts attribute the growth in part to a management that has
never reported a loss and carries no debt. But equally important
has been the airline's ability to parlay its image _ featuring the
politically incorrect ``Singapore Girl'' flight attendants _ into
an award-winning global reputation for service and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Clear Holzmann Bailout
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Philipp Holzmann, the troubled German
construction conglomerate, approved a $2.2 billion bailout plan,
but not before some accused the chairman of the company's
supervisory board, Carl von Boehm-Bezing, of being incompetent and
self-serving. Boehm-Bezing, who is also a Deutsche Bank executive,
attributed the problems almost entirely to the company's old
management, which was dismissed two years ago during a previous
bailout.

   Court Approves MetLife Settlement

   Financial Markets to Close Early
</P>
<P>
   Markets in Canada and the United States will be open for a half
day of trading Friday, closing at 1 p.m. Eastern time for the New

WITH A LOT AT STAKE, IBM AND MICROSOFT AWAIT YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Microsoft Corp., the price of freedom on New Year's Eve is
high indeed _ more than $60 billion, by one reckoning. Which is
another way of saying that Steven Ballmer, the president (personal
worth: $28 billion), will be working, but Bill Gates, the chairman
(personal worth: $91 billion), has the night off.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, none of the senior executives have the night off. Louis
V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman, and the other dozen members of his
executive team will be on the job monitoring the Year 2000
transition of the world's computer systems past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize how important this Y2K transition is to our
customers and to IBM,'' observed David Cassano, general manager of
IBM's Year 2000 program.
</P>
<P>
   Every major computer company is gearing up to cope with any
problems that surface as the dates flip over to 2000 in millions of
machines at midnight _ first in Asia, then Europe and then the
Americas. But IBM and Microsoft probably have the most at stake in
terms of reputation, and potential liability.
</P>
<P>
   They have the highest profile on the issue, though for very
different reasons. IBM introduced computing to corporations and
governments in the 1960s, and origins of the Year 2000 problem _
the storage-saving convention of dropping the first two numbers in
the dates of years _ date back to the mainframe era. An estimated
70 percent of the world's business data still resides on mainframe
computers, most of them IBM machines.
</P>
<P>
   As the dominant technology company of the personal computer era,
Microsoft is a lightning rod for concern about the Year 2000
problem partly because its Windows desktop is the face of computing
to most users.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have been criticized for dragging their feet on
Y2K, as the computer problem is known. Critics have said that IBM,
as the company closest to the problem, was aware of the issue long
before it began to move forcefully with Year 2000 efforts in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, Gates was long dismissive of the Year 2000
problem, and the company has been criticized for his stance. In
July 1996, for example, Gates said the problem was one attributable
to ``aging mainframe software'' and insisting that Microsoft's
products ``won't cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence in Microsoft products proved to be exaggerated.
But in the last two years the company has hurried to test its 4,400
products, fixing nearly all problems, so the company says its
products are now ``98 percent Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   For both companies, the Year 2000 problem seems to have been a
balancing act between wanting to help customers and not wanting to
invite trouble. ``The dilemma for companies like IBM and Microsoft
is that if you take too much of a leadership role, you risk
becoming more a focal point for Y2K worries and lawsuits,'' said
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities and a
Year 2000 expert.
</P>
<P>
   The more alarmist predictions about Year 2000 problems _
widespread power failures and food shortages, for example _ have
receded in recent months. The concern among Year 2000 experts now
centers mostly on the possibility that software flaws, though
fixable, will make supply, procurement and diion in many
industries less efficient for months.
</P>
<P>
   If that problem materializes in any significant way, it will be
a challenge for IBM, whose industrial-strength computers power so
much of the economy. ``IBM is at the center of the supply chain
worldwide,'' said Scott Winkler, a technology consultant in
Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is cautiously optimistic that such supply and distribution
headaches will not be widespread. ``No one knows for sure how this
will play out,'' Cassano said, ``but our large customers have made
investments, tested their systems and they say they are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, IBM's business of helping customers fix Year 2000
problems should decline quickly. In 1999, Year 2000 revenues were
$540 million, estimated Steven Milunovich, an analyst for Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has been preparing for the Year 2000 transition for years.
In 1985, it began work on converting its MVS mainframe operating
system to a four-digit format for years. In 1991, it introduced a
version of Cobol, the programming language used for many corporate
software applications, that was ready for Year 2000. In 1995, IBM
announced that it intended to offer Year 2000 versions of all its
products.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Year 2000 Web site, set up in 1997, is now
receiving one million visits a week, three times the volume earlier
this year. Over the New Year's weekend, tens of thousands of IBM
workers will be on the job and on call, three times the usual
number, said Cassano. IBM's 150 global call centers will be open 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more people wanting to work than we've asked to
work,'' Cassano said. ``They consider it a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, a total of 6,000 people will be on the job or on
call worldwide including a staff of 300 at its ``command center''
in Redmond, Wash. ``Sure, we've turned down people who want to
come,'' said Don Jones, director of the Year 2000 program.
``They're geeks, and they want to be at the nerve center for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may have awakened late to the Year 2000 problem, but
it reacted with characteristic aggressiveness once it did. In
scanning its 4,400 products, the company has prepared fixes for
products as far back as a 1983 version of Word for DOS, the
pre-Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, it has sent out 60 million Year 2000 advisories to
customers by direct mail and e-mail. It has distributed 10 million
CDs containing fixes for its most popular products. It has produced
a free video available free at Blockbuster stores, which instructs
home PC users on how to make hardware and software ready for the
Year 2000 rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also distributing antivirus software free from its
Web site. ``The viruses are my biggest Y2K concern,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses can be carried in e-mail or attached documents, and
their only direct connection to the Year 2000 problem is usually
that they are Y2K-related hoaxes. One recent virus purported to be
an e-mail from Gates with a Year 2000 fix for Windows 95. When a
user opened the attached file, it destroyed data on the hard drive.
Another circulated this week and claimed to be a Windows fix from
the ``US Institute for Y2K Readiness.'' (There is no such
institute.)
</P>
<P>
   The legal vulnerability of either IBM or Microsoft stemming from
Year 2000 problems remains to be seen. Much will depend on what
happens in the first days and months of the new year. If there are
problems, IBM and Microsoft offer big, deep-pocketed targets _
though they are also companies with seasoned legal teams.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the legal issue. But
Jones of Microsoft said his company has been the target of two Year
2000 suits to date, and both have been dismissed. In a ruling last
March, a U.S. District Court in Chicago noted that the media focus
on Year 2000 problems would ``inevitably lead to much litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes Microsoft has a strong defense. ``If anyone wants
to come after us after all we've done for customers, I feel ready
and able to take the stand with confidence,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIMISOARA, Romania _ Of all the rebellions that toppled
communism in Eastern Europe a decade ago, the bloodiest began in
this provincial city where a protest by the parishioners of an
obscure Calvinist pastor somehow exploded into the nationwide
revolt that in nine days shoved Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu,
Romania's megalomaniacal ruling couple, in front of a firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after a radio announcer exulted, ``The Antichrist has
been executed on Christmas Day,'' Romanians are still on a national
quest to piece together what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Who shot whom? Was it populist, or a coup by disgruntled
communists who months later legitimized it in elections held in a
still-traumatized country?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the wicked witch and her husband the bad tyrant
were taken down simply by the people rising up is a fairy tale,''
said Mark Almond, an Oxford history professor who studies Romania.
</P>
<P>
   The quest goes beyond historical curiosity. If Romanians found
dignity in their revolution, said Cristian Tudor Popescu, editor of
the newspaper Adevarul, ``we also have to gain the truth, because
living under a lie while free is even less dignified than being
prisoners under a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the power the Ceausescus held, the Romanian revolt was a
virtual regicide. But unlike the revolts in other East European
countries, where power passed to accepted heroes like Poland's Lech
Walesa or Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel, Romania was taken over by
a committee, the National Salvation Front, which quickly splintered
into parties now playing what amounts to a national bloodsport:
bickering over ``who betrayed our revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Romania was almost as closed as North Korea is
today and riddled with informants for the Securitate, the secret
police. Food was short, heat scarce, open dissent impossible.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a nation on edge. Through their tiny peepholes to
the world like Radio Free Europe, people knew that communist rule
had toppled from East Germany to Bulgaria. They also knew that in
China, democracy protests had been crushed by tanks. No one doubted
the ruthless Ceausescus would apply a ``Chinese solution'' if the
army and the Securitate would obey.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents who would be soon be running the country were
barely visible. Ion Iliescu, Ceausescu's former heir-apparent, who
had fallen from favor for criticizing the Mao-like personality
cult, was running a small publishing house. The protest poet Mircea
Dinescu and the sociologist Silviu Brucan, a former ambassador to
Washington who had drafted the ``Letter of Six'' older communists
attacking Ceausescu, were both under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As the coup unfolded, most of what Romanians learned came from
national television. The National Salvation Front met at the
studios in almost continuous live debate, and the studios
themselves were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   What they reported was often more panic than fact. Up to 60,000
people were reported killed; actually, about 1,000 were. People
shouted on camera that the water was poisoned, that the Soviets
were invading. ``Terrorists'' from Libya, Russia, Iraq, Israel or
the CIA were said to be fighting for Ceausescu. (Prosecutors
concluded only last month that there is ``no proof'' any terrorists
existed.)
</P>
<P>
   There were grotesque mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Military school cadets were sent to take Bucharest airport when
it was already in the army's hands; 48 cadets were gunned down. A
special forces unit was sent to take the defense ministry; units
who had arrived there earlier wiped them out.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents created suspicion, still repeated today, that the
National Salvation Front arranged shoot-outs to have enough
bloodshed to prove that theirs was a popular revolt. (The Front's
members vigorously deny this.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Brucan, whose memoir, ``The Wasted Generation,''
was published in 1994, there had been plots against Ceausescu since
1976 and he personally had told Washington, London and Moscow of
plans to unseat the dictator, and had received Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's promise that Moscow would not interfere. But
the 1989 uprising was populist, he insisted, adding, ``Our only
merit was that we were in the railway station when the train of the
revolution arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he said, a labor riot in Brasov led Ceausescu to form
secret military units trained for urban warfare. The commandos were
given keys to caches of arms and food, uniforms and maps of the
tunnels and bunkers under government buildings. In any coup, their
orders were to save the party elite.
</P>
<P>
   These men, Brucan and others say, created much of 1989's chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the murkiness is that the revolution's
trigger never became a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Tokes was a pastor in the Romanian Reformed Church, which
was popular among the ethnic Hungarians of Transylvania. He had
become a thorn in the government's paw with his sermons complaining
about the treatment of Romania's Hungarians and about the
bulldozing of villages for collective farms.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a cleric and known to foreign journalists, he was
not imprisoned, but rather sent to Timisoara, a largely Orthodox
city.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, 1989, he was to be exiled to a remote village for
having given an interview to a foreign television crew smuggled
into the country. Instead, hundreds of loyal parishioners encircled
his church. Water cannon were turned on them; others joined. The
revolution began.
</P>
<P>
   As rioting spread, Tokes was forgotten; only seven friends were
with him when police took him away, grilling him for three days
before the collapse of the regime freed him.
</P>
<P>
   As a forceful spokesman for Hungarian rights, he is still viewed
with suspicion by many Romanians. ``As the spark of the revolution,
I was never appreciated,'' he said in an interview. ``If I hadn't
been in the Hungarian minority, I would be a Vaclev Havel or a Lech
Walesa by now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bloody mayhem that spread across Romania began in Timisoara,
when generals, following orders by Ceausescu on pain of death,
opened fire. Rumors began that conscripts who refused were
summarily executed, and that the wounded were being killed in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some uniforms were found near the crematorium with bullet
holes in the back,'' said Mihai Dragoi, a doctor who founded the
Association of the Wounded and Heirs of the Martyrs of the Dec. 17
Revolution. ``But there is no wish to investigate these things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dragoi was part of a 1994 panel that concluded that there were
10 unexplained deaths in hospitals. Strangers in medical garb were
roaming the halls, and the one running r No. 5 in one
hospital was suspected of killing patients.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dragoi, 43, is one of the few Romanians who knows exactly
who shot him. A former major admitted in a 1995 interview that he
stood in the director's office of the government newspaper building
and sniped at passers-by. ``I was scared,'' was his explanation.
Dragoi, passing by, was hit in the leg and still limps.
</P>
<P>
   The major was cashiered in 1995 and charged with shooting four
people, one fatally. He retorted that he was sorry he had not aimed
at their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In Timisoara, 12 monuments mark spots where dozens died.
Securitate men also took 44 bodies to the capital, cremated them
and dumped the ashes in sewers.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 20, for reasons that are still not fully clear, the
generals in Timisoara had a change of heart, and shooting stopped.
Their commander, Gen. Victor Stancalescu, who could not be
contacted while this article was in preparation, disobeyed
Ceausescu's orders to open fire again, had his leg put in a cast as
camouflage and returned to Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Ceausescu himself in effect brought the revolt to
Bucharest, when a crowd of 100,000 he had summoned to denounce the
Timisoara revolt suddenly took up a chant of ``Timisoara!
Timisoara!'' The last televised image was Ceausescu's shocked face
shouting ``Be quiet!'' That moment, all agree, finished him.
</P>
<P>
   Students poured into the streets. That night army units opened
fire in University Square, killing dozens. The next day, workers
marched downtown; an air force general refused Ceausescu's orders
to attack them. The presidential couple fled in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   After a street celebration likened by Dinescu to ``one of those
bad-taste movies of the Cuban revolution,'' the poet drove to the
television station. Iliescu, who by that evening had formed the
National Salvation Front and become acting president, also drove to
the station, instinctively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The station's director stalled them for an hour, saying the
equipment was overheated, but Dinescu finally insisted on going on
air and shouted: ``God has turned his face on Romania! We've won!''
A stream of generals arrived to pledge their support.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, Brucan now believes, ordered the secret sniper units
that Ceausescu had formed into action. Dinescu said he later saw
hotel rooms with guns and food hn the walls, and light poles
rigged with machine-gun simulators.
</P>
<P>
   Ceausescu fled north, stopping at a lakeside villa so his wife
could grab jewelry. His pilot, who is now dead, either pretended
mechanical problems or said anti-aircraft radar was tracking them.
They landed near Tergoviste, had a bodyguard hijack two cars and
sought safety at a government nursery, but they were arrested by
the army.
</P>
<P>
   Gelu Voican Voiculescu, a muscular engineer who came to the
television station and impulsively became Iliescu's bodyguard,
learned from Stancalescu that Ceausescu was in custody. The two
arranged a telephone number and password to have the dictator
killed immediately. A horrified Iliescu refused, saying that
democracy could not begin with murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, the Front debated the couple's fate, Voiculescu
recalling that parts took place sotto voce in a bathroom with the
water running to defeat bugging. What carried the day was that the
Tergoviste commander had reported two attempts to rescue the
Ceaucescus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who argue political, moral or juridical arguments don't
know what is a revolution,'' Brucan said later. ``It's like in war:
If you don't shoot, he'll shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote to hold a rapid court martial was unanimous. The
verdict, though not stated, was clear, since the firing squad
traveled in the same helicopters with the judges.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 25, a tape of the trial shows, an arrogant Ceausescu
pounded the table and his wife broke down. Then their hands were
tied for execution, but not their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The indiscriminate shooting continued, so the next night the
bullet-riddled bodies were put on display. By the next morning, the
shooting faded away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Brucan, ``was the proof of the pudding,'' and
virtually the only certainty lefrevolution that continues to
haunt Romania.

AMERICANS TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S EVE AT PARTIES, HOME, IN FRONT OF

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Millions of Americans will be putting on the glitz
tonight, from the crush of humanity in New York City's Times Square
to a throng of revelers expected for fireworks and dancing at San
Francisco's Embarcadero.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the New Year's Eve spectrum are computer
watchdogs, such as Damon Hughes. The Ohio database administrator
will spend most of the evening in his office, guarding the computer
system at Lima Technical College against some obscure Y2K failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?'' Hughes asks
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of Americans aren't interested in fighting the
crowds, can't even program their VCRs for the Year 2000, and hope
to spend New Year's Eve in relative peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   At most of the high-profile city celebrations, party-goers can
expect to be surrounded by an obviously beefed up police presence.
In New York, officials are being so cautious that the manhole
covers in Times Square have been welded shut.
</P>
<P>
   Many municipal leaders have criticized Seattle as being too
fearful in canceling a planned New Year's Eve bash under the Space
Needle. Mayor Paul Schell was shaken by his city's riots over the
World Trade Organization gathering there and the recent arrest of
an Algerian national caught crossing the nearby Canadian border by
ferry with a carload of bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly every U.S. city will have an emergency management
team ensconced in some sort of bunker tonight ready to respond to
anything from computer-fed utility failures to acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really expecting nothing will go wrong, but we're not
betting nothing will go wrong, so we're prepared for the worst,''
explained Tim Cuthriell, director of Denver's Office of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Emergency Operations Director Chuck Lanza has
been trying to strike a balance, advising preparation even though
he says he's comfortable that Y2K is going to be a ``nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked people to think of Y2K as the last hurricane of
the season,'' Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they don't expect anything serious to
happen, yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up 10
regional centers ready to respond, in the event of some kind of
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials were still making
last-minute Y2K adjustments Thursday to one of the nation's most
important air-safety systems. FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said a
software ``patch'' correcting 10 lines of software code was applied
to computers that process radar and flight-plan data for flight
controllers, and called it a ``very, very minor issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a USA Today/CNN poll published Thursday revealed that
61 percent of those surveyed expect at least one terrorist attack
somewhere in the United States to mark the arrival of 2000. Fewer
than a quarter of those polled expressed any fear of what might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that 71 percent of Americans have made no
special plans for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster Inc. did its own poll, finding that 45 percent of
those surveyed intend to stay home on New Year's Eve, and nearly 50
percent of those are likely to rent movies. Of those staying home,
the Blockbuster Web site notes, 27 percent chose ``Much Ado About
Nothing'' as the movie title that best described their feelings
about the new year.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., two of the largest, private New Year's Eve
celebrations have been canceled _ not out of fear of a terrorist
attack, but from lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   A gala featuring several rock groups at the MCI Center sports
arena, where indoor fireworks were to be set off, was canceled
Wednesday because tickets ranging from $249 to $399 were slow to
sell. Earlier this month, a lavish black-tie party co-sponsored by
the Washington Post was canceled because of a lack of sales of
tickets costing as high as $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials still estimate that between 100,000 and
500,000 people will attend a massive Y2K party tonight on the
Washington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Security will be tight near the Lincoln Memorial, where
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will gather
with celebrities and performers following dinner at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But in smaller venues around the country, even a night out will
end early. At Lou Malnati's Pizza in Chicago, manager Wendy Kolton
will oversee the annual New Year's Eve party that the eatery hosts
for children, but will stop all deliveries by 9 p.m. so the
employees can leave early. The pizzeria is usually open until
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so they can make it home safely, not so much that they
can celebrate,'' Kolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based BindView Corporation, a company that provides
computer security to 22 of the 25 largest U.S. banks, is hoping to
help the thousands of computer professionals stuck in front of
their terminals do a little celebrating, too. They are hosting a
virtual New Year's Eve party that will allow workers to call up
movies, music, chat and multiplayer games over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the office-bound database administrator , Ohio,
plans to log in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go into the technical chat groups to see if anybody
runs across something we might look at or we're missing, but the
movies sound good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking to our customers, and discovered they were
all going to be working New Year's Eve,'' said Marc Camm, BindView
vice president for marketing. ``So we decided we would have a
virtual party. It's really Times Square for geeks. But it's a lot
of fun.''

   ARGENTINA: DRUG CHIEF'S WIDOW INDICTED
</P>
<P>
   A judge has indicted the widow of Pablo Escobar, once leader of
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, on charges of money laundering and
froze $10 million of her assets. Prosecutors said Victoria Henao
Vallejos has led a money laundering organization in Argentina since
she arrived in Buenos Aires almost two years ago using an alias
granted by Colombia through a witness protection program.

<P>
   CHILE: EX-PINOCHET AIDES WARNED
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministry warned 36 former aides to Gen. Augusto
Pinochet not to leave Chile, telling them that the Spanish judge
who issued the warrant for the former dictator's arrest in London
is now planning to prosecute them as well. Foreign Minister Juan
Gabriel Valdes told the officials, mostly high-ranking retired
military officers, that the government could not protect them from
prosecution if they left the country.

   ISRAEL: BUDGET APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   Parliament approved a $55 billion budget for 2000, giving Prime
Minister Ehud Barak a domestic political victory before he departs
for further peace talks with Syria in the United States next week.
Despite threatened defections, most of Barak's 68-member coalition
united behind the fiscally stringent spending plan. The budget is
expected to reduce the public sector deficit to 2.5 percent of the
gross domestic product from an estimated 3 percent of the GDP in
1999.

<P>
   FRANCE: BEEF CASE TO COURT
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission and France have decided to take their
battle over lifting a ban on British beef to the European Court of
Justice. After imposing a ban in 1996 because of mad cow disease,
the commission lifted it last summer. But France refused to go
along with the decision and efforts to negotiate have failed.
</P>
<P>
   SERBIA: OPPOSITION REBUFFED
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's prosecutor rejected charges that the secret police
plotted to kill the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in October. His
party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, said the secret services
planned the crash of a truck into a car in which Draskovic rode
with his brother-in-law, who died along with three bodyguards. In
the official newspaper Politika, the prosecutor's office said
``there is no evidence'' the secret services had any link to the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   SERBIA: 3 JUDGES FIRED
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the Serbian Parliament to fire three judges was
condemned by the Serbian Chamber of Lawyers as unconstitutional,
unlawful and an effort to undermine the judiciary's independence.
The dismissals, without explanation, ``could have a huge impact on
the system of the separation of powers and affect the independence
of judges,'' the chamber president, Milan Vujin, said at a Belgrade
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: JOHN MAJOR POUNDS TORIES
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party's headaches worsened as former Prime
Minister John Major broke ranks and attacked its ``suicidal'' shift
to the right wing. Major's remarks, in The Spectator, follow an
attack by the former Conservative chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, who
told the BBC the party ``has not yet found its way in opposition.''

   SRI LANKA: PRESIDENT FEARS FOR EYE
</P>
<P>
   The recently re-elected president of Sri Lanka, Chandrika
Kumaratunga, told the BBC that she may lose her eye as a result of
a suicide bomb attack during a campaign appearance. The attack was
believed to have been the work of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil homeland.
``Somehow I have been spared to live to talk of love and
forgiveness,'' she said.

Annan, a soft-spoken aristocrat from Ghana, was elected the United

BUSH'S MONEY MACHINE LOST NO STEAM IN LAST QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas closed a
record-shattering year in political fund raising by collecting $10
million over the last three months, bringing his total for 1999 to
more than $67 million, the Bush campaign said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will begin the new year with $31.4 million in the bank,
aides said, more than four times the bankroll of his closest rival
for the Republican presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain leads Bush in polls in New Hampshire, the first primary
state, and appears to be building momentum elsewhere. His campaign
announced on Wednesday that he raised $6.1 million in the fourth
quarter to bring his total for the year, including anticipated
federal matching funds, to more than $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way for McCain to match the financial firepower
of Bush, whose campaign spent more than $17 million in the last
three months of 1999 alone. Bush is not accepting federal matching
funds and so is not bound by the state-by-state spending limits
that McCain must adhere to.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush were dismissive of McCain's fund raising and
minimized any political threat from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears he has raised enough for his two- or three-state
campaign,'' said Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman,ing to
McCain's emphasis on showing well in early contests in New
Hampshire and South Carolina to generate support in later primaries
in big states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has worked hard to earn broad-based support all
across America,'' McClellan added, ``so he can run a national
campaign and focus on meeting with voters as they begin to pay
closer attention to the election.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan also suggested that McCain's recent fund-raising
prowess was inconsistent with his emphasis on trying to root out
the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently McCain found time to hold fund-raising events
between his campaign reform speeches,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, McCain's press secretary, replied: ``McCain's
message is what has made us successful in New Hampshire despite
being outspent 2-to-1. It shows it's not the strength of your bank
account but the strength of your message that ultimately sways the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The $17 million Bush spent in the fourth quarter is more than
any other candidate has ever spent in a three-month period in a
pre-election year _ and more than any candidate other than Bush has
raised in such a span.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Bush's spending, or about $6.3 million, went to
produce and place television and radio advertisements, the Bush
campaign said. The campaign spent $2.7 million to raise money
(largely in fund-raising events and direct mail) and $3.4 million
for on-the-ground expenses like staff salaries and telephone costs
in various states. Travel accounted for $1.5 million, and
accounting and general overhead, largely headquarters expenses, for
an additional $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, running far behind Bush and McCain, reported
Thursday that he raised $1.7 million in the last three months of
1999 and $7 million for the year. He has $200,000 in the bank and
expects to receive $4.4 million in federal matching funds after the
first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Republican candidates _ Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah and Alan Keyes _ have not yet reported their fund
raising or spending figures for the final quarter. Nor has Pat
Buchanan, who is seeking the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, released fourth-quarter numbers on Wednesday.
Bradley raised $8 million, while Gore collected $4 million. When
matching funds are added to their cash on hand, the two candidates
will begin the new year with roughly $19 million each.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are now living in the '00s, but it's still a ``what have you
done for me lately?'' world.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a new decade and a new century, though, it seems
worthwhile to recall what the stock market did in the last decade
of the last century. And what it did was considerable: from the end
of the 1980s through Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up more than 400 percent, as was the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
And the Nasdaq? Up nearly 800 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Laszlo Birinyi Jr., who runs his own research firm
and serves as global strategist for Deutsche Bank Securities, was
wildly optimistic. His forecast of a 2,800 peak for the Nasdaq
during 1999 was much higher thanher prediction on Wall
Street; it caused chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Few are laughing now that the Nasdaq has pierced 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi also predicted that the Dow would peak at more than
12,000 and the S&AMP;P at 1,500; close enough. Last week, he took some
time to talk about stocks in the Year 2000. Following are excerpts
of the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A year ago you were projecting that the Nasdaq would rise
around 30 to 40 percent in 1999. Yet the index was up about double
your own forecast. What did you miss? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two things caused my guess to be so off and everyone else's
to be so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   First, the speed with which the Internet has gained momentum was
something no one anticipated. Just do a search of feature stories
in The New York Times that have dot-com in them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, no one saw that health care and consumer growth stocks
would fall off the wagon. That shrank the number of stocks going
into growth stock mutual funds, and yet the number of growth stock
mutual funds did not shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you looking for this year? It's hard to imagine that
stocks will keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   A. I am looking for another 20 percent gain in all the major
indexes. We continue to see a lot of stocks which undergo
accumulation on every stumble. That is the market's way of telling
us that it is discounting more good news.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Valuations and rising interest rates don't worry you?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think rates are a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude going into 1997 was very similar to what you see
today _ questions about interest rates, strong technology stocks
and a market that had had a couple of good years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are recycled, but the numbers get updated.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern I like is the one that holds that the stock
price moves we have had are unprecedented, and that such violent
upswings tend to end badly. If this has never happened before, how
do you know it will end badly?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does it bother you that only a fairly narrow group of stocks
have performed well while others have languished?
</P>
<P>
   A. The stock market is not a democracy. The stock market is all
about picking stocks, and always has been. And for all this concern
about lack of breadth, we should realize that it is not as bad now
as it was 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, AT&AMP;T and General Motors represented 15 percent of the
S&AMP;P 500 Index. Today, Microsoft and General Electric represent 7.5
percent of the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, back then the market cap of AT&AMP;T and GM was
equal to the 388 smallest stocks in the S&AMP;P. Today, Microsoft and
GE are equal to the smallest 180 stocks in the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Breadth, like many indicators, is descriptive, not indicative.
It tells you what is going on, not what is going to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The indicative stocks have been technology and Internet
issues. You expect them to continue to be the leaders, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. The market is telling you that there is a very dramatic event
taking place here. And dramatic changes of this nature suspend old
rules until new ones are found.
</P>
<P>
   As I suggested earlier, part of technology's strength is that
many of the old-line growth sectors are no longer growing.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are no longer a growth sector. They may be again, but not
under this administration. And consumer growth stocks like Proctor
&AMP; Gamble, Gillette and Coca-Cola are no longer growing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which technology stocks do you like? America Online was your
favorite last year, and the stock was up about 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A. AOL is still my top pick. I also like CMGI, Nokia and Texas
Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Should someone who has left $100,000 in a sock for the last
10 years buy technology stocks, even at these sky-high prices? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That would be my advice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do any other sectors look interesting?
</P>
<P>
   A. Large brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter look good, as well as cyclical stocks like Dow
Chemical, Alcoa, paper stocks and manufacturers like Caterpillar.
</P>

 &HT;    Some outlive '19' inscribed on their own gravemarker
 &HT;    By Michael Samuels
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cemeteries throughout South Florida are
having their own Y2K problem, and it has nothing to do with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   At Boca Raton Cemetery and Mausoleum Inc., endless rows of
gravestones seem to blend together on long, manicured lawns
decorated with scattered flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But look closely and some of the oldest ones may catch your eye
because of a small but important quirk.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 gravestones randomly placed about the grounds have the
number ``19'' inscribed on them for the year of death. The only
problem is the owners of those headstones have not died in this
century. And of course there's only one more day to go,
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to put 19-- on their tombstones, but now people
are living longer,'' said Fred Menor, president of the Lake Worth
Monument Co. ``It was one of the major things to do back in the
1950s and 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a problem when those people die,'' Boca Raton
Cemetery and Mausoleum manager Curtis Harris said. ``We've had a
couple of people contact us and laugh about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 24 years in the business, Menor said he does not ever
remember placing a ``19'' on a tombstone before a person died, but
his father and grandfather did so regularly. The surviving spouse
of a deceased husband or wife would often purchase the same
tombstone and have the name, year of birth and ``19'' inscribed on
it in preparation for his or her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the 60s, I'm sure you'll find lots of cases,'' Menor
said. It was more convenient and less expensive for people to place
their birth year and the first two numbers to designate the century
of their death on the tombstones before the headstone was in the
ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it used to cost more to inscribe letters and
numbers once the headstone was in the ground, said David
Walkinshaw, spokesman for the National Funeral Directors
Association and a funeral director in Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is actually a very, very small problem,'' Walkinshaw said.
``Most of those people have indeed died.''
</P>
<P>
   There are competing viewpoints on how to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Menor suggested inscribing an ``x'' over the ``19'' and then
placing the correct year of death after it. Other ways to fix the
``19'' include refacing the stone or patching it and then filling
in the uneven parts with resin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time that shows,'' Menor said. ``We never really
do have a way to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Slutsky, director of Heritage Manor Memorial Park in Boca
Raton said the best and least expensive way would be to remove the
stones. ``There is really not a viable way of doing it,'' Slutsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Cemetery in
suburban West Palm Beach avoid the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is inscribed until you die,'' said Alexia Alfonso, a
worker at Our Lady who has a grave marker set up since her husband
already passed away. ``You cannot predict anything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, Maine _ Russell Merrill and his neighbors have spent
every weekend this month scouring junk heaps for a winch and a
telephone pole, cutting plywood and wrapping 250 feet of lights _
the kind you see on the sides of tractor-trailer trucks _ to make
their own New Year's Eve ball.
</P>
<P>
   It stands perched 57 feet in the air, in what folks here call
Maxfield Common, just in front of the iced runway that will be used
on Friday afternoon for turkey bowling, a competition in which two
bowlers roll frozen birds at wooden pins.
</P>
<P>
   Of the town's practices for the first ball drop in its history,
said Merrill, ``We have tried it four to six times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more personal to have it done in your hometown,'' added
Merrill, 47, an electrician who estimated that 240 work-hours and
$1,100 went into the creation.
</P>
<P>
   In the kind of I-don't-need-New York attitude that is common in
Maine, this town of 2,500 people _ several dozen of whom fled the
city _ has been holding meetings for 50 weeks to plan its own New
Year's Eve celebration carefully.
</P>
<P>
   While the people here shudder at the thought of jamming into
Times Square, they cannot conceive of bringing in the 2000s without
a lighted ball. The local cable access station, Lake Region TV,
will show the ball drop later, sometime in January.
</P>
<P>
   A winch to lower the ball was found, pulled from a pile of
rusting junk in Maurice Robbins' backyard. In a concession to
drinking habits, three men will work it, so all will have a free
hand to hold a beer.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is scheduled to take a minute and 4 seconds to drop.
The words ``Harrison 2000'' will be in lights on a post, and
operators will flash the lights for the sign and ball on and off.
</P>
<P>
   There are still $25 buttons that provide admission to the day's
events. In addition to the ball drop and turkey bowling, there will
be a cribbage tournament, Bingo, a torch-light parade, clog dancing
and story telling. For all the pull of the famous events in Times
Square, there are still some rooms to be had in the larger
metropolis, but not here: the three at the Crystal Lake Inn and the
five at the Harrison House are booked with visitors here for the
big show.
</P>
<P>
   That should not be a surprise. The Oxford Hills, rolling and
pine-forested, merge into the White Mountains about a half-hour
away. The jagged snow-capped ridges of Mounts Washington, Madison
and Jefferson lie silhouetted against the western skyline. The
night sky, free of the street lights and nearby houses, glitters
with a of stars. The deer and moose are as common as the
blue jays and chickadees.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this town's aesthetics and attitude are different
from New York's, the ties between the two are hard to miss, and
some go back to the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   There were huge resorts in this part of Maine in the early part
of the century that drew some of the wealthiest people from New
York north for the entire summer. Long Lake and Crystal Lake here
have attracted many vacationing artists, especially opera singers,
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, a New York opera coach, Enrica Clay Dillon, opened the
Deertrees Theater, which still has summer stock productions. It
brought in stars like Rudy Vallee and Tallulah Bankhead, as well as
numerous regulars from the operatic world. Vivian Vance, who went
on to become Lucille Ball's sidekick on the television show ``I
Love Lucy,'' acted in the Deertrees company in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   The town still lures tourists from the city; in the summers it
doubles in size and 15 or so children's camps, like Owatonna,
Waziyatah, PinecNewfound, Wigwam and Tapa Wingo, draw
heavily from the New York and Boston areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents who left New York for Harrison retired in the
area after years of vacationing here, although some, like Donna
Joyce, who grew up in East Flatbush in Brooklyn, simply packed up
their families and left for the slower life of the country. Mrs.
Joyce, who says she misses New York most during the Christmas
season, works as a nurse at the hospital in Bridgton.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Eleanor Frank, 84, a Bronx native who was a camp
counselor at Tapa Wingo in 1934 when she met her future husband, a
swimming teacher at a neighboring camp. They lived most of their
life at Broadway and 88th Street, ``right in the middle of the
mess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1972, her husband retired as a governor at the American
Stock Exchange, and they moved here, to about 200 acres and a
rambling 14-room farmhouse built in 1908. He put a stock ticker in
the house and it clattered away until his death in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   She likes her quiet life in the country. ``Of course, it's
calmer and you do what you want,'' she said. ``When your car stops
you are parked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago they asked those of us who had houses on the
lake if we wanted our mail delivered to our docks,'' she said,
sitting in her hilltop home as a wind blew against the white
clapboards. ``There was not one yes. We all wanted to go into town.
How would we know what was going on? If I sneeze in my living room,
someone in the post office says `Bless you.' That is how fast news
travels in Harrison.''
</P>
<P>
   The town, considered upscale by neighboring communities, is tame
by the crime standards of Maine. There was a rooftop shootout
recently in a neighboring town, but the closest thing to a
sensational crime here was the arrest of the local drug dealer, who
had the town paying for the electricity to grow his marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of millennial terrorism here are not rampant. Any threat
will probably be home-grown, everyone concedes. Gordon McLaren, the
emergency management director for the town, has designated the
firehouse as the emergency shelter for any Year 2000 crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Selectwoman Sheila Smith wanted to be sure the shelter would be
used only if it was really necessary. ``Anyone in Maine should be
prepared to go without power for 12 to 24 hours,'' she said. ``Five
hours without power does not warrant an emergency shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The five members of the board of selectmen, which administers
the town, have been debating security modifications to the town
offices. As Selectwoman Sue Gazza put it at a recent meeting,
``There are a lot of weirdos in this country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers here, known as ``out-of-staters'' or ``displaced
locals,'' are sometime viewed as intruders, or as people with
different ways. Philip H. Denison, 70, a retired chicken farmer and
leather worker with a laconic wit and down east drawl, was talking
about them as he stood under the low ceiling of his farmhouse,
which has been in his family since 1812.
</P>
<P>
   As the town humorist, he will tell stories and poems, some of
them rather ribald, at the community church on New Year's Eve,
though he may change some of the punch lines. He'll be in church,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know anybody in town anymore except for the
old-timers,'' he said. ``We used to be able to hunt all around
here, but a lot of these out-of-staters post their land: `No
Trespassing.' It makes me kind of mad. And, of course, they talk
funny, they call supper dinner. We eat dinner at noontime.''
</P>
<P>
   In one skit, he plays a host of characters, including a bumpkin
from Harrison, wearing a suit made by a city tailor, John Paul. The
tailor's motto, as Denison utters it, is ``John Paul fits them all,
young, fat, short and tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit the bumpkin is wearing has sleeves that are too short,
mismatched lapels and a baggy seat. He complains to the tailor,
first about one flaw, then about another, and each time the tailor
shows him a solution: hold up the seat, pull down the sleeves and
keep the lapel flat with a tucked-in chin. Denison is left limping
around the stage, like Richard III.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Denison as a sympathetic observer: ``Look at that poor
man. He can hardly walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup,'' comes the response. ``But his suit sure fits good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Clark, eat your heart out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If, like many of us, you plan to swill
champagne out of a plastic cup tonight while plopped on your Rooms
To Go sectional watching Dick Clark, get a load of this:
</P>
<P>
   A $150,000 fireworks display for just 20 folks.
</P>
<P>
   A $100,000 Ritz-Carlton package that includes _ among other
indulgences _ a private jet, personalized Louis Vuitton luggage and
use of a new Jag for the weekend (''chauffeur-driven if
preferred'').
</P>
<P>
   And $50,000 for a Mar-a-Lago member who's paying for 25 pals to
hear Gladys Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' says a Palm Beach hostess
who's passing out 300 crystal boxes containing mini flashlights
``just in case everything goes black at 12:01 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the keepsakes? ``I have no clue,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, like many islanders, does she care.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, for example, hired party planner extraordinaire
Bruce Sutka to produce a $2,000-a-seat soiree with 3,000 balloons,
antique Venetian statues flown in from Italy and a sumptious spread
(including caviar, lobster, duck, sea bass and foie gras).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like stage fright,'' said Sutka _ shaping silver mylar
into a decoration that resembled a giant Jiffy Pop _ when asked if
he was fretting over the 400-guest event at Mar-a-Lago. ``You just
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutka also is overseeing the private fireworks display behind a
Palm Beach mansion (''we're bringing a barge up the
Intracoastal''), and he's a consultant for the Young Friends of the
Red Cross ``Garden of Eden'' gala.
</P>
<P>
   About 750 revelers will attend the party, which will be held at
the International Pavilion in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go back to the beginning,'' said Meredith
Martin-Merritt, an American Red Cross special events manager,
referring to the theme. ``We have actors who'll be playing Adam and
Eve, and, well, they'll be appropriately dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, barely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there have been no takers for the Ritz-Carlton
``Ultimate Experience Package'' in Palm Beach, but the hotel has
sold one at its Cancun location.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if a hundred grand is too steep, you can always scale
down to the Ritz's ``Turn of the Century'' dinner and show
featuring comedienne Rita Rudner and the Powerhaus band.
</P>
<P>
   That's just $895 per person.
</P>
<P>
   And good news is, that includes the tip.

 &HT;     IN 1999, THE STARS WERE STILL THE CARS  
 &HT;     By JAMES G. COBB    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 1900 rolled around, the motorcar was a noisy, smelly
infant. Oldsmobile, the oldest surviving manufacturer in America
today, didn't build its first successful car until 1901. The Model
T was but a gleam in Henry Ford's 36-year-old eyes. Sport utilities
were buckboards pulled by old gray nags.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after transforming the century, the passenger car seems
endangered itself as trucks threaten to take over. But of the
vehicles I drove this year, the ones that stood out were mostly
cars.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the assessments in the following end-of-the-year
report card are thoroughly subjective, representing a personal view
on how close some 1999-2000 vehicles came to fulfilling their
potential:
</P>
<P>
   AUDI S4 ($38,425-$43,175) The graceful A4 is one of the great
sport sedans. What could go wrong by cramming in a twin-turbo V6
and stiffening the suspension to challenge the BMW M3? Just one
thing: The six-speed shifter is vague and rubbery and out of
character with this otherwise exhilarating car. B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   AUDI TT ($31,025-$36,170) After three decades of mostly
forgettable styling, auto design may be entering a new golden era.
Exhibit A: The stunning Machine Age architecture of the TT, which
will turn any garage into a sculpture garden. Inside, you marvel at
the attention to detail in the textures, materials and patterns.
One quandary: Should you drive it, or just sit and stare at it?
A-plus.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 750iL ($92,670-$97,270) If I were a dot-com zillionaire,
what would I drive on the nondigital superhighway? You can't do
much better than this V12 supercar; if you took Bill Gates to
lunch, even he'd be impressed. A.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC DeVILLE DTS ($45,370-$55,390) This old fogy has finally
emerged from the 1970s. The 2000 DeVille, particularly the
semisporty DTS, borrows freely from Mercedes and Lexus, yet it
feels distinctly American _ in the best sense. Ride, handling and
comfort are first-rate and the controls are the best GM has ever
offered. A.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET IMPALA ($19,350-$25,143) GM's engineers did their
part, giving Chevy's flagship a solid chassis, decent handling and
a supple ride. But the designers came up with a half-baked styling
exercise in which the pieces seem to belong to different cars, plus
an interior that whispers ``Hertz.'' My favorite Impala is still
the '65. B.
</P>
<P>
   FORD FOCUS ($12,280-$17,665) Agile and composed, comfortable and
spacious, the Focus does nearly everything well _ so well, in fact,
that it makes a sensible alternative to bigger cars costing $10,000
more. It is, hands-down, the best small car I've ever driven.
A-plus.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA INSIGHT ($19,295-$20,495) If alternative-fuel vehicles
ever find mainstream appeal, they must perform as well as
conventional cars at a comparable price. In local commuting,
Honda's odd gas-electric hybrid comes close, but it makes one
anxious in fast traffic and on steep hills. Still, Honda gets an A
for effort. B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA S2000 ($ The taped notes I made while driving this
racing-bred roadster weren't very useful, consisting mostly of
exclamations of glee. The small engine, which revs to an incredible
9,000 rpm, is almost impossibly powerful. The crisp six-speed stick
is the best I've ever shifted. The handling seems telekinetic. Like
a lovesick puppy, I can't get the S2000 out of my mind. A-plus.
</P>
<P>
   HYUNDAI ACCENT ($10,034-$12,752) For 2000, it's a little bigger,
a little faster, a little more substantial. Inside, there's more
Toyota and less Yugo. The price is right, and a 100,000-mile
warranty offers assurance. B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   ISUZU VEHICROSS ($29,595) Drive this weird sci-fi module through
Deming, N.M., and you might make The Weekly World News. (``Aliens
Invade in SUVs!'') The back seat is accessible only by Star Trek
transporter and the visibility isn't much better than a bomb
shelter's. C-minus.
</P>
<P>
   JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE ($27,105-$37,735) After two Grand Cherokees
of my own, an axle failure cooled my ardor; there have been
numerous reports of drivetrain problems on new models. Furthermore,
the driving position is now oddly uncomfortable. I'll sit this one
out. C-plus.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN LS ($31,475-$39,935) This is not Detroit's first attempt
to build a luxury touring sedan in the European tradition, but by
virtually cloning BMW's 5-Series it is the first to get it right.
The LS's road manners are surprisingly good, thanks to a rigid,
German-tight chassis. American luxury cars will never be the same.
A.
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ S500 ($78,445-$98,050) The ride and handling are
perfectly balanced and the big V8 is a dream. But the audio,
climate and navigation systems, plus the phone, are controlled by a
maddeningly complex video screen. Who wants to spend $90,000 for a
car that makes you feel stupid? A.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI GALANT ($17,792-$23,117) A spirited, stylish
alternative to the Accord and Camry, and a relative bargain to
boot. No wonder Galants seem to be everywhere around New York, hip
young people at the wheel. A-minus.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN MAXIMA ($21,569-$30,261) The 2000 Maxima is smooth,
polished and powerful, with attention to detail that some luxury
cars should imitate. A-minus.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN XTERRA ($19,269-$26,392) What was the last Nissan to have
buyers lining up? This back-to-basics S.U.V. is stylish and honest,
though the cabin is dressed in dollar-store materials, the engines
are plodding and the handling is unimpressive even by truck
standards. A fair deal at $20,000, but hardly worth the $5,000
premiums that some dealers are charging. B.
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI GRAND VITARA ($18,749-$23,149) This puppy is eager to
please, and it's a nicer pet than the defunct Sidekick. But its V6
is sluggish, its cargo space is minimal and its quirks _ the rear
door opens on the wrong side for American streets _ diminish its
appeal. C.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA ECHO ($10,750-$14,291) Did somebody at Toyota stand up
and say, ``Hey, let's build the world's ugliest car!''? Whatever,
the Echo is roomy and comfortable, rides smoothly and quietly and
performs nicely until challenged. I like this odd duck best from
the driver's seat; sitting there, you don't have to look at it. B.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA TUNDRA ($15,475-$31,516) The most polished pickup yet,
the Tundra feels like a Lexus that can haul logs. Its V8 is a
scorcher; its handling is of passenger-car caliber. Unfortunately,
the long-cab version can't match the spacious accommodations of GM
trucks. A-minus.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN JETTA ($17,225-$26,165) Dom Perignon tastes on a
Rolling Rock budget? Here is a solid German sth impeccable
engineering, supportive seats and great road manners. If it makes
you feel better, you can glue a three-pointed star to the hood.
A-minus.

 &HT;     FOUR KEY INGREDIENTS THAT MAKE THE CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 UNDATED: hood. A-minus.   &HT;     By MICHELLE KREBS    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creating a best-of-class car or truck isn't so different from a
master chef's development of a signature dish that thrills the
critics and lights up the reservations line. Certain key
ingredients are essential in just the right measure. All the pieces
must come together in the right quantities at the right time.
Handsome presentation is a plus.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes for my favorite vehicles include a good amount of
horsepower, a dash of responsive handling, a comfortable ride and,
as icing on the cake, an attractive design. It is not so easy to
find all those attributes in the right amounts in the trucks and
sport utility vehicles that the public is gobbling up. So, once
again, it's the cars that get the highest grades in this annual
review of some of the vehicles I've tested this year:
</P>
<P>
   AUDI A6 AVANT ($37,425-$45,000) Add the cargo capacity of a
wagon to the classy styling, comfortable ride, precise steering and
responsive handling of the A6 sedan. Order Quattro all-wheel drive
for sure-footed traction in bad weather, and you have most of the
advantages of a sport utility in a vehicle that is lighter, more
nimble and more comfortable than any SUV on the road. A.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 5-SERIES SPORT WAGONS ($41,270-$60,000) Life seems to be
speeding up, and these BMW wagons are among the few family haulers
that can keep pace. They also have features to keep your precious
cargo safe, including standard side air bags, head-protection bags
and emergency braking assistance. A.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET TAHOE ($25,604-$41,721) For 2000, the Tahoe shifts
from the old C/K pickup truck platform to the much improved
architecture of the Chevy Silverado. The new Tahoe handles more
responsively and rides more comfortably. Inside, there is now a
third-row seat and side air bags. B.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE NEON ($12,970-$16,000) The Neon has shed its cute baby
face for a handsome, grown-up profile. Under the hood, though, it's
still a raucous adolescent. It is also disappointing that the Neon
_ the first small car with two standard air bags and optional
antilock brakes _ doesn't offer side air bags. B.
</P>
<P>
   FORD EXCURSION ($34,160-$44,905) Consider the statistics: 19
feet long; 6 feet, 9 inches tall; 8 feet, 9 inches wide, counting
the mirrors; 167 feet to a stop from 60 mph; less than 10 miles to
the gallon. And even though the Excursion seats nine with scads of
cargo space, it is ridiculously over the top for almost everyone.
D.
</P>
<P>
   FORD EXPLORER SPORT ($22,225-$25,245) The popularity of this
short, two-door Explorer, especially among young women, is lost on
me. Getting in is awkward and the seats are painful. The ride is so
harsh that only a young physique can tolerate the wear and tear. D.
</P>
<P>
   FORD TAURUS ($18,245-$25,000) Ford has decided the Taurus need
not be a style-setter, and the 2000 model stresses all-American
virtues of function and safety. Adjustable pedals help short
drivers to move away from the air bag; sensors decide which air
bags should deploy, at what instant and with how much force. And
the trunk has grown significantly. B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   FORD WINDSTAR ($20,420-$31,120) This minivan would rate an
A-plus if only the Honda Odyssey wasn't even better. The Windstar
performs well and has extra utility with two sliding doors (one,
power-operated). I the government's top safety rating, and
offers reverse sensors that warn of objects to the rear. But it is
noisy and its traditional, removable third seat is less handy than
Honda's folding variety. A.
</P>
<P>
   HYUNDAI SONATA ($15,434-$21,252) A redesign for 1999 makes this
midsize Korean sedan much more competitive. The new version is
handsome and has safety features like side air bags. The reasonable
price and 100,000-mile warranty help to compensate for a lack of
oomph and tacky fake-wood trim. B.
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI I30 ($29,990-$34,859) Nissan's luxury division is
slowly returning to its high-performance roots. The new I30,
derived from the Maxima, is thoroughly competent. Too bad the
styling isn't more distinctive. B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR S-TYPE ($43,095-$56,900) If Jaguar ran a shoe store, the
XK8 would be stilettos and the S-Type would be classic, sensible
pumps, ideal for everyday wear. Its designers rummaged through the
closet and pulled out all the classic Jaguar touches. A.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR XKR ($77,395-$84,795) The XKR has the same
take-your-breath-away beauty and sumptuous accommodations as the
XK8, plus a lot of extra power from a supercharged V8. Who could
ask for anything more? A-plus.
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA MPV ($20,475-$30,000) This van now has front drive,
blend-into-the crowd styling and two sliding doors. Its compact
size is a drawback except in crowded urban areas, and it loses
points for a lack of power and a harsh transmission. C-plus.
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC BONNEVILLE ($24,310-$34,675) While Pontiac has done a
great job of carving out a distinct image, it lost me _ a former
Bonneville owner _ along the way. The 2000 model's overdone body
cladding and garish dashboard put it on the flashy end of the
boy-racer scale. C.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER SERAPH ($216,400-$300,000) Hand-stitched
Connolly leather smothers the interior and Wilton carpets tempt you
to go barefoot. But is it worth the price, which can soar to
$300,000 with options like a Wedgwood tea set and armrest bottle
cooler? Certainly not, although nothing else has the status of a
Rolls. B.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN L-SERIES ($15,450-$24,135) By far the best Saturns yet,
these midsize models are surprisingly fun to drive. A new
four-cylinder engine feels more powerful than the numbers imply;
the V6 is tried and true. B.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN 3-DOOR COUPE ($12,975-$20,850) Necessity is the mother of
invention, and a rather simple innovation _ a small extra door on
the driver's side _ has breathed new life into the sadly dated
S-Series lineup. B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   SUBARU LEGACY ($19,690-$28,000) Why mess with a winning formula?
Subaru has redone the Legacy for 2000, with a stiffer structure to
improve ride and handling. But it kept the core traits that make
all-wheel-drive Subarus so popular in snowy climates. B-plus.
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA AVALON ($25,650-$35,000) The quirky styling of this
restyled 2000 model suggests an identity crisis, but the quiet
six-passenger cabin imitates big American cars. It may be the best
Buick that money can buy. B.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO S40/V40 ($23,475-$29,952) Volvo figures that there is a
market for Accord and Camry buyers who want more luxury. But I'd be
tempted to stay within the family, opting for an Acura or a Lexus.
C-plus.

 &HT;    Despite notoriety, New Year's DUIs trail other holidays
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Don't Drink and Drive.'' It's become
the addendum to ``Happy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   And the warning apparently has had a sobering effect on the
holiday symbolized by the uncorked champagne bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In 1998, more people in Palm Beach County were
charged with driving under the influence on Earth Day (28) than on
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day (a total of 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think that all the media attention given to
the campaign against drinking and driving over all these years has
made the difference,'' said Lt. Pembrook Burrows of the Florida
Highway Patrol in Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   While the message may have influenced local New Year's Eve
revelers, it seems to have made less of an impact on those inclined
to quaff a beer or two on other holidays. You're much more likely
to encounter a drunken driver on the Labor Day and Memorial Day
weekends than during the Christmas and New Year holidays _ if DUI
arrests can be used as an indicator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the most recent year for which data is available, 73
people were charged with DUI in the county during the Labor Day
weekend. Police charged 53 people with DUI during the Memorial Day
weekend. On Christmas Eve and Christmas, officers charged 25 people
with DUI.
</P>
<P>
   Countywide, law enforcement officers charged 3,335 people with
DUI in 1998, according to a computer database maintained by the
sheriff's office, which books all of those charged. The Palm Beach
Post examined the database and found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost 30 percent _ 973 people _ live between Southern
Boulevard and Hypoluxo Road. Geographically, these neighborhoods
are located in the heart of Sheriff's Office District 1, which
assigns three squad cars to do nothing but stop drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revitalization of downtown (West Palm Beach) attracts a
lot of people, and don't get me wrong because I think that's a good
thing, but a lot of those people drive through our district to get
home,'' said Deputy Greg Croucher, who led all officers in the
county in making DUI arrests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one-third refused to submit to tests that determine
blood-alcohol levels. Refusing the test robs prosecutors of one
hard piece of evidence. But the strategy has its negative sides,
said criminal defense attorney Burt Winkler.
</P>
<P>
   First, a prosecutor is allowed to tell a jury that the defendant
refused the test. Furthermore, the person who refuses the test
faces an almost certain license suspension for one year and is
ineligible for a hardship license that allows driving to work for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed bag,'' Winkler said. ``In casual conversations, I
think most lawyers will advise you to refuse the test because most
times a person will blow at least a .08 (percent blood-alcohol
level). But from a practical standpoint, people in South Florida
rely on their cars. Are you willing to do 90 days' hard suspension,
which means no driving for any purpose?'' Anyone with a .08 percent
or higher cannot legally drive in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   _ 102 of those charged with DUI were driving with suspended or
revoked licenses. A new state law, effective Saturday, allows
police to seize the vehicles of drunken drivers who are caught
driving on a license suspended for a prior DUI conviction.
</P>
<P>
   _ 48 people were charged despite registering less than .08
percent blood-alcohol levels. A low test result might suggest drug
use, police say. Or it's possible that the suspect ``sobers up''
during the time between the arrest and the test, said Mike
Edmondson, spokesman for the State Attorney's Office. Will
prosecutors press ahead with such cases? ``Yes we will,'' Edmondson
said. They'll rely on videotaped evidence and the testimony of the
arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1,041 cases in which blood-alcohol test results were
entered into the database, more than half of the people charged
registered levels of at least two times the legal limit.
Ninety-four people recorded levels at least three times the legal
limit.
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, once every four days, a driver was charged with
DUI after being involved in a traffic accident. And accident
prevention is the point of strict enforcement of DUI laws, Croucher
said. ``The biggest thing we're trying to do is keep people from
getting hurt or hurting someone else.''

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Nov. 14, The Gulf Times in the Middle Eastern
emirate of Qatar published a glowing profile of a young
Karachi-born financial entrepreneur named Mohammad Ali Khan, who
had returned to invest in his native land after ``a highly
successful career'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come back to Pakistan hoping to provide solutions, on
the basis of my firsthand experience, in the areas where the
country is lacking,'' the article quoted Khan as saying. It went on
to describe him as a man who had made millions as ``the proud owner
of the first fully Muslim-owned investment bank on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan, 35, was also credited with founding a profitable holding
company, U.S. Financial Group, whose board of directors ``included
11 top business leaders of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the youngest chairman and founder of an investment bank in
America,'' the dazzled reporter added, ``his accomplishments are a
little more than extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, in a way, perhaps they are.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever else he is, Khan is a fugitive from justice in New
York, where state prosecutors accused him last spring of stealing
millions of dollars from several of his brokerage firm's customers
_ including some who also happened to be members of the Gambino
organized crime family. The Gambino customers, one of whom is in
federal prison, have expressed their annoyance by filing a lawsuit
against the absent financier and one of his top brokers.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Financial Group? Supposedly a diversified corporate
empire, it apparently existed only in an inch-thick stack of paper
that Khan filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
SEC subsequently sued him, accusing him of ``vastly overstating''
his business operations in those documents and others he used to
raise money from investors and attract support from business
leaders, including the former chief executive of Kmart and a top
executive at Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have filed a criminal
complaint against Khan, accusing him of committing securities fraud
by using lies and exaggerations to entice at least 55 people to
invest nearly $3 million in his brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is the plight of the Gambinos that makes Khan's
story so intriguing. It is not unusual these days for organized
crime figures to stand accused of manipulating sales of speculative
penny stocks. But how could Joseph and Thomas F. Gambino _
themselves such experienced criminals _ have found themselves, as
they contend in their lawsuit, the marks in just such a swindle?
Their court complaint offers an explanation that surely resonates
with penny-stock victims everywhere: They had ``a relationship of
trust'' with their broker.
</P>
<P>
   And that trust, the Gambinos contend, was betrayed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BEGINNING: An Elusive Broker At a Small Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Khan's difficulties with the Gambino family arose from their
dealings with Klein Maus &AMP; Shire, the tiny brokerage firm he opened
in early 1995 in an impressive suite of offices on the 24th floor
of 110 Wall St. in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   People who worked there knew him as Ali Khan and described him
as an attractive young man, slim and small, wiious manners,
silk shirts and European-cut suits. Born in Pakistan, he told
people that he had lived in the United States since he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   He was an intuitive listener. ``He was so sharp at picking up
exactly the right button to push with each person,'' said one
executive who knew him. But his attention to business was erratic,
said veterans of the firm, and he would sometimes disappear for
months, staying in touch through calls to his wife's brother, Asim
Kohli, the firm's young and inexperienced operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Among the brokers Khan recruited to his little firm was Maurice
Gross, , known as Mike. Gross, now 68, is a big, dark-haired man
who worked for more than a dozen years at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York
before joining Klein Maus in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At Gruntal, Gross built up a fat list of clients that included
members of the Gambino family. Thomas F. Gambino, who is serving a
five-year prison term arising from a federal racketeering
conviction in 1993, and his wife, Frances, were clients. So were a
brother and a sister-in-law, Joseph and Arlene Gambino, and Thomas
C. Gambino, a son of Thomas F. Gambino.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph and Thomas F. Gambino pleaded guilty to state antitrust
violations and paid $12 million in fines and restitution in 1992 to
settle charges that they illegally controlled intra-city trucking
service in New York City's garment industry. They are the sons of
the late Carlo Gambino, who founded the extended crime family that
was later run by the now-imprisoned John J. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at Gruntal, Gross lost a number of arbitration
cases brought by customers who accused him of making unauthorized
trades in their accounts, according to public records maintained by
the North American Securities Administrators Association, although
that does not seem to have worried members of the Gambino clan.
Indeed, their decision to follow Gross to Klein Maus &AMP; Shire in
1997 was ``a reflection of the trust that had developed'' between
them and their broker over the years, according to their subsequent
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gross nor his lawyer responded to numerous requests for
comment on the case, nor have they filed any response to the
Gambinos' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gabriel Bernaschina, a former executive at Klein
Maus &AMP; Shire, Khan was encouraged to hire Gross by ``a lovely old
Italian gentleman, a retired vaudeville performer who lived in
Hoboken and was a dear friend of Ali's.'' He knew the elderly
friend only as ``Vic,'' Bernaschina said. Thus it was that the
investment affairs of a fairly demanding branch of the Gambino
family fell into the hands of a flimsy little brokerage firm whose
standards and ethical practices were policed by the ambitious but
haphazard Khan. &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY: Second Looks At a Resume &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Klein Maus &AMP; Shire may seem an odd name for a Muslim-owned
investment bank. But the name had a certain logic.
</P>
<P>
   Khan explained to an early recruit that the firm's first name
was chosen by his wife _ in homage to her favorite fashion
designer, Calvin Klein. ``Maus,'' Khan said, honored a Dutch lawyer
who had given him his first job in the securities business;
``Shire'' was part of the name of a London brokerage firm where
Khan had gotten his start, the new recruit was told.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that story might be true, of course. But the employment
history that Khan was required to file with American regulators
when he obtained his broker's license does not list any employment
in London. Nor did he mention his London roots in discussing his
life story elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tariq Al-Rifai, a research consultant in Islamic
finance in Chicago, remembers being charmed by Khan when they first
met in the early summer of 1997: ``I was very impressed by his
story _ how he had come here to go to college, starting with
nothing and driving a taxi as a student, and then made his money by
building up a chain of video stores, which he sold off to finance
his move into the investment side.''
</P>
<P>
   The resume that Khan submitted to regulators, however, states
only that he had worked for two years at a video rental store while
he was a student at Rutgers University between 1985 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   No video store fortune was mentioned in the documents Khan
circulated as he tried to raise money for Klein Maus and, later,
for U.S. Financial Group. But he did claim that he had earned a
degree in finance and economics from Rutgers and boast that he had
received ``the Financial Times of Karachi award'' in 1994. Khan
acknowledged later, in interviews with regulators, that he never
earned a Rutgers degree. And while Karachi's newsstands carry The
Financial Post and The Times of Karachi, there is no trace of a
``Financial Times of Karachi.''
</P>
<P>
   While still in school, where he met his future wife, Khan worked
for a few months as a trainee at Magyar Savings Bank in North
Brunswick, N.J., according to one regulatory filing he made; after
graduation, he worked for more than a year selling insurance
products at a Prudential Insurance Co. office in Woodbridge, N.J.,
other records show.
</P>
<P>
   His Wall Street career began in February 1990, when he went to
work as a broker at South Richmond Securities, a now-defunct
brokerage firm with a beefy file of customer complaints. By
September 1991, after three months at another small firm, he had
landed at yet a third troubled firm, Barrett Day Securities. There,
he helped sell the cheap but high-risk microcap stocks that were
the firm's bread-and-butter business, until Barrett Day's
regulatory problems led to the firm's collapse in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In various resumes he later showed to potential investors, Khan
summarized these penny-stock experiences as employment ``at two New
York-based international investment banking firms.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE EXPANSION: A Brokerage Firm Appears to Thrive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1995, Khan began recruiting the management team for a
brokerage firm of his own, hiring a compliance officer and chief
trader from Barrett Day. He also approached Bernaschina, then at
another small retail brokerage firm, offering him the job of chief
financial officer over lunch at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very persuasive,'' Bernaschina said. ``He said he was
going to open up a branch office in Dubai _ that he had a prime
location, and prime prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Klein Maus &AMP; Shire was gaining customers and something
akin to credibility, at least among the lawyers, brokers and
accountants who operate on the fringes of the penny-stock world and
cater to small companies trying to sell stock to the public for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Three small Canadian companies signed on to sell stock through
Khan's firm on the strength of their accountant's recommendation,
executives at those firms said. The accountant, Gerald Goldberg of
the Toronto office of Schwartz Levitsky Feldman, said he had been
introduced to Khan and his brokerage firm by Greg Sichensia, a New
York lawyer ``with whom we do a lot of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sichensia, in response to a query about his dealings with Khan,
said his firm ``had an office policy of never talking to any
reporters about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Goldberg and executives at the companies who dealt
with Khan all remember him as being impressive, if difficult to
reach by telephone. ``He told us he handled the finances for some
major Middle Eastern people,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm certainly seemed prosperous. On a Saturday early in
December 1996, Khan arranged for a fleet of limousines to carry his
entire staff and their dates _ more than 50 people _ to a sumptuous
black-tie Christmas party at Caesars Atlantic City. There was an
open bar, a band for dancing, envelopes of cash for gambling at the
casino's tables _ all at company expense.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, according to one former adviser, Khan was wearing
$3,000 suits and offering to fly guests to the Super Bowl in New
Orleans _ ``with box seats, a private jet, the works.''
</P>
<P>
   That May, he was invited to participate in a Harvard conference
on Islamic banking and financial matters _ he sent a senior
executive instead _ and he attended a banking conference in
Bahrain, winning a small mention in some newspaper accounts of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   As he traveled more often to the Middle East, trying to raise
money from foreign investors, Khan talked more about opening a
branch office in Dubai. One young executive at the firm actually
sold his home, put his furniture in storage and moved his family in
with relatives in anticipation of a promised transfer to the Middle
East, according to Bernaschina. But a Dubai office was never
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, Khan was introduced to Joseph Antonini,
the former chief executive of Kmart. Antonini had joined race-car
driver Mario Andretti in the formation of the Andretti Wine Group,
a small vintner that makes wines under Andretti's label.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the SEC, the company, whose
shares trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, had engaged Klein Maus as
its investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Antonini declined to discuss his dealings with Khan, and others
associated with the winemaker did not return numerous calls. A
spokeswoman for the company said that the deals that gave rise to
the investment banking relationship were never consummated.
</P>
<P>
   Neverthel May 1998, when Khan filed the SEC documents for
U.S. Financial Group, Antonini was listed as a director, along with
Leonard Yablon, executive vice president and chief financial
officer of Forbes Inc., which publishes Forbes and other magazines.
The Andretti Wine spokeswoman said Antonini, like others on the
list, had ``indicated he had potential interest in serving on the
board of the new company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, this interest was dependent upon the outcome of due
diligence, as well as SEC approval,'' she said. ``To Antonini's
knowledge, the SEC never approved this filing. The board has never
met or played any type of role in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Yablon did not respond to messages left at his New York office.
It was in February 1997 that a Gambino family accountant named
Joseph Gluckman first noticed some disturbing activity in his
clients' accounts at Klein Maus &AMP; Shire.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Thomas F. Gambino and his family contend in a
lawsuit filed in New York state courts that Gluckman immediately
faxed a letter to Gross, their broker at Klein Maus, challenging
the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is going on?'' Gluckman demanded. ``I opened the
last reports and found a dozen off-the-wall trades. You know Tom
only gets investments in quality bonds. Please reverse or sell all
these trades immediately. Call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the lawsuit asserts, Gross had used money
generated by the Gambinos' income-producing bonds to buy stock in a
tiny young company called American Champion, which owns, among
other things, a pair of San Francisco karate studios.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Gross repeatedly promised Gluckman
that the trades were ``mistakes'' and would be corrected. Instead,
he ``accelerated the pace of the unauthorized trading'' in the
Gambinos' accounts, the lawsuit says, filling their portfolios with
shares of American Champion and other microcap stocks whose prices
had been manipulated by Klein Maus.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the lawsuit accuses Klein Maus of manipulating the
prices through sham trades among numerous controlled accounts,
after which the inflated stocks were sold into the accounts of
unsuspecting customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckman continued to protest these investments and demand that
they be corrected, the lawsuit says. ``We don't gamble,'' the suit
says he told Gross at one point. ``Get the h--- out now.'' In July
1998, the lawsuit says, he even threatened to report Gross to the
SEC. But after Gross promised yet again to reverse the disputed
trades, the accountant did not carry out his threat, according to
the lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DENOUEMENT: The Collapse Of a Little Empire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The SEC nonetheless found its way to Klein Maus &AMP; Shire's
offices on Wall Street. By early that September, according to court
records, SEC lawyers were interviewing Khan under oath about the
activities of Klein Maus and his efforts to raise money for U.S.
Financial Group. Yet he continued his efforts to get an initial
public offering for U.S. Financial Group off the ground, repeatedly
amending his corporate filings with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gross, by January 1999 he no longer even returned
Gluckman's telephone calls, according to the Gambinos' lawsuit. And
within a month, the little empire on the 24th floor at 110 Wall St.
was starting to unravel. Without Klein Maus' support, the prices of
the stocks that the firm had been hawking to its customers were
collapsing, and regulators were circling.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point, according to New York State Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer, that Khan tried to move nearly $2 million in
funds from various customer accounts _ including those of Thomas F.
and Frances Gambino _ to an account in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by customer complaints, Spitzer and the firm's clearing
broker were able to reverse the transfer, and the money was
returned to the customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, federal investigators obtained a search warrant for
the premises occupied by Klein Maus &AMP; Shire; by March 17, the firm,
penniless, had closed its doors.
</P>
<P>
   By April 23, in an action filed under seal, Spitzer's office had
obtained an indictment from a Manhattan grand jury charging Khan
with five counts of second-degree grand larceny arising from the
attempted Dubai transfers, along with a warrant for his arrest.
Less than later, Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, also obtained an indictment of the financier, accusing
him of committing securities fraud in connection with the sale of
$2.7 million of his brokerage firm's own preferred shares between
April 1996 and June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And on May 3, the SEC filed its civil complaint against Khan,
Klein Maus &AMP; Shire, U.S. Financial Group and Kohli, accusing them
of securities fraud in connection with efforts to raise money for
U.S. Financial Group between July 1997 and January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time all the various legal agencies were ready to
arrest him, Khan had disappeared with his wife and two young sons,
leaving Gross and Kohli, his wife's brother, to face the
consequences of the firm's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Gambinos is seeking a court order to allow the
family to seize any profits that Gross realizes on the sale of his
2,500-square-foot home about six miles from the new home of
President and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Chappaqua. Neither the
lawyer, Peter Raymond, nor the Gambinos would comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kohli is ``vigorously defending'' himself against the SEC
charges and ``denies the allegations,'' said his lawyer, Richard
Blumberg of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As for Khan, he is facing trial if he is apprehended, and up to
15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the Gulf Times interview, however, those bleak
prospects have not appreciably diminished the optimism and
enthusiasm that were the foundation of his brief Wall Street career
in America.  &QL;

APPEALS COURT CANCELS EXECUTION OF MENTALLY RETARDED MAN &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal appeals court canceled next month's
scheduled execution of Johnny Paul Penry to consider, among other
legal arguments, whether his death sentence should be overturned
because he is mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Penry was scheduled to die Jan. 13 for the 1979
rape and murder of Pamela Moseley Carpenter, a 22-year-old
Livingston, Texas, housewife. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals postponed indefinitely Penry's execution
so arguments could be made on the legal issues in the case.
Arguments are scheduled before a three-judge panel on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost issue _ according to his lawyers, human rights
organizations and advocates for the mentally retarded _ is whether
Penry should be executed, given his limited mental capacity. During
his 1990 trial, defense attorneys said Penry scored 63 on an IQ
test, which placed him in the range of mild mental retardation.
Penry's younger sister, Sally Belinda Potts of Houston, said Penry
has ``the mind of a 7 year old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should be in a place for the mentally retarded,
either that or he should get life in prison,'' Potts said Thursday.
``But I don't think he should be put to death. ... My opinion is he
didn't do the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice now, juries have disagreed with Potts. Penry was convicted
first in 1980, then again in 1990, of Carpenter's savage murder.
Carpenter was raped, beaten so severely that one of her kidney's
burst, and was stabbed with a pair of scissors. After the attack,
Carpenter managed to telephone a friend and describe her assailant.
She died hours later at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Carpenter's description, authorities zeroed in on
Penry, who had been paroled from prison two months before for a
1977 rape conviction. Police said Penry confessed to them verbally
and in writing. Penry now denies committing the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Penry's first conviction in
1988 because jurors were not told of his retardation. During a
second trial in 1990, the jury learned of his limited mental
capacity. But in legal briefs filed with the federal appeals court,
defense attorneys John Wright of Huntsville, Texas, and Robert
Smith of New York contend that jurors did not hear enough about
Penry's background.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal is based on a lot of issues. One of them is the
claim that executing mentally retarded people is unconstitutional
in light of the present state of society's general understanding,''
Smith said. ``The Supreme Court held otherwise 10 years ago (in
Penry's first appeal), but we say things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Wright also contend that the jury should have been
told that Penry likely would not have been paroled had he received
a life sentence rather than death. Also, they argue that Penry's
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was violated when
he was ordered to speak to a psychiatrist, who later testified for
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity County District Attorney Joe Price, who prosecuted Penry
in both cases, said his opinion about the case has not changed in
20 years. Price said he does not believe Penry is mentally
retarded. And even if he is, he still deserves to die for the
crime, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say mentally retarded, I think of the Down syndrome
type of person. Obviously, I'm opposed to (executing someone like
that), as most people are,'' Price said. ``In the Penry case, if he
is mentally retarded, he's in the high range. You should allow the
jury to focus on each individual case.''
</P>
<P>
   Penry's case is often cited by human rights groups, such as
Amnesty International and advocates for the mentally retarded. The
Texas Legislature last year voted down a bill that would have
prohibited the execution of a mentally retarded killer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Storming a shabby Brooklyn apartment block at dawn on
Thursday, a black-clad antiterrorist task force seized a man they
alleged was an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian charged
with trying to smuggle powerful explosives and four sophisticated
timing devices across the border near Seattle two and a half weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man arrested on Thursday, identified as Abdel Ghani, a
31-year-old Algerian, traveled to Seattle earlier this month to
meet with Ressam as part of an elaborate Islamic terrorist bomb
plot, federal authorities said. But their role in the plan was
foiled when Ressam, nervous, suddenly bolted off a ferry at the
border when a Customs Service agent looked in the trunk of his car,
the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani was arrested on a day that agents from the FBI fanned out
to question, and in some cases detain, Algerian immigrants in
several cities. In Vermont, federal prosecutors said that a
Canadian woman arrested while crossing the border with another
Algerian man was linked to Ressam. In successfully arguing that the
woman be kept in federal detention, prosecutors said that Ressam
and the Canadian, Lucia Garafolo, were friends of Said Atmani,
identified in court papers as a member of the Armed Islamic Group,
`'a violent Algerian terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents acknowledged privately that they hoped the sweep
would serve as a warning or a deterrent to potential terrorists. In
Boston, federal officials arrested five men, one of whom fled from
his workplace, and officials chased him with guns drawn, but the
men were charged only with immigration violations, not with
anything related to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani was charged with helping Ressam's efforts to bring
explosives into the country with the intention of setting off a
bomb, and with trying to conceal his assistance. At a news
conference on Thursday night, however, Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant
director of the FBI in charge of the New York office, said
officials were not aware of any threat to a specific target in New
York City or elsewhere. He also noted that no explosives were found
in connection with the arrest of Ghani.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, federal law enforcement officials said they had
concluded that the Ghani and Ressam were part of a broad plot. They
speculated that because Ressam was caught in mid-December, he could
have been contemplating an attack close to New Year's, but
acknowledged that they had no evidence indicating that such an
attack had been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that yesterday's arrest did not mean the ring was
broken up. `'The most interesting thing is there are more,'' one
official involved in the investigation said. `'We know there are
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The question left unanswered was why the Armed Islamic Group
would plan a strike in the United States. The criminal complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Thursday said that
based on information from a confidential source, federal agents had
concluded that Ghani and another associate believed that ``Allah
will shake up this world, that a new generation will punish
America, and that Islam's renaissance will rise from Algeria.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint was based on an affidavit submitted by
Bradley S. Morrison, an FBI agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist
Task Force of the FBI and the New York Police Department. In it,
Morrison states that because this affidavit was intended only ``for
the limited purpose'' of establishing probable cause to arrest
Ghani, ``it does not include all the facts that have been learned
during the course of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint did offer a broad-brush image of the plot,
much of which, Morrison's affidavit suggest, was sloppily executed.
It recounts how Ghani left a trail of evidence, from fraudulent
credit card receipts to a destroyed plane ticket hastily dropped in
a Dumpster, as federal agents observed him and listened in through
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was carefully compartmentalized, according to the
criminal complaint, so that in case of an arrest, each person
involved would know only the tasks of two others. Ressam, was to
leave the car, with its cargo of bomb-making material and the keys,
in a parking lot, and someone else would drive it away. Then he and
Ghani were to go to Chicago and other places on a ``fund-raising''
mission, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam is believed to be part of a gangster-terrorist underworld
group that committed a series of armed robberies and shootouts with
the police in northern France and later set up a Canadian base in
Montreal, according to French antiterrorism investigators. The
French authorities say the organization grew out of the Armed
Islamic Group, part of a bloody insurgency in Algeria, and out of
Arab forces who fought on the Muslim side during the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani is to be formally charged with ``willfully and knowingly''
providing ``material support and resources'' for Ressam's attempt
to violate federal anti-explosives laws and concealing and
disguising his role, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he is being charged with credit card and bank fraud
in a series of schemes involving counterfeit credit and bank cards
and illicit bank withdrawals under the false name Eduardo Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mary Jo
White, said that, if convicted, Ghani could face up to 10 years in
prison on the charges of concealing material support of a terrorist
group, and up to 5 years on the fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   At first, four men, including Ghani, were held on Thursday after
the Joint Terrorist Task Force raid by FBI agents and the New York
City Police shortly after 6 a.m. in the Midwood section of
Brooklyn. Two were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The third, Najmeddine Houaichi, a 35-year-old Algerian, was
turned over to immigration authorities on charges that he was in
the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint filed against Ghani suggested that
however complex and sophisticated the alleged bomb plot might have
been, it's execution left something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, according to the complaint, was nervous at the
Washington state customs point because he did not speak English. He
ran off the ferry that had carried him in from Canada, chased by
customs agents, and was arrested after he tried, and failed, to get
into a passing car from the driver's side. In the trunk of Ressam's
car, Customs agents found four timing devices made from Casio
watches and 9-volt batteries and 193 pounds of various explosive
compounds, among them, officials say, a material known as RDX
(cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), widely used by military
demolitions experts.
</P>
<P>
   Also found on Ressam, according to the complaint, was a scrap of
paper bearing the name `'Ghani'' and a telephone number in the 718
area code. The telephone number was traced to 944 Newkirk Avenue in
Brooklyn, a three-story gray brick building with apartments on the
two upper floors and shops _ a laundry, an Afghan kebab restaurant
and a supermarket _ on the street level.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord of the building in the heavily Pakistani
neighborhood, Dr. Iftikhar Dim, said on Thursday that about three
months ago, two men named Najeem and Rashid who lived in one of the
top floor apartments asked him if a friend of theirs named Ghani
could move into a vacant apartment. He did so, Dim said, but did
not sign a lease.
</P>
<P>
   Having traced the phone, FBI agents began staking out the
building, watching Ghani come and go. On Dec. 21, the complaint
said, the agents watched as Ghani threw away several documents in a
Dumpster by a nearby supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Rummaging in the Dumpster, the agents found, torn in half, a
Delta Airlines ticket for a flight from Seattle to Kennedy
International Airport on Dec. 16. There was also a Fleet Bank
account statement in Ghani's false name of Eduardo Rocha that
showed four cash machine withdrawals in Seattle between Dec. 13 and
Dec. 15, three for $390 and one for $329.
</P>
<P>
   This led them to a hotel in the Seattle area, where they found
that a man giving the name Edward Rocha and the address 944 Newkirk
Avenue, Brooklyn, had checked in on Dec. 11 and out on Dec. 16. In
addition, a surveillance camera on one of the Seattle cash
machines, had a picture that matched the FBI surveillance photo
made of Ghani in Brooklyn, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency plans to arrest Ghani had been in place for days, a
law enforcement official said.

 &HT;    PEACH BOWL NOTEBOOK: Sherrill doesn't see payoff in playoff
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mississippi State coach Jackie Sherrill predicted more
than a decade ago that football's top level never would have a
playoff system. He stood by the statement again on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have one,'' Sherrill said. ``We will never
have a national playoff like we have in basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteenth-ranked Mississippi State (9-2) plays Clemson (6-5) at
7:30 p.m. today in the Peach Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will, either, because of the bowl system,''
Clemson coach Tommy Bowden interjected. ``The bowls have been a big
part of college football and very beneficial to the sport (over the
years). You'll have difficulty trying to implement the playoffs
with the bowl system we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I think there is a way. This year, I think you've got
the two best teams in the nation (Florida State and Virginia Tech)
playing _ last year, too. I think the Sagarin (computer) system is
very accurate. If you put in strength of schedule and all of that,
you are going to get No. 1 and No. 2. (Sagarin) has been in place
two years, and I think the best two teams have played the last two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill, who will be participating in the 13th bowl game of his
22-year head-coaching career, said the bowl games are not to blame
for a lack of a true playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy (Bowden) may be more politically correct than I am,''
Sherrill said. ``The problem is, you are not going to have the
(conference) commissioners, athletic directors and (school)
presidents give the money to the NCAA that they have given in
basketball (because) you can't survive any more if you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put any more people in Clemson Stadium, you can't
put any more at Michigan _ where they were $2 million in the red
last year. Football is maxed, and you are not going to give up
money that you generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Where does the money) generated by basketball go? It doesn't
go back to the university or the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill does have an idea for a better process to determine a
national championship game: All major colleges grouped into four
conferences, two teams playing for each conference championship,
and then the four conference winners entering a two-round playoff
system.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunion
</P>
<P>
   Bowden will be focusing heavily on recruiting next week, but he
will break away on Tuesday and take a flight to New Orleans to
watch his father's Florida State Seminoles play for the national
title in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the recruiting battles, the younger Bowden has beaten his
father, Bobby, for several high school recruits so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' Tommy Bowden said with a grin. ``The big
dog usually barks at night, and that is what usually happens'' when
he recruits against his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The top 11 scholar-athletes on both Mississippi State's and
Clemson's teams were honored Wednesday at a luncheon. . . . Both
teams spent the afternoon watching the NBA game at Philips Arena
between the Hawks and the Indiana Pacers.Michael Carvell writes for

IN NUCLEAR SECRETS CASE, JUDGE'S RULING ON BAIL BROUGHT LEVITY TO
QUICK END
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times even the most serious trials and hearings can feel like
football games, with palpable shifts in momentum.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident at the unusual three-day bail hearing in
Albuquerque this week for Wen Ho Lee, the government scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear weapons data.
</P>
<P>
   When an FBI counterintelligence agent tried to persuade a
skeptical judge that Lee had to remain isolated in jail because
even ``a simple utterance'' to a family member might be a signal
giving away the country's nuclear secrets, the courtroom, filled
with Lee's supporters, broke into titters. The derisive chortling
grew louder when the agent, Robert Messemer, added that Chinese,
Lee's native language, was suited to deception because of its
idiomatic character.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, James A. Parker of U.S. District Court, asked
questions suggesting that he would release Lee into some form of
restrictive home detention. And that seemed a foregone conclusion,
since Lee had been permitted to chat with his family and friends in
the courtroom and even inspected a box of laundry his daughter had
brought.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just as suddenly, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Parker concluded the hearing on Wednesday by denying bail to
Lee. The decision condemned him to perhaps a year in solitary
confinement until his trial on 59 counts of having improperly moved
a huge volume of nuclear secrets from secure computers onto
unsecure computers and computer tapes. Lee's cheerful visage turned
grim and his two grown children burst into tears as the judge
brought the hearings back to a grave consideration of national
security. Parker said his decision had turned not on the holes the
defense had punched in the government's case but on the unanswered
question of what Lee had done with seven missing computer tapes
that had contained much of the vast library of nuclear secrets he
had downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is present principally in the missing tapes,''
Parker said, backing the notion that if, by some chance, Lee could
slip them into enemy hands the global balance of power might be
altered.
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that if Lee could pass a lie detector test
showing that he had told the truth when he said he had destroyed
those tapes, bail would be reconsidered. But Lee had offered to
take such a test when he was arrested and indicted earlier this
month, and the government prosecutors had refused.
</P>
<P>
   The judge encouraged the government to give the test, but did
not order it, and the U.S. attorney expressed no enthusiasm for the
idea after the hearing ended.
</P>
<P>
   And so the short, slight, gray-haired Lee, a grandfatherly
figure in a dark suit, was hustled out of court. He has not been
charged with espionage, but he had still been called in this
hearing one of the greatest villains since the dawn of the nuclear
age. The hearing offered a series of such contrasts, underscoring
what a peculiar business designing weapons of mass destruction is.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard testimony from soft-spoken women and men who,
despite their homespun manner had spent their lives designing
sophisticated weapons that could kill millions of people in one
unimaginable flash. John Romero, a weapons designer in the top
secret X Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where Lee
worked, was surrounded by reporters after he testified and was
asked how he spelled his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're speaking to a person who knows what I know and that's
what you ask?'' he asked good-naturedly. He then indicated that for
the most part he was unable to talk about what he does to anyone,
except to say, as he had in one sobering moment on the witness
stand, that it was a solitary profession in which the scientists
received abstruse problems to work out on their own in cluttered
offices.
</P>
<P>
   And there were contrasts in the picture that emerged of Lee's
actions. The government tried to show that he had meticulously
worked around security precautions to move almost the entire
arsenal of nuclear weapons design and testing theory from secure
computers to unsecure computers, where hackers or others could gain
access, although there was no evidence that anyone had taken
advantage of that access.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's defense lawyers showed that, for all the vaunted security
measures in the lab's computer system, changing the status of files
took only a few keystrokes and the system did not keep logs of the
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the main defense contentions was that if Lee was
a spy, he was a bad one, since he had left damning evidence of his
actions in the open for up to six years. A security officer who
investigates unusual computer activity learned of Lee's actions
years ago and did not report them.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the efforts the defense made to undermine the
government's case, and the chortles the efforts sometimes drew,
what ultimately determined the outcome was the question of the
tapes. Why had Lee made them, when they seemed unrelated to his
work, and what had he done with them? Whether that is the issue on
which a trial turns remains to be seen, but it is the issue that
has handed Lee another solitary task to endure.

JAPAN DELAYS KEY ELEMENT OF BANK PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's ruling coalition has decided to postpone placing
a limit on government guarantees of bank deposits for another year,
dealing what many here called a major blow to overhauling the
nation's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, announced late Wednesday, overrules a previously
established timetable for the plan, which would have placed a
$97,700 limit on bank deposit guarantees starting April 1, 2001.
Currently, bank deposits are fully insured.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the timing of the announcement, which seemed intended to
draw a minimum of attention to the change, editorialists,
economists and banking industry experts criticized the measure as a
large and potentially disastrous step backward for this country's
efforts to restore health to the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the first time the three-party coalition has
overturned already decided-upon policies for the sake of
elections,'' read an editorial Thursday in the country's leading
financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun. ``We are weary of them
losing sight of the big picture for short-term interests. If there
is turmoil in the financial sector, it will be the responsibility
of the coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks continue to struggle under huge amounts of
nonperforming loans, which economists say are a result in part of
the system of deposit guarantees, which for years has allowed small
or inefficient banks to avoid serious restructuring or closing.
</P>
<P>
   The changes that were postponed were expected to set off a
flight of depositors from the country's weakest banks toward
stronger, more solvent institutions.
</P>
<P>
   By delaying the measures, members of the ruling coalition were
reportedly overruling the advice of the country's ministry of
finance, as well as the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they emphasized concerns about the so-called
cooperative banks, perhaps the least competitive sector in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and let
them get back onto a stable footing, improvement is necessary for a
portion of the financial sector,'' said Shizuka Kamei, chairman of
the Policy Research Council of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
``There it was appropriate to freeze the start of the payoff system
for another year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's 289 co-op banks account for barely 2 percent of the
country's private banking assets, and many critics say that to put
off badly needed changes to shield such a small community of
industry laggards has no justification in economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many offered political explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's three-party coalition, which formed the country's latest
government in early October, has been widely unpopular from its
inception. By law, it must hold new national elections by next
October, and with the economic recovery here still tentative at
best, many critics say the government wishes to avoid bad political
news like small-business bankruptcies, bank failures and corporate
layoffs at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the government has approved a series of loan
guarantees for small businesses. In doing so, rather than letting
them fail, it has extended hundreds of billions of dollars of new
credit guarantees to thousands of small and medium-size enterprises
that are often either unprofitable or badly in need of
reorganization, but rich in votes.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts say that the delay could reduce investor
confidence in the direction of the country's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any hope on the part of the government that
people would not notice this in their year-end rush to vacations,
they will be badly disappointed,'' said Robert A. Feldman, chief
economist with Morgan Stanley Japan. ``This will be on every
investor's lips on Jan. 4, when the markets reopen. The worry is
that investors who have bought Japan in the last year will reach
the conclusion that this country is not serious about imposing
discipline on the use of capital.''

SEXISM OR SUCCESS: EITHER WAY, IT'S THE SINGAPORE GIRL'S TIME TO
SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Seductively prim in her snug sarong and sandaled
feet, she has been the epitome of airborne Asian hospitality for 27
years, an object of feminist ire and a primary reason her employer
has vaulted to the forefront of the global aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   She is Singapore Girl. Hear her roar.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Singapore Airlines, which made a mascot of its
attentive stewardess in 1972 and turned her into a marketing icon,
said it would pay 600 million pounds, or $967 million, in cash for
a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic, the carrier owned by the
Virgin Group of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, if regulators approve, the two airlines will
share passengers, joining two companies known for pampering
customers. It is a direct challenge to Virgin's archrival, British
Airways, giving each partner the ability to fly passengers, if they
so choose, from California around the world to New York, with
stopovers across Eurasia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   For Singapore Airlines, the investment represents the end of a
long search to expand its route network, which included failed
attempts to buy into four other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   How a flag carrier with no domestic routes and a home market of
slightly more than 3 million people has managed to grow so large
and have so much money, analysts say, can be partly attributed to a
management that has never reported a loss and carries no debt.
</P>
<P>
   But equally important has been the airline's ability to parlay
its image into an award-winning global reputation for service and
safety that travelers are willing to pay a premium to enjoy. ``The
Singapore Girl thing is not strictly PC these days,'' said Wendy
Wong, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. ``It's just very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines was born in 1972, when it split from
Malaysia-Singapore Airlines. Faced with more established rivals
with more modern fleets, the airline focused on service. Its first
advertisement pictured a stewardess next to the tag line, ``This
girl's in love with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the air hostesses traded skirts and blouses for the
equivalent of a Malay evening gown, a blue sarong kebaya, each
tailored to fit so closely they have been known to split open
during flights. The airline adopted a new slogan: ``Singapore Girl,
you're a great way to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the outfit and slogan have changed little. These
days, the Singapore Girl appears not just in the cabin, but mincing
in the countryside on TV, complete with her own theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of guts to stick with a strategy of promoting
service when other airlines are moving to something more
functional,'' said Theodore Cho, deputy managing director at
Monsoon Advertising in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore Girl was the brainchild of Ian Batey, a Briton who
moved to Sydney, Australia, in 1948 and then to Singapore in 1969
and who runs Batey Ads Ltd., Singapore's largest ad agency. The
agency, which sold a 37 percent stake to WPP Group last year, has
handled the airline's account since 1972. The airline spends more
than 80 million Singapore dollars, or $48 million, a year on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Batey was not available for comment, and the agency executive in
charge of the Singapore Airlines account declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse the airline of using sex to sell seats, not that
that would be a first for an airline or for an Asian business. The
difference at Singapore Airlines is that what passengers see in the
ads, they more or less get when they board a plane. ``We've never
done an ad which didn't have a genuine Singapore Girl in it,'' said
Rick Scott-Blackwell, chairman and co-founder of Batey Ads.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective stewardesses _ the airline has yet to adopt the
sex-neutral term flight attendant _ must be younger than 26, at
least 5 feet 2 inches tall, slim and attractive with a good
complexion. And Asian.
</P>
<P>
   While about half the airline's flight attendants are men, they
are less visible than their female colleagues. They perform more of
the galley functions, while the women by and large serve the meals
and beverages. The stewards, who wear jackets and ties, must be
Singaporean or Malaysian and in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are reviewed in a series of four interviews that,
according to a former Singapore Girl, includes a swim test in which
the women are inspected for scars and blemishes their sarongs would
not hide.
</P>
<P>
   The chosen undergo four months of training that features mock
crashes, fire-fighting and life-saving. But it is also a debutante
boot camp. Trainees are taught poise, deportment and wine
selection. They learn how to address surly passengers with a smile;
how to cut their hair to match the shape of their faces; what
make-up best matches their skin tones; how to sit, walk and climb
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is unabashed. ``We want to present a complete
picture of femininity,'' said Maniam Supramaniam, a spokesman for
the airline. And passengers remain loyal despite what appears to go
against conventional notions of women's liberation. ``Why change a
winning formula?'' Supramaniam asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cho said the Singapore Girl presented a less suggestive image in
Asia. Accustomed to self-effacing service and inured to flesh by
years of Hollywood imagery, Asians see just what the airline says
it intended: graciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Khoo Heng Keow, president of the Singapore Association of Women
for Action and Research, said that the form-fitting sarong was
merely elegant. But, she added, advertising the flight attendant as
a ``great way to fly'' is sexist. ``It robs her of her personhood
and makes her a vehicle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore Girl is not Singapore Airlines' only draw. In
addition to the carrier's legendary punctuality, passengers rave
about its in-flight entertainment: each seat is equipped with a
television screen and the ability to play 10 video games or watch
one of 21 channels, including eight offering films.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also credit the company's policy of quickly replacing
older aircraft with new ones so that it can get relatively high
prices for its used planes and keep its fleet among the youngest in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Asia's recent financial crisis kept many passengers at
home, Singapore Airlines managed to post a profit. And it is
sitting on roughly 3 billion Singapore dollars, or $1.8 billion, in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's profitability is partly attributable to a highly
regulated Asian airline industry that keeps competitive pressures
low. But the company has also cut costs in the face of threats on
its long-haul routes and rising wages at home.
</P>
<P>
   The main question now is whether a carrier represented by
Singapore Girl is compatible over the long term with its cheeky
London partner. When he announced the deal with Virgin Atlantic in
London, Cheong Choong Kong, the chief executive of Singapore
Airlines, said he hoped Singaporeans would be infected by the joie
de vivre shown by Richard Branson, the Virgin Group chairman, and
``begin taking ourselves a little less seriously.''  &QL;

<P>
   In an apocalypse that Dawn Rivette expects to see in her
lifetime, Jesus Christ rides to earth on a white stallion, sweeping
believers up to heaven while calamity swallows the faithless back
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Chantel Mikell, a security guard, imagines the Second Coming as
a tender, guiding hand righting a world gone crazily wrong. For
Jeffrey Case, chemical and biological weapons will unleash massive
destruction in an all-out war, as heaven opens the only escape.
</P>
<P>
   And in a late-20th-century entreaty reminiscent of St.
Augustine, Aida Guadalupe, a mother of three in the Bronx, prays
for salvation _ but not yet.
</P>
<P>
   As the final days ticked down before the year 2000, nearly one
out of three Christians in the New York metropolitan region said
they believed they would witness Christ's return in their
lifetimes, according to a recent New York Times poll. Asked the
same question four years ago, only one out of five Christians in
the region believed they would see the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   Belief that the apocalypse will occur in the coming years
appears to be higher among Christians elsewhere in the United
States than in New York, according to a recent CBS News poll that
posed a question similar to the New York Times survey. In that
poll, 37 percent of Protestants and Catholics said they believed
Christ would return to earth sometime after the year 2000. Four
years ago, 26 percent of Protestants and Catholics surveyed
nationally said they believed Christ would return in their
lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Times survey, conducted from Nov. 29 to Dec. 5,
polled 1,615 adults of all religious backgrounds in New York's
Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx,
Staten Island and seven upstate counties.
</P>
<P>
   While the New Testament sets no specific date when the terrible
visions described in the Book of Revelations will strike _ indeed,
it says the time is not known _ television evangelists, supermarket
tabloids and a variety of books with titles like ``There's a New
World Coming,'' and the highly popular ``Are We Living in the End
Times?'' have taken to predicting the end is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   William D. Dinges, a professor of religious studies at Catholic
University of America, in Washington, likens popular belief that
the apocalypse is coming to a ``low grade fever, that flares up at
different moments in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, those beliefs grew strongest in times of adversity,
surviving even after being proved wrong time and again. ``There's
something deeper that's going on here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One such movement, started by William Miller, a farmer,
predicted the Second Coming in 1843, and then lated it for
decades later. The prediction's failure became known among
Millerites as the Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   One follower, Washington Morse, wrote of his anguish after
altering his life in preparation for Christ's imminent return.
``That day came and passed and the darkness of another night closed
in upon the world. But with that darkness came a pang of
disappointment to the Advent believers, that can find a parallel
only in the sorrow of the disciples at the crucification of their
Lord,'' Morse wrote in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, to turn again to the cares, perplexities and dangers
of life, in full view of jeering and rivaling unbelievers, who
scoffed as never before, was a terrible trial of faith and
patience. When Elder Himes visited Waterbury, Vt., a short time
after the passing of the time, and stated that the brethren should
prepare for another cold winter, my feelings were almost
uncontrollable. I left the place of meeting and wept like a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At our century's end, Dinges said, nuclear weapons had put the
horrific visions of the apocalypse within reach of popular
imagination. ``What we have is a scientific discovery that
facilitates the plausibility of this end-of-time prophecy,'' he
said. The sustained economic boom has probably tempered
expectations of the second Advent, he said, but they were still
heightened, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Ingebor G. Luckner, 73, a retired hairdresser and bank clerk in
Port Jervis, N.Y., said she watches Billy Graham on television and
believes she will see the Second Coming by her 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we're getting near that time,'' said Mrs.
Luckner, who participated in the New York Times poll and was
reinterviewed afterward. Mrs. Luckner, who grew up in Hitler's
Germany, said terrorism and violence among young people, which she
said was shown by the wave of shootings at schools, made her think
the end was near. ``This I have not heard of throughout history,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Luckner imagined the second Advent could resemble the
destruction she saw during the Allied bombing that ended World War
II, when her family fled to the mountains and returned home to find
neighbors digging the bodies of loved ones from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let it affect my life to the extent that I get
hyper and panicky,'' she said. Mrs. Luckner said she is not without
sin, but has led a ``quiet, decent, honest life,'' toiling to care
for ailing family members. ``I tried hard,'' she said. ``I tried
very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mikell, 26, said she, too, thought the world had reached a
turning point. ``When you see children killing other children, you
know the world is on its way to a serious downfall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed that Christ's return would prove nothing
like the predictions made St. John the Divine during his exile on
Patmos. ``I don't believe that Jesus will come to harm,'' Ms.
Mikell said. ``He'll come to repair things, because there's a lot
that's wrong with the world.''

</P>
<P>
   Those who believed the Second Coming is near share a belief that
humanity is in trouble. Mrs. Rivette, a mother of three in Hyde
Park, N.Y., said natural disasters like floods and earthquakes had
almost become everyday occurrences. ``It just seems like the end is
getting closer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rivette said technology had made daily life easier, but the
world was no more harmonious for it. She said she looked forward to
an end of crime and hatred with the Second Coming, and to being
swept up in the rapture and to being reunited with deceased
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She said, too, that she expected those who did not believe in
Christ would face punishment. ``I don't see it as a bloody thing,
but I think it'll be sad for the people who don't know who he is,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Case, 29, who manages a beverage store in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
imagines mankind's final chapter as a global disaster, triggered by
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Case said he did not expect that non-Christians who were
humane would suffer with Christ's return. ``I don't think you have
to believe in Jesus,'' he said. ``In my mind, how could you let
good people die?''
</P>
<P>
   Aida Guadalupe, 34, said she, too, expected the end to be
``devastating'' for those who remained on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guadalupe said that her belief did not consume her life,
because the uncertainty was still large. ``I'd go out of my mind,''
she said. ``All I can do is pray to God, to try to get to know
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guadalupe said her in-laws, who live in Florida, always ask
whether she is attending church and feels ready for the rapture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I don't want it to come,'' she added. ``I've got
children, and I want to see them grow up. I want to see
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping, `Please, not yet.'''

AGENCY SEEKS SAFEGUARDS FOR BIRDS ON POWER LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Alaska, Va., Colo.)  (nk) 
 By DENNIS BLANK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Power poles have always been a favorite perch for birds,
especially eagles, hawks, owls and falcons, which use them to spot
their prey.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 of these raptors are electrocuted every year, but now
the criminal prosecution of a Utah utility company for causing the
deaths of birds has raised concerns among electric companies,
particularly in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities say they could face large expenses, possibly running
into millions of dollars, if they are forced to prevent the
electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is running scared right now,'' said Monte Garrett, a
biologist for PacifiCorp, a utility based in Portland, Ore., that
has 45,000 miles of power lines in eight Western states. PacifiCorp
has already spent $8 million in the last 10 years retrofitting many
of its lines, Garrett said, and it would cost the company at least
$200 million to bird-proof all its lines.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Moon Lake Electric Association Inc., based in
Roosevelt, Utah, was convicted under the federal Eagle Protection
Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act of causing the deaths of 12
eagles, four hawks and one owl. A federal judge in Denver, Lewis T.
Babcock, ordered Moon Lake Electric to pay a $50,000 fine and
donate $50,000 to organizations dedicated to protecting wild birds.
The company was also put on probation for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated the criminal
prosecution of Moon Lake after the utility notified the service of
the bird deaths _ most of which had occurred near a remote Chevron
oil field in Colorado _ and asked for help in preventing future
electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that these incidents were unintentional, Moon
Lake is disappointed that the government chose to impose such a
severe penalty,'' Grant J. Earl, general manager for the utility,
said. Earl said the utility had spent several years installing
protective devices to discourage birds from landing on poles.
</P>
<P>
   But Benito A. Perez, a special agent with the Fish and Wildlife
Service, said Moon Lake was prosecuted because it had not been
moving fast enough to install those devices.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Lake Electric said it had cost $960,000 to retrofit more
than 3,200 poles in Utah and Colorado at an average cost of $300
per pole, with at least 600 more poles yet to do. It said it could
absorb the cost without raising rates. The work involves spreading
lines farther apart, insulating the jumper cable on transformers
and erecting devices such as plastic hoops to discourage migratory
birds from landing on the poles. Some eagles have wingspans up to 8
feet, which means they are able to complete a circuit between two
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Swazo, a Fish and Wildlife agent in Lakewood, Colo., said
between 1978 and 1998, a total of 1,045 bird deaths were reported
in the central Rocky Mountain states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more birds dying than we know,'' he said.
``Power line collisions are also a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Moon Lake case, several utilities from Alaska to
Colorado have be warning letters from Fish and Wildlife
agents, giving them up to 60 days to take corrective action or face
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are trying to spread a little bit of fear to all
the small utilities,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising rates to defray the cost of retrofitting was discussed
at a meeting of utilities in Virginia recently, Garrett said, but
no utilities have sought to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the industry in April, Jamie Rappaport Clark, the
director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, warned that because of
the public's ``love affair with birds,'' more deaths can give
utilities a ``public relations headache.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Making power lines bird-safe is not only the right thing to
do, it is also the law,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rae E. Cronmiller, an environmental attorney for the National
Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Washington, said,
``People want to do the right thing because you cannot afford to be
in violation of environmental law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service does not want every power pole
retrofitted, Swazo said, just those where frequent deaths occur.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, home to large numbers of eagles, the issue is of
particular concern to wildlife authorities. ``Protecting the
migratory birds is always a difficult challenge because our lines
extend for hundreds of miles,'' Ed Kozak, general manager of Kodiak
Electric in Kodiak, Alaska, said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE RAINBOW THAT WAS REGGIE CARTER
</HEADLINE>
   (With OBIT-CARTER) 
(rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If life were an arc that could emit colors, Reggie
Carter's life would be a rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, 1,000 friends and colleagues came to pay tribute at
Riverside Church to the former St. John's star and Knick who died
on Christmas Eve after a long battle with sarcoidosis, a disease
that affected his heart. Most said that his life ended too soon,
but most agreed that his life was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers may never have heard of Reggie Carter, who
played with the Knicks for two seasons in the early 1980s and had a
tryout with the Nets, then got on with his life: an undergraduate
degree from St. John's, a master's degree from the City University
of New York. Carter lived a basketball life, a student's life, the
pro life, a parent's life, the educator's life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was not the celebrity death of the century _ not Joe
DiMaggio or Wilt Chamberlain or Walter Payton. This was the passing
of a New Yorker, a man who went from boyhood to young adulthood to
manhood in this building.
</P>
<P>
   One boyhood friend recalled how, 30 years ago, Carter at age 12
had dragged him to Riverside Church to try out for the basketball
team. The Riverside program became a catalyst in Carter's life. He
played around the city, the state, the country. Ernie Lorch, the
program's founder, helped him gain entry to Long Island Lutheran in
Brookville, where he played with Wayne McKoy, later his teammate at
St. John's, and Al Eford Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Eford recalled a litany of funny adventures involving
he, Carter and McKoy _ how they used to hitchhike from Long Island
back to New York City, how Carter used to drag him through
practices, how Carter taught him to be a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Carter wound up going to the University of Hawaii, lured away by
an eager assistant named Rick Pitino. Carter was the captain of the
team. The program was sanctioned by the NCAA and Carter came back
home, to St. John's, where he enjoyed a brilliant career. St.
John's was the commuter school that took New York City kids with
wanderlust and welcomed them back. Carter was one of the first. Ron
Rutledge, a former player for St. John's and a coach since 1979,
called Carter ``a St. John's man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge remembered the wonderful 1979 season when St. John's
played the University of Pennsylvania for the right to reach the
Final Four. St. John's lost. ``That was the lowest I ever saw
Reggie,'' Rutledge remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Price was the Pennsylvania center that day in the regional
final. Thursday, Price was at Riverside Church. He remembered the
game vividly, and remembered how badly he felt for Carter. They
played together at Riverside, where Carter was the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the locker room and hugged him and Wayne,'' Price
said. ``Told them I was sorry that we beat them, but I had to be
loyal to my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we used to know was the gym _ in the gym and
out,'' Price said. Two months ago he stopped by the church with his
6-year-old daughter. They sat in the nave and he taught her to
pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be back here for this is tough,'' said Price, who has a
son. ``I was looking forward to having another relationship with
Reggie. We had the relationship coming up playing with and against
each other; I was looking forward to having a relationship as
fathers with sons.'' Carter had three sons and a granddaughter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nate Archibald, the great NBA guard, emphasized that Carter was
good person, a nice person. ``A lot of us aren't nice people,''
Archibald said, referring to humans in general, athletes in
particular. ``I'm a good guy, but I'm not a nice guy. Reggie Carter
was a nice, good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest testament to Carter was recorded in the presence
of students from Mineola High School, where Carter was assistant
principal since 1996. They listened. Some cried. Carter was no
pushover. He knew their tricks, their games, their aches and pains,
too _ he had invented many of them years earlier. He cared.
</P>
<P>
   The principal spoke of Carter's dedication, his determination to
keep students on the right course. On Carter's last day in the
building, Dec. 7, at a variety show, he stayed at the school until
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The principal wept. The students at Mineola never knew Reggie
Carter the college basketball star, the former Knick. They knew Mr.
Carter, the dedicated administrator who seemed to know what he was
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Carter lived a life at many levels in many different
colors. His was more than a basketball life. He lived a rainbow.

ANGRY SHAREHOLDERS BACK RESCUE PLAN FOR GERMAN CONTRACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Shareholders of Philipp Holzmann AG, the
troubled German construction conglomerate, approved a $2.2 billion
bailout plan here Thursday, but not before some accused the
chairman of being incompetent and self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann, long one of Germany's formidable construction
companies, shocked investors six weeks ago when executives
announced the discovery of 2.4 billion marks (about $1.2 billion)
in bad loans and other losses. Holzmann was about to declare
bankruptcy when the German government applied pressure on a
consortium of banks to come up with new financing.
</P>
<P>
   Carl von Boehm-Bezing, a Deutsche Bank executive who is also
chairman of Holzmann's supervisory board, attributed the problems
almost entirely to the company's old management, which was
dismissed two years ago during a previous bailout. He said those
executives covered up many of the problems by shifting bad real
estate and construction loans into a Swiss company in which
Holzmann owned slightly less than half the equity.
</P>
<P>
   But that provided little comfort to smaller shareholders, who
complained that he and Deutsche Bank _ which is Holzmann's biggest
creditor as well as a big shareholder _ were either asleep or
intentionally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Nieding, a lawyer for the German Society for the
Protection of Security Holders, accused Boehm-Bezing of ignoring
repeated signouble over the last year. He was especially
incensed that Holzmann had failed to properly disclose an auditor's
report in February that harshly criticized both the management and
the valuation of various Holzmann projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough of cluelessness, incompetence and show
business,'' Nieding said at a meeting with shareholders Thursday,
urging without success that Boehm-Bezing be forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deutsche Bank is Holzmann's biggest creditor, a major
shareholder, a business partner and also a buyer and seller of its
shares,'' Nieding said. ``They have too many conflicts of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He had hoped to put forward a resolution calling for the ouster
of Boehm-Bezing, but his group failed to submit the resolution in
time to satisfy the company's bylaws. The shareholder advocacy
group said it might offer a similar resolution at the next board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm-Bezing became chairman of the supervisory board when
Holzmann went through the 1997 overhaul and bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, as Holzmann's biggest creditor and a large
shareholder, is determined to control the supervisory board. And,
at least for the time being, bank executives say they have no
alternative to Boehm-Bezing.
</P>
<P>
   He orchestrated the dismissal of Holzmann's previous management
team and installed a new chief executive, Heinrich Binder. It was
Binder who disclosed the mountain of new losses in November, month,
just a few weeks after declaring that Holzmann was solidly on the
path to a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Binder and Holzmann's former chief financial officer resigned
Dec. 9. The stock has plunged more than 70 percent since the losses
were announced. It fell 1.41 euros Thursday, to 34.60 euros, or
$34.86.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm-Bezing insisted that he and the supervisory board had done
all they could. ``In hindsight, it is naturally easy to say that we
on the supervisory board should have dug more deeply,'' he said.
But they did everything consistent with their obligations to ferret
out the problems, he declared, adding, ``I have decided not to take
the easy way out and resign, but rather to help advance the
difficult and demanding job of leading the company to a secure and
prosperous future.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reggie Carter, an outstanding guard for the
unheralded St. John's University basketball team that came within
one game of the NC AA tournament's Final Four in 1979, died last
Friday at Huntington (N.Y.) Hospital. Carter, who lived in
Huntington Station, was 42.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown
origin that results in lesions and had affected his heart, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's got off to a 9-8 start in the 1978-79 season,
Carter's junior year, and was the last team selected for the NCAA
tournament. But Carter teamed up with Wayne McKoy, a center who had
been his high school teammate at Long Island Lutheran in
Brookville, to provide exciting moments in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   After St. John's defeated Temple in the first round, Carter's
jump shot with five seconds left brought 10th-seeded St. John's an
80-78 victory over second-seeded Duke in Raleigh, N.C. The
following weekend, in Greensboro, N.C., McKoy scored, also with
five seconds remaining, for a 67-65 victory over Rutgers. But St.
John's was beaten by Penn, 64-62, in the East Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 6 feet 3 inches, averaged 15 points a game as both a
junior and a senior and scored 1,061 points over 2 1-2 seasons at
St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was a high school All-American and then starred as a
freshman at the University of Hawaii. He transferred to St. John's
after the NCAA found that Hawaii had engaged in recruiting
violations. After sitting out one season as a transfer student and
an additional 14 games because of improper benefits provided by
Hawaii, he made his debut for St. John's in January 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A second-round draft choice of the Knicks, Carter saw limited
action for them in the 1980-81 and '81-82 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so coachable,'' recalled Lou Carnesecca, his St. John's
coach. ``He played both ends of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter received a master's degree from the City University of
New York and was an assistant principal at Mineola High School on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alicia; three sons, Reggie Jr.,
Nicholas and Nigel; two brothers and three sisters; his mother,
Mary, and a granddaughter.

GIULIANI SCOFFS AT COMPLAINTS ABOUT `CHRISTMAS' REMARK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani scoffed Thursday at complaints
from Jewish leaders who called him insensitive for saying that
Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign spokesman, who is Jewish, ``can't
figure out how to celebrate Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints made their way to the front page of the Dec. 31
issue of The Forward, a weekly newspaper that covers Jewish issues,
prompting a question from a reporter Thursday about Giuliani's
reaction, during his daily news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded with a hearty laugh, said, ``Oh, stop it,
come on,'' then added that ``it sounds to me like everybody is
taking themselves too seriously. My goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, criticized
the mayor for bringing about the ouster of Rudy Crew, the schools
chancellor, saying that ``the mayor's instinct when he disagrees
with someone is to either fire them, sue them or arrest them. That
won't work in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded that day by saying, ``I say Merry Christmas
to everyone, including some press flack who can't figure out how to
celebrate Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is Roman Catholic, said Thursday that ``what I was
saying was, that wasn't a day for negative personal attack by
anyone. It was the day before Christmas, and can't you have a
holiday?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the New York director of the Anti-Defamation
League, Howie Katz, said Thursday that Giuliani's remark ``hints at
an insensitivity to someone else's beliefs. There was no reason to
include the remark about an individual not knowing how to celebrate
Ch who has a Jewish-sounding name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forward also quoted Ira Forman, the executive director of
the National Jewish Democratic Council, as saying that Giuliani
``proves that if you don't think exactly like he does and you don't
celebrate the same holidays he does, then you are fair game for his
political thuggery.''
</P>
<P>
   Forman could not be reached Thursday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said Thursday that ``I was surprised by the comment, and
people will draw their own conclusions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has strong support among Jewish voters, particularly
conservative ones, and is a staunch supporter of Israel's policies.
Mrs. Clinton has announced her intention to run for the U.S. Senate
in 2000; the mayor, who has not yet announced his campaign, is her
likely opponent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his news conference, Giuliani also responded to questions
about a major fund-raiser who was granted special city parking
privileges by joking, ``That's right, I'm a big crook.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported on Thursday that Joseph Spitzer, a
Brooklyn real estate developer who raised more than $83,000 for the
mayor's 1997 re-election campaign, has one of 11 special city
permits allowing him to park his 1998 Audi anywhere in the city,
including in no-parking zones. The dashboard permit reads
``Official Business of the Mayor's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked about the permit, Giuliani said: ``Oh, get
out of here. No, I'm not going to comment on the Joseph Spitzer
parking situation. It's the silliest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the reporter pressed, Giuliani said sarcastically: ``Oh, my
God, he's got a permit to park in the city. Oh, my God. That's
right, I'm a big crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Wolfson sent the mayor a letter asking how much such
special permits cost and how an ``averazen'' could get one.

RAID ON TERROR SUSPECTS LEAVES COMMUNITY STUNNED AND ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TERROR-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officers are a familiar presence to the people
who live and work in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, a bustling,
largely Pakistani enclave that has struggled over the last decade
to cut crime and revive a fraying neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But those who caught sight of the swarming FBI agents Thursday
morning understood instantly that something out of the ordinary was
about to occur. ``It was total chaos,'' said Joe VanDusky, who
works in an electronics store.
</P>
<P>
   By the dozens, the agents emerged quickly and silently from a
caravan of unmarked cars that pulled to a stop at dawn on a quiet
stretch of East Eighth Street. Many were dressed entirely in black,
from their pullover face masks to their body armor. They carried
protective shields, battering rams, assault weapons. Some led
police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   They made their way down side streets toward their target, a
three-story building at the corner of Newkirk and Coney Island
Avenues, and then raced inside _ some through the main entry and
others up a fire escape _ until they were crowded into a narrow
second-floor hallway outside apartment No. 1. Smashing the door
open, they burst inside screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 minutes of wrestling,'' recalled Sebastian Pinochet,
19, who lives in the next-door apartment.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that the agents had come looking for associates
of a suspected Algerian terrorist, the neighborhood reacted with
two distinct strains of fear: one of terrorism itself, the other of
being unfairly stigmatized by law enforcement agencies and the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm nervous,'' said Ahmad Khaid, who works in a
grocery across the street from the apartment building. ``I never
saw anything wrong,'' he said of the men who lived in the raided
apartment. ``They were customers and they seemed like good people.
I hope that it's not true. Things like this give Islam a bad
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents announced the arrest of one tenant, whom they identified
as Abdel Ghani, a 31-year-old Algerian, who they said had traveled
to Seattle this month to meet Ahmed Ressam, the man caught
allegedly trying to smuggle explosives and timing devices across
the Canadian border. A second man who was in the Brooklyn apartment
was being held by immigration authorities. Two others were
released, and one of the two returned to the apartment late
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The men were not well known in the neighborhood. Their landlord,
Dr. Iftikhar Dim, a physician in Brooklyn, said in an interview
Thursday that some of his other tenants in the apartment had asked
him several months ago whether a friend of theirs named Ghani could
rent apartment No. 1 on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Dim said he agreed to rent the apartment to Ghani but did not
require a signed lease. Residents in the building said they thought
the men mainly spoke Arabic. But this was hardly remarkable in a
neighborhood known as Little Pakistan. Friends came and went, music
was played _ all the normal rhythms of apartment living. ``Very
nice,'' said a neighbor, Maria Goldsworthy, 47, of the men.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vito Tulovac, a building superintendent for an apartment around
the corner on Parkville Avenue, said Thursday that he knew the men
from the neighborhood, although not by name. He said they wanted to
move into his building and were supposed to complete an apartment
application Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't seem like people who would be involved with
terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With police cordoning off an entire block Thursday as FBI
evidence technicians completed a methodical search of the
apartment, several residents said they were worried that law
enforcement officials were unfairly singling out their neighborhood
for terrorists because of its large Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are such a peaceful people here,'' said Ashgar Choudhri, an
accountant from Pakistan who has lived in the neighborhood for 25
years. ``We made such a beautiful business district. This place
used to be full of drug dealers. We made it a good neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Wasim and his roommate, Tahir Hussain, live in an
apartment above the one that was raided. Wasim, a native of
Pakistan, said the agents pounded at his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up and showed my documents to them.'' he said. ``They
asked some questions of me and my roommate. They just wanted to see
if we were legal, or were we involved in anything or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mahmudur Rahman, 18, said he and his friends were stopped
and detained by FBI agents Thursday morning as they drove up Coney
Island Avenue. The agents apparently were alarmed by the license
plates on Rahman's van, from Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have been searching in Canada for possible
accomplices, but Rahman offered a simple explanation for the
plates. He said he is a student from Toronto visiting family in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their guns drawn,'' Rahman said, clearly shaken by
the experience. ``They told everyone to come out of the car, they
detained us for about an hour and a half. They searched the van,
and looked through our wallets. They thought we could be suspects.
I never expected something like this to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman said he and his friends were released. Tariq Khother,
another resident, said he had noticed helicopters circling the area
for several nights. ``Three straight nights, we cannot sleep and
our children cannot sleep,'' said Khother, a native of Pakistan.
``They're watching anyone who is Muslim. They're treating us like
animals.''

ACTRESS AND RAPPER ADD GLAMOUR TO COURTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Male police officers took suspiciously long cigarette
breaks outside the private entrance of the Manhattan district
attorney's office Thursday, hoping to catch a glimpse of the
alluring actress and singer. Female court officers gathered round
and said that if she had any brains, she would dump the rap mogul
who landed her in court in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The actress and singer, Jennifer Lopez, and the rap impresario,
Sean Combs, better known as Puff Daddy, spent their mornings
Thursday in the decidedly unglamorous Manhattan Criminal Courts
Building. Ms. Lopez testified before a grand jury about a shooting
in a Times Square club early Monday that left three people wounded
and Combs facing gun possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, who denies that he had a gun, was present in the
courthouse but did not testify, according to law enforcement
officials. The grand jury will continue hearing testimony in the
case next week, they said.
</P>
<P>
   While Combs waited in court in Manhattan, one of the people
wounded in the shooting filed a lawsuit against the
multimillionaire rap producer, the owners of the nightclub, Club
New York, and others involved in the shooting. Julius Jones, a
bouncer at the club who was shot in the shoulder, accused Combs of
assault and battery and the club's owners of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, who has been romantically linked to Combs and was
with him on the night of the shooting, was all smiles Thursday as
she left the courthouse after several hours of meetings and
testimony. She would not answer reporters' questions about what she
saw in the club or about her future with Combs, and sped off in a
Ford Expedition followed by Lincoln and Mercedes coupes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Combs and Jamal Barrow, a young rap artist
who was with him at Club New York that night, both drew 9-mm
pistols after a man threw money in Combs' face. Barrow fired his
gun, wounding three people, and was caught fleeing with a gun in
his waistband, they said. A loaded but unfired 9-mm pistol was
found in the front seat of the Lincoln Navigator that Combs and Ms.
Lopez fled in with a bodyguard after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Combs has repeatedly denied having a gun in the club and has
accused witnesses who say he did of lying. His lawyer, Harvey
Slovis, dismissed the lawsuit filed against Combs Thursday as
frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyer, William Schwitzer, said the gunshot wound to his
client's right shoulder might resulrmanent paralysis of his
right arm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the courthouse regulars drawn to the spectacle was Gary
Davis, a counselor who ran a two-hour anger management seminar that
Combs was sentenced to attend earlier this year for assaulting a
record producer. Davis said that Combs was contrite and respectful
during the seminar and seemed to have learned that as ``a
high-profile person he should think before putting himself in a
high-risk situation.'' Davis said he was taken aback by the new
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' he said. ``I was like, not again!''

SENATE RIVALS JOUST ON FUND-RAISING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prospective candidates in the Senate race in New
York reach a minor milestone Friday, a fund-raising deadline that
is turning into much more than an accounting exercise. Recognizing
that the contribution totals they announce for the year will be
used to evaluate their standing, both sides are trying to shape
expectations _ and even shape the shaping of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   How much have Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton
raised? At first, the candidates' advisers declined to say
Thursday. With a little goading, by late afternoon they were
letting out clues. The upshot is that both campaigns said they had
taken in more than $6.6 million this year, which would be a record
for this point in a Senate contest. But they would not divulge
exact figures.
</P>
<P>
   However vague, those acknowledgments ended weeks of conspicuous
humility on the part of the campaigns. Mrs. Clinton's advisers had
repeatedly disavowed earlier suggestions that the checks would
cascade in. When it was mentioned that a supporter had set a goal
of $25 million in donations by the election, her brain trust would
collectively wince. (Rule No. 1 in the perceptions game: avoid
outsized predictions, which could prove embarrassing if not met.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget, her advisers would often point out, that
Giuliani has an extensive fund-raising operation that was nurtured
in his three runs for City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Giuliani headquarters, the mayor's lieutenants had also
been mum about their bottom line, and just as eager to describe
what they contended were the opposition's advantages, beginning
with Mrs. Clinton's national reputation and her husband's famed
fund-raising prowess. The Giuliani campaign in recent weeks has
been highlighting the Dec. 31 deadline, saying that the campaign
needed a burst of money to withstand comparisons with Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By Election Day, this maneuvering will probably seem an ancient
chapter in the race, and the consensus among political analysts is
that both candidates will be able to raise the money they need, in
what will be among the most costly congressional races in the
nation's history. Numerous other caveats indicate that the size of
treasuries now do not yield much insight.
</P>
<P>
   The national and state political parties are expected to pour in
money, and so will outside advocacy groups. This spending _ much of
it stemming from the unregulated donations known as soft money _
makes the candidates' bankrolls somewhat less crucial. What's more,
neither campaign would discuss how much cash it had after expenses,
which is also an important indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is particular interest in the figures for
Mrs. Clinton, who has never run for office before and has been the
subject of speculation about whether she can shoulder the
fund-raising demands.
</P>
<P>
   Specific numbers will not be known until sometime next month,
when the candidates submit disclosure records covering the last six
months to the Federal Election Commission, but the silence started
crumbling Thursday after a bit of sparring over a jibe from Mrs.
Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that the mayor will match us dollar for
dollar,'' Wolfson said, declining to provide Mrs. Clinton's
financial statistics but happy to espouse a new-found admiration
for Giuliani's money skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a huge pre-existing donor base,'' Wolfson said. ``This
race is the No. 1 priority of national Republicans. And if he
doesn't raise as much as we raise, or certainly as much as Al
D'Amato raised, he is doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment was read to Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's top
campaign aide. D'Amato, the former senator from New York, was a
crackerjack fund-raiser, and in 1997, the year before he lost his
bid for re-election to Charles Schumer, he raised a record $6.6
million. He ultimately spent roughly $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Teitelbaum would merely say, ``We are right
where we want to be. We have had a very good year and we are very
grateful for the support.''
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the D'Amato reference, Teitelbaum said he would
call back. When he did, he called Wolfson's bluff. ``We have raised
considerably more than Senator D'Amato raised in that same time
frame,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that, Wolfson consulted his superiors. He then
said: ``We have raised more in six months than Al D'Amato raised in
the entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum would not go further. ``The Clintons have said all
along that they were going to raise $25 million or more,'' he said.
``Given their proclivity at raising money, especially soft money,
it wouldn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign has estimated that it will raise from $15
million to $20 million by November, and has not backed off from
that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns obviously regard speculation about their bankrolls
very seriously. But others did not want to get drawn in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers game got wildly out of hand from the beginning,''
said Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Committee.
``Everybody needs to try to reel it back because it's very
misleading. It's bad politics and it's bad campaigning. It turns
the public off. These huge amounts of money are something that the
public in general finds offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the campaigns are not backing off.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, a rumor was circulating that Mrs. Clinton
was so concerned about her numbers that the president was getting
on the phone to ask prominent donors to hold last-minute
fund-raising events for her. There was no confirmation of it, and
Wolfson said he heard the rumor before and quickly swatted it down.
``The president,'' he said, ``is not making any calls.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel Myers, the originator of the London Fog raincoat, died on
Sunday at the North Oaks retirement community in Pikesville, Md. He
was 93.
</P>
<P>
   After making raincoats for the Army in World War II, Myers'
Londontown Manufacturing Co. was the first to popularize the
military trench coat for civilian wear. The design and pioneering
use of polyester blends helped Londontown become the dominant maker
of men's coats in the United States in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the son of a tailor, was born in Lynchburg, Va., but
moved as a boy to Baltimore. He became a statewide champion in
shorthand while attending Baltimore City College. Just before
graduating at 17, Myers was hired as a stenographer with Makover,
Roten Co., a maker of naval officers clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Myers worked for that company, with increasingly more
responsible jobs, while earning a law degree at the University of
Maryland at night. By 1927, the company changed its name to
Londontown Clothes and began to focus on expensive men's suits and
coats.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed during the Depression, and Myers obtained
the rights to the Londontown name by agreeing to help the creditors
liquidate its assets. Myers started his own men's clothing company
under the name Londontown Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's big break came during the war, when the Army
ordered 10,000 raincoats. After the war, Londontown found a
receptive market for its trench coats at leading retailers like
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and the J.C. Penney Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Myers started experimenting with a fabric that was 50
percent cotton and 50 percent Dacron polyester, a blend that was
both lightweight and waterproof. After working with DuPont to
perfect the fabric so that it could be used in automated
manufacturing equipment, the company introduced the London Fog
Maincoat in 1954. It quickly became the company's signature
product.
</P>
<P>
   The $29.95 coat, introduced by Saks Fifth Avenue with an ad in
Look magazine featuring a model in front of a foggy background, was
an immediate hit. Rather than the double-breasted and belted trench
coat, the new model was a more streamlined single-breasted design
called a balmacaan. Myers called it a maincoat because he intended
it to be worn year round in all weather.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' experiments with polyester allowed the company to
introduce other innovations, including a wash-and-wear coat and a
zip-out lining.
</P>
<P>
   Londontown soon introduced a version of the maincoat for women,
which became popular in the late 1950s and early '60s as women's
fashion emulated men's clothing. Later in the 1960s, the company
began to expand into other styles and colors and eventually began
to make a range of outerwear from golfing jackets to heavy car
coats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Londontown became the first clothing manufacturer to
advertise directly on television rather than relying on retailers
for promotion. Its atmospheric advertisements, filmed in London,
featured what would become its long-running slogan: ``London Fog
lets you laugh at the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late '70s, the company dominated the men's raincoat
business, selling six of every eight men's raincoats bought in the
United States. Indeed, its position was so dominant that it was
accused by the Federal Trade Commission of fixing prices, a case it
settled without acknowledging wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Myers' son, Jonathan, of Owings Mills, Md., became the
company's president and was promoted to chief executive in 1973.
Myers became the chairman emeritus, and he continued to go to his
office almost every day until his health deteriorated in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the company was bought by Interco, a conglomerate based
in St. Louis that owned other brands like Florsheim Shoes. But
Jonathan Myers and his brother-in-law, Herschel Langenthal,
continued to run the Londontown division for several more years.
</P>

   Since then, Londontown has become a pawn in a series of Wall
Street deals. In 1988, Interco fought off a hostile takeover bid
through a leveraged buyout that ultimately forced it into Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. The company, renamed London Fog
Inc., passed through the hands of several investment groups. Along
the way, it opened a chain of 140 stores, but that strategy
offended its traditional department store outlets. In September,
London Fog itself filed for bankruptcy protection.

MANY FEAR A PAROLE PROTEST COULD HARM SOME PRISONERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. _ Ulanda Canty and her 7-year-old daughter
trudged wearily away from Sing Sing prison, its medieval-looking
watch tower looming behind them like a rook on a chess board.
</P>
<P>
   They had made their regular weekly visit to Mrs. Canty's
husband, an inmate, but Tuesday she worried that this could be the
last one for a while. The prison is caught in a showdown between
the state Department of Correctional Services and inmates across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The department and advocates for prisoners' rights are hoping to
avert a strike that some inmates have threatened to start Saturday
morning in several prisons. According to the inmates' advocates,
the call for a strike has come from a number of violent felons who
feel they have repeatedly been denied parole because of stiffer
release guidelines sought by Gov. George Pataki, and feel they have
nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor, Bill Van Slyke, referred questions
about his policies on parole issues to the Department of
Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 72,000 inmates in state prisons work at jobs
ranging from prison maintenance to making furniture for state
agencies, earning an average of $1.05 a day.
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ guards, inmates and prisoners' relatives like
Mrs. Canty _ fear that they will be caught in the middle of a clash
in which they have little to gain and much to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Canty's husband, Douglas, has served six years of a
6-to-12-year sentence for robbery, and comes up for parole for a
second time in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Canty said she moved to Ossining from New York several
years ago to be closer to her husband, and she worries that if he
participates he could be moved to another prison far from her home.
Although she sympathizes with the strike organizers, she says
people like her husband, with relatively short prison terms, cannot
afford to take chances that could jeopardize parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of inmates who don't want to join in,'' Mrs.
Canty said. ``But they have to, because if they go against the
other inmates they could have trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other women leaving the prison's visitors' center
Tuesday said they shared Mrs. Canty's concerns. ``If they get
involved in this, how will it affect their privileges?'' asked one
woman, who would give only her first name, Lynn, referring to
nuptial visits and access to prison phones.
</P>
<P>
   At least 85 inmates suspected of plotting the strike have been
moved from Green Haven prison in Stormville, in Dutchess County,
which is believed to be one of the strike's hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Christmas Day, all 2,100 inmates at Green Haven and the
1,800 at Sing Sing have been placed under lockdown, which means
they are allowed out of their cells only to see visitors, for
emergency medical care and for mess-hall jobs.

PATAKI SIGNS BILL TO INCREASE CORRECTION OFFICER PENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki signed legislation Thursday
intended to increase retirement benefits for correction officers in
New York City, delivering a major defeat to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who had warned that the measure would severely strain the city's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides said he thought that correction officers were
entitled to the additional retirement benefits because they have
among the most difficult jobs in the city. His aides also noted
that the city already provides extra retirement money to police
officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been sponsored by the politically potent union
representing the city's 11,000 correction officers, and it is the
latest example of how the city's influential labor unions have come
to rely on Albany to grant them special benefits and privileges
that they cannot get from the city during contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's action drew an immediate and harsh rebuke from the
mayor, who maintained that it would cost the city as much as $100
million a year, a figure the union and the governor's office
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major sellout of the city, in terms of money,''
Giuliani said during a news conference at City Hall. ``The state
Legislature and the governor get to do this without spending any of
their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' Giuliani added, ``you can't give your city or
your state up to any special interest group. No matter how much
they support you, no matter how much you like them, if they're
asking you to create enormous deficits that hurt the entire city,
you've got to be willing to stand up to them and say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The action threatens to publicly divide the mayor and the
governor, the state's two most prominent Republicans, at a time
when Giuliani is counting on Pataki's support in his likely
campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have had a turbulent relationship over the years,
but in recent months have sought to forge a more cordial
relationship, at least publicly, in hopes of advancing their
political futures within national Republican circles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the Senate and Assembly in nearly unanimous
votes and placed Pataki in a political bind the moment it reached
his desk. It forced him to choose between the mayor, a fellow
Republican, and a union that enthusiastically supported his
re-election campaign in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides said the governor was swayed by the unions'
contention that its members were not being treated as fairly as
members of other municipal unions and that the cost to the city
would not be as great to the city as the mayor claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action was praised by Norman Seabrook, president
of the New York City Correction Officers Benevolent Association,
which represents city correction officers. Seabrook said the
union's decision to turn to state lawmakers came only after the
city refused to address the issue at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we are being treated fairly,'' Seabrook said in a
statement released by his office. ``We now have the same benefits
that New York City police officers and firefighters have long
enjoyed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new law takes stock market profits from the correction
officers' pension plan and places them in a separate fund to
supplement their retirement benefits. Until now, such profits have
been reinvested in the pension plan, increasing its worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration had warned that the city would end
up losing tens of millions of dollars if the stock market profits
were taken out of the pension plan. That is because there is a
formula that sets mandatory levels of financing for the pension
plan, and the city would have to make up the difference if the fund
was raided. The administration estimated that it would cost the
city $65 million to $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the union said those cost estimates were exaggerated, adding
that the pension increases would be paid only when the main pension
fund received profits from its stock market investments.

JANET BODE, 56; WROTE FOR YOUNG ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Janet Bode, the author of 14 nonfiction books with
socially conscious themes for young adults, died on Thursday at her
home in Manhattan. She was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, said her companion of many years,
Stan Mack, the cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bode's books were about interracial dating, teen-age
immigrants, rape, sibling rivalry, teen-age parents, troubled love,
friendship, eating disorders and other concerns of young people.
Her literary technique, she explained to an interviewer in 1997,
was to pick a topic resonant with meaning for teen-agers, interview
hundreds of young adults across the country and then present their
comments verbatim.
</P>
<P>
   Among her books were ``Death Is Hard to Live With,'' ``Voices of
Rape'' and ``The Colors of Freedom'' (1999), a book addressed to
teen-age immigrants. Her books are not the kind usually reviewed by
critics, but their value to troubled or perplexed young adults has
been recognized by organizations like the American Library
Association, which designated six of her titles Best Books for
Young Adults.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bode was born on July 14, 1943, in Penn Yan, N.Y., the
daughter of the late Carl Bode, a professor of English and American
Studies at the University of Maryland, and the former Charlotte
Watkins Smith. She attended schools in London in the late 1950s
when her father was cultural attache at the American Embassy there.
She graduated from the University of Maryland in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mack, Ms. Bode is survived by two sisters,
Barbara, of Washington, and Carolyn, of Santa Monica, Calif.

TEXAS DPS WORKERS TO KEEP UP GUARD WAY PAST MIDNIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (editors: ``tonight'' is cq for Friday) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three stories beneath the ground at Texas Department of Public
Safety headquarters, workers from more than 200 state agencies,
utilities and vital private entities will gather tonight to monitor
mission-critical computer systems that might crash when the clocks
strike midnight.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the state is celebrating, they'll soberly
watch for problems in state computers and equipment, ranging from
traffic lights to hospital life-support devices.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Y2K watch, coupled with increased anti-terrorism
vigilance by law enforcement officials around Texas, is designed to
put the public at ease about potential disaster, as well as hasten
the response if a calamity occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Texas has taken Y2K seriously,'' said state Rep.
Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, a member of the Texas team that has been
bracing for this day since 1996. ``Any disruptions related to state
government should be minor, isolated and easily repairable.''
</P>
<P>
   To field reports of power disruptions, civil unrest,
communications failures or other major problems, the state has been
divided into nine regions _ the same ones used for hurricanes and
other weather calamities. Each of the districts will try to handle
their problems locally before going up the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case the National Guard is needed, the governor will be
on call. Gov. George W. Bush will be somewhere in the state when
the new year arrives, though his staff won't disclose exactly
where.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday scenarios are uncalled for, state officials insist.
Computers and other equipment have been upgraded and tested, and
officials are confident that lights will stay on, computers will
operate and government services will be available as usual on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The intensive vigil at DPS headquarters will end by mid-day
Saturday, and workers will take a break before conducting a broad
reassessment of all state functions next week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Texas Department of Information Resources, which
oversees computer functions at all state agencies, began requiring
all hardware and software purchases to be Y2K-compliant _ able to
recognize 2000 as a date. (Computer programs that are not
Y2K-compliant and that rely heavily on dates may alter important
data.)
</P>
<P>
   The following year, lawmakers set aside $110 million to fix
older devices with embedded chips that might be tripped up by the
date change. By September, state agencies and universities reported
that 99 percent of their systems were ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of state employees have been dedicated to this
project,'' Pitts said. ``Because of the efforts made by both
government and private industry, Jan. 1 will be a day of
celebration rather than one of disruptions, as some had
predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, officials won't be giving an immediate ``all clear''
report for all agencies because some computers won't be tested
until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies with highly critical functions, such as keeping inmates
behind bars or making sure child-support checks are issued on
schedule, will have scores of workers on duty at their main offices
to monitor events. That's in addition to law enforcement and other
state workers who are expected to work on holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain confident that all of our systems are in order, but
we will maintain very prudent vigilance,'' said state prisons
spokesman Glen Castlebury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FBI officials said Thursday they interviewed a number
of people after receiving information that they might know
something about Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian arrested in Washington
state on explosives-smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesmen in Houston and Dallas would not say how many
people were interviewed, but none was detained. FBI officials said
they have no information that any terrorist groups are planning
attacks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal officials are concerned that an attack could come
from an unknown group or individual terrorists who want to disrupt
Y2K celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility of (action) by a few groups, but what
scares me even more is the people who got taken down in Washington
(state). They just got caught by accident, and we didn't know
anything about them,'' said a veteran federal agent, who asked not
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scary is nothing is supposed to happen, but there are
some groups who want to force something to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   An FBI Web site mentions groups that may be planning attacks on
power stations, petroleum refineries and other installations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Texas DPS spokesman said no groups are monitored unless
there is an indication that ``they are actually engaged in a crime
or planning a crime. Just because someone has a kooky philosophy,
it doesn't make them illegal,'' said DPS spokesman Mike Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said all the state's 2,300 uniformed officers will be on
duty, and all nonuniformed officers, including Texas Rangers, will
be on call.
</P>
<P>
   The state Capitol will be closed from 5 p.m. Friday until 9 a.m.
Sunday, and extra members of the DPS Capitol police will be on
hand.

LINKS SEEN IN BORDER ARRESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   S_ The Algerian arrested two weeks ago after he ran from
U.S. Customs inspectors _ and a rental car loaded with explosives _
belongs to a notorious terrorist group blamed for massacres,
bombings and a hijacking, federal prosecutors now assert.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, prosecutors have linked Ahmed Ressam, who
remains in a federal detention center south of Seattle, with a
Canadian woman arrested after she tried to cross the border at a
remote port of entry in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were also media reports Thursday that a federal
judge in Seattle had issued an arrest warrant for a material
witness in the Ressam case. FBI agents and federal prosecutors
would not discuss the warrant, which has reportedly been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, law enforcement officials have issued a warrant and
are searching for Abdelmajed Dahoumane, whom officials believe
shared a motel room with Ressam before he left for Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been downplaying links between Ressam's arrest
and later arrests at the Canada-U.S. border in Vermont _ until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia Garofalo had an Algerian man with her when she was
arrested Dec. 19 _ five days after customs inspectors tackled and
apprehended a fleeing Ressam in Port Angeles. He had just arrived
on a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The link between them is a former roommate of Ressam's in
Montreal, said Charles Tetzlaff, U.S. attorney in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that the roommate, Said Atmani, was a forger
for an Algerian terrorist organization known as the Armed Islamic
Group, and that he helped pay for a trip Garofalo made to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Tetzlaff said prosecutors were not prepared to say that
Ressam and Garofalo had worked together to launch a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is that Mr. Atmani is a member of an Algerian
extremist organization. She had contact with Mr. Atmani, and we
know Mr. Atmani was a roommate of Mr. Ressam,'' Tetzlaff said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents, however, suggest the link was stronger than a
common acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of ... the fact that her crimes occurred
contemporaneously with Ressam's attempt to smuggle explosives into
the United States, it is likely that her actions were taken on
behalf of an Algerian terrorist organization or organizations,''
federal prosecutors argued in the documents, filed in the Vermont
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Because of the remarkable coincidence of the dates and
nexus with Montreal, it is similarly likely that her actions were
in some way connected to the actions of Ressam.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, an assistant U.S. attorney accused Garofalo
of ``working to assist terrorist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Seattle have not publicly linked Ressam
to any terrorist organizations, including the Armed Islamic Group,
which is known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
   The explosives found in Ressam's car have been sufficient to
persuade a federal magistrate to order him held without bail in a
dentention center in SeaTac. He faces up to 40 years in prison if
convicted of smuggling bomb-making components and lying to
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors in Vermont lack such physical evidence as
explosives, so they used intelligence provided by a foreign
government to allege terrorist connections.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that ``the possiblity _ indeed the probability _
exists that further information will come to light which will tie
her activities even more directly to those of Ressam. As such,
there is a substantial risk that the organization that supported
Ressam's activities will have every incentive to aid her flight
from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Jerome Neidermeier agreed to have Garofalo, who
faces immigration charges, held without bail. ``There are enough
factors in this to indicate something beyond a plan to enter
someone into in the United States,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described Garofalo, 35, as a mother of three who has
$8 in her checking account and lives on welfare in Montreal. Yet
she travels extensively, including to the U.S., European counties,
Morocco and Libya, and carries a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to bring Algerians into the United States through New
England three times in December. She was finally arrested trying to
cross the border with an Algerian _ Bouabide Chamachi, who is also
being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is also an Algerian, who has been unsuccessful in
trying to enter Canada from Germany. The foreign government told
U.S. officials that Garofalo contacted Atmani in September 1997 to
finance her airline ticket to Germany and to hire a lawyer for her
husband, according to the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Atmani agreed to meet her on a Montreal street corner and gave
her $700, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   His name has surfaced repeatedly since Ressam's arrest. French
authorities are interested in questioning him about a terrorist
bombing of the Paris subway in 1995. They also reported that Ressam
belonged to a cell of the GIA, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA is extreme even for terrorist groups. It has massacred
entire villages of men, women and children and declared women who
do not wear traditional Muslim veils fit targets for assassination.
It's actions are so bloody that even other terrorist groups have
condemned it.
</P>
<P>
   The GIA has been blamed for a 1994 hijacking in which terrorists
planned to blow up an Air France jet over Paris. Instead, French
commandos stormed the jet and killed the terrorists. The GIA also
has been blamed for bombings in France.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, its efforts have been limited to Algeria and
France, which supports the current Algerian government. Montreal
police say Algerian terrorists do operate in that city, using
extortion and thefts to fund overseas activities.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Cannistraro, a former counterterrorism chief at the CIA,
said he doubts the GIA is planning an attack on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a new thing? A GIA operation nipped in the bud? That
doesn't seem likely that the GIA would change its agenda,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a GIA operation. I'm persuaded that this is an Osama
bin Laden operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist, is blamed for bombing two
American embassies in Africa last year. Some members of the GIA are
thought to have fought and perhaps trained in Afghanistan, which is
bin Laden's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The information prosecutors released Thursday, along with the
FBI's launching of a nationwide effort to question and possibly
arrest those who know Ressam, underscores that there is an
infastructure of a terrorist group in the U.S., Cannistraro said.
</P>
<P>
   Another former intelligence official said it's quite possible
that Ressam and Garofalo know little about each other's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may or may not know anyone,'' said David Harris, former
chief of strategic planning for Canadian Security Intelligence
Service. ``Security calls for and enforces that. In a way, it's
more tricky than it appears to identify a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetzlaff would not identify the foreign government that provided
information to prosecutors. But Cannistraro said the government is
almost certainly Canada, whose law enforcement officials have been
working closely with their U.S. counterparts in the Ressam case.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, FBI agents and prosecutors would say little beyond
what was revealed in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's information that's going to have to stand on its own,''
said Robbie Burroughs, spokeswoman for the FBI in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Pflaumer, U.S. attorney for Western Washington, would
not say whether the information in court documents will prompt
additional charges against Ressam, including conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never speculate about charges,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: THE JOURNEY TO 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 31:
</P>
<P>
   The concluding day of the 20th century and therefore of the
second millennium _ that event so freighted with various meanings
by historians, politicians, fictionists and doomsaying preachers _
is upon us. With allowances for the dateline, it will fall
everywhere with equal finality, evoking all around the world the
same feelings of solemnity for humanity's catalog of travails and
triumphs, and stirring in every corner of our common planet the
desire to celebrate our hope for a peaceful and healing future.
Those aspirations will stir with an equal inexorability in quiet
villages on far continents and in the digital glitter of Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   At this newspaper, we cannot ignore the fact that the world's
most famous New Year's Eve party takes place on our doorstep. The
history of that party spans almost the entire century and is
intimately connected to that of The Times. The area was known as
Long Acre Square until 1904, when The Times moved to the area.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907 Adolph Ochs, who had purchased the newspaper 11 years
earlier, came up with the idea of lowering an illuminated globe
down a flagpole to mark the New Year. Ever since, Times Square has
been the center of New York's celebration, and with the coming of
the age of television, the teeming crowd that gathers to watch the
ball drop has become an international symbol of the passage from
the old year into the new.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night an expected 2 million people will jam themselves
into Times Square. Over a billion television viewers will be
watching them count down the last seconds of 1999. At the dawn of
the millennium, Times Square will become, in effect, the virtual
town square for a nation and indeed for a world reshaped by
revolutions in communications, transportation, medicine, commerce
and perhaps most forcefully by America's centurylong act of
self-invention. It is that chronicle of change that presses most
insistently forward as 2000 comes into view.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Luce of Time magazine put America at the center of the
story with a memorable term: the American Century. Those three
words convey unmistakable self-congratulation, but there should be
no artificial modesty about an overarching fact of the era. This is
a nation that within the memory of our oldest citizens used the
blood of its soldiers and the power of its founding idea to guide
the world away from totalitarian rule and economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the America that awaited t of 1900 was by no
means ready for its eventual role as guardian of what we now call
the free world. But the years around the turn from the 19th to the
20th century became the hinge of a new age. After the great labor
of filling up the continent, an inward-looking United States
expanded its vision and ambitions, grasping for leadership in a
world it had once ignored.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901 the only American president born in New York City,
Theodore Roosevelt, moved into the White House. By 1908 he would
enshrine progress and economic justice as national ideals. By
reclaiming powers Congress had been accreting since the Civil War,
he also created the powerful modern presidency as an institution
capable of shaping both this nation's goals and world events. In
the same period the country began to move rapidly toward the
urbanized, mass-consumer society as its dominant mode of living.
Products, style and money swirled together in a hurricane of social
exploration. In 1920, for the first time, a majority of Americans
lived in cities.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath these flurries of imperial ambition and middle-class
materialism, more spiritual aspirations were quickening as well _ a
yearning for a society that was as enlightened as it was
productive. That definitively American desire was captured in a
letter written in 1912 by one apostle of the machine age, Thomas
Edison, to another, Henry Ford. After surveying other societies,
Edison concluded that ``in a lot of respects we Americans are the
rawest and crudest of all. Our production, our factory laws, our
charities, our relations between capital and labor, our
distribution _ all wrong, out of gear. We've stumbled along for a
while, trying to run a new civilization in old ways, but we've got
to start to make this world over.''
</P>
<P>
   The idealistic desire to make the world over is the deepest
mystery of the American character and our signature national trait.
It was also the guiding influence in the century's thematic
political conflict _ the series of armed and unarmed struggles to
thwart tyranny. American idealism is mysterious because it has
always existed in a paradoxical linkage with greed, an alarming
tolerance for social injustice, and the racial blindness that
allowed the same mind that shaped the Declaration of Independence
to condone slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these flaws, the American vision of remaking the world
was built around a stainless philosophical core _ the twin ideals
of democratic self-government and individual liberty. These values
would prove decisive in World War I, then World War II and finally
the 50-year contest to block the Soviet Union's military
aspirations and its doctrine of monolithic state oppression. A
hundred years before the start of the watershed conflict of World
War II, Alexis de Tocqueville observed that citizens in a democracy
would be slow to enter wars and dangerously ineffective in the
early fighting. But, he predicted, they would ``easily turn into
good soldiers when once they have been torn from their business and
their pleasures.'' And he sensed that once engaged, they would not
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Less easy to foresee was that America and the West would have
the benefit in World War II of the century's most important leader,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He rallied, in his words, ``the
American people, in their righteous might'' and led the alliance
that defeated Adolf Hitler. On the humanitarian level, Roosevelt
and his planners failed greatly in ignoring the apex of Nazi evil,
the extermination of 6 million Jews. Nothing can erase the primal
nature of that lapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the victors' peace imposed by the next president, Harry S.
Truman, did provide a contrasting pinnacle of wisdom unlike
anything in the history of warfare. The Marshall Plan to lift a
wrecked Continent from the rubble was both a monument to American
idealism and a coup for strategic self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   For with Hitler's death, another, better-organized threat to
liberty arose in the Soviet Union. Unless America had revitalized
Europe, the Russian Bear would have ambled hungrily toward the
Atlantic. Instead it was blocked through containment, a new
doctrine that would prevent another global war but burden humanity
with a prolonged anxiety about nuclear annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, however, was not the weapon that produced the
concluding triumph of a century of expanding freedom. It was the
American economy and the worldwide influence of the popular culture
made possible by that economy. Robber-baron abuses and the Great
Depression had, through painful steps, produced a consensus on how
to manage capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   By regulation and taxation the government would curb the
cruelties of laissez-faire capitalism, but never so sternly as to
destroy the freedom of markets and the zeal of mold-breaking
entrepreneurs. Unlike Europeans and the Japanese, Americans were
get-rich-quick romantics willing to tolerate the huge, enduring
income gaps between the most affluent and the poorest that remain
the chief defect of the social contract governing their market
economy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The compensating factor was the creation of a huge middle class
and the attendant expansion of workers' ability to enjoy products
and pleasures once reserved for the elite. Through mass
communications, the images of America's generalized prosperity had
an impact that rattled totalitarian capitals. The Soviet Union
disintegrated when its economy could not sustain a decent standard
of living while also matching the United States in the renewed arms
race announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Americans are
still arguing whether his declaration of economic war on the ``Evil
Empire'' was the act of a simpleton or a visionary strategist. But
the shining fact is that the interplay between Reagan and the
Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev sped the destruction of a Soviet
empire dedicated to the denial of civil liberties and national
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   For America, the century ended with a triumphant maturing of the
concepts of freedom that a restless and innovative people had
carried fope and nursed into vibrancy in the rough cradle of
a frontier continent.
</P>
<P>
   The original American frontiers had to do with covering
geographic distance _ from coast to from farm to factory,
from hamlet to city or suburb. But the nation finishes the century
with many of its social frontiers uncrossed. Racial justice and
decent medical care are not yet a guaranteed part of every
citizen's birthright grant to ``life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.'' Our people need arms controls that limit both nuclear
weapons and the handguns on America's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on this New Year's Eve we still do not know if the
invention of the silicon chip will surpass that of nuclear weapons
as the signal technological event of the century. With visionary
leadership, we may dare to hope that the ultimate engine of war
will take second place in mankind's memory to a worldwide explosion
of knowledge. Yet what can be known in these last hours of the year
1999 should be saluted by the glowing orb in Times Square and with
toasts in living rooms across the land.
</P>
<P>
   It was a century in which freedom triumphed and generosity
became a global ideal because of the most distinctive of all
American inventions, a society based on the values of political
freedom, economic opportunity, individual worth and equal justice.
It is that invention that must be preserved and celebrated above
all others, for it is our national treasure and the world's.

EWING STARS AGAIN, SORT OF, AGAINST WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick Ewing was far from dominating, but he
ambled out of the millennium by slipping back into his superstar
skin Thursday night, if only in the minds of the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing made only 3 of 10 free-throw attempts and scraped up just
13 points to go with his 11 rebounds in 32 minutes. But for a New
York Knicks team that was looking for whatever meager help it could
find, Ewing's team-best seven fourth-quarter points were just
enough for New York to get by the Washington Wizards, 89-86, at the
MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' record improved to 18-12 despite allowing the
Wizards to make 8 of 15 shots from 3-point range while shooting
only 43.7 percent themselves. The Knicks were led by Larry
Johnson's 24 points and 19 from Allan Houston. The Wizards (10-20)
were led by Mitch Richmond's 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs nearly cost the Knicks the game. In an inexplicable
90-second meltdown, Childs single-handedly blew the Knicks'
four-point lead by turning over the ball twice and committing four
fouls to allow the Wizards to grab a 75-72 lead with 8 minutes left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks came back with their big men. Curiously, Latrell
Sprewell sat out much of the fourth quarter as Ewing and Johnson
became the go-to men in the post. Charlie Ward, a much calmer force
at point guard, came up with a series of superb defensive plays and
guided the Knicks to an 87-80 lead with 2 minutes 47 seconds left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   A player who has troubled the Knicks in the past, Tracy Murray,
brought the Wizards to within one point with 40 seconds remaining
after he hit a 3-pointer right after one delivered by Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   After Ward missed a jumper, Richmond came down the floor with a
chance to give the Wizards the lead, but Sprewell, playing just his
third minute of the fourth quarter, came up with a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, fouled on the play with 9.3 seconds left, then made
both free throws to give the Knicks an 86-83 lead, which proved too
much for Washington to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night provided a test of the Knicks' attention span.
They have had winning streaks, but they have yet to show the
consistent intensity of a team with nothing but winning on its
mind. After a run to the finals last spring, the Knicks have been
looking increasingly bored with the regular season; their energy in
practices has been suspect and their focus against inferior teams
like the Wizards has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of factors that go into it,'' coach Jeff Van
Gundy said before Thursday night's game. ``We're not doing bad, but
we're not always showing that hunger that you need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten older obviously,'' Van Gundy added, referring to
a team that has been together, for the most part, over the past
three years. ``But it's not just physically older, you can get
mentally older, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Their sharpness was up for inspection Thursday night against a
Wizards team that beat them in Madison Square Garden almost two
weeks ago. Ewing, coming off a miserable night against the Nets,
had his usual pride factor playing in front of fans who remember
him from his Georgetown days.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there was something missing early on as the Knicks fell
behind at the half, 43-42, after Murray came off the Washington
bench for eight points in the second quarter. The missing element
was Ewing. Just 12 seconds into the game, he picked up a foul.
After pleading his case with some choice words, he was hit with a
technical foul. Two minutes later, after his second foul, Ewing was
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   So the Knicks leaned oon, their other post threat. He
helped the Knicks counter Juwan Howard and pulled his team out of a
five-point hole in the first quarter with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   After Sprewell was burned on a couple of moves by Richard
Hamilton, the rookie from the University of Connecticut, Sprewell
came up with a driving layup and then a 3-pointer at the
first-quarter buzzer to give the Knicks a 27-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took an eight-point lead on a hook shot from John
Wallace midway through the second quarter. Their defense was
forcing the Wizards into 24-second violations and the ball was
moving to the open man.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Knicks allowed the Wizards to creep back into the
game. Murray cut the Knicks' lead to one point with a 3-pointer in
front of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Van Gundy went back to his big lineup, the Knicks
could not get a rebound or a stop on defense. With 2:17 left in the
half, Strickland looked Sprewell in the eye and pulled up for a
jumper to give the Wizards a lead that held until the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed a kick from someone, and turned to the woozy
Ward. He missed the game against the Nets on Tuesday because of the
flu and seemed out of it in the first half Thursday night. But he
found his legs after the half and delivered three 3-pointers in 3
minutes to put the Knicks ahead, 52-51, with 8 minutes left in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   After a back-and-forth stretch _ which included six lead changes
_ the Knicks finally grabbed the edge at the end of the quarter
with a 66-64 lead after a jumper from Houston with four seconds on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the chief thing separating the teams was
turnovers. The Knicks had just seven, while Washington had 15
turnovers that had resulted in 15 points. &QL;

 NETS WIN THEIR 9th STRAIGHT AT HOME 
 (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Se   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Keith Van Horn began Thursday night's
game with the look of a man in need of a hot bowl of soup, a
cluster of blankets over his body and bed rest. But he was
determined to play against the Orlando Magic despite suffering from
the flu.
</P>
<P>
   More than two hours later, at the end of a hard-fought contest
against one of the grittiest teams in the NBA, Van Horn looked
healed. His face was still flush and his expression pained, but his
play looked like anything but that of a sick man.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 20 points and grabbing 11 rebounds, Van Horn helped the
New Jersey Nets win their ninth straight game at Continental Arena
with a 102-92 victory over the Orlando Magic. The Nets' streak ties
a franchise record for consecutive home games. The original mark
was set over the final two games of the 1994-1995 season and the
first seven of the 1995-1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets held the Magic scoreless for the last 3 minutes 14
seconds and scored the final 10 points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey, whose club has won 10 of its last 13 games
after a 2-15 start, belittled the record, perhaps in an attempt to
keep things in perspective for a club that, despite its excellent
play of late, is only 12-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make too big of a deal out of that,'' Casey said. ``It's
typical of the NBA, where you have your peaks and your valleys.
Right now, we're in the middle of a peak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets and Magic battled for 48 minutes with the Nets taking
leads and the Magic fighting back to pull close. With just over 3
minutes left, Orlando (15-14) tied the game at 92-92 and seemed to
have the momentum. But the Magic never scored again.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, who fell just one rebound shy of his first
career triple-double with 21 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds,
started the run with a driving layup and free throw. Then Van Horn
knocked a pass by the Magic's Darrell Armstrong to Kendall Gill (16
points), who fed a streaking Kerry Kittles downcourt. Kittles was
fouled and made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, after another stop by the Nets, Van Horn drove
baseline around Pat Garrity and dunked over former Net Chris
Gatling to put the Nets ahead, 99-92, with 1:55 remaining. When
Kittles (13 points) sank a 3-pointer less than 30 seconds later,
the Magic were through.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who got 16 points and 15 rebounds from Jamie Feick,
started the first three quarters the same way, jumping out to
substantial leads only to see Orlando rally. After seeing leads of
nine and eight disappear during the first two quarters, the Nets
turned a 54-50 halftime lead into an 11-point advantage early in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, with two 3-pointers, and Van Horn, with one, led the
charge that gave the Nets a seemingly commanding 67-56 lead with
just under 9 minutes remaining in the quarter. But Orlando scored
the next seven points and it was close the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, who was moved from New Jersey as a part of the Marbury
trade, led Orlando with six points in the quarter to pull the Magic
within 79-76 heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the game with a burst, the Nets looked ready to run
easily to their 10th victory of December. After Orlando scored the
first five points, the Nets scored 21 of the next 28, including a
14-0 run that was highlighted by several eye-pleasing plays. Van
Horn scored in transition on a dazzling layup in which he raised
the ball skyward with one hand, brought it back into his belly to
avoid a defender and then laid it in with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Gill made a steal and ended up lofting a lob pass
toward the rim for a rising Marbury. Catching the ball with two
hands, Marbury dunked it softly with his right to the crowd's
delight. When Gill made another steal midway through the quarter
and scored on an easy dunk that made it 21-12, it seemed as if the
Nets would roll.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic pulled within one point, 29-28, by quarter's end.
The leaders of Orlando's charge were Tariq Abdul-Wahad and reserve
John Amaechi, a little-known center who spent the past three
seasons playing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets started strongly in the second quarter as well, pushing
the lead to eight points, 42-34, after 4 1-2 minutes. But again,
Orlando responded, pulling within a point several times before
settling for a four-point deficit at intermission.

 &HT;    Mississippi State rings Clemson's bell in Peach Bowl
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For 30 futile minutes, it seemed every imaginable Y2K
glitch had simultaneously hit Mississippi State and Clemson a day
early. But then State righted itself behind Starkville's most
advanced technology: a blitz-happy defense that turned Thursday
night, well, Peachy.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Madkin ran for one fourth-quarter touchdown and threw for
a second on a 15-yard screen pass to Dontae Walker to give No. 16
Mississippi State a 17-7 victory over Clemson in the Peach Bowl.
Yet a Peach-record crowd of 73,315 in the Georgia Dome knew it was
the Bulldogs' top-rated defense that enabled State to finish 10-2
for just the second 10-win season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, meanwhile, finished 6-6 after losing in the Peach Bowl
for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   On a balmy night in Atlanta, a Peach Bowl record crowd came
indoors with great anticipation. Clemson was back in the Peach Bowl
for the third time in four years; but more important, the Tigers
were back in the bowl business under Tommy Bowden. Mississippi
State, meanwhile, in its third Peach in eight years, was back in
the Georgia Dome, where the Bulldogs nearly upset Tennessee in the
1998 SEC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   This night, the dome was packed and alternately awash in orange
and maroon. And that incessant clanging? The sound of the
Starkville Stradivarius, the cowbells State fans so love to shake.
Yet in the first half, while there was a whole lotta shakin' going
on, there was little else offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Bowden's offensive imagination, Mississippi State
answered with the nation's top-ranked defense, Joe Lee Dunn's
blitz-happy bunch. But Clemson, too, shut down Mississippi State's
offense _ not surprising given the Bulldogs' lack of firepower and
the presence of Keith Adams, Clemson's sophomore linebacker from
College Park, Ga., and the ACC defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But even by Peach Bowl standards, where the last 15 games have
been decided by an average of 3.2 points, this first half was
remarkable. Your score at halftime: 0-0, the first scoreless first
half in the Peach Bowl's 32-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1966, when Vanderbilt clung to a 3-0 halftime lead
over Texas Tech in what became a 6-6 draw and the only tie in Peach
Bowl annals, had a Peach first half proved so impotent. In the
first half, the teams combined for 11 punts (eight in the second
quarter alone) and committed three turnovers. Four, counting a
blocked Clemson field goal attempt on the Tigers' most dangerous
scoring threat of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Streeter, who dislocated his hip Nov. 13 at Georgia Tech
on his last visit to Atlanta, was back starting at quarterback from
Clemson. On the game's first play from scrimmage, Streeter hit Rod
Gardner for 37 yards to the State 39. When Clemson went for it on
fourth-and-2, Streeter's play-action pass was intercepted at the 10
by Fred Smoot. Even worse, Travis Zachery, the Clemson tailback and
the Tigers' leading rusher, dislocated his right elbow hitting
Smoot and was lost for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Behind quarterback Wayne Madkin, Mississippi State could do
nothing offensively against Clemson. Not that it mattered. When
Streeter passed Clemson to a first-and-goal at the State 9, the
Bulldogs stiffened. When Tony Lazzara tried a 25-yard field goal,
Robert Bean blocked it, his fifth blocked kick of the season. After
Barrin Simpson picked the ball up and ran a bit, he lateraled to
Smoot, who returned it to the Clemson 39.
</P>
<P>
   When Adams recovered a Mississippi State fumble at the State 28
early in the second quarter, Woody Dantzler replaced Streeter at
quarterback for Clemson. On the second play, Dantzler's pass was
deflected at the line and intercepted by Ashley Cooper. It was
another of several costly Clemson mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   On State's next two possessions, Madkin was penalized for
intentional grounding. No matter. Clemson missed a chance to
recover a fumbled punt, then meekly punted on its next possession.
Dantzler finally had the Tigers moving late in the half, sweeping
for 19 yards, then keeping for three more to the State 29. But
Dantzler was sacked on consecutive plays by defensive end ConnerStephens, losing 11 yards, then eight more and resulting in the
11th punt.
</P>
<P>
   When might someone score? When cows fly? No, when Pig flies.
After Pig Prather took the second-half kickoff 45 yards to the
State 47, Madkin completed three straight passes for 33 yards.
Although State stalled, Scott Westerfield kicked a 39-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 3-0 entering the fourth quarter, even after
Streeter returned at quarterback for Clemson and, with State
blitzing and in man-to-man coverage, hit Brian Wofford for 47 yards
to the State 16. But on fourth-and-7, Bowden eschewed the field
goal and went for it. Defensive tackle John Hilliard leaped,
however, and knocked down the pass at the line of scrimmage.

FBI FINDS MORE LINKS TO SUSPECTED ALGERIAN TERRORIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An FBI roundup in five states Thursday resulted in
arrests of at least nine people, including one linked to a
suspected Algerian terrorist accused of smuggling explosives into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The nine arrests came as federal authorities detained dozens of
people for questioning less than 48 hours before Americans begin
celebrating the new year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 40 people were interviewed in Texas, New York,
California, Massachusetts and Washington about possible links to
Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested crossing the U.S.-Canadian border
near Seattle in a car loaded with bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani, one of four arrested in New York, was charged with
``concealing his material support'' for Ressam's effort ``to
violate federal explosive laws.'' Ghani, an Algerian national, also
was charged with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The eight others were charged in Boston and New York with
immigration violations. No one in Houston or Dallas was charged.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials decided to launch the exercise after determining
``it was time to do overt interviews'' based on information
gathered since Ressam's arrest on Dec. 14 and the border arrest
four days later of a woman linked to an Algerian terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   An official acknowledged that, in addition to gathering
information about Ressam, the ``series of concerted interviews''
was timed to send a signal to would-be terrorists who may be
targeting the United States during the holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed Thursday allege that Ressam and Ghani are
part of a plan involving aliases, fake passports and a rental car
loaded with explosives that was to be dropped off for an
unidentified accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they have not identified any city that
might be a focus of any attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ghani's arrest and the questioning of others are ``part of
efforts to pursue all information regarding the risk of any planned
attacks,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York. She
said inquiries so far have ``not suggested any specific and
credible threats against any particular targets, either in New York
or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Clark, special agent in charge of the FBI's Houston office,
said the ``possibility of terrorism always exists,'' but nothing
indicates a specific, immediate threat in Houston. ``I'd like to
think that because of the things that we have done, we have
lessened that possibility,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, FBI agent Lori Bailey confirmed that interviews were
being conducted with people there ``who have been identified in the
investigation (of Ressam) as having information that might be
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied any racial tinge to the interviews. ``No one is being
targeted because of their religious or ethnic backgrounds,'' Bailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   All five of those arrested in Boston are Algerian nationals. One
of them was the only person to resist authorities, who ended up
chasing the man with guns drawn, a helicopter hovering overhead and
police dogs combing the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The roundup occurred as prosecutors in Vermont drew a link
between a Canadian woman, Lucia Garofalo, and the Armed Islamic
Group, a militant Algerian group blamed for terrorist activities in
Europe and Africa. Prosecutors also have tied Ressam to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo was arrested Dec. 19 as she drove into the United
States from Canada in a vehicle carrying Bouabide Chamchi, an
Algerian national who allegedly has a fake French passport.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities detained the pair when alera bomb-sniffing
dog that the vehicle Garofalo was driving was carrying explosives.
A search yielded no explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo was charged with illegally transporting aliens into the
United States, an activity that U.S. Attorney David Kirby said was
funded by Said Atmani, an activist in the Armed Islamic Group and a
former roommate of Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Atmani also is a leading document-forger for the group, Kirby
said at a federal court hearing in Burlington, Vt., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby said there is ``a direct link between (Garofalo) and
someone who is charged with committing crimes, which appear to be
precursors to acts of terrorism in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ghani's arrest in New York on Thursday, authorities said
he had traveled to Seattle Dec. 11 under an assumed name. Ghani
returned to New York immediately after Ressam's Dec. 14 arrest as
he tried to enter the United States at Port Angeles, Wash., about
65 miles northwest of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When Ressam was arrested, authorities said, he was carrying a
piece of paper with Ghani's name and Brooklyn phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam and Ghani allegedly planned to travel to Chicago and
other cities to raise money for a terrorist organization not named
in the federal documents filed Thursday with a federal court in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Ghani alleged that a confidential source said
Ressam had been assigned by the group to drive the explosive-laden
vehicle ``to a parking lot and walk away from it.'' The indictment
said another person later was to retrieve the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The car that Ressam allegedly was driving when he was arrested
initially was believed to have been carrying common nitroglycerine.
The liquid turned out to be RDX, or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine,
a compound used by military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Wednesday said there was enough RDX in the vehicle to
destroy a major building.

BURGER KING NAMED IN LAWSUIT OVER POKEMON TOYS

<P>
   DALLAS _ Burger King, under fire from the federal government for
failing to recall a potentially hazardous Pokemon toy distributed
with its children's meals, was named in a nationwide class-action
lawsuit Wednesday filed by a Dallas woman who bought several of the
meals for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Winder filed the suit in Dallas County Court-at-Law
after hearing news reports that Burger King had refused to recall
the toys until the death of a 13-month-old Sonoma, Calif., girl was
suffocated by a piece of the Pokemon toy covering her mouth and
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Winder could not be reached for comment, but her attorney, Jeff
Rasansky, said she contacted him after a partial recall was made
Monday and ``asked what we could do about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided this was the proper course,'' Rasansky said of the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit did not specify damages, and Rasansky said a dollar
amount will be determined after more information is obtained
through the discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   After the California child suffocated on Dec. 11, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission asked Burger King, based in
Miami, to recall the toys or to stop distributing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused on both counts,'' commission spokesman Russ Rader
told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Kansas man reported that he found his 18-month-old
daughter with half a Pokemon ball covering her mouth and nose. He
removed the object before she was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King announced a partial recall Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious that those toys pose a significant risk to
young children,'' Rasansky said. ``I think it is appalling that
Burger King has used this promotion to market and sell millions of
dollars worth of dangerous toys to children.''
</P>
<P>
   His client, he said, purchased several of the children's meals
solely for the Pokemon toys, and was outraged when she learned that
were potentially deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials could not be reached for comment Thursday.

   Best Operating System _ Caldera OpenLinux 2.3
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Linux has come a long, long way. No, Linux is still not
ready for everyday users, but for those who need a Unix-like
operating system, or for PC enthusiasts who want to see what the
buzz is all about, this is your best choice. (Linux zealots: before
you start whining, ask yourself _ would you let your mom install
and get Linux running on her own? I didn't think so!)
</P>
<P>
   The Caldera version of Linux is particularly friendly to Windows
users, with tools that make it easy for Windows and Linux to
coexist on the same hard drive. Version 2.3 has an improved setup
routine that is better at automatically detecting both video and
sound cards. It also comes with a copy of WINE, which lets you run
Windows programs within Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Best Office Suite _ Corel WordPerfect Office 2000
</P>
<P>
   Marred by bugs, feature bloat and a serious design error in Word
(each new document opens in a separate, free-floating window,
cluttering up the desktop), Microsoft's ambitious Office 2000 gets
knocked aside by the more elegantly enhanced WordPerfect Office.
</P>
<P>
   The various components of the suite interact better, and a
version is available that integrates a version of Dragon Systems'
Naturally Speaking voice recognition software. WordPerfect remains
easier to use than Word, and now comes with a slick feature that
previews formatting changes before they are applied to a document.
</P>
<P>
   Best Internet Software _ Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0
</P>
<P>
   For now, anyway, the browser wars are over and Microsoft has
prevailed. Internet Explorer 5.0 is incredibly useful, fast and
easy to customize.
</P>
<P>
   From the way it organizes its history list _ in folders based on
day, week or even month, if you go back that far _ to its dynamic
search feature that taps into multiple search engines at once, IE5
is a Net junkie's dream.
</P>
<P>
   IE5 has a dark cloud to its silver lining, though: installing it
via the Web can be troublesome. If you're upgrading, do it by
ordering the CD from Microsoft's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And IE5's supremacy isn't likely to be challenged anytime soon,
since Netscape Communicator 5 continues to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Best Utility _ WildFile's GoBack 2.1
</P>
<P>
   Every PC user knows that sinking feeling when something goes
horribly wrong. And every PC user has longed for something that
will instantly set things right.
</P>
<P>
   GoBack is that product. It keeps track of everything that
happens on your PC, keeping a record of changes to files and the
Windows Registry. If something nasty occurs, you can roll back to a
point in the past where your system was working perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   GoBack works quietly in the background, consumes minimal system
resources, and works as advertised. More utility programs should be
as well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   Best Music Software _ MusicMatch Jukebox 4.4
</P>
<P>
   Looking for easy-to-use software for playing all kinds of music
files, as well as audio CDs? Music Match is friendly, works well
and can use almost every music file format out there.
</P>
<P>
   MusicMatch can not only play MP3, WAV and Windows Media files on
your hard drive, but it also can handle streaming audio and video
pulled in from the Internet. It interacts with the CD Database on
the Net, pulling in song titles and artist names when you use it to
listen to a CD.
</P>
<P>
   It also can convert CD songs to MP3 and other formats. Once you
register and pay for the program, you get lifetime upgrades to any
new version.
</P>
<P>
   Best Game _ Microprose's Roller Coaster Tycoon
</P>
<P>
   A great game is one that holds your interest, drawing you in and
becoming more of an obsession than a mere diversion. Roller Coaster
Tycoon, a surprise hit for 1999, definitely qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   In this outstanding simulation title, you build and design
roller coasters and the parks they reside in. Success depends on
how well you design the rides and manage the parks.
</P>
<P>
   Are your coasters too wild? Guests will complain of neck pains
and refuse to ride. Prices too high? You'll drive customers away.
Not enough garbage cans or maintenance personnel, and patrons
complain about the mess. And, of course, be sure you have enough
restrooms.

CALM MARKS INDIVIDUALS' PREPARATIONS FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 and ALICIA A. CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Procrastinating millennialists filled shopping carts
with bottled water and bulk goods Thursday while others who share
their concern about the Y2K computer bug tanked up on propane.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers reported brisk sales of water and bottled fuel while
long lines could be found at bulk goods purveyors such as Costco.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the next to last day of 1999 looked just like
any other. No lines at gas stations or bank ATMs. But signs of Y2K
frenzy could be seen if you looked in the right places.
</P>
<P>
   Ahwatukee resident Beverly Jankowski was clearly preparing her
contingency plan, but she's no procrastinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it (stocking up) for over a year now,''
Jankowski said while loading her car with paper plates, cups and
storable foods from an overloaded cart at the Costco at Elliot Road
and Priest Drive in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Jankowski had long ago stocked up on water and other essentials,
but was adding to her stash. She said she may be able to help
others in her neighborhood in the event of Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fortunate that I can do it,'' she said. ``I hope that
I can be that good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping for the best, but prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Costco Assistant Manager Monica Delio said she has seen
increased sales of batteries and power generators.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the store's 20 registers were open, and all lanes
were full.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based U-Haul International said that nationwide, its
sales of propane were up 30 percent this week over the comparable
week last year.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, last-minute shoppers overburdened several Phoenix
area Water 'n Ice shops Thursday, forcing some to close early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep up with demand,'' Manager Ben Adams said at a
central Phoenix Water 'n Ice shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been busy all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he started the day with his usual 800-gallon reserve.
His reverse osmosis filtering equipment makes a gallon and a half
per minute, but it started losing ground early in the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, he was starting to turn customers away.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he doesn't expect any computer problems with the new
year. Any extra money he makes before the end of the year will be
balanced out by slow sales in early 2000.

   ``I won't have any business next week,'' he said. ``Everybody
will already have all the water they want.''

   Safeway spokeswoman Debra Albery said the chain's stores had all
reported moderate increases in sales of bottled water. She said
stores had ample supplies in storerooms to restock shelves. The
company has its own filtering plant and can ship water to stores
every day, if necessary, she said.

   ``We don't expect to run out,'' Albery said.

   No ATM lines turned up in an unscientific survey of a half-dozen
central Phoenix banks.

   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said she wasn't surprised. Her bank
hadn't seen any signs of last-minute hoarding of cash.

   ``It's really been business as usual,'' Marjorie Rice said.

   At the Texaco station at Camelback Road and Interstate 17,
attendant Larry Stice said he'd sold extra propane over the past
couple of days, but there'd been no lines at the gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Stice said he didn't think people were worried about Y2K. But
still, he'd worked out his own contingency plan for the midnight
rollover.

<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' he said with a laugh. ``We shut
down at 10.'' &QL;

 &HT;    With Sherrill, there's joy in Starkville
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

   ATLANTA _ Well, no matter how many times they come to the city,
you just can't take the ``cow'' out of Cow College. And if there
was any doubt in your mind, they bring along their cowbells to ring
it home to you. Mississippi State has a coach who has been to some
big towns, seen some bright lights, had some high times _ he has
even been to Pittsburgh _ but when he got to Starkville, he never
tried to change a thing. He got a cowbell and started ringing along
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Just to prove he was one of them, he had a bull castrated on the
practice field one day. Had something to do with somebody's
manhood, they way I heard it. It didn't set too well with a certain
segment of society, so he didn't resume his surgical act on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   What Jackie Sherrill has done is bring a lot of joy to the
hearts of these bell-ringers. Mississippi State used to run through
coaches like movie stars run through marriages. Get a good one,
have a good season and he was gone before he even unpacked the
furniture. Not Jackie Sherrill. He got there, he nailed his shoes
to the ground and said that's where he was hanging his hat until he
coached his last.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he wanted to do, needed to do before he did that,
though, was not go home from Atlanta empty one more time. He
wanted, needed to win the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl game. He'd been
here twice when it was just plain Peach Bowl, and lost both times;
maybe adding the chicken was just the spice he needed.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the first half was a real fooler. The Bulldogs in maroon
could hardly get out of their own shadow. In the first quarter, for
instance, they had the ball for only nine plays. They gained only
46 yards. Clemson gained 156. With the end zone in sight, though,
the Tigers were a hazard to their own health. The one time they had
a scoring chance, Tony Lazarra's field goal attempt not only was
blocked, but Barrin Simpson picked up the loose ball and by the
time the lint settled on the rug, Mississippi State had the ball on
Clemson's 39-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs lost two, gained five and punted. It was that kind
of half for them. There wasn't much for the cowbells to ring about.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since LSU beat Florida State in the first of
these 31 games, two teams had played a scoreless half. It was a
record that may be tied, but never bettered. Or worsened.
</P>
<P>
   But, stay the course. Once State broke the scoring ice with a
field goal in the third quarter, Sherrill's offense began to shift
into gear. It didn't create a flood of offense. In fact, it
required some disturbing calls by this imported officiating crew
from the Big Ten. (The SEC has no monopoly on officiating
botchery.)
</P>
<P>
   Two pass interference calls in a row moved the ball from the
Clemson 23-yard line to the two, from which point Wayne Madkin, the
quarterback, took off on a sprint and made it into the end zone at
the pylon. Finally, a touchdown after a little over 48 minutes of
sterile offensives.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs went into some aerobic synchrony on the sideline
after the score, a rather strange scene on a college football
field, and came out from the kickoff doing somersaults and high
kicks, after which Clemson, with some officiating aid of its own,
moved 70 yards, the last one of which was maneuvered by Streeter on
a quarterback sneak.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State scored once more, not without another
controversial pass interference call, and Jackie Sherrill had
cemented his person in Starkville history forever. His team had won
its 10th game, and only one other State team before had done it.
That was way back in 1940, a team coached by Allyn McKeen, now in
the College Hall of Fame. This team is no threat to that in the
hearts of old-time Bulldogs. It was a team that produced State's
first All-American, Buddy Elrod, an end, and a great running back
with the interesting name of Blondy Black.
</P>
<P>
   As for this game, it was not one to coddle in your memory. It
was sloppy, full of penalties _ not all merited _ one half
dominated by defense, the other by wild and reckless offense.
Clemson led in everything offensive, except penalties, which cost
Mississippi State 188 yards. But five interceptions, a lost fumble
and the surely the early arrival of Y2K effects must have cluttered
up the Clemson offense. As Peach Bowls go, it was not a portrait to
be hung on a museum wall.
