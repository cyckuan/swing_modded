<HEADLINE>  Kwan Stronger After Olympic Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sure, Michelle Kwan was a little  
teary-eyed when Tara Lipinski won the gold medal at the Nagano 
Olympics. And yes, it was a little tough to hear the national 
anthem and know it wasn't playing for her. 
</P>
<P>
	But for anyone who expected her to be depressed for the next  
four years, get over it. She got a silver medal and additional 
inner strength out of her Olympic experience, and she's not about 
to apologize for either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only took me a few moments to get myself together after the  
Olympics, because I had other things to look forward to,'' she said 
Tuesday. ``A lot of things happened for the good and for the 
better. I don't think if I could go back in time, I don't think I'd 
change anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped me grow as a person and as an athlete. So I think it  
was meant to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan has been stronger and more formidable than ever -- if that's  
possible -- since leaving Nagano. She won her second world title and 
the world professional title, and has a nine-event winning streak 
going. 
</P>
<P>
	She comes to this week's U.S. Figure Skating Championships as  
the overwhelming favorite to win her third crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that I would still be in the same position if I did  
win the gold,'' she said. ``I love competing, I love what I'm 
doing. They always say don't change what you love doing, and I love 
what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And believe it or not, she'd love it even more if Lipinski had  
stuck around for another few years. Lipinski gave up her Olympic 
eligibility six weeks after winning gold, leaving Kwan in a class 
by herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Lipinski captured some titles Kwan wishes she had,  
it's just not going to be as fun without her effervescent foe. 
Without Lipinski, there may be other skaters, but there's no 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great when the best skaters are out there. That  
is pure competition, that's what I love,'' Kwan said. ``So I do 
miss her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always like this,'' she said, holding up two fingers  
close together. ``It was great for us. Every time I would go on the 
ice, I would always go out there and say, `I need to work harder 
and harder because she is always there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Kwan and coach Frank Carroll are going to have to find  
their own motivations. This week, it's the U.S. championship. 
</P>
<P>
	While almost everyone -- other skaters, other coaches, the media  
-- seems to think Kwan is a lock for the title, that's not how she 
and Carroll see it. She's added a triple-triple jump combination to 
make her program more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	With a short program to ``Carmen'' and free skate to ``Ariane,''  
she's determined to expand the emotion and expressiveness for which 
she's already known. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle and I don't think of the nationals as an easy  
competition,'' Carroll said. ``We respect this title very well and 
we plan to go after it with a vengeance. We're not here for casual 
play. We mean to skate well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd really like her to do a bang-up job here to show how much  
she's improved,'' he added. ``I think she's really going to do it 
up right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she plans to keep doing it. She's sticking around for the  
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, and she joked Tuesday that she 
might have to hang around for 2006, too. 
</P>
<P>
	While other skaters have traded their Olympic and national  
medals for the less stressful life of touring, three months of 
shows in the summer is plenty for Kwan. She wants to skate and she 
wants to compete, and the tours and pro-ams aren't enough to 
satisfy her competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's the pleasure of skating,'' she said. ``That's  
what it all comes down to. Skating. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I stop loving to skate, that's when it's time to walk  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The championships began Tuesday night with the compulsory dance.  
With five-time champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow now 
professionals, their former training partners, Naomi Lang and Peter 
Tchernyshev, took first place after the compulsories, worth 20 
percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	Just behind were Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates.

<HEADLINE> One of 3 Escaped Inmates Captured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS, N.M. (AP) -- One of three inmates who apparently  
shimmied up pipes and cut a hole through the roof of a jail was 
captured today in a canyon area nearby, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Tapia, 18, was arrested about 20 miles southwest of San  
Miguel County jail, state police Capt. Rudy Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man was arrested with Tapia but Acosta said he wasn't  
one of the escapees. Among the two still at large was 26-year-old 
Roger Dale Yeadon, who pleaded guilty in a carjack slaying and has 
a history of breakouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The inmates were last seen Sunday night before the final lockup.  
They stuffed their beds to make it look like they were asleep and 
weren't discovered missing until Monday morning, jail administrator 
Levi Borunda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities scoured cabins in the canyon area near the jail 118  
miles northeast of Albuquerque. Tapia, accused of the gang-related 
shooting of a 17-year-old, was being interviewed at a state police 
office in Las Vegas after he was captured. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon pleaded guilty to carjack resulting in death in the 1996  
shooting of Maj. David Graham Nichols, a British officer attending 
a conference at an air base in Albuquerque. At the time, Yeadon was 
an escapee from Alabama -- his fourth escape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon was serving 18 years and had been held in Las Vegas for  
more than two years while awaiting assigned to a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The three apparently shimmied up pipes that led to the ceiling,  
made their way to the roof, then cut a hole and escaped, Borunda 
said. They likely had outside help, said Darren White, the state 
public safety secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The other escapee, 20-year-old John Edward Sanchez, was in the  
jail for a probation violation on a burglary charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jail authorities had been told to keep Yeadon in maximum  
security, in part because he was considered an escape risk, U.S. 
Marshal John Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeadon was moved out of segregation Thursday because he had not  
caused problems and was considered less of a security risk, Borunda 
said. Jail officials needed to house two high-risk inmates in the 
segregation area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal marshals were not notified as required when Yeadon was  
moved into the general population, Borunda said. He did not give a 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, vice commander of the Defence School of Languages in  
England, was en route to a conference at Kirtland Air Force Base in 
Albuquerque when he was carjacked.

<HEADLINE> Diet Industry Given New Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The multibillion-dollar diet industry should  
beef up the information it gives people trying to slim down, a 
government-created coalition says. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary guidelines cover the costs and risks of  
weight-loss programs, but not what people really want to know: How 
many pounds they can expect to lose. The Federal Trade Commission 
and other members of the group -- including consumer and health 
advocates as well as industry representatives -- will release the 
guidelines Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the coalition, called the Partnership for Healthy  
Weight Management, said they hope consumers will use the guidelines 
when choosing weight-loss programs. Americans spend about $33 
billion a year in their efforts to shed pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government could impose regulations if the industry ignores  
the voluntary guidelines, which the coalition worked on for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very happy that we have gotten this far,'' said Lynn  
McAfee, of the Philadelphia-based Council on Size &AMP; Weight 
Discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines suggest that companies alert consumers that  
``most people who lose weight are likely to find it difficult to 
keep the weight off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, consumer groups and health professionals are far  
from agreeing on whether they can come up with an accurate measure 
of typical weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been struggling with these issues, but we realize  
there's not a one-size-fits-all disclosure,'' said Warren Dennis, 
outside general counsel for the Jenny Craig program. ``We think a 
lot of these disclosures are meaningless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis said the results of weight-loss programs vary so much  
from individual to individual and are dependent on so many factors 
that determining their effectiveness is extremely difficult. It's 
even tough to figure out how many people successfully maintain 
their weight loss after a few years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the companies have a good idea about how much their  
clients lose on average,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of 
legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
``This is not rocket science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines do seek to put more upfront information in  
consumers' hands. Providers of weight-loss services or products, 
including physicians, nutritionists and commercial centers, are 
asked to give clients a detailed description of program contents, 
goals and staff qualifications. They should provide an estimate of 
total costs, including mandatory food purchases or medical tests 
required by the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy emphasis is placed on giving consumers information about  
the health risks of obesity, trying to shift the focus away from 
dropping pounds solely for cosmetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``People enter weight-loss programs because they want to lose a  
whole lot of weight to be a size six or eight. They don't want to 
hear that just losing 20 pounds has health benefits,'' said Tracy 
Fox, a registered dietitian with the American Dietetic 
Association's government affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health says about 55 percent of  
American adults are overweight or obese -- up from 43 percent in 
1960. The extra weight can mean increased risk of heart disease, 
high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, gallbladder disease, 
arthritis, sleep and breathing problems and some types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to talk about looking better, but when your health  
is involved it's not quite as easy,'' said Harry Greene, medical 
director for Slim Fast Foods. ``Having agreed to this, we'll be 
much more forthright on giving out information on the health 
benefits weight loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slim Fast, Jenny Craig and Novartis Nutrition Corp., which runs  
the Optifast plan, were among the coalition's industry 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies also should inform consumers of risks associated with  
the weight-loss programs, says the FTC. For example, losing weight 
too rapidly can increase dangers of developing gallbladder disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders believe that following the guidelines will not  
amount to a significant change of practice, particularly since many 
of them already are under consent orders with the government that 
prevent them from making false claims about their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Some worry that smaller operations --making more outlandish  
promises-- won't follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the FTC hopes is that the competitive pressures will  
drive other companies in the industry to follow,'' said 
Silverglade, who expressed doubts this would happen without 
mandatory regulations. Jenny Craig also is asking the commission to 
step up enforcement of the worst offenders.

<HEADLINE> Gibson's `Payback' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Gibson's latest blow-'em-up flick,  
``Payback,'' blasted to the top of the weekend movie pack, ending 
the recent teen-oriented choke hold at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playback,'' which stars Gibson as an anti-hero out to settle a  
few scores after a vicious double-cross, had the best opening of 
the year with $21.2 million in ticket sales, according to final 
industry figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film dumped the high school romance ``She's All That'' and  
upset the debut of another teen-age love story, ``Simply 
Irresistible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of regular season football, Gibson's mostly male,  
older fans returned to theaters in droves, industry analysts said. 
Paramount had held back ``Payback'' over the summer so it wouldn't 
clash with another Gibson film, ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That'' collected $11.7 million for second place  
while ``Patch Adams'' had $4.4 million for third. ``Varsity 
Blues,'' sharing the youth audience with ``She's All That,'' 
grossed $3.8 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of  
television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' debuted with a 
disappointing $2.23 million for ninth place, stung by bad reviews 
and fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which DreamWorks re-released to cash in  
on its Golden Globe wins and the buzz surrounding the Academy Award 
nominations, was at No. 5 with $3.6 million. Another film with 
Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' was sixth with $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky coming-of-age story ``Rushmore,'' starring Bill  
Murray, did strong business in limited release, grossing $1.8 
million on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of just 
under $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday through

<HEADLINE>  Kwan Stronger After Olympic Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sure, Michelle Kwan was a little  
teary-eyed when Tara Lipinski won the gold medal at the Nagano 
Olympics. And yes, it was a little tough to hear the national 
anthem and know it wasn't playing for her. 
</P>
<P>
	But for anyone who expected her to be depressed for the next  
four years, get over it. She got a silver medal and additional 
inner strength out of her Olympic experience, and she's not about 
to apologize for either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only took me a few moments to get myself together after the  
Olympics, because I had other things to look forward to,'' she said 
Tuesday. ``A lot of things happened for the good and for the 
better. I don't think if I could go back in time, I don't think I'd 
change anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helped me grow as a person and as an athlete. So I think it  
was meant to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan has been stronger and more formidable than ever -- if that's  
possible -- since leaving Nagano. She won her second world title and 
the world professional title, and has a nine-event winning streak 
going. 
</P>
<P>
	She comes to this week's U.S. Figure Skating Championships as  
the overwhelming favorite to win her third crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that I would still be in the same position if I did  
win the gold,'' she said. ``I love competing, I love what I'm 
doing. They always say don't change what you love doing, and I love 
what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And believe it or not, she'd love it even more if Lipinski had  
stuck around for another few years. Lipinski gave up her Olympic 
eligibility six weeks after winning gold, leaving Kwan in a class 
by herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Lipinski captured some titles Kwan wishes she had,  
it's just not going to be as fun without her effervescent foe. 
Without Lipinski, there may be other skaters, but there's no 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great when the best skaters are out there. That  
is pure competition, that's what I love,'' Kwan said. ``So I do 
miss her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always like this,'' she said, holding up two fingers  
close together. ``It was great for us. Every time I would go on the 
ice, I would always go out there and say, `I need to work harder 
and harder because she is always there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Kwan and coach Frank Carroll are going to have to find  
their own motivations. This week, it's the U.S. championship. 
</P>
<P>
	While almost everyone -- other skaters, other coaches, the media  
-- seems to think Kwan is a lock for the title, that's not how she 
and Carroll see it. She's added a triple-triple jump combination to 
make her program more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	With a short program to ``Carmen'' and free skate to ``Ariane,''  
she's determined to expand the emotion and expressiveness for which 
she's already known. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle and I don't think of the nationals as an easy  
competition,'' Carroll said. ``We respect this title very well and 
we plan to go after it with a vengeance. We're not here for casual 
play. We mean to skate well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd really like her to do a bang-up job here to show how much  
she's improved,'' he added. ``I think she's really going to do it 
up right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she plans to keep doing it. She's sticking around for the  
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, and she joked Tuesday that she 
might have to hang around for 2006, too. 
</P>
<P>
	While other skaters have traded their Olympic and national  
medals for the less stressful life of touring, three months of 
shows in the summer is plenty for Kwan. She wants to skate and she 
wants to compete, and the tours and pro-ams aren't enough to 
satisfy her competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's the pleasure of skating,'' she said. ``That's  
what it all comes down to. Skating. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I stop loving to skate, that's when it's time to walk  
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The championships began Tuesday night with the compulsory dance.  
With five-time champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow now 
professionals, their former training partners, Naomi Lang and Peter 
Tchernyshev, took first place after the compulsories, worth 20 
percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	Just behind were Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates.

<HEADLINE> When Office Dating Abounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You're in love with the cute co-worker just a few cubicles away,  
and -- sigh! -- she loves you too. Snatching kisses in the elevator 
is fun, and you can't wait for your next stairwell squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a cold shower instead?  
</P>
<P>
	As more companies let colleagues freely date and throw them  
together for marathon work and social fun, passion is spilling into 
the workplace. Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky aren't the only 
ones to choose the office for a tryst: 9 percent of people have 
made love at work, and 12 percent have walked in on other lovers, 
according to a recent survey of more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember what happened to Clinton and Lewinsky. Bringing sex  
into the office is playing with fire. Sooner or later, someone's 
going to see the smoke. And even if you're involved in a perfectly 
aboveboard courtship with a co-worker, take care. In most offices, 
seemingly tame gestures -- lunches together, knowing looks -- can 
cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a tightly knit group and you regularly go in an office  
and close the door, that's a signal to others,'' says Wayne Sotile, 
a psychologist and family counselor. ``A workplace romance never 
occurs in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, workers now have ample opportunity to get to know one  
another. Americans work 47 hours a week on average -- 3 1/2 more hours 
than they did 20 years ago -- and they often work closely on teams 
and joint projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is such a fertile dating ground, says Rich Gosse, founder  
of the global organization American Singles, that he advises the 
lovelorn: ``If you don't date people on the job, you'll stay single 
your whole life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do most companies forbid office courtship. Nowadays, dating  
is rarely banned and couples are allowed to stay on the payroll 
together, as long as one doesn't oversee the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche scrapped its rule  
forbidding couples to work together, finding that it was too 
restrictive and out-of-date, says Jim Walls, national director of 
human resources. Now the company allows all romances, except for 
those between bosses and underlings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives of our employees are none of our business, provided  
that those relationships don't interfere with our business,'' says 
Walls. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no wonder, then, that almost 40 percent of adults have  
dated a co-worker, according to a random telephone survey of 1,007 
adults. The survey, commissioned by the romance book publisher 
Harlequin Enterprises and conducted by Roper Starch, also found 
that nearly 10 percent of adults have made love in the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Vieira, a marketing specialist, hasn't made any effort to  
keep secret her three-year relationship with a co-worker at 
MasteryWorks, an Annandale, Va., consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she feels so comfortable with her colleagues that at  
times she publicly greets her boyfriend with a kiss and a hug, yet 
she takes care not to flaunt the relationship at work. ``We both 
keep it very professional,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's true, says company president Caela Farren, Vieira's  
direct boss, who says she's never seen the couple's open affection, 
but wouldn't care if she did. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all companies or co-workers are so accepting, even if dating  
is allowed. Gossip flourishes and judgment may be questioned if 
love is openly shown, or if lovers seem more wrapped up in each 
other than their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, this kind of behavior isn't conducted to offend  
other people, it's just not thought about,'' says Robert Sawdon, 
vice president of human resources for Wright Line Inc., a 
Worcester, Mass.-based maker of computer furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	At a past job, Sawdon had to talk to a couple who had a habit of  
kissing passionately in their car each morning in the company 
parking lot. ``It was distracting to other employees,'' he recalls. 
``I suggested that they take it to the public park down the 
street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is tolerated ultimately may depend on each company's  
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``People make their own rules in the context of the relationship  
in the workplace,'' says Linda Gerstel, a New York City lawyer who 
dated and ultimately married a fellow lawyer at the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gerstel met her husband nine years ago, she refused to have  
lunch with him or be seen leaving or arriving together. Although 
neither was boss to the other, she worried when they worked on the 
same committees, fearing others would think they'd vote in a block. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Powers, author of ``The Office Romance,'' praises lovers  
who keep their work and love lives as separate as possible. He says 
lovers need to show that they're getting their work done just as 
they always did. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to some, few things are more tantalizing than the forbidden:  
sex in the office when nobody's looking -- even though that breaks 
most employee codes of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	When one company found underwear on a desktop, an investigation  
was undertaken and the couple that had been dallying at night was 
disciplined, says Katie Buchanan, a human resources executive who 
refused to name the company, her former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sonia Vieira doesn't have any qualms about a quick  
private kiss with her boyfriend when she's working late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kissing? Sure,'' she says. ``It doesn't go as far as making  
love, but if it's just us two, (kissing) doesn't bother me. It's 
usually after hours.''

<HEADLINE> Life IS Beautiful for Italian Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy has won its share of Oscars, but the seven  
nominations for ``Life is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's 
bittersweet comedy about the Holocaust, set a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said Tuesday after the  
nominations -- including his own as best actor -- were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' tells the story of a Jewish father who  
uses humor to try to shield his little son from the horrors of a 
German concentration camp. It was nominated for best picture, best 
foreign film, best actor, best director, best screenplay, best 
editing and best original soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than 10,000 people voting for the Academy  
Awards and I don't know how to thank everybody,'' the famously 
irrepressible Italian comedian told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be a bluebird, flying in each of their windows  
to sing my thank yous,'' he added, tweeting and whistling like a 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Congratulations poured in from everyone from the prime minister  
on down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful film that, along with millions of Italians, I  
loved,'' said Premier Massimo D'Alema. Culture Minister Giovanna 
Melandri called the nominations ``recognition from the 
international world of cinema for this big little genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is the first movie in three decades to get  
Oscar nominations for both for best picture and best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the success of a film that deserves a special place in  
the history of cinema, because it deals with the greatest horror of 
all times with respect and poetry,'' said Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	In Benigni's hometown of Vergaio, a village in Tuscany, his  
parents toasted their son and the phenomenal recognition his movie 
had received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him the night of the premiere: 'Dearest Roberto, this  
is the most beautiful film you've made,''' said his father, Luigi, 
a farmer who spent two years in a German labor camp during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely acclaimed and the winner of 28 festival prizes already,  
``Life is Beautiful'' has weathered its share of controversy. Some 
feel it trivializes the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear is that from fairy tale to fairy tale, we will head  
toward euphemisms that make the unacceptable acceptable,'' said 
Tullia Zevi, ex-president of the Union of Italian Jewish 
Communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is a breakthrough film for Benigni, a  
comedian best known for his pratfalls and rapid-fire delivery. 
Critics have hailed it as a profound tragicomedy and have even 
compared Benigni to his hero, the legendary Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked it,'' Amos Luzzato, president of the Union of Italian  
Jewish Communities, said of the movie. ``Not only that, it touched 
me. And it astonished me. I never suspected Benigni could do such a 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, an Italian film about a lovesick postman was the talk  
of Hollywood. ``The Postman (``Il Postino'')'' got five nominations 
-- including best picture and best actor. It won only for best 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	The last movie to be nominated for both best motion picture and  
best foreign film was Costa Gavras' ``Z'' in 1969, which won for 
best foreign movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Italian movie to win the Oscar for best foreign film  
was ``Mediterraneo'' by Gabriele Salvatores in 1992. The late 
Federico Fellini won four Oscars for best foreign film.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Crop Freeze Labeled Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton issued a major disaster  
declaration Tuesday in six California counties hit hardest by a 
crippling and costly citrus freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration, the latest in a line of numerous announced at  
the state and federal level since the disaster, clears the way for 
special unemployment benefits to farmers and farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new designation also leaves the door open for rental and  
mortgage assistance, job programs and other aid that many 
farmworkers are desperately hoping for as they struggle to meet 
their most basic expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration was announced by Vice President Al Gore in a  
conference call with Gov. Gray Davis. Gore has delivered most of 
federal largesse since the disaster struck voter-rich California, a 
state crucial to his presidential drive. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the four-day freeze in late December has caused an  
estimated $656 million in crop losses, mostly to oranges and 
lemons. Disaster-related claims for unemployment benefits have 
climbed to 5,981 and counting.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police raided a prison in southeastern  
Brazil on Tuesday, ending a 12-hour riot that left six inmates 
dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uprising, sparked by a botched prison escape, took place at  
the Praia Grande Prison, 43 miles southeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	After authorities failed to persuade inmates to return to their  
cells, police raided the prison and they surrendered, he said.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Colombian rebel leaders and that  
country's presidential peace envoy met in Caracas on Tuesday to try 
to advance talks aimed at ending a 34-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the National Liberation Army, Colombia's  
second largest rebel group, said they were meeting with Victor 
Ricardo to discuss a possible agenda for formal peace talks, and a 
place and date for them to take place. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on any agreements.  
</P>
<P>
	Formal peace talks between Colombian President Andres Pastrana  
and Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, began Jan. 7. But the talks stumbled 
amid increased violence by right-wing paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC withdrew from the negotiations, vowing to return only  
if the government cracks down on the landowner-backed militias.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's secret police will fire or  
reassign 400 bodyguards, including some who ran errands for 
politicians and took their wives to beauty parlors, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodyguards were assigned mainly to ministers, congressmen,  
bureaucrats and judges who don't need protection, said Ezequiel 
Quirales, a spokesman for the DISIP, Venezuela's version of the 
CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	The wasted efforts cost the government $350,000 a month for  
salaries, vehicles, gasoline and food. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodyguards were being reassigned or dismissed this week.  
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is part of President Hugo Chavez's plans to  
cut down on government bureaucracy. Some one million people, or 
nearly one in eight workers, are on the government payroll.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Forty-three people remain hospitalized, 15 in

central Cuba that killed 14 people over the weekend, the newspaper 
Granma reported Tuesday.

<P>
	Cuban health and police officials were still trying to determine  
what substance caused the poisoning on Saturday among customers of 
a private fried-vegetable seller in the town of Manguito, about 100 
miles east of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people died and 73 others were treated at hospitals for  
poisoning, according to the internet version of Granma, the 
Communist Party's daily newspaper,. 
</P>
<P>
	The government news agency Prensa Latina warned Cubans to be  
``extremely demanding'' about food purchased at the thousands of 
small private stalls that have sprung up across the country as part 
of economic reforms allowing limited private enterprise.

<HEADLINE> Commander: Maneuver by Pilot Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot took a risk by doing a  
360-degree roll in his jet the afternoon the plane cut an Italian 
ski gondola cable and killed 20 people, the pilot's former 
commander testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very safe,'' Lt. Col. Richard Muegge told jurors.  
``It doesn't take much to lose altitude. It can be disorienting. 
It's not commonplace and it's never been condoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in the court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby say the  
corkscrew maneuver, called a flaperon, occurred just before the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense says the roll was normally used to cross mountain  
ridges. 
</P>
<P>
	Muegge's testimony came after the jury flew to a nearby base to  
sit in the cockpit of an EA-6B Prowler, the same jet flown by Ashby 
last Feb. 3 in Cavalese, Italy. During the four-hour trip, the jury 
also went to a bombing range to watch a Prowler and an FA-18 fly 
over at 1,000 feet and nearly 600 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, he faces a maximum 
penalty of more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and other pilots of the Prowler anti-radar jets stationed  
at the Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station usually flew at 
altitudes of 20,000 to 25,000 feet, Muegge said. The jets flew over 
Bosnia from the Aviano, Italy, air base. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the jet was flying too low and too fast,  
violating altitude restrictions of 1,000 feet. The cable was hit 
around 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend the ski area on Mount Cermis wasn't on  
Ashby's map and that he may have experienced an optical illusion 
that made him think he was higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Muegge said it was common knowledge that there were ski areas in  
the Alps.

<HEADLINE> Croat Death Camp Head To Be Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The trial of a former World War II  
concentration camp commander charged with war crimes will start 
March 4, a Croatian court announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinko Sakic commanded Jasenovac camp in Croatia, where tens of  
thousands of people were killed. Sakic, 76, was extradited in June 
from Argentina, his home since shortly after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Zagreb legal authorities charged Sakic in the  
deaths of more than 2,000 people at the Jasenovac camp during the 
nine months he ran it in 1944. He is accused of ``maltreating, 
torturing and killing detainees'' and of allowing his subordinates 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist  
Croats were killed in Jasenovac from 1942-45, most historians 
agree. Some Serb scholars say the number was far greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic's wife, Nada, was extradited from Argentina in November on  
suspicion of war crimes against women inmates at Jasenovac. She was 
released earlier this month when the state dropped its case.

<HEADLINE> Germany Seeks Compensation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- Germany is discussing with the United States  
a reparations plan aimed at settling all outstanding Holocaust and 
slave labor claims from its Nazi past. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Bodo Hombach,  
chief of staff to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, met Monday 
with Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the Clinton 
administration's point man on Holocaust settlement issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder comes to Washington Thursday to meet with President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hombach talked to representatives of Jewish groups and  
the Israeli government. Representatives of Holocaust survivors and 
their families also are involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said they reviewed ``a German proposal that German  
industry establish a foundation to resolve outstanding claims from 
the Holocaust era.'' Those involved in the talks said a fund to 
make payments also could be set up. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials described the talks with Hombach as  
not a formal negotiation but a preliminary meeting they hoped would 
lead to a process that will produce a ``swift and just outcome'' to 
compensating victims of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hombach planned more talks today with Deputy Secretary of State  
Strobe Talbott and other department officials before returning to 
Germany. Speaking on condition of anonymity, State Department 
officials said Schroeder, in office 100 days, was more positive and 
forthcoming on resolving Holocaust compensation issues than his 
predecessor, Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Hombach has said the German government might announce a solution  
to the claims issue by the end of the month. His objective appeared 
to be to avoid having the talks drag on as they did when the Swiss 
government and banks considered compensating Nazi victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Hombach was accompanied by Rolf Breuer, chairman of Deutsche  
Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has paid more than $60 billion in reparations to Nazi  
victims, but has refused to honor wage claims by slave laborers, 
who were technically working for private companies. Most companies 
refused to honor individual claims as well, arguing the slave labor 
was forced on them by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department announced Jan. 15 an agreement had been  
reached for Germany to pay compensation to more than 200 Americans 
who survived concentration camps, but details were kept secret 
pending final approval. The cost could reach $25 million, depending 
on how much the German parliament provides, according to lawyers 
involved.	   That settlement is different from the fund German businesses are 
expected to establish to compensate slave laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank is one of many German companies facing class  
action suits in the United States filed by Holocaust survivors, who 
accuse them of profiting from slave labor or the Nazi expropriation 
of Jewish assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is facing new pressure to make restitution to Nazi  
victims after disclosing last week that it helped finance 
construction of the Auschwitz death camp during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published by the Hamburg daily Bild, Breuer was  
quoted as saying German businesses are ready to compensate some 
Holocaust survivors forced into slave labor by the Nazis through an 
industry-wide fund. Those involved in the talks said a foundation 
could be established or the two ideas could be combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany wants to find a way to satisfy Nazi survivors and block  
any future legal action. There are concerns that German businesses, 
which depend heavily on exports, could be severely damaged by 
claims. In addition, time is running out for elderly concentration 
camp survivors.

<HEADLINE> Is Y2K More Urgent Than Disclosed? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How ready are America's companies for the year  
2000 and how much are they spending to upgrade their computer 
systems? 
</P>
<P>
	It's very hard to tell, a top securities regulator says.  
</P>
<P>
	A check of financial reports that publicly traded companies must  
submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that ``many 
companies are still not complying'' with Year 2000 disclosure 
requirements, SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than half the companies in an unspecified sample  
failed to disclose how much it is costing them to get their 
computer systems ready for the millennial change, while close to 
half didn't describe their contingency plans in case the systems 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency is alerting investors to examine the  
Year 2000 disclosures of companies that interest them, Turner said 
at a conference organized by the District of Columbia Bar 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were the chief financial officer of a corporation that  
wasn't adequately prepared and things went wrong after Jan. 1, 
Turner quipped, ``I'd be hung out there like a cold piece of meat 
in storage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, the SEC has been nudging companies to provide  
more details so investors can be better informed. The agency issued 
guidelines on how publicly traded corporations as well as mutual 
fund companies and brokerage firms should make the required 
disclosures of Year 2000 costs and risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Y2K, the Year 2000 problem reflects programming in many  
older computers that recognizes just the last two digits of a year 
in reading a date. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely 
to interpret Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause 
massive computer failures, lost data, or broken connections with 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	As all sectors of government and the economy come to grips with  
the Year 2000 problem, some observers have warned that costs to 
companies of getting ready could punch a hole in their profits and 
hurt stock prices on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has warned that if investors don't  
have sufficient information regarding a company's readiness, 
confidence could be seriously undermined and ``panic and 
overreaction'' could ripple through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials also have said they will take enforcement action  
against companies that make materially false and misleading 
statements about Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about possible action against companies that fail to  
adequately disclose their readiness, Turner said he hoped that 
could be largely avoided by having the SEC ask the companies to 
voluntarily revise their reports with fuller information. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months the SEC:  
</P>
<P>
	--Charged 37 relatively small brokerage firms with failing to  
fully disclose their Year 2000 computer readiness, in the federal 
government's first major enforcement action related to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the firms have agreed to settle the charges by promising  
to refrain from such violations in the future, being censured and 
paying civil fines ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on 
their size. In settling the charges, the firms neither admitted nor 
denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Accused nine stock-transfer agents of failing to adequately  
disclose their computer readiness for the millennial date change. 
Five of the agent companies settled the charges and four contested 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer agents, which sometimes are banks or trust companies,  
are responsible for keeping records of shareholders of corporations 
and for issuing or canceling stock certificates when shares are 
bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and fix  
Year 2000 computer problems could seriously disrupt corporations' 
dividend payments and other transactions with their shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Jim Pyne Is Browns' First Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- With bronzed Hall of Fame busts of Jim  
Brown, Lou Groza and Leroy Kelly reminding them of their rich NFL 
past, the new Cleveland Browns began building with no-name players. 
</P>
<P>
	Priming for their return this season after a three-year absence,  
the Browns selected Detroit center Jim Pyne with their first pick 
in Tuesday's NFL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, 27, started all 16 games for the Lions last season after  
spending his first three years with Tampa Bay. His versatility made 
him attractive to the Browns, as did his salary cap number of 
$1.885 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL required the Browns to take 30 to 42 players or spend 38  
percent ($21.77 million) of their salary cap ($57.288 million) on 
players they take in the expansion draft. So Cleveland had to 
equally weigh a player's character, expense and potential before 
making him part of its future. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne's selection fit perfectly into this day when history was on  
everyone's mind. He is part of the only three-generation NFL family 
in history. His father, George III, played for Boston in 1965, and 
his grandfather, George II, played for Providence in 1931-32. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' said Pyne, a 6-foot-2, 297-pounder from  
Virginia Tech. ``Cleveland is a great place. I'm glad to be here. I 
wanted to be here. I grew up watching the Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it seemed did everyone else at the Canton Civic Center.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 fans, including members of the famed Dawg Pound,  
were on hand for the 2 1/2-hour, made-for-television event. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been more than three years since Cleveland fans could  
scream for their football heroes. And with all the barking and 
``Here we go Brownies'' chants, it was as if the Steelers were in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL held the draft in pro football's birthplace to trumpet  
the rebirth of Cleveland's tradition-rich franchise. A high-tech 
stage, complete with scoreboard, was ringed with the 13 bronzed 
busts of Browns in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland used its second pick on the defensive side, choosing  
Dallas end Hurvin McCormack. McCormack, 26, had five sacks for the 
Cowboys in '98. With the third pick, Cleveland snatched New England 
tackle Scott Rehberg, a 6-foot-8, 330-pounder who played in two 
games for the Patriots last year and is considered a bargain at 
$325,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Damon Gibson was the first skill player taken by  
the Browns, who plan to build the majority of their roster through 
free agency and in April's college draft. Gibson, 23, had 19 
catches for 258 yards and three TDs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparing for the expansion draft, Dwight Clark, Cleveland's  
director of football operations, said the deepest talent available 
would be on the offensive line. And that's where the Browns went 
again with pick No. 5, taking San Francisco center Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman are important to any team, but particularly to  
the Browns, who could take Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch with the 
No. 1 overall pick in the college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and cheap seemed to be the early direction for the Browns.  
Of their first 10 selections, only one player -- Pyne -- cost them 
over $1 million and none was older than 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because a player is with the Browns today doesn't mean  
he'll be wearing an orange helmet very long. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL expansion has taught fans this: Don't get too attached to  
your team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Cleveland Browns won't look anything like they will in  
a few years, maybe even in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 30 or so players the Browns select could be cut  
before the team opens training camp in July. Others could be traded 
as Cleveland attempts to secure more draft picks. Some will get 
injured; some will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns used the expansion blueprints left by Carolina and  
Jacksonville in preparing for this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina took 35 players in the draft, and 15 made their roster  
for the start of that season. Four years later, just one -- wide 
receiver Mark Carrier, a former Brown -- remains and he was released 
at one point and came back as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 31 expansion players selected by Jacksonville, 22 made  
its opening roster. There are now just three original Jaguars 
remaining.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise To Close Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise will close 134 of  
its 347 jewelry and home products stores over the next four months 
in an attempt to revitalize business and reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise operates stores in 34 states and has 25,000  
employees. Spokesman Greg Winnett said Tuesday that a list of the 
stores being closed will be released soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to estimate how many employees would lose their  
jobs. The stores being closed represent 39 percent of the total. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise, which was founded in 1934, flourished into  
the 1980s but has been hurt by competition from discount chains 
like Wal-Mart and Kmart. More than 50 Service Merchandise stores 
have closed since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The interim chief executive, Bettina Whyte, was brought last  
month to replace Gary Witkin. Sales, however, have continued to 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Kurt Barnard said the outlook for Service Merchandise is  
``dim, at best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have no clear idea of what it is and what it tries  
to do,'' said Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report 
in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``If you want a toaster, for example, the 
first company you think of is Wal-Mart or Kmart.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Talent Running for Mo. Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rep. Jim Talent, who won re-election last year  
with 70 percent of the vote, has announced plans to run for 
governor of Missouri in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enthusiastic about it,'' said the 42-year-old Republican,  
who served as minority leader of the Missouri House for four years 
before winning election to Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic State Treasurer Bob Holden also has declared his  
intention to run. Two-term incumbent Democrat Gov. Mel Carnahan is 
constitutionally prohibited from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference Monday at Vatterott College in suburban  
St. Louis, Talent said that as governor he would push for lower 
taxes, better education and removing drugs from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner,'' said Ann Wagner, chairwoman of the Missouri  
Republican Party. ``Missouri needs Jim Talent to come back and take 
over the reins in Jefferson City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state Democrats said Talent has toed the Republican Party  
line in Congress and little would change if he were governor. ``He 
takes his marching orders from far right special interests,'' state 
Democratic Party Chairman Joe Carmichael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talent's decision is risky, Saint Louis University political  
scientist Ken Warren said. He would leave the 2nd District, a 
traditionally Republican area, for statewide office where Democrats 
currently dominate.

<HEADLINE>  Quartey Is Test for De La Hoya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From Pernell Whitaker to Hector Camacho to  
Julio Cesar Chavez, Oscar De La Hoya has handled every challenge 
after winning an Olympic gold medal in 1992. Next comes what he 
calls his first true test in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe it also could be his first loss.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, of East Los Angeles, will risk his perfect record  
against Ike Quartey of Ghana, who is also unbeaten, on Saturday 
night at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will be defending his WBC welterweight championship  
for the sixth time in a bout originally scheduled Nov. 21, but 
postponed because De La Hoya suffered a lacerated left eyelid 
during sparring some three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of my previous fights have been preparations,'' De La Hoya  
said Tuesday. ``I feel Ike Quartey will bring the best out of me. I 
respect the guy a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two warriors in that ring who really want to win. I'm  
prepared for a good, long war if that's what it takes. Ike Quartey 
is my very first test; 1999 will be a very big year for boxing and 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters appeared at a packed Dodger Stadium news conference  
attended by, among others, former welterweight champions Sugar Ray 
Leonard and Thomas Hearns, who are helping Top Rank, Inc., promote 
the card. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and Quartey were supposed to provide a special photo  
opportunity at home plate, but rain restricted them to the Stadium 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya brings a 29-0 record with 24 knockouts into the bout.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say this is his toughest fight, and that might  
very well be the case,'' said Bob Arum, the 26-year-old De La 
Hoya's promoter. ``He's prepared, he's ready. He's a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is the 29-year-old Quartey, who is 34-0-1 with 29 knockouts.  
He has held the WBA welterweight crown since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to beat Oscar, I'm going to win, zero doubt, maybe  
the later rounds, a knockout, for sure,'' said Quartey, who will be 
fighting for the first time in almost 16 months. ``I think I'm the 
best, I'm very confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is being co-sponsored by the Las Vegas Hilton and  
Mandalay Bay, a new Las Vegas resort scheduled to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, it's likely his next fight will be  
against the winner of the Oba Carr-Frankie Randall 10-round bout, 
also on Saturday night's card, at Mandalay Bay's Events Center.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Faces Threat of ACC Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn just can't seem to shake controversy.  
But if it gets the Tigers out of their season opening game with 
Florida State, coach Tommy Tuberville can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know right now we're taking it and will be for a few days,  
but at least we won't be for a month in August,'' Tuberville said 
Tuesday. ``It makes for great talk and people can point fingers for 
a while, but that's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been one scandal after another at Auburn since Terry Bowden  
quit as football coach in October. The latest involves a nasty spat 
with Florida State that emerged after Auburn canceled a Sept. 2 
football game between the two schools. In retaliation, the Atlantic 
Coast Conference has threatened to boycott games against Auburn in 
all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be successful, maybe not next year, but soon,  
and I think some people are worried,'' Tuberville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn officials expected criticism when they bought their way  
out of the nationally televised Florida State game, but nothing 
prepared them for what came Monday when it was revealed that ACC 
commissioner John Swofford wanted all nine of his member schools to 
boycott playing the Tigers in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if the ACC never thinks about playing Auburn  
again,'' Auburn trustee Lowell Barron said. ``We've got 100 
athletic events scheduled and only seven or eight are with ACC 
schools. They're only a big thing in their own mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bowden is no longer Auburn's coach, school officials -- and  
Tuberville -- aren't too eager to open the season against Bobby 
Bowden's Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no longer a father-son matchup. It looked more like a  
grudge game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This football team had a very hard time for two months after  
coach Bowden resigned,'' Tuberville said. ``I didn't want them to 
have to go through that again, take even more scrutiny when they 
really should be trying to heal from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville said he was the one who told Auburn athletic director  
David Housel to cancel the game, but not because he was afraid of 
beginning his reign against Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all for rescheduling, we just didn't want the game  
this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's decision left Florida State without an opponent for its  
season opener and probably cost the Seminoles a spot in the ESPN 
Thursday night game, network spokesman Dean Diltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very slim that Florida State can still play on Thursday  
night,'' Diltz said. ``There's not many, if any, formidable teams 
that have an open date. It ends up costing Florida State more than 
anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford agreed and fired off an angry letter to Housel.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the way Auburn University is going to conduct its  
business, I feel it is my obligation as conference commissioner to 
ask all of our member institutions to seriously evaluate whether it 
makes sense to schedule Auburn in any sport,'' Swofford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said Tuesday he ``didn't care to comment'' on Swofford's  
threat of an ACC boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auburn made an institutional decision,'' Housel said. ``We are  
now moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barron called Swofford's threat ``opposition hogwash. Bobby  
Bowden stated on television he didn't want to play the game, and it 
should be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's comment about scraping the game came in the aftermath  
of his son's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn settled with Terry Bowden for $620,000 last week,  
including a mandate that he say nothing bad about Auburn, its 
coaches or trustees. The school also paid $500,000 to Florida State 
to get out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford wants an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league  
will lose if the Seminoles lose the ESPN game. 
</P>
<P>
	The money spending alone has angered many Auburn students.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Weaver, a sophomore on Auburn's club-level wrestling team,  
said the football situation has made it unfair for other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spend money for football, for cleaning up football  
messes, and we can't even get help for new wrestling mats,'' Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon to tell what, if any, repercussions will come from  
Swofford's request. Auburn has replaced Florida State with Division 
II Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have a contract to play Clemson, which is now coached  
by Terry Bowden's brother, Tommy, for four games from 2005 through 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson officials have said they don't foresee the series being  
dropped, and Tommy Bowden said Tuesday he never asked to get out of 
the Auburn series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I haven't done,'' Tommy Bowden said. ``There  
is very little I can comment on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pac-10 since 1983, said he had  
never seen one conference commissioner threaten to boycott another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply don't recall that having happened,'' Hansen said.  
``It does seem like a strong step. But I can understand why there's 
strong feelings, all of us work very hard to get our games to be 
televised.''

outcome so evident that one Republican said ``bipartisan 
acquittal'' was possible by week's end. In all, 18 senators spoke,

television's popular ``Teletubbies'' children's show is gay. The 
February edition of the National Liberty Journal, edited and 
published by Falwell, contains an article warning parents the 
Teletubby may be a gay role model. The publication says Tinky Winky 
has the voice of a boy but carries a purse. It says: ``He is purple 
-- the gay-pride color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle -- 
the gay-pride symbol.'' Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., which 
licenses Teletubbies in the United States, said: ``To think we 
would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of

and five of Philadelphia's season-high 13 blocks as the 76ers beat 
the Detroit Pistons 90-86 tonight in a matchup of undefeated teams. 
Grant Hill, coming off a career-high 46 points, scored 32 points on 
11-for-18 shooting in the Pistons' third game in as many nights. 
Allen Iverson had 19 points despite another poor shooting 
performance (6-for-20) and only one assist.

	Senate Begins Clinton Deliberations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate shut its doors to debate its  
verdict on the impeachment of Bill Clinton today, with the outcome 
so evident that one Republican said ``bipartisan acquittal'' was 
possible by week's end. Clinton stands accused of perjury and 
obstruction of justice in his efforts to conceal his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. An effort led by Democrats and Texas Republican 
Kay Bailey Hutchison to open this afternoon's proceedings failed. 
One Republican senator said he hoped that by closing the 
deliberations the Senate would be able to engage in a candid, 
nonpartisan discussion of a proposal to censure Clinton after his 
presumed acquittal.

	Mrs. Clinton: Let Women Decide on Kids  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton took the  
podium at a U.N. population conference today to declare that all 
women should be allowed to make their own family planning choices 
and to praise those fighting China's restrictive one-child rule. 
Mrs. Clinton said all women should have access to family planning 
programs, including safe abortion. According to the World Health 
Organization, about 78,000 deaths a year are due to unsafe 
abortions.

	French Avalanches Kill Two  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Two avalanches buried 11 chalets under deep snow  
today just north of the popular ski resort of Chamonix in the 
French Alps, killing two people, police said. Seven people were 
missing. About 200 rescue workers, some using sensors and others 
with dogs, were searching for those believed trapped inside wooden 
chalets or under the snow in the villages of Le Tour and 
Montroc-le-Planet. Police said 11 people were pulled from the snow 
alive.

	Social Security Plan Criticized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both the head of a commission that  
investigated Social Security and Congress' chief auditor criticized 
parts of President Clinton's plan to devote $2.8 trillion in future 
government surpluses to shoring up Social Security. David M. 
Walker, head of the congressional General Accounting Office, and 
Edward Gramlich, who headed up a 13-member Social Security study 
commission, questioned Clinton's proposal to use general government 
revenues to meet projected shortfalls between payroll taxes and 
benefits. Gramlich said his commission felt it was a bad idea 
because it would put the needs of retirees in direct competition 
with other government programs.

	Pilots Agree To Resume Negotiations  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots union  
agreed to resume negotiations today over how quickly the company 
can integrate pilots from recently purchased Reno Air onto its 
roster. The December purchase of Reno Air by American Airlines' 
parent, AMR Corp., has resulted in disgruntled unions representing 
pilots at both carriers. More than 1,300 flights have been canceled 
since talks bogged down between the airline and the Allied Pilots 
Association late last Friday.

	'Shakespeare,' 'Ryan' Lead Oscars  
</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The romantic comedy ``Shakespeare  
in Love'' collected 13 Academy Award nominations today to top the 
early favorite, Steven Spielberg's war epic ``Saving Private 
Ryan.'' Among the nominations for ``Shakespeare in Love'' were best 
picture, director, actress for Gwyneth Paltrow, supporting actor 
for Geoffrey Rush and supporting actress for Judi Dench. ``Saving 
Private Ryan'' had 11 nominations, including best picture, director 
Steven Spielberg and leading actor Tom Hanks. The winners will be 
announced March 21 at a ceremony televised live on ABC.

	Survey Traces Sexual Dysfunction  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- More than 40 percent of women and 30 percent of  
men regularly have no interest in sex, can't have an orgasm or 
suffer from some other sexual dysfunction, according to what 
researchers say is the most comprehensive U.S. sex survey since the 
1948 Kinsey Report. The researchers said problems with sex are 
often coupled with everything from emotional and health problems to 
lack of time, job pressures and money trouble. The study appears in 
tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association.

industrials down 145.72 at 9,145.39 just before the close. On the 
NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,940-1,061. The Nasdaq was down

</P>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- About 4,000 Cleveland fans, including the  
famed Dawg Pound, filled the Canton Civic Center this afternoon as 
the Browns were to fill the roster for their expansion team. The 
new Browns were expected to load up on offensive linemen and 
low-salaried players with potential. One source told The Associated 
Press that Cleveland would select Detroit center Jim Pyne with its 
first pick.

<HEADLINE> Owners Win First Arbitration Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball owners won the first two salary  
arbitration cases of the year, beating Boston outfielder Midre 
Cummings and Montreal infielder Shane Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston shortstop Ricky Gutierrez ($2,212,500) and Cincinnati  
outfielder Michael Tucker ($1.6 million) agreed to one-year 
contracts, leaving 17 players remaining in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings, 27, had asked for a raise from $250,000 to $725,000  
after hitting .283 last year with five homers and 15 RBIs in 120 
at-bats. Instead, he will be paid Boston's proposal of $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was argued Monday in Tampa, Fla., before arbitrators  
Elizabeth Neumeier, Gil Vernon and Anthony Sinicropi. Neumeier was 
the first woman ever to handle a baseball salary arbitration case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we were very disappointed because we thought we'd  
put together a winning argument,'' said Cummings' agent, Craig 
Fenech. ``You just don't know why the arbitrators make their 
decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews will get $1.25 million rather than his request for $2.3  
million, in the decision by arbitrators Richard Bloch, Roger Kaplan 
and Jerome Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, 27, hit .238 last season and set career highs with 30  
doubles, 25 home runs and 69 RBIs. He made $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, who beat out Tim Bogar as the starter last season,  
had asked for a raise from $850,000 to $2,575,000 and the Astros 
had offered $1,850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, 28, played in a career high 141 games last season and  
established career bests with 491 at-bats, 128 doubles, 46 RBIs and 
13 steals. He hit .261. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati had offered Tucker $1.4 million and he has requested  
a raise from $370,000 to $1.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, 27, hit .244 with 13 home runs and 46 RBIs last year  
with Atlanta. He was traded to the Reds on Nov. 10 along with 
left-hander Denny Neagle and a minor leaguer for second baseman 
Bret Boone and left-hander Mike Remlinger.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Puts Snapshots on Picture CD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Aside from computer and photo hobbyists,  
are there enough ordinary folks willing to fork out an extra $9 a 
roll for the novelty of having a photofinishing store computerize 
their traditional snapshots? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the key question Eastman Kodak Co. faces as it puts the  
finishing touches on its new product in its effort to profit from 
digital photography. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Picture CD, amateur shutterbugs will be able to have their  
photos stored on CD-ROM. In a few weeks, Picture CDs will begin 
popping up at national chains such as Kmart Corp., Walgreen Co., 
CVS Corp. and Target Stores. By this summer, they will be available 
at more than 40,000 retail stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak developed the Picture CD along with computer chip giant  
Intel Corp. as part of a drive to expand mainstream photography to 
the Internet. The Picture CD uses software by Adobe Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent test-markets in Indianapolis and Salt Lake City, Kodak  
said the compact discs were bought by about 5 percent of consumers 
-- a higher percentage than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be really surprised if this doesn't take off,'' said  
Audrey Debije, 29, a college instructor who was picking up film at 
a Moto Photo store in Kodak's hometown on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a real benefit when members of families live clear  
across the country from each other and you don't see each other 
that often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another customer, Karl Neubauer, doesn't anticipate much demand  
among ``average Americans'' for a few more years, at least until 
costs come down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already, developing film can be expensive, so I think it's  
going to take a while before CDs are widely used,'' said Neubauer, 
a sculptor. ``I like photos to be tangible. Not that I'm a 
technophobe, but in a way I'd like to keep it simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least initially, traditional prints, which cost roughly $5 to  
$8 per roll, must be purchased along with CDs. The CD orders take 
about two days to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDs are simpler to use than the floppy disks that Kodak and  
other photo companies now sell, which require consumers to load 
their own software onto their computer. While the CDs are slightly 
more expensive, their images are sharper. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos on CD could be stored in digital albums, manipulated to  
adjust color, clarity and brightness, or dropped into newsletters 
and personalized birthday cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The photography industry is pushing hard to get consumers  
interested in digital products but, for many, the technology 
remains an untried novelty. Kodak has yet to turn a profit from its 
digital business, which racked up $702 million in losses in 1997 
and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's core business of amateur film, photographic paper and  
traditional cameras generates half its profits, but this cash cow 
is being threatened by intense competition from Japan. However, the 
slowly growing market for digital products could pose a much bigger 
threat to future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Kodak also expects to begin offering America Online  
subscribers the option of having digitized copies of their photos 
delivered to their computer by photofinishing stores for an extra 
$5 to $7 a roll.

<HEADLINE> Oprah Winfrey May End Her TV Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime  
television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready 
to bail out of her long-running show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am all talked out,'' Winfrey told The Sunday Times. ``My  
contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows 
because I feel they are going to burn themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah  
Winfrey Show'' in September 1986. Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it 
recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told  
the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her 
stint on the movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more  
dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling  
his show a ``vulgarity circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just  
hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have 
sexual intercourse -- and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy 
pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes 
a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted 
as telling the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping  
her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a 
publicist in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued  
Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey 
would continue the show after the end of her current contract.

<HEADLINE>  Novelist Iris Murdoch Dies at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Iris Murdoch, whose macabre yet comic  
sensibility made her one of Britain's most admired modern 
novelists, has died at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch died Monday at Vale House in Oxford, said Patricia  
O'Leary, administrator at the home for Alzheimer's disease 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cause of death was not announced, Murdoch was  
diagnosed in 1996 as suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a 
condition she described in its early stage as ``a very, very bad, 
quiet place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Bayley, who had cared for his wife through her last years,  
was with her when she died, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayley, the academic, critic and writer who had shared Murdoch's  
life for more than 40 years, wrote of her life and the progression 
of her disease in ``Elegy for Iris,'' published in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voyage is over,'' Bayley wrote, ``and under the dark  
escort of Alzheimer's she has arrived somewhere. So have I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Hodges, the neurologist who diagnosed Murdoch's ailment,  
said, ``It was tragic seeing someone who had been a literary giant 
not remembering the details of the books she had written -- it was 
heart-rending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philosophical speculation, religion, magic and metaphysics run  
through many of Murdoch's 26 novels. One of her most famous -- ``A 
Severed Head,'' published in 1961 -- was a black farce about 
infidelity, incest and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow author Rachel Billington once wrote that Murdoch's  
characters ``seem to walk a tightrope, with only darkness below and 
no particular end in view; yet sustained by the very act of staying 
on and, as Miss Murdoch says, constrained to be always in 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow novelist Malcolm Bradbury on Monday rated her ``amongst  
the four or five great novelists of the second half of this century 
to come out of Britain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born into an Anglo-Irish family in Dublin on July 15, 1919, Jean  
Iris Murdoch was educated in England at Badminton School, at 
Somerville College, Oxford University, and at Newnham College, 
Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning to teach at Oxford, Murdoch spent a year at  
Cambridge studying with disciples of the Austrian philosopher 
Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, she married Bayley, with whom she kept a famously  
chaotic household -- for many years in the village of Steeple 
Ashton, 100 miles west of London, then in a vine-covered house in 
north Oxford. Books were stacked on the floors in pyramids, and 
sacks overflowing with papers and manuscripts shared space with a 
collection of stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book was nonfiction -- ``Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''  
in 1953 -- and she wrote on philosophy throughout her career. 
``Existentialists and Mystics,'' a collection of her essays and 
articles, was published in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's first published novel was ``Under the Net'' in 1954,  
and it won immediate praise. She wrote prolifically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invent the whole thing before I start writing,'' she once  
explained. ``Even the conversations are in my head. I don't start 
writing the thing until I've got the whole of it absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most admired novels was 1973's ``The Black Prince,''  
about a middle-aged would-be writer and his professional rival's 
young daughter. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, ``The Sea, The Sea,'' about a retired film director  
trying to win back his first love, won the Booker Prize, widely 
considered Britain's highest literary honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, the equivalent of a knighthood for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Her last novel, ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' was published in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch didn't put up with editing, not even allowing  
punctuation changes -- an attitude that some critics blamed for the 
length of some of her less successful novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she could be a severe critic of her own work.  
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is not being great,'' she said in a 1988 interview.  
``I'm in the second league, not among the gods like Jane Austen, 
and Henry James and Tolstoy. My characters are not as memorable as 
theirs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 interview, she said two of the most important things  
in her life were her parents and her work. ``But above all else, 
the most important thing in my life is my husband,'' she said. ``To 
have had a happy marriage is a very good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband. They had no children.  
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

<HEADLINE>  Quartey Is Test for De La Hoya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From Pernell Whitaker to Hector Camacho to  
Julio Cesar Chavez, Oscar De La Hoya has handled every challenge 
after winning an Olympic gold medal in 1992. Next comes what he 
calls his first true test in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe it also could be his first loss.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, of East Los Angeles, will risk his perfect record  
against Ike Quartey of Ghana, who is also unbeaten, on Saturday 
night at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will be defending his WBC welterweight championship  
for the sixth time in a bout originally scheduled Nov. 21, but 
postponed because De La Hoya suffered a lacerated left eyelid 
during sparring some three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of my previous fights have been preparations,'' De La Hoya  
said Tuesday. ``I feel Ike Quartey will bring the best out of me. I 
respect the guy a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have two warriors in that ring who really want to win. I'm  
prepared for a good, long war if that's what it takes. Ike Quartey 
is my very first test; 1999 will be a very big year for boxing and 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters appeared at a packed Dodger Stadium news conference  
attended by, among others, former welterweight champions Sugar Ray 
Leonard and Thomas Hearns, who are helping Top Rank, Inc., promote 
the card. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and Quartey were supposed to provide a special photo  
opportunity at home plate, but rain restricted them to the Stadium 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya brings a 29-0 record with 24 knockouts into the bout.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say this is his toughest fight, and that might  
very well be the case,'' said Bob Arum, the 26-year-old De La 
Hoya's promoter. ``He's prepared, he's ready. He's a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is the 29-year-old Quartey, who is 34-0-1 with 29 knockouts.  
He has held the WBA welterweight crown since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to beat Oscar, I'm going to win, zero doubt, maybe  
the later rounds, a knockout, for sure,'' said Quartey, who will be 
fighting for the first time in almost 16 months. ``I think I'm the 
best, I'm very confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is being co-sponsored by the Las Vegas Hilton and  
Mandalay Bay, a new Las Vegas resort scheduled to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, it's likely his next fight will be  
against the winner of the Oba Carr-Frankie Randall 10-round bout, 
also on Saturday night's card, at Mandalay Bay's Events Center.

<HEADLINE> Starr Accused of `Forum Shopping' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman accused of obstructing Kenneth Starr's  
investigation of President Clinton says the prosecutor went ``forum 
shopping'' in Virginia to avoid the heavily Democratic District of 
Columbia and a federal judge in Washington who dismissed one of 
Starr's other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after U.S. District Judge James Robertson in  
Washington threw out Starr's tax evasion case against presidential 
friend Webster Hubbell, prosecutors ordered Julie Hiatt Steele to 
produce subpoenaed records for a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., her 
lawyers revealed in court papers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, last summer, Ms. Steele had already testified to a  
grand jury Starr was using in Washington. Steele lawyer Nancy Luque 
said she was told by one of Starr's prosecutors that he was using 
the Virginia grand jury for the document production simply because 
the Washington grand jury, which was investigating the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal, was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele produced the documents for the Virginia grand jury  
under a limited grant of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	When she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against  
self-incrimination before the grand jury in Virginia, a Starr 
prosecutor ``persisted in his interrogation and persecution of Ms. 
Steele ... for more than one hour'' until she testified that her 
previous grand jury testimony in Washington had been truthful. She 
was indicted in January for false testimony to both grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case exemplifies unprecedented prosecutorial forum  
shopping,'' said Luque. She wants the indictment dismissed or 
transferred to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers stated that Starr's office ``improperly  
maneuvered to avoid prosecuting Ms. Steele in ... the District of 
Columbia,'' which ``may be the most predominantly Democratic 
jurisdiction in the United States, with registered Democrats 
outnumbering Republicans on a more than 10-1 ratio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal court jurisdiction across the river in Virginia  
``counts at least one Republican senator and congressman as its 
representatives in Congress,'' Ms. Steele's lawyers added. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is investigating whether his probe into whether Clinton  
made an unwanted sexual advance against former White House 
volunteer Kathleen Willey was obstructed. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercutting Mrs. Willey's story, Ms. Steele, from Midlothian,  
Va., denies that Mrs. Willey told her about the president's alleged 
sexual advance and asserts that Mrs. Willey asked her to lie to a 
Newsweek magazine reporter about it.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Would End Flight Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- O'Hare, Kennedy and LaGuardia, three of the  
most tightly restricted airports in the country, would be opened to 
unlimited flights in five years under a new Clinton administration 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, part of a broad federal aviation bill, would also  
allow unlimited flights by 70-seat regional jets into the airports 
in Chicago and New York as of Sept. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Those flights would be aimed at improving service to small and  
medium cities that have been underserved by major carriers and 
their larger jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Department  
officials said the existing limits are ``obsolete'' and based on 
30-year-old rules. Under the proposal, the current caps would 
expire simultaneously on Sept. 1, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is the only other U.S.  
airport with a similar restriction on flights. The new FAA bill 
would not affect the number of flights into Reagan National, which 
was set by Congress about 12 years ago when control was shifted to 
a local airport authority. Officials said any changes are still 
considered a matter for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials also said they would not propose any change in the  
existing 1,250-mile limit on the length of flights from Reagan 
National. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has proposed dropping that 
limit to allow nonstop, coast-to-coast flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year a more modest proposal to add 30 flights at O'Hare,  
the world's busiest airport, and an undetermined number at Kennedy 
and LaGuardia died in Congress after Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
complained to Newt Gingrich, then House speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The new speaker, Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert, has said he  
would support more flights at O'Hare, but he has not said anything 
about an unlimited number. Representatives for Hyde and Hastert did 
not immediately return calls seeking comment on the latest 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration officials challenged assertions made by those  
living near the airports that extra flights would increase noise 
and reduce safety in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that after this year, noisier Stage 2 aircraft  
engines will be banned in the United States, replaced by more 
modern and quieter Stage 3 equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A Transportation Department official who briefed reporters said  
the rule was never designed for safety reasons. FAA and 
Transportation Department officials said the old rules emanated 
from a concern about airport congestion, not safety, and despite 
the recent addition of flights at O'Hare in particular, delays have 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the bill, which would renew the FAA for another  
five years, are provisions to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase an airport ticket tax, which goes to state and local  
authorities, from $3 to $5 per airport, and from a maximum of $12 
per ticket to $20. 
</P>
<P>
	--Institute $1.5 billion in new user fees for the air traffic  
control system. The department and FAA officials said details about 
how the fees will be assessed and who will pay them will not be 
available until a cost accounting is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give domestic airline travelers the same anti-discrimination  
protections extended to international travelers. The DOT, for 
example, has recently fined international carriers for refusing 
passage to handicapped individuals who were making connections from 
domestic flights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give airline passengers in rural communities more protection  
during major airline strikes by requiring major airlines to support 
their feeder services during a strike. The bill would also create a 
five-year grant program to help small and rural communities attract 
better air service. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve smaller airports by starting satellite-based instrument  
approaches and extending runways from 3,500 feet to 5,500 feet, 
which would allow service by regional jets.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Get Word on Possible Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators have decided to pass on to  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr unsubstantiated information that 
suggests the White House has a taping system that might have 
recorded telephone conversations between President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart has denied the  
existence of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators received information about a week ago raising the  
possibility that such a system might exist, but they have not 
confirmed it. Eager to finish the impeachment trial, they decided 
it would be best sent to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I've done is make available information sent to me,''  
Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate officials said the information was raised at a meeting of  
GOP senators, who showed little appetite for delaying the trial to 
find out whether any such tapes exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking about what to do about this and I suggested  
why don't we turn it over to Starr,'' Assistant Majority Leader Don 
Nickles said. ``It's for him to handle; its not for us to handle.''

<HEADLINE> Rehnquist Stays True to Demeanor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- True to his reputation, Chief Justice William  
H. Rehnquist showed during the impeachment trial he doesn't like to 
waste time -- even if it means forgoing a little praise. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments this week, prosecutor Rep. George Gekas,  
R-Pa., asked, ``If I were to take some time to thank the chief 
justice for his patience in all of this, would that be counted 
against my time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Rehnquist responded as senators began to laugh about  
his well-known eye for the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would? Then I'll send you a note,'' Gekas said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other House prosecutors took the opportunity to heap some praise  
on their presiding officer, only the second chief justice ever to 
oversee a presidential impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank the chief justice not only for his patience  
and his perseverance, but for the aura of dignity that he has lent 
to these proceedings,'' lead prosecutor Henry Hyde said. Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., also thanked Rehnquist for his ``impartial 
demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Rehnquist has kept his views on President Clinton's  
impeachment trial to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue and I probably know him about as well as  
anybody,'' says Washington lawyer Charles Cooper, a former 
Rehnquist law clerk. ``That is as it should be. It won't surprise 
me if we never know how he felt about the merits of the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Theodore Olson agreed. ``I have no idea'' of  
the chief justice's views, said Olson, who described Rehnquist as a 
``perfect authority figure'' for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist also has added a little levity now and then. On  
Tuesday, as senators tried to figure out the rules for making 
public their statements during closed deliberations, the chief 
justice interjected with a chuckle, ``The parliamentarian tells me 
that this is all out of order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, when Majority Leader Trent Lott tried to go on to  
another matter, Rehnquist interrupted: ``We have a motion, do we 
not? However amorphous it may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American University law professor Thomas Sargentich described  
the chief justice as ``a moderator of a discussion in which the 
real judges were sitting in front of him. We know very little more 
than we knew in the beginning about the actual role of the chief 
justice in impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that is because the Senate did not hold a real trial as  
they normally are conducted. Because there were no live witnesses, 
Rehnquist was never called on to rule on whether a particular 
question was proper or relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	He also never confronted the question of whether the chief  
justice can, or should, break a tie vote on any trial issue by the 
Senate. Impeachment history is murky on the point. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist did assert himself on some questions:  
</P>
<P>
	--He ruled that senators are both judges and jurors in  
impeachment cases and therefore should not be referred to as 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	--He overruled the trial parliamentarian and decided House  
prosecutors could not object to questions asked during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--He turned down a Democratic request to stop prosecutors from  
meeting with Monica Lewinsky before her formal questioning under 
oath. ``I cannot accede to your request'' to intervene, the chief 
justice said in a letter to Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, Rehnquist kept things running relatively on  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice is a strict enforcer of time limits at the  
Supreme Court. He was somewhat more lenient in the Senate, but when 
Lott asked Saturday if the chief justice wanted to take a break, 
Rehnquist said forcefully, ``No, let's keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, when it seemed time for a break, Lott said  
somewhat sheepishly, ``I was hesitant to suggest it too early 
today, Mr. Chief Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Virginia law professor A.E. Dick Howard said  
Rehnquist is a ``no-nonsense chief justice'' and added, ``I don't 
think he wanted a greater role than what he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the only player of all the cast who had no ...  
political need to posture,'' Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	And once the trial is over, Cooper said, Rehnquist will be  
``back at the court, working hard on regaining his anonymity.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Mayor Suspends Gun Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The mayor on Tuesday suspended the city's  
controversial deal to swap thousands of guns confiscated from 
criminals for new police weapons, saying the contract with a gun 
manufacturer may have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Marc Morial said weapons with their serial numbers removed  
and illegally modified guns were supposed to be destroyed and not 
given to the Smyrna, Ga.-based Glock, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is suspended ``until we can determine whether there  
have been any violations or wrongdoing by (New Orleans police) or 
Glock representatives in trading weapons that should have been 
destroyed,'' Morial said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation will also focus on unconfirmed reports that  
some of the traded guns may have ended up back in Louisiana, Morial 
said. Under the contract, Glock sold the used guns to an Indiana 
firearms dealer. The guns were not to be resold in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	City police have already traded 7,200 confiscated weapons and  
old 9mm service pistols for about 1,700 new Glock .40-caliber 
handguns under terms of the $613,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
	About $153,000 worth of confiscated guns the department still  
owes Glock will be held until the investigation is complete, Morial 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left with a police spokesman and officials at Smyrna,  
Ga.-based Glock were not immediately returned to The Associated 
Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the gun swap deal was made public last month it brought  
swift criticism to Morial, who helped spearhead lawsuits by five 
cities seeking to recover the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said New Orleans acted as a gun distributor and could  
wind up as a defendant in one of those lawsuits if a confiscated 
gun resold elsewhere was used in a crime.

<HEADLINE> Senate Begins Clinton Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate shut its doors Tuesday to debate  
its verdict on the impeachment of Bill Clinton, with the outcome so 
evident that one Republican said ``bipartisan acquittal'' was 
possible by week's end for the second president in history to be 
put on trial for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	After a month and a day spent listening in silence to opposing  
legal arguments, senators began their private deliberations in 
midafternoon in a Senate chamber cleared of House prosecutors, 
presidential lawyers and gallery spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
his efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators spoke from a lectern in the well of the Senate as the  
deliberations unfolded, according to congressional officials. 
Republicans used a sign-up list, while Democrats went by order of 
seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first to speak were Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas  
and Slade Gorton of Washington as well as Democrats Edward M. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. The 
Senate's senior Democrat, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has 
suggested he could vote either way, chose to wait rather than claim 
the right to speak first among lawmakers in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate rules, lawmakers may deliberate for up to 25 hours,  
with 15 minutes allotted to each senator to speak. Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., preached the virtue of brevity, noting that 
Lincoln's Gettysburg address lasted but three minutes and John F. 
Kennedy's famed inaugural address scarcely seven. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort led by Democrats and Texas Republican Kay Bailey  
Hutchison to open the proceedings failed -- it gained a 59-41 
majority but that was short of the two-thirds needed -- with the GOP 
leadership helping to stiffen the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed-door deliberations are more conducive to thoughtful  
exchanges, said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``Sometimes a discussion 
breaks out. If it's in closed session, you will see more of a 
dialogue. If there's going to be any persuasion it's only going to 
be in closed session.'' Despite his remarks, Kyl voted to open the 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that we won't just have speeches and we will have  
deliberations,'' said Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator said he hoped that by closing the  
deliberations the Senate would be able to engage in a candid, 
nonpartisan discussion of a proposal to censure Clinton after his 
presumed acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have been leading the censure effort, with the support  
of a small number of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, lent her support during the day. A  
spokesman said she had succeeded in inserting language in a 
proposal under consideration to make it clear that Clinton would be 
treated like any other citizen after he leaves office -- a time when 
the government decides whether to prosecute him for any alleged 
crime -- and expressing the hope that no future Congress would 
rescind the censure. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said many  
GOP senators oppose censure, but he said he might be receptive as a 
way of dousing any plans for celebration at the White House. ``What 
we could end up having by the end of the week is a bipartisan 
acquittal, which I'm afraid could lead to a good deal of 
celebrating downtown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart has already declared that  
the White House will be a ``gloat-free zone'' after the Senate 
takes its votes. Republicans, in particular, were offended by 
Clinton's campaign-style appearance at the White House with 
Democratic lawmakers hours after the House voted last December to 
impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	With one or two possible exceptions, the Senate's 45 Democrats  
are expected to vote for Clinton's acquittal on both charges -- 
perjury and obstruction of justice. Most of the 55 Republicans are 
expected to vote for conviction, although several GOP senators have 
said in recent days the article of impeachment alleging perjury, in 
particular, could fail to achieve a majority vote. That would mean 
at least six Republicans voting for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the historic trial only days away, Republicans  
moved to tie up loose ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott dispatched a letter to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
containing what Republican officials said was information about a 
possible White House taping system that might have picked up 
telephone conversations between Clinton and Lewinsky. ``All I've 
done is make available information sent to me,'' Lott told 
reporters. He said he has had that information for about a week and 
discussed it with the GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart has denied the existence of  
such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., sought permission to have the Senate  
issue subpoenas for three individuals who have cast doubt on trial 
testimony given last week by White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle objected, however. Republicans,  
who are eager to wrap up the trial without further political 
damage, let the matter die rather than demand a vote by the full 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Blumenthal denied that he had passed to the  
news media Clinton's false account from January 1998 about his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife  
signed affidavits stating that Blumenthal told them the former 
White House intern was a Clinton ``stalker.'' Journalist Scott 
Armstrong signed an affidavit Monday saying he was told by Hitchens 
and his wife, Carol Blue, about their conversation with Blumenthal 
and the ``stalker'' comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter sought subpoenas for Hitchens, Ms. Blue and Armstrong,  
as well as for Blumenthal to allow exploration of ``possible fraud 
on the Senate by alleged perjury'' on the part of the White House 
aide.

<HEADLINE> Playwright Won't Let Women Play Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When an all-female theater troupe took on some  
roles David Mamet wrote for men, the show hit a hurdle. It wasn't 
the set or the theater or the funding. It was the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamet says the men in ``Goldberg Street'' must be, well, men.  
</P>
<P>
	That put the kibosh on the five women of the QuintEssential  
Theatre Co., which was to make its Off-Broadway debut with a series 
of brief plays taken from Mamet's 1985 collection of stories and 
monologues. 
</P>
<P>
	The twentysomething actors had hoped to hit the boards at  
Manhattan's Limelight theater with vintage in-your-face Mamet -- 
lines like ``You can kiss my ...'' and ``Go to hell!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only hours before opening night last month, they learned  
they had lost their dramatic license. ``ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST'' 
said the letters on one legal missive representing Mamet's agent. 
``David Mamet does not permit any gender changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Mamet man is a man is a man, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of such macho plays as  
``American Buffalo'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' apparently decided 
the women were breaching his artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers in QuintEssential, on the other hand, ``feel this  
is a breach of contract,'' said actress Rebecca Woodland. When they 
paid for the rights in October, she said, the troupe made it clear 
they were women. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyer is now threatening to sue two publishing companies  
that share the rights if the troupe is not compensated for at least 
$10,000 in production expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you grant the rights to five females, you know that  
they're going to perform the work,'' attorney John Lonuzzi said 
Monday. ``In this case, after rights were granted, someone decided 
they didn't want to go ahead with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gender-bending is nothing new in drama.  
</P>
<P>
	Plays in ancient Greece were usually staged with men playing  
female roles. Shakespearean characters of both sexes were 
traditionally played by men or young boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Proper Elizabethan ladies, after all, dared not appear on the  
bawdy boards, a fact illustrated in the current film ``Shakespeare 
in Love,'' in which Gwyneth Paltrow swaddles herself in men's 
clothes simply so she can act alongside her love, William 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, New York theater auditions are peppered with reverse  
roles. Julie Andrews, the star of the wholesome musical ``The Sound 
of Music,'' recently starred in ``Victor, Victoria,'' playing a 
woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Whoopi Goldberg replaced Nathan Lane in the role of  
Pseudolus, a slave in search of his freedom, in ``A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And this summer, the male artistic director of London's Globe  
theater, a revival of Shakespeare's playhouse, plans to play 
Cleopatra in the Bard's ``Antony and Cleopatra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mamet, whose script ``Wag the Dog'' was nominated for an Academy  
Award, made a big splash on Broadway when his play ``Speed the 
Plow'' got lavish media attention. It starred the gender-exploding 
rock star Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Mamet's lawyers say QuintEssential has gone too far.  
When asked via his literary agent to comment on the dilemma, Mamet 
was mum. His publicity agent didn't return calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five women say they chose Mamet's work because, Woodland  
said, ``we wanted to produce theater that transcends gender 
boundaries, that's people-driven, that's about human 
communication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, argues Woodland, it doesn't matter whether the skits are  
played by men or women, because they ``have nothing to do with 
sexual interaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the troupe says it has no politically correct  
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work well together and we have similar views  
artistically,'' said actress Kathryn Rolston, a native of Wigan, 
England. She says they might even hire some male actors, ``and I'm 
looking forward to it!''

<HEADLINE> Fidelity Fund Kicks Up Some Fuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Even though it is the oldest fund at the biggest  
of all mutual fund families, the Fidelity Fund doesn't get much 
time in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with assets of $10.5 billion, it is outranked in size by  
more than a half-dozen other funds in the Fidelity Investments 
complex, including the giant Fidelity Magellan, at $83.5 billion. 
Its name seldom comes up in performance debates that focus on funds 
like Magellan or the Internet-connected Fidelity Select Electronics 
and Fidelity Select Developing Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a flashy fund, and I'm not a flashy fund manager,''  
says Beth Terrana, a 14-year veteran in the Fidelity management 
corps who has run the Fidelity Fund since July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not to say Ms. Terrana has nothing to boast about.  
The fund, which traces its origins to 1930, has sextupled in size 
since she took over the reins, with help from the great bull market 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Fidelity Fund racked up a total return of 31  
percent, outpacing the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by almost 
2 1/2 percentage points. It also trounced the Lipper average of what 
the fund defines as its peer group, growth and income funds, which 
was up 15.61 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With a five-star rating from Morningstar Mutual Funds, which  
classifies the fund's return as high and its risk as below-average, 
``I think the fund will have a higher profile,'' Ms. Terrana said 
in an interview in her office, decorated with recent school 
projects and other mementos of her two small children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manager Terrana's style is tough to pigeonhole,'' said  
Morningstar analyst Scott Cooley in a recent appraisal. ``Her fund 
includes some traditional value fare such as Philip Morris, and a 
sizable stake in financials. On the other hand, Terrana also likes 
a good growth stock, provided that its valuations aren't 
extraordinarily high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One measure of how she operates can be taken from her approach  
to the Internet, which she sees as part of ``one of the most 
important themes and trends within the market -- the 
telecommunications revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You won't find the Fidelity Fund chasing the latest 'Net new  
issue that skyrockets across the sky. But in the past year, Ms. 
Terrana has more than doubled the percentage of the fund's assets 
committed to technology, from 6.1 percent at the end of 1997 to 
13.9 percent at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my responses has been to own telecom stocks,'' she says  
in the unmistakable accents of her native New York City, which 
persist after more than 20 years of living in Boston. ``It's kind 
of the chicken way to own the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also has a piece of America Online, the most serious  
aspirant among Internet stocks to blue-chip status. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Terrana expects the whole subject of the Internet to keep  
making market news through 1999, as investors get a clearer picture 
of its importance for the economy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, she says, the Internet acts as a powerful force  
against inflation, while increasing productivity and competition. 
``I did 80 percent of my holiday shopping this winter over the 
Web,'' she says. ``I think the deflationary impact of the Internet 
is something we've just started to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also sees important positives in the recent trend of  
economic growth. ``The global economy has been weakening for the 
last 18 months, but we have a very strong U.S. consumer,'' she 
says. ``We've now gone eight years in this economic cycle. Could it 
be 10 years? It's certainly possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the Asian economies are better -- or maybe less bad is  
the right way to put it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all those pluses, however, Ms. Terrana says she worries  
about ``just how narrow the market is,'' with investors all 
scrambling to crowd into a few dozen blue-chip and technology 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, the gauge so  
commonly used when investors measure their performance, ``is 
getting growthier and growthier and growthier,'' she says. ``It 
heightens the risk that exists in the market. I don't think I used 
to think about the downside as much as I do today.''

<HEADLINE> For Some, Y2K Causing Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Never mind that the year 2000 hasn't arrived  
yet. It turned businessman Mark Yarsike's first day as a gourmet 
produce grocer into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening Produce Palace in the suburban Detroit to the  
public, Yarsike and his partner were thrilled to see customers 
stream in and pick out purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	But things quickly turned sour when store clerks tried to ring  
up purchases on the store's sparkling new $100,000 high-tech 
computer system. It crashed after clerks tried to process credit 
cards set to expire in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire computer system crashed. Lines were 10 to 20 people  
deep,'' he told the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday. ``People 
were waiting with full carts of groceries to pay but couldn't. We 
could not process a single credit card or could not take cash or 
checks. We could not make one sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarsike asked the committee to reject a bill that would limit  
the amount of court damages plaintiffs like him can collect from 
companies that cause business failures or sell products that fail 
because of the Year 2000 computer problem, also known as the Y2K 
glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, introduced by committee Chairman John McCain,  
R-Ariz., no punitive damages would be awarded except in cases of 
extreme negligence. Damages not related to economic loss would be 
limited to $250,000 or three times the amount of economic loss. 
Noneconomic damages for smaller businesses would be limited to 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require plaintiffs to give defendants a  
chance to correct their mistakes before a lawsuit is filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other members of Congress are working on their own bills  
and a coalition of business leaders has proposed another plan. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has called his bill a ``work in progress'' and open  
to changes, assured Yarsike that it is designed to discourage 
frivolous lawsuits and greedy lawyers. It would not protect 
businesses from the cost of correcting their mistakes and repairing 
equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses that make a good-faith effort to prepare for the year  
2000 or fix their mistakes should not be punished for their efforts 
with high punitive damage awards, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer programmers inside and outside government are  
scrambling to avert disasters expected when New Year's Day 2000 
arrives. That's when computer systems performing calculations 
involving dates may begin generating incorrect data because they 
recognize only the last two digits of a year and will assume that 
2000 is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have said the Y2K computer glitch could spark such  
problems as power outages, traffic snarls, paycheck delays and 
disruption of air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is expected to trigger a flood of expensive lawsuits,  
and many of them are likely to be filed by unscrupulous attorneys, 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits are sheer craziness and represent  
ambulance-chasing at its worst,'' McCain said. ``They are absolute 
confirmation that Y2K litigation is not about consumers, but about 
making wealthy lawyers even wealthier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarsike said that if such a law been in place during the 2 1/2  
years he struggled with almost daily computer crashes, the company 
that sold him the system would never have settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, Yarsike wonders whether the customers who stalked  
out of his store in 1995 ever bothered to give him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``People began drifting out, leaving full carts of groceries  
behind,'' Yarsike said. ``As my partner and I darted around the 
store trying to calm people, we heard constant comments like, `I'll 
never come back here.' ... People walked out in droves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have bought the $500 registers my parents used when  
they arrived from Poland,'' he told the committee. ``At least those 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> States Setting New Rules for HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress failed to pass legislation regulating  
HMOs last year, but states continued to set new rules meant to 
protect patient rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were fewer new mandates in 1998 than in 1996 and  
1997, partly because of waning interest and partly because states 
have already enacted a large number of requirements, the BlueCross 
BlueShield Association found in its annual survey of state action 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine states approved measures allowing patients direct access to  
specialists without getting permission from a primary care doctor, 
and eight states adopted some type of mandatory outside review for 
patients who want to challenge a denial of care. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty states considered legislation expanding patients right to  
sue insurance companies, but none of these bills passed. That 
leaves Texas as the only state that allows people in health plans 
traditionally regulated by the federal government an avenue for 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proponents were unable to convince a majority of legislatures  
that suing health plans is a good way to improve quality,'' said 
Susan Laudicina, director of state services research at the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to help all Americans, Congress is considering a host of  
legislation that would enact federal requirements in each of these 
areas. State laws, no matter how prolific, do not apply to some 50 
million Americans who get their health insurance from companies 
that are regulated by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't get the job done purely at the state level,''  
said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a consumer group that is pushing 
for new federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of federal action, who also fight against these state  
laws, say mandates drive up the cost of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to this year, the survey found states were likely  
to consider many of the same issues again, with new interest in 
regulation of pharmacy benefits. These include proposals to 
restrict use of formularies -- lists of approved drugs -- and to 
restrict requirements that patients use generic versions of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998, the BlueCross survey also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Just over half the states considered bills to create quality  
standards for managed care plans. Eleven states adopted these laws, 
which generally require plans to have enough doctors, appropriate 
credentials for providers, disclosures on what services are covered 
and timely resolution of patient complaints inside the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are now 22 states that require some sort of independent  
review of complaints, though these laws vary in scope. Almost half 
of the states debated such laws this year. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than half the states considered some sort of law that  
would allow patients direct access to gynecologists, pediatricians 
or other providers. Nine laws were passed, bringing to 35 the 
number of states with some sort of direct-access law. 
</P>
<P>
	--20 states considered mandating some sort of emergency room  
coverage -- usually requiring that insurance companies pay for 
visits if a reasonable person would have believed his or her health 
was in danger. Twelve states enacted laws, bringing the total 
number to 38. 
</P>
<P>
	--Five states enacted laws requiring some degree of parity for  
mental health benefits. These laws were considered in more than 
half of the states' legislatures.

<HEADLINE> FAA, Pilots Reach Runway Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government, airlines and the nation's  
largest pilot union reached an agreement Tuesday that will allow 
continued simultaneous takeoffs and landings on intersecting 
airport runways. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, reached between the Federal Aviation Administration,  
the Air Transport Association and the Air Line Pilots Association 
International, came 10 days before the association's 50,000 pilots 
planned to start refusing ``land-and-hold-short operations'' -- a 
technique used to reduce airport delays and congestion around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Such refusals would have required air traffic controllers to  
wait until a landing airliner had turned off a runway before giving 
takeoff clearance to a plane using an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, pilots who are landing are asked if they will stop  
before a runway intersection so the adjacent runway can be used for 
a takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots usually agree because they know that with their  
airplane's weight and anticipated stopping point, there is little 
chance that they would reach the runway intersection before the 
plane taking off had already flown over that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal:  
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides agree that land-and-hold-short operations should not  
be tried when it's wet, despite previous tests. They will be 
reserved for dry runways only. 
</P>
<P>
	--Airports will install two sets of lights in intersecting  
runways to both warn pilots of the upcoming intersection and to 
then demarcate precisely where the runways cross. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pilots and air traffic controllers will receive new training in  
land-and-hold-short operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides have agreed to use more conservative figures for  
calculating which runways qualify for land-and-hold-short 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both will study several runways where a midair collision could  
occur if a pilot who aborted a landing continued into the path of 
an airliner taking off on an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that with this agreement, airline passengers  
can be assured that land-and-hold-short operations will now be 
performed with increased margins of safety,'' said Capt. Duane 
Woerth, president of the pilots' association. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey added: ``The three parties worked  
closely together to identify and resolve issues with the first 
consideration always being safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Land-and-hold-short operations were begun in 1968. Since then,  
air traffic has increased dramatically. Takeoffs and landings alone 
have risen from 55.9 million in 1985 to 61.1 million in 1996. At 
the same time, there has been an increase in the number of 
intersecting runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, land-and-hold-short operations are permitted at 850  
runways in 220 airports around the country, including Logan 
International in Boston, a popular European gateway, and O'Hare 
International in Chicago, the world's busiest airport. 
</P>
<P>
	As airlines have pushed to improve their on-time performance,  
pilots have expressed concern about the practice. A NASA database 
on land-and-hold-short operations also shows at least 50 incidents 
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 19, 1997, the FAA proposed rules that would expand  
land-and-hold-short operations. Among other things, the rules would 
allow all airports to conduct such landings. They also would have 
allowed the landings on wet runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol B. Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association,  
the trade group representing major airlines, said: ``Land-and-hold 
short operations have been safely and effectively used for more 
than 30 years, and with the agreed-upon procedures, LAHSO will 
continue to safely provide increased airport capacity into the 20th 
century.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Discusses Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates used lucrative  
incentives to help clinch deals with companies that promised to 
promote Microsoft's Internet browser and drop the one made by rival 
Netscape, a Microsoft manager admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates urged his executives to use such inducements to help  
encourage widespread use of the company's then-emerging browser, 
said William Poole, Microsoft's director of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was sort of the high-level message from Mr. Gates,''  
Poole testified Monday during Microsoft's antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The incentives, characterized as a bribe by Justice Department  
attorney David Boies, came up in an e-mail Gates wrote to his 
executives about his talks with Intuit founder Scott Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do  
for him that would cost us something like $1 million to do that in 
return for switching browsers in the next few months I would be 
open to doing that,'' Gates said in the July 1996 memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, which makes the popular financial software Quicken,  
signed a deal with Microsoft the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies used the memo to demonstrate how the software giant  
allegedly took advantage of its monopoly power to crush its 
competition. The government contends Microsoft often used illegal 
tactics to discourage clients from distributing the browser made by 
Netscape, which once dominated the Internet software business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cameron Myhrvold, vice president of Microsoft's Internet  
customer unit, scheduled to be the next witness called by the 
company, said Netscape lost the browser war because of poor 
business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony released Monday, Myhrvold said Netscape  
made ``a number of strategic mistakes'' over the past few years 
that decreased its browser's popularity. It originally charged too 
much for the software, which Microsoft gave away for free. Netscape 
also failed to maintain its reputation for cutting-edge technology, 
said Myhrvold, who could take the witness stand as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, during his cross-examination, was questioned about his  
role in securing the Intuit deal. The negotiations were structured 
around the Windows ``channel bar,'' a list of prominent Internet 
sites that appears when a computer using Windows is turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit was offered a prime spot on the channel bar in a contract  
that prohibited the company from promoting Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit President and Chief Executive Officer William Harris  
testified earlier in the trial about learning ``that any such 
agreement would require, as a condition, that Inuit forgo any 
business relationships with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said Intuit agreed to the restriction because a place on  
the Windows desktop was ``very important to them.'' The spot would 
help provide access to millions of computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said the exclusionary contract was not much different from  
those signed between major businesses in other industries.

<HEADLINE> Molinari Urges Bush To Run in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A top New York Republican is throwing his  
muscle behind an effort to persuade Texas Gov. George W. Bush to 
get into the race for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has his own network and he inherits the network of his  
dad,'' said Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a 
former congressman. ``He represents our best opportunity for taking 
back the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he would be joining with about four dozen other  
Republicans in Washington today to press the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari, whose daughter Susan gave up a promising career in  
Congress for a short-lived job in television, has been close to 
former President Bush for years and served as the elder Bush's New 
York presidential campaign chairman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he has not talked with the Texas governor about  
whether he will run for the GOP nomination. The younger Bush has 
said he will make a decision within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari also said that New York Gov. George Pataki is hurting  
his chances of being on the ticket as vice presidential candidate 
by warring with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The two have 
been at odds over everything from how the city school system is run 
to how much state aid the city receives.

diplomats and an often hostile world,'' Albright said at a 50th 
anniversary celebration of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she first fell in love with the Marine Corps as a  
Czech emigre child in London in World War II and saw the guards 
outside the U.S. Embassy. She now has a Marine sword on her office 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve guards in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and  
elsewhere have been killed on duty since 1968. Albright said ``all 
of them died as heroes for all died helping our country fulfill a 
leadership role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Charles C. Krulak, commandant of the Marine Corps, said the  
guards and the State Department have become inseparable. Protecting 
U.S. installations abroad against terrorists and other assailants, 
he said, ``they have been shot at, rocketed, wounded and sometimes 
killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He singled out a 20-year-old Marine from New Jersey, Stephen  
Crowley, who remained at his post on the roof of the U.S. Embassy 
in Islamabad, Pakistan, in 1979 as a furious mob stormed the 
embassy and forced the American diplomatic contingent into a 
third-floor vault before Pakistani security forces rescued them 
from a five-hour ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowley was shot and killed by a sniper as the last American  
found refuge in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was held in a State Department auditorium, with a  
Marine color guard standing motionless on the stage after 
presenting the colors.

<HEADLINE> Unser Withdraws From IROC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. withdrew from the 1999  
International Race of Champions Series after his 12-year-old 
daughter was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Unser was in an Albuquerque, N.M., hospital on Tuesday and  
was undergoing diagnostic tests. The youngster, one of four Unser 
children, reportedly became ill during a school basketball game on 
Friday. No other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, a two-time IROC champion and the career leading winner in  
the all-star series, will be replaced by NASCAR Winston Cup star 
Bobby Labonte, the pole winner for the 1998 Daytona 500 and a 
two-time winner last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's only previous IROC experience was replacing Robby  
Gordon in 1997 after the latter sustained a concussion during a 
Winston Cup event in Fontana, Calif. Labonte started 10th in the 
12-car field and finishing second to eventual series champion Mark 
Martin in the IROC race in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Signore, president of IROC, said Unser, a regular in the  
CART series, does not plan to return to IROC this season and will 
concentrate his attention on his family and his Champ car ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-race IROC series begins Friday at Daytona International  
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOWE'S MOTOR SPEEDWAY:* The announcement that Charlotte Motor  
Speedway will be known as Lowe's Motor Speedway under an agreement 
between and track and the home improvement warehouse chain drew an 
immediate reaction from Winston Cup car owner Michael Kranefuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of thing was probably inevitable,'' said Kranefuss,  
who with Roger Penske owns the Fords being campaigned by Jeremy 
Mayfield. ``Cities have been selling name rights to their stadiums 
and arenas for years. Why not race tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some traditionalists, Kranefuss demonstrated that he is  
not upset with the new commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they continue to refer to us as the Mobil 1 team,  
we will refer to them as Lowe's Motor Speedway,'' Kranefuss said 
with a chuckle. ``I see little negative in it. Hopefully, this will 
bring new revenue into the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO TAKERS:* All 59 drivers who made qualifying laps during the  
first two rounds of time trials for the Daytona 500 decided to 
stand on their times on Tuesday, canceling out the scheduled 
Winston Cup qualifying session. 
</P>
<P>
	The timed laps determine the starting positions for Thursday's  
twin 125-mile qualifying races, which will in turn fill positions 
3-30 in the 43-car field for Sunday's 500-miler. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions 31-36 will go to the remaining fastest drivers from  
the two days of qualifying, with the final seven starters chosen on 
the basis of 1998 car-owner points. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *DASH FOR CASH:* Rookies in NASCAR's top three divisions will  
collect an additional $5,000 for any victory this season, and a 
corresponding drawing will be held to give a fan a like amount 
should that transpire. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, ``The Rookie Dash for Cash,'' is sponsored by  
MoonPie, the marshmallow snack. Included in the competition will be 
rookies from the Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and Craftsman 
Truck series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a promotion like this has encompassed  
NASCAR's top three series. 
</P>
<P>
	The six Winston Cup rookies who helped promote the program were  
told to take a bite from their MoonPies at a photo shoot. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thomas Celebrates Lincoln's Beliefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas  
celebrated the legacy of Abraham Lincoln Tuesday night, praising 
Lincoln's adherence to the rule of law and stressing the importance 
of preserving the Constitution more than 200 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, speaking to the Claremont Institute, called the task of  
protecting the Constitution and its underlying principles ``a 
serious endeavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this goes, this grand experiment is over,'' he said. The  
justice noted that he rarely ventures beyond straightforward court 
opinions, because he views the law as ``deadly serious business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But upholding the rule of law may sometimes require political  
judgments and prudent compromises, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics at its root is the art of the possible,'' Thomas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, the founding fathers compromised by not  
abolishing slavery in the Constitution. But they did so because 
they believed only a unified nation of all states -- committed to 
human equality -- could put slavery on the course to extinction, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And although Lincoln was an opponent of slavery, the president  
did not forsake his belief in the rule of law or in the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first blush, Lincoln's devotion to the rule of law ...  
would seem not to merit our praise but deserve our collective 
condemnation,'' Thomas said. But Lincoln understood that not 
upholding the rule of law could mean secession, which would in turn 
perpetuate and expand slavery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By doing so, Lincoln ``enabled this nation to fulfill its  
promises of liberty and justice for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was part of the Claremont Institute's third annual  
Lincoln Day celebration.

<HEADLINE> Evel Knievel Advises Walter Payton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Evel Knievel thinks Walter Payton's wait for  
a liver transplant would be shortened if he comes to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, who underwent the operation here last month, said he  
told the Chicago Bears Hall of Famer that the waiting list for a 
liver is shorter through the Tampa-based LifeLink than in more 
highly populated areas, where the wait can be three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is on a national list through the Mayo Clinic in  
Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `I don't care where you've been, who you've seen or  
what you've done. All I want is to tell you I love you and I want 
you to come down and see Dr. (Hector) Ramos and LifeLink,''' the 
former daredevil recalled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 44, announced this month that he has primary sclerosing  
cholangitis, which blocks the bile ducts. The former running back 
could die in two years if he does not get a new liver. Knievel 
waited eight months for his. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Duncan Bell, a LifeLink spokeswoman, said the program  
doesn't estimate how long a person may have to wait.

<HEADLINE>  Aamodt Wins Combined Skiing Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Aamodt and Kjus. Kjus and Aamodt. The two  
Norwegian stars have become as inseparable as salmon and boiled 
potatoes at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus finished 1-2 on Tuesday in  
the men's combined event, giving Aamodt his second medal at these 
championships and Kjus his third. 
</P>
<P>
	They feed off each other's accomplishments, and have been for  
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasse and I motivate each other by having good results,''  
Aamodt, 27, said. ``When he's not at the start, I don't feel like 
racing either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been skiing against him since I was 6 years old, and he's  
the skier I measure myself against. He's been doing so well this 
year, and I feel fortunate to beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, agreed. ``Kjetil is such a marvelous skier. He  
motivates me and helps me to ski faster. We're a positive influence 
on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time in these championships that Aamodt and Kjus  
have joined each other on the podium. Kjus was second in Saturday's 
downhill, behind Austria's Hermann Maier, and Aamodt was third. 
Last Tuesday, Kjus shared the super-G gold medal with Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	True to their symbiotic relationship, the Norwegians have  
dominated the two combined events on the World Cup circuit this 
season. Kjus was first and Aamodt second in a combined in Wengen, 
Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week later, Aamodt was first and Kjus 
second in Kitzbuhel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	With his second medal, Aamodt tied Marc Girardelli's record for  
the most world championship and Olympic medals in a career, with 
13. Kjus is not far behind, with 11. 
</P>
<P>
	In this event, the combined times of a downhill and two slalom  
runs determine the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, gold medalist in combined at the last world  
championships in 1997 in Sestrieres, Italy, led Kjus by .40 seconds 
entering the second heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus had the second-fastest time in the second run of 45.12  
seconds, giving him a combined time of 2 minutes, 43.25 seconds and 
putting pressure on his teammate, who skied next. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aamodt was up to the challenge. Early in his run, he lost a  
few hundredths of his advantage, but he punched out gates in a mad 
rush to the bottom, finishing in 45.36 for a total time of 2:43.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Paul Accola took the bronze medal as the top seven  
racers after the first slalom run held their positions in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who finished second in the combined at the 1989 world  
championships here, overcame a slip near the finish when he got 
sideways between gates and still managed to post the fastest second 
run, 45.09. His combined time was 2:43.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is the worst competition for us because we  
know we're favorites,'' Aamodt said. ``The (time) difference in the 
downhill was small, so I knew I had to risk in the slalom to get 
the gold or take a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Lasse push really hard out of the start, so ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus said he was satisfied with the silver medal. ``I skied very  
well today. Kjetil skied a bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian men and women claimed 10 out of a possible 15 medals  
through the first five events, but they were shut out for the first 
time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has five medals, all accounted for by Kjus and Aamodt.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was the top North American, placing 13th  
in 2:49.67. Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., was the top 
American, finishing 16th in 2:52.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who has been critical of the leadership of the Swiss Ski  
Federation, said, ``If winning the medal saves their jobs, I'm 
sorry I won it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Christian Mayer placed fourth in 2:43.89.  
Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, who paced the downhill portion of the 
combined on Monday but slipped to fifth place after a mediocre 
first slalom run earlier Tuesday, was fifth in 2:44.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the only skier to have won world-championship medals in  
all five disciplines, trailed Kernen by just .08 seconds in the 
downhill. Aamodt fashioned a first slalom run of 44.21 to move into 
first place overall at 1:57.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, third in the downhill but only .14 seconds behind Kernen,  
was timed in 44.55 in the first slalom and stood second overall at 
1:58.13. He lost some ground to his teammate, however, falling .40 
seconds behind Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion,  
straddled a gate on his first slalom and was disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Burst of Productivity Should Extend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of productivity at the end of 1998  
suggests the economy can continue to have its cake and eat it, too 
-- grow robustly with low inflation -- for a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Output per hour of work by nonfarm, nonsupervisory employees  
increased a healthy 2.2 percent last year, the Labor Department 
said Tuesday. During the final three months of the year, 
productivity surged at a 3.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual 
rate, the biggest advance since the first three months of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's symbolic of the extraordinary strength of this economic  
expansion,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``This really is the bottom line: 
Strong productivity growth means living standards are rising 
quickly. ... And the momentum the economy is exhibiting will carry 
over into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.2 percent gain in 1998 marked a significant improvement  
over the 1.2 percent increase in 1997 and was nearly as good as the 
2.4 percent rise in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, after growing at nearly a 3 percent rate in the  
1960s and early 1970s, slowed to an anemic 1 percent rate from 1974 
through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at nearly a 2 percent 
rate, leading some economists to speculate that the economy has 
embarked on a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers 
and other high-tech innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe productivity recently has been even better than  
measured because it's difficult to gauge the output of many 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to  
prosperity because sizable increases mean companies can pay 
employees more, hold the line on prices and still deliver profits 
to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The robust productivity data suggest that the economy can grow  
at a faster pace with less inflation,'' said economist Veronika 
White of First Union Bank Corp. in Philadelphia. ``Indeed, the 
economy has been doing this for a number of years now, and 1999 
will probably surprise on the upside, once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, employees have been reaping more of the benefits of  
increased productivity, in contrast to earlier in the decade, when 
the benefits flowed into corporate profits and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and  
benefits jumped 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of underlying  
inflation pressures, slowed last year. They rose 2 percent, 
compared with 2.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a 0.2 percent  
annual rate, the first decline since the first quarter of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At factories, many of them hard hit by loss of export sales to  
Asia and other economically struggling parts of the world, 
productivity still increased a strong 4.3 percent in 1998, down 
from a five-year high of 4.9 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manufacturing of durable goods -- items from cars to  
computers expected to last three or more years -- productivity 
surged 6.8 percent, the biggest advance since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of manufacturers to maintain, and in many cases  
improve, productivity reflects their determination to operate 
efficiently in the face of lost sales abroad. That, in turn, has 
caused the loss of more than 200,000 jobs in the sector since 
March.

<HEADLINE> Film Documentary Market Said Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A boom in history-based television productions  
is opening new markets for filmmakers, making the past more 
accessible for viewers and pushing a once low-profile art form 
toward television's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	At a weekend meeting in Washington, documentary filmmakers said  
the growth of new markets on such channels as A&AMP;E, the History 
Channel and the Discovery Channel is a blessing, even if some of 
the work is not as in-depth as traditional documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's best-known documentary filmmakers agrees  
that the channels are valuable because they offer outlets for 
documentaries. But he cautioned in a phone interview Monday that as 
these new markets have production and time pressures that work 
against some of the most valuable aspects of the in-depth 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite often, the demands of a commercial network are in  
opposition to the complexity and intelligence of a documentary 
film,'' said Ken Burns, whose 1990 series ``The Civil War'' set 
records for public television viewership. 
</P>
<P>
	A disadvantage of commercial television is the frequent  
interruptions for advertisements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a clicker generation, as soon as an ad comes on, people  
fly,'' Burns said. ``Because the cable audience is so small, there 
is not a huge budget for these. There is a more superficial, more 
journalistic approach, rather than working for five years on 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Moore, a director of photography on several of Burns'  
projects, said in an interview that not all documentary producers 
can get the kind of money raised by Burns for popular projects, 
such as his works on the Civil War and baseball. But the growth of 
the market for documentaries is good for the industry, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we can expand our audience to the value of  
documentary material, the better off we'll all be in the long 
run,'' Moore said. It's not fair to compare the longer Burns series 
to cable shows produced more quickly, such as the ones on A&AMP;E's 
popular ``Biography'' series, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most American viewers want material that is intelligent and  
informative. But they don't always want to watch a production that 
runs over several days, said filmmaker Nina Seavey, a co-producer 
of the film: ``A Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She questioned whether filmmakers given a rushed schedule and  
limited budgets will have the time to question the complexity of 
their film's topic ``and then express that complexity in an 
intelligent way.''

<HEADLINE>  Life IS Beautiful for Italian Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy has won its share of Oscars, but the seven  
nominations for ``Life is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's 
bittersweet comedy about the Holocaust, set a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said Tuesday after the  
nominations -- including his own as best actor -- were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' tells the story of a Jewish father who  
uses humor to try to shield his little son from the horrors of a 
German concentration camp. It was nominated for best picture, best 
foreign film, best actor, best director, best screenplay, best 
editing and best original soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than 10,000 people voting for the Academy  
Awards and I don't know how to thank everybody,'' the famously 
irrepressible Italian comedian told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be a bluebird, flying in each of their windows  
to sing my thank yous,'' he added, tweeting and whistling like a 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Congratulations poured in from everyone from the prime minister  
on down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful film that, along with millions of Italians, I  
loved,'' said Premier Massimo D'Alema. Culture Minister Giovanna 
Melandri called the nominations ``recognition from the 
international world of cinema for this big little genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is the first movie in three decades to get  
Oscar nominations for both for best picture and best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the success of a film that deserves a special place in  
the history of cinema, because it deals with the greatest horror of 
all times with respect and poetry,'' said Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	In Benigni's hometown of Vergaio, a village in Tuscany, his  
parents toasted their son and the phenomenal recognition his movie 
had received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him the night of the premiere: 'Dearest Roberto, this  
is the most beautiful film you've made,''' said his father, Luigi, 
a farmer who spent two years in a German labor camp during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely acclaimed and the winner of 28 festival prizes already,  
``Life is Beautiful'' has weathered its share of controversy. Some 
feel it trivializes the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear is that from fairy tale to fairy tale, we will head  
toward euphemisms that make the unacceptable acceptable,'' said 
Tullia Zevi, ex-president of the Union of Italian Jewish 
Communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is a breakthrough film for Benigni, a  
comedian best known for his pratfalls and rapid-fire delivery. 
Critics have hailed it as a profound tragicomedy and have even 
compared Benigni to his hero, the legendary Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked it,'' Amos Luzzato, president of the Union of Italian  
Jewish Communities, said of the movie. ``Not only that, it touched 
me. And it astonished me. I never suspected Benigni could do such a 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, an Italian film about a lovesick postman was the talk  
of Hollywood. ``The Postman (``Il Postino'')'' got five nominations 
-- including best picture and best actor. It won only for best 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	The last movie to be nominated for both best motion picture and  
best foreign film was Costa Gavras' ``Z'' in 1969, which won for 
best foreign movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Italian movie to win the Oscar for best foreign film  
was ``Mediterraneo'' by Gabriele Salvatores in 1992. The late 
Federico Fellini won four Oscars for best foreign film.

<HEADLINE>  Life IS Beautiful for Italian Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy has won its share of Oscars, but the seven  
nominations for ``Life is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's 
bittersweet comedy about the Holocaust, set a record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said Tuesday after the  
nominations -- including his own as best actor -- were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' tells the story of a Jewish father who  
uses humor to try to shield his little son from the horrors of a 
German concentration camp. It was nominated for best picture, best 
foreign film, best actor, best director, best screenplay, best 
editing and best original soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more than 10,000 people voting for the Academy  
Awards and I don't know how to thank everybody,'' the famously 
irrepressible Italian comedian told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be a bluebird, flying in each of their windows  
to sing my thank yous,'' he added, tweeting and whistling like a 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Congratulations poured in from everyone from the prime minister  
on down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful film that, along with millions of Italians, I  
loved,'' said Premier Massimo D'Alema. Culture Minister Giovanna 
Melandri called the nominations ``recognition from the 
international world of cinema for this big little genius.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is the first movie in three decades to get  
Oscar nominations for both for best picture and best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the success of a film that deserves a special place in  
the history of cinema, because it deals with the greatest horror of 
all times with respect and poetry,'' said Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	In Benigni's hometown of Vergaio, a village in Tuscany, his  
parents toasted their son and the phenomenal recognition his movie 
had received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him the night of the premiere: 'Dearest Roberto, this  
is the most beautiful film you've made,''' said his father, Luigi, 
a farmer who spent two years in a German labor camp during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Widely acclaimed and the winner of 28 festival prizes already,  
``Life is Beautiful'' has weathered its share of controversy. Some 
feel it trivializes the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear is that from fairy tale to fairy tale, we will head  
toward euphemisms that make the unacceptable acceptable,'' said 
Tullia Zevi, ex-president of the Union of Italian Jewish 
Communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' is a breakthrough film for Benigni, a  
comedian best known for his pratfalls and rapid-fire delivery. 
Critics have hailed it as a profound tragicomedy and have even 
compared Benigni to his hero, the legendary Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked it,'' Amos Luzzato, president of the Union of Italian  
Jewish Communities, said of the movie. ``Not only that, it touched 
me. And it astonished me. I never suspected Benigni could do such a 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, an Italian film about a lovesick postman was the talk  
of Hollywood. ``The Postman (``Il Postino'')'' got five nominations 
-- including best picture and best actor. It won only for best 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	The last movie to be nominated for both best motion picture and  
best foreign film was Costa Gavras' ``Z'' in 1969, which won for 
best foreign movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Italian movie to win the Oscar for best foreign film  
was ``Mediterraneo'' by Gabriele Salvatores in 1992. The late 
Federico Fellini won four Oscars for best foreign film.

<HEADLINE>  Aamodt Wins Combined Skiing Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Aamodt and Kjus. Kjus and Aamodt. The two  
Norwegian stars have become as inseparable as salmon and boiled 
potatoes at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus finished 1-2 on Tuesday in  
the men's combined event, giving Aamodt his second medal at these 
championships and Kjus his third. 
</P>
<P>
	They feed off each other's accomplishments, and have been for  
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasse and I motivate each other by having good results,''  
Aamodt, 27, said. ``When he's not at the start, I don't feel like 
racing either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been skiing against him since I was 6 years old, and he's  
the skier I measure myself against. He's been doing so well this 
year, and I feel fortunate to beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, agreed. ``Kjetil is such a marvelous skier. He  
motivates me and helps me to ski faster. We're a positive influence 
on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time in these championships that Aamodt and Kjus  
have joined each other on the podium. Kjus was second in Saturday's 
downhill, behind Austria's Hermann Maier, and Aamodt was third. 
Last Tuesday, Kjus shared the super-G gold medal with Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	True to their symbiotic relationship, the Norwegians have  
dominated the two combined events on the World Cup circuit this 
season. Kjus was first and Aamodt second in a combined in Wengen, 
Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week later, Aamodt was first and Kjus 
second in Kitzbuhel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	With his second medal, Aamodt tied Marc Girardelli's record for  
the most world championship and Olympic medals in a career, with 
13. Kjus is not far behind, with 11. 
</P>
<P>
	In this event, the combined times of a downhill and two slalom  
runs determine the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, gold medalist in combined at the last world  
championships in 1997 in Sestrieres, Italy, led Kjus by .40 seconds 
entering the second heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus had the second-fastest time in the second run of 45.12  
seconds, giving him a combined time of 2 minutes, 43.25 seconds and 
putting pressure on his teammate, who skied next. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aamodt was up to the challenge. Early in his run, he lost a  
few hundredths of his advantage, but he punched out gates in a mad 
rush to the bottom, finishing in 45.36 for a total time of 2:43.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Paul Accola took the bronze medal as the top seven  
racers after the first slalom run held their positions in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who finished second in the combined at the 1989 world  
championships here, overcame a slip near the finish when he got 
sideways between gates and still managed to post the fastest second 
run, 45.09. His combined time was 2:43.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is the worst competition for us because we  
know we're favorites,'' Aamodt said. ``The (time) difference in the 
downhill was small, so I knew I had to risk in the slalom to get 
the gold or take a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Lasse push really hard out of the start, so ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus said he was satisfied with the silver medal. ``I skied very  
well today. Kjetil skied a bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian men and women claimed 10 out of a possible 15 medals  
through the first five events, but they were shut out for the first 
time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has five medals, all accounted for by Kjus and Aamodt.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was the top North American, placing 13th  
in 2:49.67. Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., was the top 
American, finishing 16th in 2:52.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who has been critical of the leadership of the Swiss Ski  
Federation, said, ``If winning the medal saves their jobs, I'm 
sorry I won it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Christian Mayer placed fourth in 2:43.89.  
Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, who paced the downhill portion of the 
combined on Monday but slipped to fifth place after a mediocre 
first slalom run earlier Tuesday, was fifth in 2:44.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the only skier to have won world-championship medals in  
all five disciplines, trailed Kernen by just .08 seconds in the 
downhill. Aamodt fashioned a first slalom run of 44.21 to move into 
first place overall at 1:57.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, third in the downhill but only .14 seconds behind Kernen,  
was timed in 44.55 in the first slalom and stood second overall at 
1:58.13. He lost some ground to his teammate, however, falling .40 
seconds behind Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion,  
straddled a gate on his first slalom and was disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy: Dead Woman Free of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- Vernal Ohlrich watched helplessly as his  
74-year-old wife languished for weeks in a hospital bed, her body 
restrained because she thrashed around in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich, 76, thought Phyllis, his wife of 57 years, was dying of  
colon cancer. On Oct. 27, police said, he could take her suffering 
no longer and shot her to death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was performing an act of love, not malice, his lawyer said  
Monday. But it may have been neither. 
</P>
<P>
	Autopsy reports showed no trace of cancer. It wasn't known  
whether doctors at Thayer County Hospital had misdiagnosed Mrs. 
Ohlrich or her husband had misunderstood the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich pleaded no contest Monday to manslaughter after  
prosecutors agreed to drop charges of first-degree murder and use 
of a weapon to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told by doctors that she should call her children home  
because she's not going to make it overnight,'' Ohlrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go with her,'' he said. He said he put the gun to  
his own temple after he shot his wife, but it jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ohlrich had undergone an operation for colon cancer in May,  
but prosecutors said she was cancer-free at her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said she wanted to die several times,'' Ohlrich said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hospital administrator Larry Leaming wouldn't comment Monday. A  
doctor who performed surgery on Mrs. Ohlrich last May wouldn't 
comment on the specifics of her surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not dispute that Mrs. Ohlrich was in a lot of  
pain, or argue with testimony that she had said she wanted to die, 
but they said the pain may have been from a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure the autopsy report is correct,'' defense attorney  
Joe Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ohlrich underwent chemotherapy after her cancer surgery,  
but it was discontinued over the summer because of the side 
effects. She was readmitted to the hospital in September after 
injuring her back. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich could get up to 20 years in prison, but a long sentence  
was considered unlikely. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich said he had no regrets about what he had done.  
</P>
<P>
	``She suffered too much,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Likud Names Parliament Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party  
today handed him a present he didn't ask for -- it chose Sephardic 
Jews and a woman as its top candidates for parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's hand-picked elderly leadership team was pushed aside  
in voting by the Likud Central Committee, while newcomers and 
outspoken Netanyahu critics were given top spots on the Likud slate 
for the Knesset, Israel's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Israelis vote with separate ballots for premier and parliament.  
The 120 seats in the parliament are divided among the parties in 
proportion to the number of votes each receives. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvan Shalom, 40, appointed a Cabinet minister last year,  
received the most votes, placing him second behind Netanyahu on the 
party election list. 
</P>
<P>
	Shalom was born in Tunisia and heads the list's strong  
representation of Sephardic Jews, whose family origins are in 
Arabic-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sephardic Jews make up about half of Israel's population. In the  
past, many Sephardic voters have chosen Likud and its hard-line 
policies toward Arabs over the more moderate Labor Party dominated 
by Ashkenazi Jews of European descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Likud lost its showcase Sephardic candidate when Yitzhak  
Mordechai, the top vote-getter in 1996 Likud primary elections, 
quit last month to lead a new centrist party against Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his surprise victory, Shalom called on Netanyahu to  
add him to the party leadership before the elections. ``Finishing 
first means the people want me at the top,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's top ministers were the big losers. Foreign Minister  
Ariel Sharon was moved down to the seventh slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Arens, chosen by Netanyahu to replace Mordechai as defense  
minister last month, came in 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi, known as Netanyahu's enforcer,  
expected to finish first. Instead, he finished 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are not seen as rejection of Netanyahu by his party.  
Instead, it appears that the Likud representatives soured on the 
people around Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon and Arens are both over 70 and of European background.  
The 2,700-strong Likud central committee preferred younger, 
Sephardic politicians and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Placing second and fourth were veteran Cabinet minister Moshe  
Katsav and Meir Shetreet, Netanyahu's parliamentary coalition 
chairman. Like Shalom, both are Sephardic Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Third place went to Cabinet Minister Limor Livnat, despite  
rumors that Netanyahu wanted her left off the list because of their 
frequent clashes over policy. Last month she considered leaving 
Likud. Women also took the sixth and 16th slots. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai's centrist party has not chosen its Knesset list.  
Likud's traditional rival, Labor, is to pick its candidates in 
primary elections next week.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake City To Unveil IOC Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- What was going on?  
</P>
<P>
	What happened when Salt Lake Olympics organizers dispensed  
scholarships, cash, jobs and other largess in the campaign for the 
2002 Winter Olympics was expected to be addressed today in an 
ethics panel report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt said the report by the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee's ethics panel should not be looked at as complete, since 
the panel did not have subpoena powers and some people refused to 
be interviewed. The board spent much of its time examining 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel probe is one of five investigations into the  
payments of cash and freebies to International Olympic Committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the IOC commission report last month, which focused on  
IOC members, the report by the SLOC ethics panel concerned the role 
Utah Olympic boosters played in seeking the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and USA Today reported today that the report  
would primarily target two top bid committee officials, former SLOC 
President Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, who worked with Welch to win 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported that an official also said the two would be  
accused of hidden payments and deceptive practices that kept other 
members of the committee from knowing what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said the report, in addition to naming  
Welch and Johnson, also identified Craig Peterson as a central 
player. Peterson handled finances for the bid committee after he 
joined up in 1990 and continued in that job after the city won its 
bid and formed SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has been mum about his role in the bid committee, in  
part because when he was forced out of SLOC in 1996, he signed a 
contract that demanded his silence about Olympic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, Johnson and Peterson were all mentioned previously as  
targets for blame for the $800,000 the IOC investigation said were 
made in cash payments, scholarships, medical care and travel 
expenses to 14 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that people familiar with the probe said  
investigators had little, if any, access to Welch, Johnson and 
Peterson, and attorneys for the three refused to allow their 
clients to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted Welch's attorney, Tom Schaffer, as saying the ethics  
panel refused a confidentiality agreement and feared information 
would be turned over to the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing and Welch last week  
issued a number of statements saying others -- including Leavitt -- 
knew what was going on. The others have in the past and continue to 
deny it. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said last week that he had met about 50 IOC members and  
their families, posed for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of 
diplomacy, but, ``I did not ever personally see a gift of great 
value. I was doing everything I could to be charming. I was doing 
my diplomatic duty as the governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the volunteer chairman of the bid committee who  
later became SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on 
the bid board had been ``screened'' from the details and that he 
was dismayed to learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said last week that it obtained copies of letters  
written by Joklik and bid committee member James Beardall, seeking 
a forestry job for the husband of a Finnish member of the IOC. The 
letters to Weyerhaeuser Company on behalf of Bjarne Haeggman were 
sent in 1993. The Wall Street Journal said the ethics committee 
report ``doesn't completely exonerate'' Joklik and cites him for 
the Weyerhaeuser letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive Jan. 8, the same day he  
demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members Spence Eccles, chairman of First Security  
Corp., and Verl Topham, PacifiCorp vice president, have said they 
were deceived. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, who, unlike Leavitt,  
personally attended bid committee meetings, also denied knowledge 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all wish we could have figured out what was going on at the  
time. We all wish we would have picked up on something. But I never 
saw anything that was improper or illegal,'' she said previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal quoted an unidentified individual it  
said was familiar with the investigation as saying the report was 
adamant that the Welch, Johnson and Peterson did not inform board 
trustees about their work. The report concludes that ``they not 
only didn't tell the board, they kept it from the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, SLOC board member Ken Bullock has long complained about  
not getting answers to questions about rumored scholarships and 
getting no support from other board members when he sought 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said he asked about the scholarships each of the last  
three years during board meetings, and got vague answers. He said 
there was a ``don't ask'' sentiment -- that others board members 
wanted him to ``leave it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee also was expected to address the  
question of contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its 
members. A $23.2 million contract went to a construction company 
headed by board trustee Alan Layton to build a top for a speed 
skating oval. SLOC board member Earl Holding is owner of Snowbasin 
ski resort where the downhill races will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the investigations by the IOC and SLOC ethics panel,  
three others into the Salt Lake scandal have been announced: one by 
the Justice Department looking into violations of federal law; one 
by the U.S. Olympic Committee's ethics oversight board, led by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell; and one by Utah 
Attorney General Jan Graham -- who also was on the bid committee -- 
to examine potential violations of state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC Vice President Dick Pound said Monday the Salt Lake panel's  
report might help advance the IOC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have seen a lot of documents we have not seen and talked  
with a lot of people we have not talked to, so it may be quite 
helpful,'' he said. ``If it concentrates on their end and gives the 
facts, that helps us on our end. I hope we can avoid endless 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel was comprised of Gordon Hall, a former chief  
justice of the Utah Supreme Court; David Jordan, a former U.S 
attorney for Utah; Patricia Hanna, dean of the University of Utah 
college of humanities; Barbara Day Lockhart, a two-time Olympic 
speedskater who now is a Brigham Young University professor; and 
Merrill Norman, a forensic auditor and expert witness in trials. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC will meet Thursday to take any action on the report and to  
vote on a reorganization plan proposed by Leavitt and SLOC Chairman 
Robert Garff. The plan would expand the SLOC board of trustees from 
33 to 50 members, but would give its decision-making authority to a 
new management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympics officials also may announce this week the selection  
of a new SLOC president as successor to Joklik. The front runner is 
believed to be Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. The 
Salt Lake Tribune said today that Romney has indicated he wants the 
job.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was weaker against the yen at midday  
Wednesday following a decline in U.S. stocks on Wall Street. 
Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.16 yen at midday, down 0.54 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 114.39 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 19.05 points, or 0.14 percent, to  
13,883.61 points at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 89.83 points, or 0.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was trading lower after U.S.  
stocks declined in spite of fresh evidence of a strong U.S. economy 
that has already posted its longest peacetime expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average stood at 9,133.03 at Tuesday's  
close, down 158.08, particularly hurt by losses in technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose slightly against the yen from its levels earlier  
Wednesday on buying by U.S. hedge funds to adjust positions, 
traders said. But most investors were sitting on the sidelines 
ahead of Friday's Bank of Japan policy board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players expect board members of the central bank to  
discuss whether to take steps to ease the rise in long-term 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has been under increasing political pressure to take  
measures to lower the rates. Higher Japanese long-term interest 
rates make yen-denominated assets more attractive to overseas 
investors, boosting the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.14 yen, down  
from 129.68 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices retreated following the  
overnight decline in New York. High technology issues were leading 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Glickman Commission Criticizes USDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission appointed by Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman to look at ways to help small farms is 
giving the department poor grades for its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of 29 commissioners on USDA's National Commission on  
Small Farms issued a report card Tuesday grading the agency's 
efforts to implement a January 1998 commission report on small 
farms. The commissioners have organized themselves as the Time to 
Act Campaign, an independent effort to get implementation of the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of 10 categories rated, the agency received higher than a C  
in three areas. The agency rated a ``D'' for its efforts to ensure 
fair market access for those farmers and reach out to farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's highest scores, three ``Bs'', were for its efforts  
to bolster marketing opportunities for small farms, reach out to 
beginning farmers as well as make changes to the crop insurance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, USDA has acted quickly and decisively,'' the  
report said. ``But in most areas, real change is slow to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman defended the agency saying  
that while there is still work to do, improvements such as better 
loan programs for small farmers have been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done a lot of good things,'' Glickman said.  
``The fact is, the reversal of the trends towards concentration in 
agriculture and trying to increase family farm agriculture is a 
tough problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the commission's report last year, thousands of small  
farms -- in both commodities and livestock -- have had a turbulent 
year that included low prices, falling exports and inclement 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing concern that small farms are being overtaken by big  
business have led to hearings in Congress on concentration in the 
industry, including one Thursday by the House Agriculture 
Committee. Attorney General Janet Reno is scheduled to meet with a 
group of senators Wednesday who have called for an investigation of 
concentration in all sectors of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary has not provided strong enough leadership to  
overcome some of the resistance within the bureaucracy towards 
strong action and reversing some of the biases that exist towards 
large scale corporate agriculture,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, a 
commission member from Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Greg Gunthrop, a commission member and Indiana hog farmer,  
``I think the recommendations of the small farm commission would go 
a long way in promising a level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking for somebody to throw a lot of money at the  
problem. We're just asking for a chance,'' Gunthrop said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers could have a better chance if the department implemented  
mandatory price reporting, commissioners said, reiterating a call 
from last year. Under mandatory price reporting, meatpackers would 
have to report the price they pay for livestock. The issue failed 
in the last Congress and is scheduled to come up again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners said Glickman already has broad authority that  
would allow him to implement some form of price reporting, a 
provision they say would have helped hog producers now getting 
their lowest prices in 40 years. Glickman disagrees that he has 
such authority.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Faces Threat of ACC Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- After Terry Bowden quit as Auburn's football  
coach, the school wanted to restore order. Instead, there's a nasty 
spat with Florida State and the threat of an Atlantic Coast 
Conference boycott of Auburn in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has taken one hit after another since Bowden resigned  
last October, but nothing prepared it for what came Monday when it 
was revealed that ACC commissioner John Swofford wanted all nine of 
his member schools to boycott playing the Tigers in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if the ACC never thinks about playing Auburn  
again,'' Auburn trustee Lowell Barron said. ``We've got 100 
athletic events scheduled and only seven or eight are with ACC 
schools. They're only a big thing in their own mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford was angered by Auburn's decision to buy its way out of  
a nationally televised Sept. 2 season opener against Florida State. 
Since Bowden was no longer Auburn's coach, school officials -- and 
new coach Tommy Tuberville -- weren't too eager to open the season 
against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no longer a father-son matchup. It looked more like a  
grudge game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This football team had a very hard time for two months after  
coach Bowden resigned,'' Tuberville said Tuesday. ``I didn't want 
them to have to go through that again, take even more scrutiny when 
they really should be trying to heal from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville said he was the one who told Auburn athletic director  
David Housel to cancel the game, but not because he was afraid of 
beginning his reign against Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all for rescheduling, we just didn't want the game  
this year,'' he said. ``I know right now we're taking it and will 
be for a few days, but at least we won't be for a month in 
August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's decision left Florida State without an opponent for its  
season opener and probably cost the Seminoles a spot in the ESPN 
Thursday night game, network spokesman Dean Diltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very slim that Florida State can still play on Thursday  
night,'' Diltz said. ``There's not many, if any, formidable teams 
that have an open date. It ends up costing Florida State more than 
anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford agreed and fired off an angry letter to Housel.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the way Auburn University is going to conduct its  
business, I feel it is my obligation as conference commissioner to 
ask all of our member institutions to seriously evaluate whether it 
makes sense to schedule Auburn in any sport,'' Swofford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said Tuesday he ``didn't care to comment'' on Swofford's  
threat of an ACC-boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auburn made an institutional decision,'' Housel said. ``We are  
now moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barron called Swofford's threat ``opposition hogwash. Bobby  
Bowden stated on television he didn't want to play the game and it 
should be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's comment about scraping the game came in the aftermath  
of his son's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn settled with Terry Bowden for $620,000 last week,  
including a mandate that he say nothing bad about Auburn, its 
coaches or trustees. The school also paid $500,000 to Florida State 
to get out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford wants an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league  
will lose if the Seminoles lose the ESPN game. 
</P>
<P>
	The money spending alone has angered many Auburn students.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Weaver, a sophomore on Auburn's club-level wrestling team,  
said the football situation has made it unfair for other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spend money for football, for cleaning up football  
messes, and we can't even get help for new wrestling mats,'' Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon to tell what, if any, repercussions will come from  
Swofford's request. Auburn has replaced Florida State with Division 
II Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have a contract to play Clemson, which is now coached  
by Terry Bowden's brother, Tommy, for four games from 2005 through 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson officials have said they don't foresee the series being  
dropped and Tommy Bowden said Tuesday he never asked to get out of 
the Auburn series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I haven't done,'' Tommy Bowden said. ``There  
is very little I can comment on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pac-10 since 1983, said he had  
never seen one conference commissioner threaten to boycott another 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply don't recall that having happened,'' Hansen said.  
``It does seem like a strong step. But I can understand why there's 
strong feelings, all of us work very hard to get our games to be 
televised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn trustee Jack Venable said he anticipated the situation  
would eventually quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to think any conference would use its influence to  
affect another school,'' Venable said. ``Because at some point the 
shoe might be on the other foot.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Caller-Pay Cell Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's top telecommunications regulator  
expressed interest Tuesday in letting callers pay for mobile phone 
calls just as they do with regular phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the receiver of a mobile-phone call -- not  
the caller -- typically foots the bill. As a result, many Americans 
switch off their phones to avoid unwanted calls. In Europe and 
Asia, however, it's the caller who usually pays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for us to find a way to implement a calling party  
pays system in this country,'' Federal Communications Commission 
Chairman Bill Kennard said in a speech to the Cellular 
Telecommunications Industry Association convention in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The cellular industry has expressed some interest in changing  
the current billing system, but there also has been some 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only 5 percent of phone calls are now made on mobile phones,''  
Kennard said. ``I think that number would increase dramatically 
with a calling party pays system. This is not an easy matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard asked the industry to work with the FCC to create a plan  
to bring about the change. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission wouldn't force wireless carriers to charge  
callers but would adopt rules aimed at making it easier for them to 
do so if they so choose. A proposal could be offered later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies now provide some form of the caller-pays  
approach. Some split the cost of incoming long-distance calls by 
making the caller pay the long-distance charge and the receiver pay 
a local-access fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, two groups of competing wireless providers announced  
an agreement Tuesday that should make it easier for Americans to 
use mobile phones in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between the North American GSM Alliance LLC and  
the Universal Wireless Communications Consortium lays the 
groundwork for new mobile phones that can work on cellular phone 
networks using different technologies.

<HEADLINE> Poor Economy Hurting Fur Trappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- Raymond Whitaker is an old-time trapper,  
from the top of his otter hat to the trim of his coyote coat. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he dropped off a stack of fox and beaver pelts for sale  
recently, he sounded more like a buttoned-down international banker 
with his first words to the trader: ``How's the ruble?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He already knew the answer: not good. Whitaker, 75, has seen the  
devalued Russian currency cut deeply into the worldwide demand for 
fur, sending raw fur prices tumbling in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Trader David Hicks was able to give only paltry prices for  
Whitaker's pelts that day. Likewise, Hicks is fielding fewer calls 
from brokers seeking fur. He figures to get bottom dollar for the 
assorted fox, fisher, muskrat and raccoon pelts stocked in his shop 
along the Vermont state line. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the toughest years I've seen,'' Hicks said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a common lament in the fur trade, where prices fetched for  
animals trapped in New York's backwoods are sensitive to economic 
wobbles worldwide. Financial turmoil in Russia and Asia hurts the 
fur business here because it puts crimps in the international 
pipeline for furs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble's devaluation has particularly hurt since Russians  
account for most of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Trappers are routinely fetching as low as $2 for muskrat skins  
that went for $6 just a few years ago; raccoon skins have dropped 
from about $11 to as low as $5 to $8 in the same period. A female 
fisher that once brought $250 now can go for under $20. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of ranch-raised mink -- the gold standard of fur -- is  
reportedly off about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed prices are not limited to New York -- Minnesota,  
Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are all bigger trapping states 
with the same problems. But fur is big business in New York, from 
swanky retail stores in Manhattan to solitary trappers prowling 
upstate forests. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 8,600 licensed trappers in New York state.  
Raccoons, muskrat and beaver are their prime quarry, although mink, 
coyote and foxes are also taken. Trappers will sell their wares at 
auction or to traders like Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fur is a commodity as prone to fluctuations as wheat or pork  
bellies. For instance, this year worldwide demand for fur trim was 
up, but the U.S. warm spell in early winter across much of the 
country put a dent in coat sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trappers are stashing their skins in freezers and hoping to  
sell later at higher prices, though few expect furs to regain the 
popularity they had in the late 1970s. Dress codes are more casual, 
fur alternatives abound and organized anti-fur campaigns have 
continued since the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan fur broker Zachary Rosenfeld said he received a  
substantial order last month from Russia, where fur is still a 
necessity despite hard times. Also, the recent deep freeze across 
the United States is being warmly welcomed by many in the fur 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as it got cold, I started getting busy,'' Rosenfeld  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks' Sprewell Out 3-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After playing only two games for his new team,  
Latrell Sprewell will be out of action again. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will be sidelined 3-6 weeks with a stress fracture of  
his right heel, the New York Knicks announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Sprewell said. `I had every  
intention of suiting up to play (Wednesday), but the injury was 
more than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell sat out the final 15 minutes of practice Monday and the  
entire practice Tuesday. An X-ray and a CT scan failed to show the 
injury, but an MRI exam disclosed a tiny fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known exactly how Sprewell suffered the injury. He  
scored only five points in his regular-season home debut Sunday, 
shooting 2-for-12 in a loss to Miami that dropped New York's record 
to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell scored 24 points in his first game, a loss at Orlando  
on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a microscopic fracture of the heel,'' team physician  
Dr. Norman Scott said. ``No surgery will be required. Latrell will 
wear a walking boot, also known as a removable cast, to provide 
stress relief. He will continue conditioning on the bike and in the 
pool. This will have no long-term effect on his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who were using Sprewell as their starting small  
forward, were struggling to incorporate him into their offense. The 
three-time All-Star found himself forcing shots in New York's first 
two games, and several of his attempts Sunday missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's out of the lineup, the Knicks may move Larry  
Johnson to small forward and insert Kurt Thomas into the starting 
lineup at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly for Latrell, but the reality is we now have to  
get ready to face Washington without him,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said in a statement released by the team. ``We expect Latrell's 
rehabilitation to go smoothly so he can get back in the lineup as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Jan. 21 from Golden State for John Starks,  
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, received the longest non-drug 
related suspension in league history last season -- 68 games -- for 
attacking and choking his former coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be frustrating to have to watch from the  
sidelines after such a long time away, but we have a great group of 
players who I'm confident will be successful,'' Sprewell said.

<HEADLINE> Astros, Gutierrez OK One-Year Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Shortstop Ricky Gutierrez and the Houston Astros  
avoided a salary arbitration hearing Tuesday when they agreed on a 
one-year contract worth $2,212,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, who beat out Tim Bogar as the starter last season,  
asked for $2,575,000 and the Astros offered $1,850,000. Gutierrez 
earned $850,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez played in a career high 141 games last season and  
established career bests with 491 at-bats, 128 doubles, 46 RBIs and 
13 steals. He hit .261. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, Ricky Gutierrez established himself as an everyday  
player, something that had eluded him throughout his career,'' 
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``He came to spring training 
determined to win the job. He not only won the job but he played 
very solid and steady throughout the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``(Shortstop) is certainly one of the positions where steady  
play is extremely important,'' Hunsicker said. ``We are looking for

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Lawyers Weigh Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If a no-contest plea got Mike Tyson a year in  
jail, what would a guilty verdict bring? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the crux of the discussion inside the offices of Tyson's  
lawyers as they consider whether to risk an appeal of the former 
heavyweight champion's sentence for assaulting two motorists after 
a fender bender in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no-contest -- meaning he neither contested the  
charges nor admitted guilt -- in December. His one-year sentence, 
levied Friday by District Court Judge Stephen Johnson, could mean 
the end of the career of the 32-year-old boxer, once on course to 
become one of the greatest heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers must decide within 30 days of the sentencing whether  
Tyson's career would be further jeopardized by an appeal to Circuit 
Court, where a judge could then decide not to accept the no-contest 
plea and order a trial by jury. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Tyson would not only have another conviction on  
his record, but would again be subject to Maryland sentencing 
guidelines that call for a jail term of three to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a conviction would worsen Tyson's standing in  
Indiana and Nevada. Indiana authorities must decide whether Tyson 
violated his probation for a 1992 rape conviction, and Nevada 
boxing authorities could revoke Tyson's boxing license for the 
second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's  
rape trial, is awaiting paperwork from Maryland before ruling on 
whether he violated probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of an appeal was discussed at length by Tyson's lawyers  
on Monday, a source inside the office of lawyer Paul Kemp told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Neither Kemp nor 
Tyson's other attorney, Robert Greenberg, returned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Douglas Gansler, who led the call for jail time for  
Tyson, said the boxer could be fighting again in 1999 under his 
current sentence if he behaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong argument to be made that he's better off not  
appealing,'' Gansler said. ``If he were treated like any ordinary 
prisoner, like he has been, he would be in the (Montgomery County) 
jail about two to three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Tyson could be transferred to a prerelease center, a  
sort of halfway house where he could leave during the day to go to 
work and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be in the system about nine months,'' Gansler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said Tyson is being held in a private cell ``for his own  
protection.'' If an appeal is filed, Tyson could ask for a bond 
hearing and be released pending a trial.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Puts Snapshots on Picture CD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- By this summer, amateur shutterbugs will  
be able to get their photographs stored on CD-ROM discs as easily 
as developing a roll of film into prints. But it will cost nearly 
twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by test-market results in Indiana and Utah, Eastman  
Kodak Co. could get a much-needed boost from the new product, 
called Picture CD, in its long-drawn effort to profit from digital 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
	The key question: Aside from computer and photo hobbyists, are  
there enough ordinary folks willing to fork out an extra $9 a roll 
for the novelty of having a photofinishing store computerize their 
traditional snapshots? 
</P>
<P>
	Once scanned onto a compact disc, digital images can be viewed  
on personal computers, cropped or touched up or printed out, and 
dispatched to family and friends via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be really surprised if this doesn't take off,'' said  
Audrey Debije, 29, a college instructor who was picking up film at 
a Moto Photo store in Kodak's hometown on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be a real benefit when members of families live clear  
across the country from each other and you don't see each other 
that often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another customer, Karl Neubauer, doesn't anticipate much demand  
among ``average Americans'' for a few more years, at least until 
costs come down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already, developing film can be expensive, so I think it's  
going to take a while before CDs are widely used,'' said Neubauer, 
a sculptor. ``I like photos to be tangible. Not that I'm a 
technophobe, but in a way I'd like to keep it simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak developed the Picture CD along with computer chip giant  
Intel Corp. as part of a drive to expand mainstream photography to 
the Internet. The Picture CD uses software by Adobe Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak said the CDs were bought by about 5 percent of consumers --  
a higher percentage than expected -- at test outlets in Indianapolis 
and Salt Lake City over the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few weeks, they will begin popping up at national chains  
such as Kmart Corp., Walgreen Co., CVS Corp. and Target Stores. By 
this summer, they will be available at more than 40,000 retail 
stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	At least initially, traditional prints, which cost roughly $5 to  
$8 per roll, must be purchased along with CDs. The CD orders take 
about two days to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDs are simpler to use than the floppy disks that Kodak and  
other photo companies now sell, which require consumers to load 
their own software onto their computer. While the CDs are slightly 
more expensive, their images are sharper. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos on CD could be stored in digital albums, manipulated to  
adjust color, clarity and brightness, or dropped into newsletters 
and personalized birthday cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The photography industry is pushing hard to get consumers  
interested in digital products but, for many, the technology 
remains an untried novelty. Kodak has yet to turn a profit from its 
digital business, which racked up $702 million in losses in 1997 
and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak's core business of amateur film, photographic paper and  
traditional cameras generates half its profits, but this cash cow 
is being threatened by intense competition from Japan. However, the 
slowly growing market for digital products could pose a much bigger 
threat to future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Kodak also expects to begin offering America Online  
subscribers the option of having digitized copies of their photos 
delivered to their computer by photofinishing stores for an extra 
$5 to $7 a roll.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Jackson Criticizes Gov. Pataki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jesse Jackson, weighing in Tuesday on Gov.  
George Pataki's prospects as a candidate for president or vice 
president, likened him to Southern segregationists George Wallace 
and Orval Faubus. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights leader, in Albany to testify at a legislative  
hearing in opposition to the governor's budget plans for education, 
said the New York Republican is spending too much on prisons and 
not enough on schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Pataki's national aspirations, Jackson said Pataki  
is following in the footsteps of the late Govs. Faubus of Arkansas 
and Wallace of Alabama as well as former California Gov. Pete 
Wilson, who turned against affirmative action and cracked down on 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Pataki in that tradition,'' Jackson said. ``There's  
Faubus and there's Wallace and there's Wilson and now here is 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	``But America deserves leadership of hope and healing. And  
whether you're blocking school doors in Alabama and Arkansas or 
simply locking kids out of closed school doors in New York is not 
the wave of the American future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Jackson's ``partisan  
attacks are so outrageous they don't even merit a response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Pataki political ally, state Assembly Minority Leader John  
Faso, said he was outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really shows he isn't interested in genuinely contributing  
to the debate here in New York about the budget,'' Faso said. 
``He's more interested in throwing political Molotov cocktails.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faubus, who died in 1994, called out the National Guard in 1957  
to try to block the desegregation of a Little Rock high school. 
Wallace, who died last year, stood in the schoolhouse door in 1963 
in an attempt to keep blacks from enrolling at the University of 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a two-time Democratic presidential contender, said he  
has not decided whether to run again next year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Diet Drugs Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit  
charging that drug company executives benefited from inside 
information about problems with two popular diet drugs that have 
been recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action suit from shareholders alleged that American  
Home Products hid the troubles with Redux and Pondimin while the 
executives sold nearly $25 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan ruled Friday the case was  
not strong enough to sustain charges that AHP improperly withheld 
damaging medical data before the September 1997 recall. Politan 
noted that the company's stock rose after the problems were made 
public two months earlier, and only fell after the recall was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of damage suits are still pending against AHP,  
alleging that the diet drugs caused heart valve damage. AHP, based 
in Madison, said the suit dismissed by Politan is the only one 
claiming securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholder lawyer Marian Rosner said Tuesday that her team is  
likely to appeal. Company spokesman Lowell Weiner said the company 
was pleased with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Politan ruled that the company did not mislead investors by not  
disclosing that information before July 1997, noting that at the 
time, medical authorities had said the findings raised questions 
but were inconclusive and required comprehensive study.

<HEADLINE> Why Are There So Many Painkillers? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: It used to be pretty painless figuring out what to do when I  
had a headache, but now my head really pounds when I look at the 
array of pain relievers available. Why are there so many and what 
are the differences? 

</P>
<P>
	A. Many drug companies market the same drug under their own  
brand names, complicating choices for consumers unless you read the 
fine print on the box to find out what you're really getting. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, pharmaceutical companies are looking for a bigger  
piece of the pain market, which is growing as the population ages. 
That means some drugmakers are developing new -- usually more 
expensive -- drugs while others release cheaper generic forms of 
older drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	All drugs have their limitations and side effects.  
</P>
<P>
	Aspirin is the granddaddy of all. The anti-inflammatory drug is  
good at reducing fever, relieving muscle stiffness and joint pain 
caused by some forms of arthritis and even helping migraine 
headache sufferers. Like all anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin can 
upset the stomach, and should be avoided by people who get ulcers 
or heartburn. Many inexpensive generic versions are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Acetaminophen, whose most popular brand name is Tylenol,  
provides immediate relief for pain and fever without causing 
stomach irritation or bleeding. Acetaminophen, though, won't reduce 
swelling or stiffness. Some generic drugmakers call acetaminophen 
``non-aspirin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ibuprofen, whose major brand names are Advil, Motrin and Nuprin,  
provides relief for headaches, fever, and inflammation and is also 
effective to relieve menstrual cramps. Like anti-inflammatory 
drugs, ibuprofen also relieves minor aches and pains. And like 
aspirin, ibuprofen can cause stomach problems and other 
gastrointestinal problems. Generics are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Naproxen Sodium, sold as Aleve, reduces fever for eight to 12  
hours, longer than acetaminophen or ibuprofen. It's an 
anti-inflammatory, but is gentler on the stomach than aspirin. 
Generics are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketoprofen, sold as Orudis KT and Actron, reduces fever and the  
discomforts of arthritis, menstrual cramps and other pains. It 
generally causes fewer stomach problems than other 
anti-inflammatory drugs.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with share prices falling both in Tokyo and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend were the Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong bourses,  
where prices rebounded sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell  
89.83 points, or 0.64 percent, to end at 13,902.66 points. On 
Monday, the average closed up 94.41 points, or 0.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.70 yen in late  
trading, up 1.20 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its 
late New York level of 114.43 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar gained ground in line with an overnight trend in New  
York after Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international 
affairs with Japan's Finance Ministry, said Monday an excessively 
strong yen is not good for Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks make yen buyers wary the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to stem the yen's further appreciation against the U.S. 
currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore share prices closed mostly lower, dragged down by  
concerns surrounding a $1.3 billion convertible bond issue that can 
be exchanged for shares in Development Bank of Singapore Ltd., 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are worried the bond issue, to be priced Wednesday,  
may drain funds from the equities market. The Straits Times Index 
fell 2.3 percent, or 30.51 points, to 1,306.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian closed sharply higher, recouping most of its Monday's  
steep losses because of buying by local investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's plunge was triggered by selling from foreign investors  
following the introduction of an exit tax to replace a 
one-year-moratorium on foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur's benchmark Composite Index, which tracks 100  
blue-chip stocks, surged t 4.2 percent, or 22.04 points, to 548.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher after two straight  
sessions of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chip shares rose 104.89 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 
9,244.49. On Monday, the index had lost 50.60 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices rebounded in a late rally on  
bargain-hunting following declines over the past two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained thin as many investors stayed on the sidelines  
because of uncertainty over whether Hong Kong banks would cut 
interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices tumbled, with the main index plunging 4  
percent on a sharp rise in local interest rates. The Korea 
Composite Stock Price Index fell 22.00 points to 523.38. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply lower as foreigners  
sold banking stocks on concerns over the country's huge level of 
loan defaults. The SET Index fell 10.41 points, or 3.1 percent, to 
320.36. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking and rising  
concerns about Taiwan's economy after the government cut its 
economic growth forecast for 1999. The market's key Weighted Stock 
Price Index fell 99.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,723.73. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 22.05 points, or 1 percent, to 2,166.29. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, dragged down by a recent  
spate of bad news on both the economic and corporate fronts, 
traders said. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected 
companies fell 30.47 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,935.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, with losses in the  
telecommunications sector outweighing a strong session for 
resources issues, dealers said. The All Ordinaries Index fell 9.3 
points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,890.7. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher. The Composite Index  
rose 3.136 points, or 0.7 percent, to 402.826.

<HEADLINE> Recommendations for Losing Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Advice for those considering losing weight:  
</P>
<P>
	--Check with your doctor. Make sure your health status allows for  
a taking in fewer calories and increasing physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Follow a calorie-reduced but balanced diet that provides for  
losing as little as one or two pounds a week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make time in your day for some form of physical activity.  
</P>
<P>
	--Consider the benefits of moderate weight loss. There's  
scientific evidence that losing five to 10 percent of your weight 
and keeping it off can benefit your health. 

</P>
<P>
	Recommendations for those who decide to choose a weight-loss  
product or plan: 
</P>
<P>
	--If your doctor prescribes medication, ask about complications  
or side effects. Let the doctor know what medications you are 
taking or other conditions you have. 
</P>
<P>
	--If your treatment includes periodic monitoring or counseling,  
make sure the location is easy to get to. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some methods for losing weight have more risks than others. Ask  
for details about side effects, complications or risks of any 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	--Where appropriate, ask about the credentials and training of  
the program staff. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask for an itemized price list for all costs of the plan you're  
considering, including membership fees, diagnostic tests, weekly 
visits, meal replacements or nutritional supplements.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Talks Remain Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Rival Kosovo Albanians and Serbs  
remained deadlocked today over a pledge to keep Yugoslavia's 
borders intact, amid signs their peace talks already are heading 
for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently seeking to get the talks moving, British Foreign  
Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 
were expected in Rambouillet today to meet with the mediators and 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have remained so estranged that they haven't met  
face-to-face. A team of international mediators has been shuttling 
between rooms at the 14th century castle outside Paris where talks 
opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Kosovo Albanians pressed for a formal cease-fire for  
the province, while Serbs sought a pledge to keep Yugoslavia's 
borders unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The mediators wanted to drop what they called ``side issues''  
and move on to details of a peace settlement for Kosovo, where more 
than 2,000 people have died and about 300,000 have been driven from 
their homes in a year of fighting between ethnic Albanian 
secessionists and Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashim Thaci, political director of the rebel Kosovo Liberation  
Army who heads the Albanian delegation, called for ``an immediate 
cease-fire agreement'' between the warring factions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a shaky cease-fire since October, when American  
troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke worked out a deal with hard-line 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But a formal cease-fire, signed by both sides, would amount to a  
de facto Serb recognition of the KLA -- something Serbs have vowed 
not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were forced to the negotiating table by the  
renewed threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and further 
measures to cut off the KLA's arms supplies and financing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs are insisting that all sides sign the list of 10 basic  
principles drawn up by the Contact Group of six nations, including 
the United States, as the basis for the talks here. 
</P>
<P>
	That is very important for the Serbs because those principles  
contain a guarantee that Yugoslavia's borders won't change. That 
would mean the ethnic Albanians would have to give up their demand 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference spokesman Philip Reeker said, however, that all sides  
already had agreed to the principles merely by coming to the talks, 
and that they are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore, published in Kosovo,  
quoted Western sources in today's edition as saying that chief U.S. 
mediator Christopher Hill was trying to convince the Kosovo 
Albanian delegation to sign the principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other sources said the Albanians did not accept anything,''  
said Koha Ditore, whose publisher is a member of the Albanian 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a member of the Serb delegation, who requested  
anonymity, described some of the details in the Contact Group plan 
as ``horrifying'' because they would significantly reduce Serb 
authority in the province. He said the Serbs were preparing a list 
of amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian delegation has made three demands at the  
conference: holding a referendum on the status of Kosovo following 
a three-year interim period, having NATO be a signatory to the 
agreement, and clearly defining the status of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation regards the referendum as important because they  
believe the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province will vote for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has rejected independence for Kosovo, which has 2  
million residents, as well as the suggestion that tens of thousands 
of U.S. and other NATO troops be deployed in the province to police 
any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that President  
Clinton intends to include U.S. ground troops in any NATO force 
sent to preserve a Kosovo peace settlement, provided the accord is 
solid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be there to keep a peace, not to make a peace,'' Cohen  
told a news conference after meeting with German Defense Minister 
Rudolf Scharping in Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Gypsies Allege Holocaust Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- A special Swiss fund for Holocaust  
survivors is an easy target for fraud because of the way it 
distributes money, a Gypsy organization charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Gypsies, also known as Roma, were killed  
during World War II by the Nazis. Swiss officials established a 
$195 million fund last year to aid victims of such persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roma National Congress demanded Tuesday that future payments  
be made directly to the victims rather than through organizations 
that represent them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current practice of distributing money inevitably leads to  
corruption,'' spokesman Rudko Kawczynski told a news conference in 
Bern. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the German-based organization filed an embezzlement  
complaint, alleging that $1.2 million had been skimmed from 
payments intended for Polish Gypsies who were Holocaust victims. 
The complaint charged that 29 people in Poland, who were not 
further identified, distributed lower payments and kept the 
difference in some 200 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Roma in Poland subsequently said the Swiss  
fund meticulously checked their group and approved it as 
``trustworthy'' for the distribution of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roma National Congress said that oversight isn't enough. Its  
representatives met with the Swiss fund for the first time Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Swiss fund plans to continue working through  
organizations in Poland and elsewhere, spokesman Lorenz Wolffers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No irregularities have been found in the fund's payments,  
Wolffers added. ``If we find out anything concrete, we will follow 
it up.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Talks Remain Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Rival Kosovo Albanians and Serbs  
remained deadlocked today over a pledge to keep Yugoslavia's 
borders intact, amid signs their peace talks already are heading 
for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently seeking to get the talks moving, British Foreign  
Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 
were expected in Rambouillet today to meet with the mediators and 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have remained so estranged that they haven't met  
face-to-face. A team of international mediators has been shuttling 
between rooms at the 14th century castle outside Paris where talks 
opened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Kosovo Albanians pressed for a formal cease-fire for  
the province, while Serbs sought a pledge to keep Yugoslavia's 
borders unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The mediators wanted to drop what they called ``side issues''  
and move on to details of a peace settlement for Kosovo, where more 
than 2,000 people have died and about 300,000 have been driven from 
their homes in a year of fighting between ethnic Albanian 
secessionists and Serbian security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashim Thaci, political director of the rebel Kosovo Liberation  
Army who heads the Albanian delegation, called for ``an immediate 
cease-fire agreement'' between the warring factions in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a shaky cease-fire since October, when American  
troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke worked out a deal with hard-line 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But a formal cease-fire, signed by both sides, would amount to a  
de facto Serb recognition of the KLA -- something Serbs have vowed 
not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were forced to the negotiating table by the  
renewed threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and further 
measures to cut off the KLA's arms supplies and financing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs are insisting that all sides sign the list of 10 basic  
principles drawn up by the Contact Group of six nations, including 
the United States, as the basis for the talks here. 
</P>
<P>
	That is very important for the Serbs because those principles  
contain a guarantee that Yugoslavia's borders won't change. That 
would mean the ethnic Albanians would have to give up their demand 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference spokesman Philip Reeker said, however, that all sides  
already had agreed to the principles merely by coming to the talks, 
and that they are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore, published in Kosovo,  
quoted Western sources in today's edition as saying that chief U.S. 
mediator Christopher Hill was trying to convince the Kosovo 
Albanian delegation to sign the principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other sources said the Albanians did not accept anything,''  
said Koha Ditore, whose publisher is a member of the Albanian 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a member of the Serb delegation, who requested  
anonymity, described some of the details in the Contact Group plan 
as ``horrifying'' because they would significantly reduce Serb 
authority in the province. He said the Serbs were preparing a list 
of amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian delegation has made three demands at the  
conference: holding a referendum on the status of Kosovo following 
a three-year interim period, having NATO be a signatory to the 
agreement, and clearly defining the status of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation regards the referendum as important because they  
believe the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province will vote for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has rejected independence for Kosovo, which has 2  
million residents, as well as the suggestion that tens of thousands 
of U.S. and other NATO troops be deployed in the province to police 
any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that President  
Clinton intends to include U.S. ground troops in any NATO force 
sent to preserve a Kosovo peace settlement, provided the accord is 
solid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be there to keep a peace, not to make a peace,'' Cohen  
told a news conference after meeting with German Defense Minister 
Rudolf Scharping in Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Sears Agrees To Guilty Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will plead guilty to  
criminal fraud and pay a $60 million fine for illegally pursuing 
debts from bankrupt credit card customers, the retailer announced 
Tuesday as it closed the books on the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a plea agreement with the federal government, a Sears  
subsidiary, Sears Bankruptcy Recovery Management Services, will 
admit guilt to one count of bankruptcy fraud for failing to file 
before a bankruptcy judge debt-collection, or reaffirmation, 
agreements signed by credit-card customers who sought Chapter 7 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., already has paid more  
than $180 million in restitution to about 188,000 debtors and $40 
million in civil fines to 50 state attorneys general in connection 
with the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card debts are erased when customers file for bankruptcy.  
But when customers sign reaffirmation agreements, they agree to 
continue paying off their debt in exchange for keeping the credit 
card or keeping merchandise bought on credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some debt collectors had threatened to repossess merchandise  
unless agreements were signed. Any of those agreements must be 
approved by a bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears and several others retailers, including Federated  
Department Stores, which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Stern's, 
and Montgomery Ward, recently ran afoul of the law by failing to 
file reaffirmation agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears said the $60 million fine will have no effect on its  
earnings. In the second quarter of 1997, Sears took a pre-tax 
charge of $475 million against its earnings to cover expenses 
related to this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Tuesday, the company announced it had reached  
agreement with the U.S. attorney's office on a civil lawsuit filed 
in April 1997 regarding the same practices. As part of that 
agreement, Sears agreed to diligently file all reaffirmation 
agreements in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlements, Sears created a new post of chief  
compliance officer to make sure company policies are followed. The 
company also hired accounting firm Arthur Andersen to help it 
develop a training program to ensure its debt reaffirmation 
policies are being followed by employees.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Discuss Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT PELIER, Jamaica (AP) -- At least 1,000 people in this  
Jamaican mountain village were thrown out of work when an American 
T-shirt factory shut its doors recently and moved to Mexico, where 
labor costs were supposedly cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Another U.S.-owned factory opened last week -- but hired only 40  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get by, but only just. Every house here had someone employed  
at the old factory,'' said Carron Reid, 35, pointing to the 
village's dilapidated wood and zinc cottages. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Montego Bay beach resort, a 40-minute drive away,  
delegates from Jamaica, Mexico and 15 other developing nations are 
meeting this week to address the costs of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers from the group -- called the Group of 15, or  
G-15, although it has now grown to 17 states -- will attend the 
three-day meeting, which begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding common ground will be difficult. The group's ranks  
include Mexico, which has preferred access to the U.S. consumer 
market as a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement, -- 
and countries like Jamaica, which has lost thousands of textile 
jobs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	G-15 states account for 30 percent of the world's population and  
produce $2 trillion worth of goods, or nearly 40 percent of the 
gross domestic product of all developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic problems of some G-15 countries have captured the  
world's attention: from Malaysia, whose economic collapse launched 
Southeast Asia's financial crisis, to Indonesia, where economic 
problems brought down the government, to Brazil, the latest victim. 
</P>
<P>
	But G-15 members complain their problems have not translated  
into the political and economic clout they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems you have to go down in flames before people listen,''  
said Jamaican delegate Richard A. Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-15 draft statement echoes previous calls: giving foreign  
debt relief or forgiveness, allowing smaller states time to prepare 
for a world without trade barriers, preserving jobs and social 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates complained the World Bank and International Monetary  
Fund are not heeding warnings that traditional measures emphasizing 
austerity in exchange for financial aid could precipitate more 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, consensus among G-15 members appears elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica's Daily Observer newspaper reported that delegates  
objected to a Malaysian suggestion that the United States and 
European countries regulate the currency speculators that Malaysia 
blames in part for its economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia wants to require speculators to invest for a minimum of  
two or three years, the newspaper said. Brazil and Mexico objected, 
looking to benefit from short-term investment.

<HEADLINE> Is Y2K More Urgent Than Disclosed? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corporate America has fallen far behind in  
disclosing its readiness for the Year 2000 and how much the 
preparations and computer upgrades have been costing, the chief 
accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of financial reports that publicly traded companies must  
submit to the SEC shows that ``many companies are still not 
complying'' with Year 2000 disclosure requirements, Lynn Turner 
said at a conference organized by the District of Columbia Bar 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than half the companies in an unspecified sample  
failed to disclose how much it is costing them to get their 
computer systems ready for the millennial change, while close to 
half didn't describe their contingency plans in case the systems 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency is alerting investors to examine the  
Year 2000 disclosures of companies that interest them, Turner told 
the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were the chief financial officer of a corporation that  
wasn't adequately prepared and things went wrong after Jan. 1, 
Turner quipped, ``I'd be hung out there like a cold piece of meat 
in storage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since last summer, the SEC has been nudging companies to provide  
more details so investors can be better informed. The agency issued 
guidelines on how publicly traded corporations as well as mutual 
fund companies and brokerage firms should make the required 
disclosures of Year 2000 costs and risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Y2K, the Year 2000 problem reflects programming in many  
older computers that recognizes just the last two digits of a year 
in reading a date. Machines that haven't been upgraded are likely 
to interpret Jan. 1, 2000, as Jan. 1, 1900. That could cause 
massive computer failures, lost data, or broken connections with 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	As all sectors of government and the economy come to grips with  
the Year 2000 computer problem, some observers have warned that 
costs to companies of getting ready could punch a hole in their 
profits and hurt stock prices on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has warned that if investors don't  
have sufficient information regarding a company's readiness, 
confidence could be seriously undermined and ``panic and 
overreaction'' could ripple through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials also have said they will take enforcement action  
against companies that make materially false and misleading 
statements about Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about possible action against companies that fail to  
adequately disclose their readiness, Turner said he hoped that 
could be largely avoided by having the SEC ask the companies to 
voluntarily revise their reports with fuller information. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the SEC charged 37 relatively small brokerage firms  
with failing to fully disclose their Year 2000 computer readiness, 
in the federal government's first major enforcement action related 
to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the firms have agreed to settle the charges by promising  
to refrain from such violations in the future, being censured and 
paying civil fines ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on 
their size. In settling the charges, the firms neither admitted nor 
denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also has accused nine stock-transfer agents of allegedly  
failing to adequately disclose their computer readiness for the 
date change. Five of the agent companies settled the charges and 
four contested them. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer agents, which sometimes are banks or trust companies,  
are responsible for keeping records of shareholders of corporations 
and for issuing or canceling stock certificates when shares are 
bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and fix  
Year 2000 computer problems could seriously disrupt corporations' 
dividend payments and other transactions with their shareholders.

<HEADLINE> NYC Protests Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a matter of seconds, four white police  
officers from the elite Street Crime Unit fired 41 shots at an 
unarmed man, a black West African immigrant who had no police 
record and spoke with a stutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street peddler described as religious and  
hard-working, was hit 19 times and died instantly Thursday in the 
vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' lawyer says Diallo gestured with his hands,  
leading the police to think he was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officers themselves were the only witnesses, and now  
Amnesty International and the NAACP are demanding explanations, and 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said federal prosecutors are reviewing 
the case for possible civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting has also brought renewed scrutiny to the Street  
Crime Unit, which has been criticized before for its aggressive 
tactics. The unit is assigned to seek out and stop crime before it 
happens. Its motto is ``We Own the Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mayor Rudolph Giuliani nor Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir will say anything substantial about the case, which is under 
investigation by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the policemen involved in the shooting has spoken  
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just deeply sorry for everything that's occurred,''  
Officer Sean Carroll told the Daily News outside his family's home 
in Babylon on Monday. ``We're going to cooperate 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged residents held a rally on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not anti-police,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ``We are  
anti-police brutality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. said Monday: ``When I went to  
the house and I saw how many holes were in the walls, it made me 
sick to my stomach,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the police force also cited the alleged torture of  
Haitian immigrant Abner Louima at a police station in 1997. Four 
white officers have been charged with attacking the black man, who 
was sodomized with the handle of a toilet plunger. 
</P>
<P>
	The plainclothes officers who shot Diallo had been looking for a  
rape-murder suspect when they encountered the 22-year-old immigrant 
at about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some similarities between this individual and the  
sketch we have,'' the police commissioner said. ``But beyond that -- 
what was in their minds, whether they thought this was that 
individual -- I really don't know, and it would be unfair to 
speculate at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the officers fired 16 bullets each, emptying their 9 mm,  
semiautomatic handguns in less than five seconds. The others fired 
their similar guns four and five times. They were standing about 15 
feet from Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly believed he was in possession of a gun,'' said  
the officers' attorney, Stephen Worth. Worth said Diallo moved his 
hands, and may not have understood the officers' commands. Family 
and friends said Diallo spoke English well but slowly, with a 
stutter. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were placed on administrative duty, a routine step  
in shooting investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Street Crime Unit officers fired on rapper ODB  
during a traffic stop, thinking he had a gun. No weapon was found 
and a grand jury refused to indict ODB on attempted murder charges. 
No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the Police Department itself, a group of officers called  
100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care has demanded the unit be 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is wrong with our street crime behavior and the  
Street Crime Unit,'' said Lt. Eric Adams, president of the group. 
``And if it is not examined, we will continue to have episodes such 
as this. And I believe as long as the ethnicity of the victims does 
not change, you will not see a change in the policy of the police 
department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's friends and relatives described him as a devout Muslim,  
a hard-working man who did not smoke or drink and loved Michael 
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to New York two years ago from the village of Lelouma,  
Guinea, and made his living selling scarves, hats, socks and 
videotapes in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never had any trouble back in our country with the  
police,'' said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo. ``Never! He should not 
have been killed here by police -- he was a hard-working, nice, 
honest man.''

<HEADLINE> German Joblessness on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German unemployment climbed to 11.5 percent  
in January from 10.9 percent the previous month as the economy 
worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Labor Office said Tuesday that some 4.455 million  
Germans were out of work in January, 257,900 more than in December. 
The new figure was still 368,000 fewer than in January 1998, when 
joblessness hit a postwar record of 12.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Joblessness rose to a whopping 18.9 percent in the former  
communist east Germany, and to 9.7 percent in the former western 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak economy offset the impact of relatively good weather  
and government-sponsored job creation programs on the employment 
situation, Labor Office president Bernhard Jagoda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg  
reiterated the bank's concern over high joblessness in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said in a speech delivered at the University of Hohenheim  
in Stuttgart that it is up to governments to introduce flexibility 
into labor markets. ``The root (of this problem) lies above all in 
rigidities produced, mostly, by an over-large and inappropriate 
thicket of rules in labor and goods markets,'' Duisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The appropriate answer to this is structural reform of the  
economy, aimed at breaking down inflexibilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg also called on workers to accept ``moderate'' wage  
increases, saying hefty hikes could hurt the economy, already 
weighed down by the global economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Democrats, voted out of power in Bonn last  
September partly over record unemployment, said the new increase 
proved Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government had few ideas on 
how to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The directionless politics of Schroeder's government has left  
deep imprints on the jobs market too, after 100 days,'' said 
Hermann Kues, party leader in the lower house of parliament, the 
Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's government has made fighting Germany's chronically  
high unemployment its priority, but has seen a pet project -- a 
roundtable of unions, employers and government aimed at cutting 
joblessness -- threatened as Germany's biggest union, the 
metalworkers, and employers hold acrimonious annual wage talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawn into global economic turmoil and with exports,  
particularly to Asia, sharply reduced, the government estimates 
Germany's economy will grow by 2 percent in 1999, compared to 2.8 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Democrat social affairs expert Adi Ostertag said the  
annual winter increase had obscured an overall positive tendency, 
with joblessness still below last year's highs.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Reaches Oregon Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Battered by six days of pounding surf,  
cracks widened in the steel hull of a grounded cargo ship Tuesday, 
pouring thousands of gallons of oil and diesel fuel onto 
environmentally sensitive beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Streaks of gooey, tar-like fuel oil streaked the southern Oregon  
coastline for six miles around the 639-foot New Carissa. As many as 
300 workers in yellow slickers and hard hats were called in to mop 
up the mess with shovels, squeegees and absorbent pompoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret very much that we have a very serious incident on our  
hands,'' said William Milwee, the salvage consultant representing 
the Japanese company that owns the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Kitzhaber said he was considering declaring a state of  
emergency, which would allow him to mobilize the National Guard to 
assist in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard said three of the ship's five fuel tanks were  
leaking and one, containing heavy fuel oil, was ``seriously 
breached.'' It was not known how much oil had leaked, but the three 
tanks hold 140,000 gallons of oil and diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several oil-covered birds have been found, and special crews  
were standing by in case the slick threatens the habitat of Western 
snowy plovers, a threatened bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, staffed with a crew of 23, grounded Thursday about 150  
yards offshore as it waited to come into port to pick up a load of 
wood chips. Its crew was removed by the Coast Guard on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil fumes mixed with salt air Tuesday as workers packed  
oil-soaked sand into clear plastic bags, and front-end loaders 
piled up blackened driftwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The thick oil penetrated less than an inch of the sand surface  
and pooled into depressions. Hundreds of bags of oil-soaked sand 
had been collected by Tuesday afternoon, but long stretches of 
beach still remained to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nasty, dirty hard work,'' Milwee said, adding that the  
lighter elements of the fuel oil have evaporated, leaving behind 
only a gooey, gelatinous muck. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Coast Guard and salvage teams were going over their  
options on how best to remove the New Carissa. The 200-foot tug 
Salvage Chief, a veteran of the 1989 Exxon Valdez recovery, arrived 
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton moved ahead with plans to  
nominate Richard Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations 
after Holbrooke agreed Tuesday to pay $5,000 to settle civil 
charges that he violated federal ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will soon send to the Senate my nomination of Richard C.  
Holbrooke,'' Clinton said in a statement issued from the White 
House shortly after the federal lawsuit and settlement were filed 
simultaneously in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran 57-year-old diplomat denied in the settlement the  
Justice Department's allegations that he improperly contacted a 
U.S. diplomat on behalf of his employer. Instead, Holbrooke said he 
was acting as a special government employee asked explain U.S. 
policy to Asian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Holbrooke did not willfully violate  
the law barring former government officials from contacting 
ex-colleagues about business for one year after leaving government. 
The department also said the contact produced no direct financial 
gain for Holbrooke or his employer, the investment banking firm of 
Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``From building lasting peace in Bosnia to searching for a  
political settlement in Kosovo, to finding a workable solution in 
Cyprus, Richard C. Holbrooke's intellect, vigor and diplomatic 
skills have significantly advanced the values and the interests of 
the American people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been eight months since Clinton first picked Holbrooke,  
the chief architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord and last fall's 
ceasefire in Kosovo, for the U.N. post formerly held by Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said in a statement Tuesday that he settled the ethics  
suit ``in order to allow my nomination to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I now look forward to appearing before the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee for the confirmation hearings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the nature of the allegations against Holbrooke emerged  
last month, the White House reaffirmed that Clinton remained 
``lock, stock and barrel'' behind the outspoken diplomat, whose 
ambition and forceful personality have won him detractors as well 
as fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is extraordinarily well qualified for this vital  
position,'' Clinton said, calling Holbrooke ``a strong and capable 
diplomat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said that less than a year after  
Holbrooke resigned in February 1996 as assistant secretary of state 
for European and Canadian Affairs, he wrote James Laney, U.S. 
ambassador to South Korea, on CS First Boston stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said that during March, April and May 1996,  
Holbrooke sought official action by Laney: to arrange a meeting 
with Korean President Kim Young Sam; to arrange a lunch at Laney's 
residence attended by Holbrooke, two other CS First Boston 
employees and Korean government officials; and to have Laney attend 
an opening ceremony for CS First Boston's branch office in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Lord, who served as assistant secretary of state for  
East Asia and Pacific affairs from 1993 to 1997, said in an 
interview last month, that he asked Holbrooke as a State Department 
consultant and special government employee to visit foreign 
officials and explain U.S. policy on any trips he made to Asia and 
to report back his impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said, ``It would have been ridiculous if (Holbrooke)  
hadn't'' contacted Laney in South Korea while he was a government 
consultant meeting Korean officials to explain U.S. policy at 
Lord's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department acknowledged in the court filing that  
``it may have been in the United States' national interest to have 
Holbrooke discuss certain foreign policy issues with certain 
high-level Korean officials.'' But it said his communications with 
Laney ``were made, at least in part, on behalf of his then 
employer, CS First Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke acknowledged that his company paid for the trip.  
</P>
<P>
	The government said the meeting with President Kim had to be  
canceled because of a schedule conflict. Holbrooke denied the 
meeting had any connection to his firm and said he sought it to 
brief Kim on U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government acknowledged that the lunch, paid for by the U.S.  
government, was first suggested by Laney. Although Holbrooke and 
two other CS First Boston employees attended, ``the government does 
not allege that any specific business interests related to CS First 
Boston were discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department said that Laney's expense  
justification for the lunch attributed its purpose 70 percent to 
promotion of U.S. national interests and 30 percent to promotion of 
U.S. economic activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the government said, there is evidence Holbrooke asked  
Laney to attend the CS First Boston ribbon-cutting on May 9. 
Although Laney was among 20 to 30 guests, Holbrooke said he did not 
invite the ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed to settle ``to avoid the expense, delay and  
uncertainty of potentially protracted litigation.''

<HEADLINE> Productivity Surges in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in productivity during the final three  
months of 1998 helped produce a healthy 2.2 percent increase in 
Americans' output per hour of work last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in productivity at nonfarm businesses, reported  
today by the Labor Department, marked a significant improvement 
over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997 and came close to the 2.4 percent 
rise in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, productivity surged at a 3.7 percent  
annual rate, the best since the first three months of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to  
prosperity and rising living standards. Sizable gains mean 
companies can pay employees more, hold the line on prices and still 
deliver increased profits to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and  
benefits jumped 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of  
underlying inflation pressures, slowed. They rose 2 percent in 
1998, compared with 2.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, after growing at nearly a 3 percent rate in the  
1960s and early 1970s, slowed to an anemic 1 percent rate from 1974 
through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at nearly a 2 percent 
rate, leading some economists to speculate that the economy has 
embarked on a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers 
and other high-tech innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, some believe productivity recently has been even better  
than measured because it's difficult to gauge the output of many 
services. They say it's the key factor behind the economy's ability 
to produce the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years, the lowest 
sustained inflation since the 1960s and the longest peacetime 
stretch of economic growth in history. 
</P>
<P>
	At factories, many of them hard hit by loss of export sales to  
Asia and other economically struggling parts of the world, 
productivity still increased a strong 4.3 percent in 1998, down 
from a five-year high of 4.9 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manufacturing of durable goods -- items from cars to  
computers expected to last three or more years -- productivity 
surged 6.8 percent, the biggest advance since 1971.

<HEADLINE> 300,000 Apply for Computer Giveaway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- More than 300,000 people applied for the  
10,000 free computers a company promises to give away in exchange 
for personal information about the users, a spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers and online applicants overwhelmed Free-PC.com on Monday  
after the electronic commerce firm announced the giveaway. Queries 
and applications continued to come in on Tuesday at a slower pace, 
said Steve Chadima, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has exceeded expectations,'' he said. ``I think the Free-PC  
folks were thinking there would be a positive response, but it's 
been overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company will take about 90 days to sort through the  
applications and pick computer recipients, said Chadima. 
</P>
<P>
	Free-PC.com officials have said users will be chosen on the  
basis of their compatibility with advertisers. In return for a 
computer, participants must provide Free-PC.com with basic 
information about their income, hobbies and interests. In addition, 
Free-PC.com will monitor which Internet sites the users visit and 
which ads they click onto for more information about particular 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company believes it can recoup the $500 cost of each  
computer and turn a profit by selling ads that will appear 
automatically on the users' computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	A user receives free Internet access and can keep the computer  
for good after participating in the advertising program for two 
years, Chadima said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has said it may eventually boost the number of free  
computers to 1 million. However, just when -- or if -- the number 
will be raised beyond the initial 10,000 wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Free-PC.com was created late last year at idealab!, a  
Pasadena-based company dedicated to nurturing high-tech ventures. 
The company also received a $10 million investment from Barry 
Diller's USA Network.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Aircraft Engine Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States called on the European Union  
on Tuesday to withhold new aircraft engine rules it was poised to 
adopt, saying they would harm U.S. air carriers and trample on 
existing international guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposed rule, expected to be adopted during a meeting of  
the European Parliament on Wednesday, would prohibit the 
registration in Europe of aircraft with ``hush kits'' after April 
1. The Europeans complain that the kits, which are installed on 
engines and act as mufflers, quiet aircraft but do not diminish 
their pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another element would ban aircraft that have hush kits and are  
registered elsewhere from flying in European skies as of April 1, 
2002, unless they were operating in the European Union before April 
1, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``A thorough analysis of the situation shows that hush-kitted  
aircraft perform worse that current production airplanes in terms 
of fuel burn and air pollution,'' the European Union said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials and U.S. airlines object for a variety of  
reasons, including the claim that the European Union is attempting 
to spur sales by Airbus Industries, the European airplane 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Airbus itself opposes the EU rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think of ourselves as rational people, and we're  
not going to stand up and punch our customers in the eye,'' said 
company spokesman David Venz. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers such as Northwest Airlines and FedEx, which have a  
higher percentage of old planes in their fleets, say the rules 
could inhibit their operations in Europe. They also say the rules 
would sharply devalue older U.S. jets, which are often retired and 
sold in Europe, Africa and Asia, because they would no longer be 
operable in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines are buying hundreds of new planes and installing  
hush kits on older models because the federal government has 
required that all jets operating in the country meet more stringent 
noise standards known as Stage 3 as of Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar worldwide requirement goes into effect April 1, 2002.  
That standard was adopted by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, a United Nations-based group that works to bring 
uniformity to global aviation rules. Both the United States and the 
European Union are members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share concerns regarding noise at all airports, and believe  
that the proper approach for addressing those concerns is within 
the ICAO process, not through unilateral adoption of a design 
standard which disregards actual performance,'' said a letter sent 
to the European Union by Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials feel the United States is trying to sidestep  
efforts to clean up the air by using methods that extend the 
service life of planes whose signature is dark, belching smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hush kit approach is clearly in the U.S. interest,'' said  
the E.U. statement. ``All manufacturers of hush kits are U.S.-based 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,  
told reporters that if the Europeans proceed, ``this will not go 
unanswered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States wants more time to discuss the rules,  
some of it during a meeting with E.U. officials in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to have these consultations while we've got a  
gun pointed at our heads,'' Aaron said.

<HEADLINE> Gibson's `Payback' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mel Gibson's latest blow-'em-up flick,  
``Payback,'' blasted to the top of the weekend movie pack, ending 
the recent teen-oriented choke hold at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playback,'' which stars Gibson as an anti-hero out to settle a  
few scores after a vicious double-cross, had the best opening of 
the year with $21.2 million in ticket sales, according to final 
industry figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film dumped the high school romance ``She's All That'' and  
upset the debut of another teen-age love story, ``Simply 
Irresistible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of regular season football, Gibson's mostly male,  
older fans returned to theaters in droves, industry analysts said. 
Paramount had held back ``Payback'' over the summer so it wouldn't 
clash with another Gibson film, ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That'' collected $11.7 million for second place  
while ``Patch Adams'' had $4.4 million for third. ``Varsity 
Blues,'' sharing the youth audience with ``She's All That,'' 
grossed $3.8 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of  
television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' debuted with a 
disappointing $2.23 million for ninth place, stung by bad reviews 
and fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which DreamWorks re-released to cash in  
on its Golden Globe wins and the buzz surrounding the Academy Award 
nominations, was at No. 5 with $3.6 million. Another film with 
Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' was sixth with $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky coming-of-age story ``Rushmore,'' starring Bill  
Murray, did strong business in limited release, grossing $1.8 
million on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of just 
under $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday through

<HEADLINE> Winter Storm Shuts I-80 in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A storm that buried the Sierra Nevada with  
more than 8 feet of snow in four days pummeled the region again 
Tuesday, closing Interstate 80 and taxing the patience of drivers 
and residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting very sick of this,'' Sara Olson said at the J&AMP;L  
Food Mart, in Truckee, Calif. ``If I have to pick up another 
shovel, someone's going to get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several major roads were shut down Tuesday because of avalanche  
dangers, spinouts and near-blizzard conditions. Hundreds of state 
workers were sent home early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to remember a time in the middle of the day when we  
had this many roads closed,'' KRNV weatherman Dave Finley in Reno 
said at noon Tuesday. ``It is kind of tough to get out of Nevada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A winter storm warning remained in effect for much of the  
northern and central Sierra through Tuesday night into Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> The Unusual in This Year's Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Academy Award nominations offered up the expected and  
unexpected. Some of the surprises: 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian movie ``Life Is Beautiful'' became the first in  
three decades to be nominated in best picture and foreign language 
categories. The only other picture to receive nominations in both 
categories in the same year was the 1969 movie ``Z.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Emigrants'' was nominated in both categories, but for  
different years -- 1971 and 1972 -- based on when it was released in 
Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' was the first foreign language film to  
receive seven nominations. ``Das Boot'' of 1982 and the 1983 
``Fanny &AMP; Alexander'' had six nominations. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' has taken in more than $194 million,  
nearly twice as much money as all the other best picture nominees 
combined: ``Elizabeth'' ($17.8 million), ``Shakespeare in Love'' 
($36.2 million), ``The Thin Red line'' ($30.4 million) and ``Life 
is Beautiful'' ($18.4 million). 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The Thin Red Line'' got seven nominations despite its mixed  
reviews and lukewarm reception at the box office. It was a 
triumphant return to the movies for director Terrence Malick, who 
hadn't made a film since ``Days of Heaven'' in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Meryl Streep got her 11th Oscar nomination: best actress for  
``One True Thing.'' She's now tied with Jack Nicholson for acting 
nominations and they are one away from record-holder Katharine 
Hepburn's 12 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	If Miss Streep wins her third Oscar this year she will tie with  
Ingrid Bergman, Walter Brennan and Nicholson. Miss Hepburn holds 
the record with four best actress Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni was recognized for his multiple roles behind and  
in front of the camera in ``Life is Beautiful.'' It got seven 
nominations: director and actor for Benigni and screenplay for 
Benigni and co-writer Vincenzo Cerami, best picture, foreign 
language film, dramatic score and editing. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni's triple play was impressive, but not unprecedented.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Orson Welles was nominated for actor, director and  
co-writer of ``Citizen Kane.'' As producer of the movie, he would 
have received the Oscar if it had won that category. ``How Green 
Was My Valley'' won best picture that year. Welles won only for 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Woody Allen was nominated as actor, director and  
co-writer of ``Annie Hall.'' He won as director and co-writer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Warren Beatty was nominated as producer of best picture  
nominee ``Reds,'' and as actor, director and co-writer. He won only 
as director. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting actress nominee Judi Dench, nominated for an Oscar  
last year for her role as Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,'' was one 
of two actresses nominated this year for playing Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	She had the role in ``Shakespeare in Love'' while Cate Blanchett  
was the monarch in ``Elizabeth.''

<HEADLINE> MS Patient Faces Marijuana Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's ban on using marijuana for  
medicinal purposes will be tested in the nation's capital as a 
woman suffering from multiple sclerosis stands trial for lighting a 
joint in a congressman's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Emry Wolfe said taking a few puffs of marijuana is the  
only way she gets relief when her muscles go into spasm from the 
disease she has had for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Wolfe, ``having a joint is like an asthmatic having a  
bronchial inhaler,'' said her attorney, Jeff Orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 15, Mrs. Wolfe lighted a marijuana cigarette in the  
office of Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., to bring attention to the 
issue of medical marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``This patient has run out of patience,'' Mrs. Wolfe, a  
38-year-old mother of three from Ann Arbor, Mich., said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an uphill battle that I'm fighting,'' she said after  
Superior Court Judge Anita Josey-Herring set an April 26 trial 
date. ``I feel that if I have to talk to every judge in this 
country to get things changed, I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office  
here, said prosecutors are pushing the case because ``possession of 
marijuana is against the law'' in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a growing national debate over the use of marijuana for  
medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in six states -- California, Arizona, Alaska, Oregon,  
Nevada and Washington -- have approved measures in the last few 
years allowing use of marijuana for medical reasons. Congress 
barred the District of Columbia from counting of voting results 
from a similar ballot initiative last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Journal of Medicine has editorialized in favor  
of medical marijuana and the American Medical Association, altering 
its policy, voted to urge the National Institutes of Health to 
support more research on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Mrs. Wolfe went to McCollum's office to protest his  
resolution that day on the House floor, which said marijuana is a 
dangerous and addictive drug and should not be legalized for 
medical use. McCollum is chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee's crime panel. 
</P>
<P>
	In his legal argument, Orchard contends that Mrs. Wolfe started  
to feel tense when McCollum's aides did not want to talk with her 
and she lighted the marijuana cigarette because she felt her 
symptoms returning. When she gets attacks, her hands shake and she 
loses control of her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, McCollum aide Shannon Gravitte said she spoke to Mrs.  
Wolfe. Gravitte said the incident seemed like a publicity stunt 
since Mrs. Wolfe had brought several cameras and a reporter with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very calm and almost immediately lit up the joint,''  
Ms. Gravitte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wolfe was arrested and spent several hours in jail. Charged  
with a misdemeanor, she would face up to 180 days in jail and a 
$1,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend a medical defense does not apply because  
there was no immediate danger to Mrs. Wolfe and there was a legal 
medical alternative available. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence overwhelmingly establishes that her real purpose  
was to conduct a protest in the United States Capitol in order to 
publicize her position regarding the marijuana laws,'' prosecutors 
wrote in a legal brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Orchard said jail time could hurt her health: ``Right now, she  
does not always have to be in a wheelchair. If she does 180 days 
without any (marijuana), she will always be in a wheelchair.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Will Happily Live in the '60's / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the 1990s are a drag, NBC will gladly return  
to the 1960s or 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's music-packed miniseries, ``The '60's,'' was a hit  
in its debut Sunday night, helping the network to an easy ratings 
victory during the first week of the important February ``sweeps'' 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics didn't much like the two-part miniseries, but its  
opening night audience of 24 million viewers was bigger than any 
other program last week except NBC's trio of Thursday night hits, 
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' the week's second most-watched show, drew higher  
ratings than normal on Thursday night with actor Woody Harrelson 
reprising his role from the 1980s hit ``Cheers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most popular show, as is customary, in its  
countdown to George Clooney's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	In what's becoming a tradition in one of the four ``sweeps''  
months -- when ratings are watched closely to set local advertising 
rates -- Fox drew solid numbers with dramatic nonfiction 
programming. Last Thursday's specials included ``World's Most 
Shocking Moments'' and a daredevil jump by Robbie Knievel. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 10.3 rating and 17 share. CBS was a  
solid second with a 9.3 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.9 rating 
and 13 share and Fox was at 7.2 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the developing networks, the WB had a 3.3 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program, the third week in a row it has won or shared the lead. ABC 
had an 8.7 rating and 17 share, NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 8.4 
and 16 and the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.7 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 20.3; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.0; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 16.9; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: The '60's, Part 
One,'' NBC, 15.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 14.7; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 13.5; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 13.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Night Ride Home,'' CBS, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Pays Tax Preparer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A tax preparer targeted by the Internal  
Revenue Service has become the first person paid by the Justice 
Department under a law intended to rein in frivolous criminal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy that it's over,'' said Richard Gardner, who along  
with his attorney received $75,000 last week after arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner was indicted in 1997 on 21 counts of tax and bankruptcy  
fraud, but the charges were withdrawn in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 law, called the Hyde amendment, allows reimbursement  
for unwarranted criminal prosecutions by up to $125 an hour for 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents for the IRS raided Gardner's office in 1995. His  
attorney, Tom Seymour, said he believes Gardner was prosecuted 
because he had filed for bankruptcy on two of his businesses. 
Gardner was accused of aiding in the preparation of false tax 
returns, concealing assets in bankruptcy and committing bankruptcy 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just arrogant, and unfortunately someone has to  
stand up to them and say `Enough. We're not going to put up with it 
anymore,' '' Gardner said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman John Russell would not speculate on  
whether Gardner had been frivolously prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court said he was,'' Russell said. ``We just have no  
further comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner testified last year before a Senate committee  
investigating alleged abuse by the IRS. He said he has not lost 
faith in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deal with the IRS all the time,'' he said. ``A good 90  
percent of them are decent people. Just the other 10 percent are 
out of control.''

	Deliberations Next in Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are ready to debate President  
Clinton's fitness to remain in office. But first they must decide 
whether to hold their historic deliberations in public or behind 
closed doors. Even as deliberations begin, senators are struggling 
to draft a strong censure resolution condemning Clinton's behavior 
in trying to hide an extramarital affair. Proponents of censure 
hope to bring it to the Senate floor immediately after the trial.

	Yeltsin Cuts Stay in Jordan Short  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health was  
normal today and he was resting at a sanitarium outside Moscow 
after returning abruptly from the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein, 
officials said. A Kremlin spokeswoman said she had no information 
on Yeltsin's plans or whether he would have any meetings or attend 
other events. Yeltsin returned to Moscow late Monday after 
Jordanian officials said the Russian leader received unspecified 
medical aid before his sudden departure from Amman. 

</P>
<P>
	Albright Praises New Jordanian King  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she  
has assurances from King Abdullah of Jordan that he will ``carry 
his father's flag'' in pursuing peace in the Middle East. Promising 
to help the new monarch, Albright in an Associated Press interview 
yesterday cautioned Iraq against any intimidation of its smaller, 
pro-Western neighbor. In a wide-ranging conversation, Albright also 
made it clear she expects Israel to go ahead with its promised 
pullback on the West Bank despite repeated Israeli charges that the 
Palestinians are not carrying out all the promises they made in the 
Wye accords in October.

	U.S. Seeks Closer African Ties  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- As the first American secretary  
of defense to visit South Africa, William Cohen represents both the 
possibility of closer U.S. ties to this continent and the reality 
of America's reluctance to extend its defense commitments. In three 
days here, Cohen will meet with South African government officials, 
possibly including President Nelson Mandela, to discuss U.S. 
initiatives for peacekeeper training and an African Center for 
Security Studies, which the Clinton administration hopes will 
professionalize the region's armies. 

</P>
<P>
	World Leaders Mourn Hussein  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein was mourned yesterday by  
Dignitaries and leaders from all over the world at his funeral in 
Jordan. On hand were President Clinton and three ex-U.S. 
presidents. It also drew sworn enemies like Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Syrian President Hafez Assad. The two stayed 
well apart, but even so, their presence at the same event was 
unprecedented. Russian President Boris Yeltsin spent only a few 
hours in Jordan during the day before flying home. King Abdullah, 
who vows to further his father's moderate policies, held evening 
meetings with 31 heads of state.

	VA Nurses Getting Pay Raises  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is quietly  
giving out pay raises to nurses at many of its 173 facilities to 
atone for wage freezes or cuts that its managers imposed on them in 
recent years. Curiously, the way was cleared for those wage 
restraints when Congress passed the Nurse Pay Act of 1990, aimed 
specifically at giving agency administrators greater flexibility to 
offer competitive wages in a time of nursing shortages. A short 
time after the law took effect, the nursing shortage eased.

	Chinese Premier Frets Over Protests  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Underscoring the government's nervousness about  
festering unrest, China's premier has urged officials to discourage 
people from making collective protests, state media reported today. 
With unemployment mounting and economic growth slowing, protests by 
unemployed workers and farmers angry over heavy taxes have become 
commonplace in many cities and towns. While many protests end 
peacefully, government leaders fear that anger could escalate into 
violence. Among other steps, they are beefing up the paramilitary 
police forces that can be used to quell unrest.

	Japanese Stock Prices Slip  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices slipped today. The Nikkei  
shed 89.83 points to closed at 13,902.66. 

</P>
<P>
	Pacers 95, Cavaliers 89  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 28 points, Chris Mullin  
added 22 and Indiana spoiled Cleveland's home opener last night 
with a 95-89 win over the Cavaliers, who dropped to 0-3. Miller 
took control of the game in the second half, scoring 10 points in 
the third and 10 in the fourth to help the Pacers bounce back from 
a loss at Detroit on Sunday.

 *Executives Searching for Work    	
</P>
<P>
	LAYOFF SURVEY: The job cuts that many big companies announced at  
the end of 1998 sent many highly-paid executives searching for 
work, reports Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an employment 
consulting firm. Challenger Gray found in a survey that the median 
salary of managers and executives before they were laid off during 
the fourth quarter was $92,000, up 18 percent from the median 
$78,000 earned by executives dismissed during the third quarter. 
The survey also found it's taking longer for managers to find new 
jobs than it took several months ago. 
</P>

<P>
	CUSTOMER SERVICE: A Web site set up to record customer  
complaints and kudos found consumers believe the service they 
receive from many businesses, institutions and government offices 
keeps getting worse. The site, created by Service Intelligence, a 
consulting firm, found the most complaints about workers in the 
medical field, retailing, airlines and the government. The best 
service was reported at hotels, followed by restaurants. Service 
Intelligence said 445 people responded to the online survey, with 
46 reporting overall service in this country is getting worse. 
Thirty-six percent believe it's the same, and 18 percent see an 
improvement. 
</P>

	JUGGLING ACT: Parents find it hard to balance work and family,  
but many believe that having children makes them better employees. 
A survey of 1,002 adults commissioned by Lutheran Brotherhood, a 
financial services concern, found 52 percent of employed parents 
believe they're more productive because they have children. The 
survey conducted by Yankelovich Partners found only 11 percent say 
parenthood made them less productive. Gwen Kuhrt, the human 
resources manager for Lutheran Brotherhood, says the increase in 
productivity may be because, ``some parents may try to work more 
efficiently so that they have more time to spend with their kids.'' 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	TRAVEL TAKES ITS TOLL: If you're frazzled from traveling for  
your job, you have plenty of company in your misery. Management 
consultants Runzheimer International reported that a survey of 
business travelers found many are stressed out and suffering from 
fatigue, loss of humor, aching arms and legs, paranoia, memory 
loss, hyperactivity and crying. Most of the stressed travelers 
point the finger of blame at airlines because of lost luggage, long 
lines and not enough air conditioning on flights.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Wins Key Battle in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After heavy lobbying by the National Rifle  
Association, Gov. Roy Barnes on Tuesday signed a bill blocking 
Atlanta's liability lawsuit against gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which goes into effect immediately, makes Georgia the  
first state to prevent a city or county from filing product 
liability suits against gun makers. The law reserves that right for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, a Democrat, said the state has the right to force  
Atlanta to avoid the costs of pursuing its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta filed its suit against 17 gun makers last week as the  
city was the host of the nation's largest gun show. As with similar 
cases in Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami, 
Atlanta accused the industry of negligently designing guns with 
inadequate safety devices and sought reimbursement for the costs of 
gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans to move forward with its lawsuit and see how the  
court responds, Mayor Bill Campbell said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's in the hands of the courts to take the appropriate  
action and determine ... which side will prevail,'' spokesman Nick 
Gold said. ``We don't feel it's constitutional for the state to 
tell the municipalities who they can and cannot sue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which was pending when the lawsuit was filed and  
received final approval from the state House on Tuesday, was 
supported by the lobbying muscle of the NRA. The organization, 
which claims to have 93,000 Georgia members, endorsed Barnes in the 
1998 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first of what we hope to be many similar legislative  
efforts around the country in an attempt to stop what we think are 
basically extremely ill-considered, wrongheaded lawsuits,'' said 
James Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the NRA is lobbying for similar measures in Louisiana  
and six other states, which he declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's opponents said it unconstitutionally keeps cities  
from turning to the courts after the NRA has successfully blocked 
gun-safety proposals in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can require that the pharmaceutical companies put a lock  
cap on a bottle of aspirin for a headache, surely we can ask them 
to put out some safety mechanisms on firearms,'' said state Sen. 
David Scott, an Atlanta Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, jurors told a judge they were deadlocked in a  
private lawsuit that contends gun makers should be held liable for 
urban shootings. The trial is considered an important test case for 
the cities' gun lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein sent the 11 jurors home and  
asked them to resume deliberations Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Makes Last Appeal to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- His lofty rhetoric hanging over the weary  
Senate, Rep. Henry Hyde fired one last appeal at lawmakers poised 
to reject his case against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let right be done,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	But Hyde also acknowledged that pressing for Clinton's  
conviction and removal may have cost him esteem among his 
colleagues, a consequence that ``cuts the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All a congressman ever gets to take with him when he leaves is  
the esteem of his colleagues and constituents -- and we have risked 
that for a principle, for our duty as we have seen it,'' the 
Illinois Republican said Monday in closing arguments at the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone in the well of the Senate -- the last of 13 GOP House  
members to argue for Clinton's removal -- the silver-haired Hyde 
displayed the same fervor he has throughout the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted Shakespeare, poked fun at the Senate as the ``House of  
Lords'' and spoke in the most dire terms of the consequences if 
senators, as expected, acquit the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we are  
engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting to 
defend,'' Hyde, a World War II veteran, told weary senators. Will 
there be ``enough vitality left in duty, honor and country to 
excite our children and grandchildren to defend America?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Hyde inherited the impeachment investigation last fall as  
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, many looked at him as an 
elder statesmen at the helm of a difficult task. ``This is a lousy 
job, but somebody has to do it,'' he grumbled in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, he has been branded a partisan by Democrats who  
said he proceeded with impeachment without bipartisan support after 
promising he would not. 
</P>
<P>
	After pledging impartiality, Hyde found himself zealously  
defending Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, even leading a 
Republican standing ovation in the Judiciary Committee room after 
the prosecutor testified there last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed for witnesses that senators did not want, eventually  
winning the right to question three in videotaped deposition. But 
senators rejected his request to summon Monica Lewinsky for live 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he even tried anew to call more witness based on  
belated information casting doubt on the testimony of a White House 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own admission, Hyde was a pain ``in the bosom'' of a  
Senate eager to get the impeachment trial behind him, as the polls 
show the public wants -- and one person in the gallery shouted last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing an uphill battle for conviction, Hyde reserved some of  
his final argument to pay tribute to the 12 colleagues who joined 
him in prosecuting Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have gone through it all at your side -- the media  
condemnations, the patronizing editorials, the hate mail, the 
insults hurled in public, the attempts at intimidation, the death 
threats and even the disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the 
worst,'' he said, looking over at his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	And he mocked senators who consider a censure of Clinton a  
better punishment than removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt there are many people on Planet Earth who doubt the  
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed 
justice,'' he said. ``Do you really cleanse the office as provided 
in the Constitution, or do you use the Air Wick of a censure 
resolution?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unhappy With Japan Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed  
unhappiness with a lack of progress after two days of talks with 
Japanese negotiators about eliminating regulatory barriers U.S. 
firms believe are keeping them from expanding sales in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries hope to reach concrete agreements in such areas  
as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and construction by the end 
of March. But U.S. officials said the Japanese side had shown 
little willingness to put forward meaningful deregulation proposals 
during discussions that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. wants Japan to take steps to open its economy, said a  
senior U.S. trade official who spoke to reporters on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated the administration's position that Japan must do  
more to remove trade barriers at a time when the Asian financial 
crisis is pushing the U.S. trade deficit to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, aimed at forcing Japan to remove various regulations  
that hinder foreign companies, were started in June 1997. President 
Clinton and then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a 
breakthrough in several areas last May when the two leaders were in 
Birmingham, England, for the annual economic summit of industrial 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since then U.S. officials have complained that Japan  
has been slow to implement its promises and reluctant to go forward 
with a second phase of deregulation. In October, the United States 
put forward new proposals with a goal of reaching a new agreement 
by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is hoping for results before Japanese Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi makes his first visit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said discussions aimed at achieving new agreements  
will continue in the first week of March when a U.S. delegation led 
by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher visits Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators have focused on implementation of a new law  
removing restrictions on the location of large retail stores, 
something the United States has been pressing Japan to accomplish 
for years in the belief that establishment of bigger discount 
stores would make more U.S.-made products available to Japanese 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other issues in dispute are high telephone connection  
charges that Japanese companies have been imposing to keep U.S. 
telecommunications firms out of the market and lengthy regulatory 
procedures for getting new drugs approved for sale in Japan.

<HEADLINE> LSU May Force SEC Tournament Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Southeastern Conference on Tuesday announced  
a revised format for the men's basketball tournament because of 
LSU's ban from postseason play this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA infractions committee imposed the sanctions against LSU  
for violations in the recruiting of Lester Earl. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials will go before the NCAA's appeals committee  
Feb. 27 in Atlanta, arguing the penalties are too harsh. If the 
sanctions are upheld, the March 4-7 tournament at the Georgia Dome 
would be reduced to an 11-team format. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be three games on Thursday, March 4, instead of the  
normal four. LSU would be seeded last in the Western Division and 
not allowed to compete. The No. 3 seed with the higher conference 
winning percentage would receive a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
	The other third-seeded team would play the No. 6 seed from the  
Eastern Division in the first round. The winner of that game 
advances to play the divisional No. 2 seed with the better 
conference winning percentage on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first time since 1992, when Auburn was banned  
because of probation, that a team has been kept out of the 
conference tournament.

	``It's very exciting. When people give you a wonderful script,  
they say it has Oscar written all over it, by which they mean it's 
a good script and you don't really believe a word more. But then

<HEADLINE> UN Wants Israeli Settlements Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Ignoring Israeli and U.S. objections, the  
U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution Tuesday 
calling for an international conference on Israeli settlements in 
traditionally Arab areas that Palestinians claim are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 115-2 with five abstentions.  
</P>
<P>
	The resolution contends that Israel is violating the Geneva  
conventions by constructing new settlements in east Jerusalem and 
on other lands the Israelis captured in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for a conference of the signatories to the 1949 Fourth  
Geneva Convention to be convened on July 15 in the Swiss city to 
consider measures to enforce the convention ``in the occupied 
Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Undoubtedly, this has a great importance,'' the Palestinian  
U.N. observer, Nasser Al-Kidwa said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to the convening of that conference on time.''  
he said. ``We look forward to the expected important results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Switzerland's U.N. observer, Jeno Staehelin, said his  
country would not participate in such a conference unless the 
signatories first agreed on measures to handle grave violations 
``wherever they occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians charge that Israel's settlement programs  
blatantly disregard the terms of October's Wye River peace 
agreement, negotiated in Maryland with President Clinton. They 
claim the actions also violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on the 
protection of civilians in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of speeches, speaker after speaker supported the  
Palestinians and demanded that Israel halt construction in 
contested areas and adhere to the peace agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Assembly had been scheduled to conclude the debate  
Monday, but postponed the debate to pay tribute to Jordan's King 
Hussein. The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday paid tribute to the 
king, calling him ``a steadfast warrior for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Jordan and Egypt were among the countries accusing  
Israel of ignoring international law by building new settlements on 
confiscated land. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said Tuesday that his  
country opposes ``one-sided U.N. resolutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gold called the emergency session ``a total abuse of the U.N.  
system,'' saying conventions meant to protect civilians in time of 
war are being manipulated to block housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The Geneva conventions established a code of conduct for the  
treatment in wartime of prisoners as well as the sick and wounded. 
They also say an occupying power must guarantee the protection of 
civilians in areas it occupies. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is land seized by Israel during the 1967 Mideast War,  
including the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians 
say Israeli settlements threaten to change the makeup of these 
areas, even as their future is being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians point to a 6,500-unit Israeli housing project  
planned in Har Homa that they say violates Geneva conventions that 
prohibit population transfers in occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolutions from the 185-member General Assembly are nonbinding,  
and Israel has routinely ignored U.N. declarations regarding 
relations with the Arabs.

<HEADLINE>  Common Jordanians Flock to Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Making their way from desert camps and  
faraway villages, common Jordanians passed sorrowfully through the 
royal palace today to offer sympathy to the new King Abdullah and 
prayers for their late monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate ceremony, King Hussein's widow, the American-born  
Queen Noor, and other female family members held private prayers at 
Hussein's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour visit by Noor, Hussein's fourth wife, was her  
first to the grave. Muslim custom had prohibited their presence at 
Monday's funeral when Hussein was laid to rest amid hundreds of 
world statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Noor and Abdullah's Palestinian wife, Rania, wore white head  
scarves as they stood over the grave, said palace sources, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. After the prayers, Noor wept. 
</P>
<P>
	At the palace, crowds began forming outside the gates before  
dawn. The line of mourners in simple Bedouin robes and ill-fitting 
dark suits waiting to shake King Abdullah's hand was a distinct 
contrast to the staggering array of presidents, prime ministers and 
kings who had paid their last respects to King Hussein the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	But, perhaps, there was greater significance in the 37-year-old  
king sharing his grief with ordinary Jordanians. Officials hope 
Abdullah can quickly cement the deep loyalty and popular support 
enjoyed by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds forged by Hussein with the Bedouin tribes of this  
desert kingdom are a vital element of the nation's stability -- 
highly valued by Western and Arab leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	After beginning his reign in 1952, Hussein started projects to  
bring electricity and other development to all corners of the poor 
country. He also welcomed opinions from Bedouin leaders on domestic 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, however, has a more difficult task in winning the  
trust of the nation -- especially among Palestinians and others who 
oppose Jordan's Western tilt. As a military commander, Abdullah led 
an army crackdown in February 1998 on pro-Iraq demonstrations in 
the southern city of Maan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be difficult without Hussein among us, but we  
believe Abdullah will be fine. This cub is from the lion king,'' 
said Sheik Samir Aroumti, 57, who waited with thousands of others 
to meet Abdullah in the throne chamber, where Hussein's body had 
lain in state on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jordan began a three-day mourning period on Sunday, black  
flags were flying from homes and stores in Amman. Most businesses 
are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, who has indicated that he will continue his father's  
moderate policies, held 31 meetings with visiting heads of state on 
Monday evening after the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the hundreds of dignitaries had put aside pressing  
problems to hasten to Amman for the ceremony: President Clinton, 
facing an impeachment trial at home, led a delegation of three 
former American presidents, and ailing Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin spent only a few hours in Jordan before flying back to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 800,000 people had lined the 9-mile funeral  
procession route through Amman. In the royal cemetery, Hussein was 
buried in a simple white shroud next to his father and grandfather.

<HEADLINE>  Common Jordanians Flock to Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Making their way from desert camps and  
faraway villages, common Jordanians passed sorrowfully through the 
royal palace today to offer sympathy to the new King Abdullah and 
prayers for their late monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate ceremony, King Hussein's widow, the American-born  
Queen Noor, and other female family members held private prayers at 
Hussein's grave. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour visit by Noor, Hussein's fourth wife, was her  
first to the grave. Muslim custom had prohibited their presence at 
Monday's funeral when Hussein was laid to rest amid hundreds of 
world statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Noor and Abdullah's Palestinian wife, Rania, wore white head  
scarves as they stood over the grave, said palace sources, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. After the prayers, Noor wept. 
</P>
<P>
	At the palace, crowds began forming outside the gates before  
dawn. The line of mourners in simple Bedouin robes and ill-fitting 
dark suits waiting to shake King Abdullah's hand was a distinct 
contrast to the staggering array of presidents, prime ministers and 
kings who had paid their last respects to King Hussein the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	But, perhaps, there was greater significance in the 37-year-old  
king sharing his grief with ordinary Jordanians. Officials hope 
Abdullah can quickly cement the deep loyalty and popular support 
enjoyed by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds forged by Hussein with the Bedouin tribes of this  
desert kingdom are a vital element of the nation's stability -- 
highly valued by Western and Arab leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	After beginning his reign in 1952, Hussein started projects to  
bring electricity and other development to all corners of the poor 
country. He also welcomed opinions from Bedouin leaders on domestic 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, however, has a more difficult task in winning the  
trust of the nation -- especially among Palestinians and others who 
oppose Jordan's Western tilt. As a military commander, Abdullah led 
an army crackdown in February 1998 on pro-Iraq demonstrations in 
the southern city of Maan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be difficult without Hussein among us, but we  
believe Abdullah will be fine. This cub is from the lion king,'' 
said Sheik Samir Aroumti, 57, who waited with thousands of others 
to meet Abdullah in the throne chamber, where Hussein's body had 
lain in state on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Jordan began a three-day mourning period on Sunday, black  
flags were flying from homes and stores in Amman. Most businesses 
are closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, who has indicated that he will continue his father's  
moderate policies, held 31 meetings with visiting heads of state on 
Monday evening after the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the hundreds of dignitaries had put aside pressing  
problems to hasten to Amman for the ceremony: President Clinton, 
facing an impeachment trial at home, led a delegation of three 
former American presidents, and ailing Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin spent only a few hours in Jordan before flying back to 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 800,000 people had lined the 9-mile funeral  
procession route through Amman. In the royal cemetery, Hussein was 
buried in a simple white shroud next to his father and grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer-stricken Hussein had lingered unconscious on a  
respirator for two days after returning home to Jordan last week 
following months of cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Browns Use First Draft Pick on Pyne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- With bronzed Hall of Fame busts of Jim  
Brown, Lou Groza and Leroy Kelly reminding them of their rich NFL 
past, the new Cleveland Browns continued to build with no-name 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Priming for their return this season after a three-year absence,  
the Browns selected Detroit center Jim Pyne with their first pick 
in Tuesday's NFL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	And with its final pick, Cleveland brought back one of the old  
Browns, taking San Francisco cornerback Antonio Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne's selection set the tone for a draft in which the Browns  
spent wisely -- only two players have salary cap costs over $1 
million -- and loaded up on young offensive lineman and defensive 
backs. Cleveland used 10 of its 37 picks on defensive backs and 
nine on the offensive front. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Cleveland avoided high-priced players like Denver's  
Darrien Gordon and Washington's Gus Frerotte, opting instead to 
take players it considers to have long-term potential while saving 
money to use on free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea today was to give coach (Chris) Palmer and his staff  
a foundation,'' said Browns president Carmen Policy. ``I think what 
we did was build a foundation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, 27, started all 16 games for the Lions last season after  
spending his first three years with Tampa Bay. His versatility made 
him attractive to the Browns, as did his salary cap number of 
$1.885 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL required the Browns to take 30 to 42 players or spend 38  
percent ($21.77 million) of their salary cap ($57.288 million) on 
players they take in the expansion draft. So Cleveland had to 
equally weigh a player's character, expense and potential before 
making him part of its future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns figured to be frugal, and they made some  
penny-pinching picks. They were also expected to favor youth, and 
selected only one player over 30 -- San Francisco linebacker James 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking Langham at a cost of $3.02 million against the  
cap, Cleveland had chosen only four players with price tags of over 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne's selection fit perfectly into this day when history was on  
everyone's mind. He is part of the only three-generation NFL family 
in history. His father, George III, played for Boston in 1965, and 
his grandfather, George II, played for Providence in 1931-32. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' said Pyne, a 6-foot-2, 297-pounder from  
Virginia Tech. ``Cleveland is a great place. I'm glad to be here. I 
wanted to be here. I grew up watching the Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it seemed did everyone else at the Canton Civic Center.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 fans, including members of the famed Dawg Pound,  
were on hand for the nearly three-hour, made-for-TV event. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been more than three years since Cleveland fans could  
scream for their football heroes. And with all the barking and 
``Here we go Brownies'' chants, it was as if the Steelers were in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL held the draft in pro football's birthplace to trumpet  
the rebirth of Cleveland's tradition-rich franchise. A high-tech 
stage, complete with scoreboard, was ringed with the 13 bronzed 
busts of Browns in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland invited its first five picks -- Pyne, Dallas defensive  
end Hurvin McCormack, New England tackle Scott Rehberg, Cincinnati 
wide receiver Damon Gibson and San Francisco center Steve Gordon -- 
to the event and each was greeted with a rousing ovation as they 
made their way to the stage to be presented a Browns' cap by Policy 
and Cleveland owner Al Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to play in front of the Dawg Pound,'' said  
Gibson. ``I want to beat Cincinnati now. Nothing personal, that's 
just the way it is. I'm a Cleveland Brown now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman are important to any team, but particularly to  
the Browns, who could take Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch with the 
No. 1 overall pick in the college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wonderful to block for a guy like Couch,'' said  
Rehberg. ``But I'll do my job for whoever is back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just because a player is with the Browns today doesn't mean  
he'll be wearing an orange helmet very long. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL expansion has taught fans this: Don't get too attached to  
your team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Cleveland Browns won't look anything like they will in  
a few years, maybe even in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 30 or so players the Browns select could be cut  
before the team opens training camp in July. Others could be traded 
as Cleveland attempts to secure more draft picks. Some will get 
injured; some will retire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns used the expansion blueprints left by Carolina and  
Jacksonville in preparing for this year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina took 35 players in the draft, and 15 made their roster  
for the start of that season. Four years later, just one -- wide 
receiver Mark Carrier, a former Brown -- remains and he was released 
at one point and came back as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 31 expansion players selected by Jacksonville, 22 made  
its opening roster. There are now just three original Jaguars 
remaining.

<HEADLINE> Maria Callas Talks to Vanity Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maria Callas claimed to have continued an  
``amorous friendship'' with Aristotle Onassis after he wed 
Jacqueline Kennedy, according to the March issue of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not marry for love ... It was more a marriage of  
business convenience,'' the late opera diva is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on interviews with Callas from 1947 to her  
death in 1977, two years after Onassis. The excerpted quotes are 
from ``Maria Callas: Sacred Monster,'' by Stelios Galatopoulos, to 
be published in March by Simon &AMP; Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Callas told Galatopoulos that Onassis returned to her shortly  
after he married the former first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continued to see him from time to time, and during my  
concert tours in 1973-74 he always sent me flowers and telephoned 
... I would have preferred that he would not have married someone 
else. But that was an unusual marriage whichever way you look at 
it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she and Onassis never married, she said: ``The role of  
the betrayed wife was not in my repertoire ... We were not, 
therefore, compatible for marriage to each other.''

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Ten more IOC members were implicated  
Tuesday in an ethics panel report that shockingly detailed the 
extreme and unethical means Salt Lake City used to land votes for 
the Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for the first time, the U.S. Olympic Committee was tied to  
the ever-widening corruption scandal by the report through a series 
of exchanges among three senior staffers involving ``promises ... 
made to secure votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Free trips to the Super Bowl, stays in ritzy Paris hotels, ski  
vacations and fistfuls of cash were among improper perks and 
payments cited in the 300-page report by an independent ethics 
panel for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch, bid committee  
president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the two universally credited for bringing the 2002  
Games to Salt Lake, even by those who divulged damning information 
about Welch and Johnson to the ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also were described as the architects of a scheme born  
on the day in 1991 that Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Games 
to Nagano, Japan, by just four votes of the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From that day in Birmingham, England, where Welch claims to have  
turned down two offers of IOC member influence for cash, Welch and 
Johnson stretched Salt Lake's legitimate quest to win IOC member 
friends into an unethical and at times secretive mission, the 
ethics panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, Johnson and, to a lesser extent, former administrative  
officer Craig Peterson, had both a strategic and off-the-cuff 
approach for improper spending, said David Jordan, a former U.S. 
attorney on the five-member ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the bid board were not told of direct cash payments  
or details of bogus scholarships, and outside auditors failed to 
raise red flags about those expenditures, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel did not total up the amounts but the improper  
payments -- some in the form of scholarships -- exceeded $1 million. 
Another $1 million in air fare, hotel rooms and shopping sprees 
were donated to the bid committee and passed along to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Welch and Johnson were interviewed at length by the ethics  
panel, but Peterson and Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
declined to be interviewed, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch even made a wire transfer from his children's trust  
account when the wife of Siuli Paul Wallwork, the IOC member from 
Western Somoa, sought $30,000 for a friend in a serious situation. 
Welch later told a bid committee employee the money had been 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 IOC members mentioned in the report were not previously  
tied to Salt Lake's excesses. That brings the number of those 
implicated in vote-buying schemes to 24 -- roughly one-fifth of the 
IOC's total membership. Nine IOC members have been expelled or have 
resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 electronic-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It 
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network --  
the single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
The ethics panel did not have access to bank records and had no 
subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee, and  
the committee paid for his family to stay at the Intercontinental 
Hotel in Paris for 11 days in 1994 and 11 days in 1995 at $300 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also detailed eight wire transfers totaling  
$33,750 made in 1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish 
IOC member Pirjo Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract 
with Great Basin Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid 
Haeggman. Mrs. Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new IOC members mentioned in the report were Phillip  
Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, who with 
their families made four visits together to the United States, in 
one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted by Welch at 
a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee on several occasions paid for IOC members to  
stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended periods of 
time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City,'' the report 
said. Others received expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas, Niagara 
Falls and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> Panel Looks at Corporate Audits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A series of high-profile corporate financial  
fiascoes have drawn the ire of stock-market regulators, who are 
putting pressure on companies to increase the power and 
independence of their audit committees. 
</P>
<P>
	A blue-ribbon panel on Monday released 10 recommendations  
designed to make sure that when audit committees sign off on a 
company's financial statements it's ``not just a rubber stamp, but 
the assurance of an oversight process,'' said John H. Biggs, the 
chairman and chief executive officer of the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association College Retirement Equities Fund, one of the 
nation's biggest pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit committee is a group within the company's board of  
directors that oversees and provides an independent check on the 
company's financial controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recommended several changes, including:  
</P>
<P>
	--Audit committees should be comprised solely of outside  
directors -- board members who are not company managers. These 
directors also would not have any family or other financial ties to 
the company or its subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least three of the directors would be required to be  
``financially literate'' and at least one would need to have 
accounting or financial management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	Several committees have come under attack in the wake of some  
serious financial blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Assisted Living Concepts Inc. told investors it  
would have to restate its earnings for 1997, most of 1998, and call 
off plans to merge with American Retirement Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Portland, Ore.-based operator of senior citizen  
housing have fallen 50 percent since the news was announced Feb. 1, 
and several investors have filed lawsuits. A call to the company 
about the operation of its audit committee was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	To give its recommendations more teeth, the panel wants the New  
York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market to make them 
requirements for listing companies with market values of $200 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit committees, under the panel's proposal, should also  
have a written charter and be required to report to shareholders -- 
in the proxy statement and annual report -- how well the committee 
fulfilled its mission in the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit committees also would have more supervision over the  
outside auditors, making sure the outside auditor doesn't have any 
other conflicting contracts with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``More often, financial market participants grapple with  
questions in a gray area where there are no easy answers,'' said 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
``It is in this realm where judgment and integrity are 
indispensable to high-quality and transparent financial 
reporting.''

<HEADLINE> Suns' Sellout Streak Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns' 347-game home sellout streak,  
the second-longest in the NBA, came to an end Tuesday night when 
about 800 tickets went unsold for a game against the Sacramento 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Streaks come and streaks go,'' Suns' owner Jerry Colangelo  
said. ``It's not the end of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns had sold out every game at America West Arena, capacity  
19,023, since the building opened in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance Tuesday night was 18.217.  
</P>
<P>
	The last Phoenix home game at which all tickets weren't sold was  
Feb. 1, 1990, when 14,143, 344 short of capacity, paid to see the 
Suns lose to the Atlanta Hawks at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls have the league's longest streak of homecourt  
sellouts at 448 games, dating to 1987. The New York Knicks are 
second with 224. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns sell nearly 17,500 season tickets and have about 3,500  
on a waiting list, but hold about 1,500 for single game sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the casualty of the lockout was the limited time we  
had to put together a marketing plan to sell the tickets,'' 
Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be a risk, and we might have to eat  
tickets from time to time,'' said Colangelo, who brought the NBA to 
Phoenix 31 years ago. ``But the fans have been so great that it 
took years for that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that there probably would be a handful of other games  
that wouldn't sell out. 
</P>
<P>
	At least, Colangelo said, people who never had a chance to see a  
game in the past now can buy tickets. He remembers the early days 
in Phoenix, when tickets were available two for the price of one at 
a local convenience store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever have to go back to 2-for-1,'' he said. ``That's a  
sign we're in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Stops Work on Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- A drug once touted for its apparent  
cancer-fighting qualities suffered a major setback Tuesday when it 
lost the backing of drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Princeton-based drug company previously had a co-agreement  
with EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md. to conduct research and 
development on the drug angiostatin. Under a new agreement 
announced Tuesday, the much smaller EntreMed will now take on all 
responsibility for laboratory research into the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, however, whether the company has the financial  
resources to continue the years of research needed to bring 
angiostatin to market. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, EntreMed 
lost $8.8 million on revenues of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach EntreMed officials for additional comment were  
not immediately successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Angiostatin, a naturally occurring protein in humans, received a  
surge of favorable publicity last May when it was featured in a 
front-page New York Times article on its possible cancer-fighting 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	According to research by Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's  
Hospital in Boston, the combination of angiostatin and the drug 
endostatin was able to shrink tumors in mice by cutting off the 
tumor's blood supply. Neither of the drugs have been tested on 
people, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Several laboratories have had difficulties reproducing the  
findings by Folkman, though other researchers said they have had 
some success with endostatin. EntreMed also has the license to 
endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers, which had $18.2 billion in 1998 sales, will end  
almost all of its laboratory study of the protein, focusing instead 
on other anticancer agents, the company said. It is retaining its 
right to reassume development and marketing rights to a drug based 
on angiostatin if further research shows it to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, angiostatin protein in its present form does not  
meet our criteria for molecules that advance to clinical trials,'' 
said Robert A. Kramer, Ph.D., vice president of Oncology Drug 
Discovery for the Princeton-based Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Children's Hospital said the change in the  
research agreement had no immediate effect on the hospital's 
working arrangement with EntreMed. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the agreement was released after the stock markets had  
closed. EntreMed's stock, which hit a high last year of $85, fell 
18 3/4 cents to $24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Bristol-Myers 
dropped $3.06 1/4 to $122.50.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Offers Refunds on Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online bookseller Amazon.com will offer  
customers refunds for all books it has recommended after receiving 
stinging criticism over the way it handles its editorial 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company also promised to tell customers when a  
publisher pays for a prominent display on its Web site following 
reports this week that it was offering publishers ``cooperative'' 
advertising packages that affected a book's placement on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying up to $10,000, a book publisher could get prominent  
display for a book on Amazon's home page, an author profile or 
interview and ``complete Amazon.com editorial review,'' the New 
York Times said. The bookseller also accepted payments for books 
placed in its ``Destined for Greatness'' section and its ``What 
We're Reading'' list. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers were not informed of the payments, a decision that  
some industry analysts said blurred the line between legitimate 
book criticism and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff  
Bezos defended the company's editorial integrity. He said that no 
book is praised unless it meets ``our standards,'' and added that 
``there is no amount of money that would cause us to feature it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Vanderbilt, an analyst at the Internet research firm  
Jupiter Communications, said taking money for product placement 
isn't unusual. It doesn't differ much from a grocery store that 
sells prominent shelf space, she said. ``It's not because the 
Safeway thinks Budweiser is a better beer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless Vanderbilt praised Amazon's change of strategy,  
``They're right in putting the customer first. That differentiates 
them from most of the other online players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several book browsers interviewed Tuesday at a Barnes &AMP; Noble  
bookstore in New York City were dismayed to hear about the 
advertising deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprises me,'' said Felicia Garcia, an administrative  
assistant from New York. ``It will make me think more about what 
books I buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of seems a little dirty,'' said Amy LaPort, an artist.  
</P>
<P>
	But Jonathan Shipman, a producer of TV commercials felt  
differently. ``It's just another form of promotion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's Web site features brief reviews from its staff of  
editors, and it also invites readers to offer their praise or 
condemnation and posts their comments for others to read. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon maintains that its editors -- not the advertisers -- have  
complete control over which books to feature on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March 1, Amazon.com will tell customers which displays  
have been paid for. In addition, the company is offering full 
refunds for any recommended book.. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how dog-eared or worn it is,'' Bezos said.  
``Even if you ripped out the pages because you thought the book was 
so bad, you can still return the pieces to us for a full refund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the company's returns policy required books to be in  
unread and new condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon has said the cooperative advertising deals are no  
different than others in the industry in which bookstores are paid 
to place prominent displays for certain books in the aisles and 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Barnes &AMP; Noble and others who charge for display  
space, Bezos said his company was being ``held to a higher standard 
than physical stores. And you know? That's the way it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's strongest online competitor, Barnesandnoble.com,  
has said it too will be offering ``cooperative'' advertising deals 
for publishers. It has promised to make clear to customers which 
displays have been paid for.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Ten more IOC members were implicated  
Tuesday in an ethics panel report that shockingly detailed the 
extreme and unethical means Salt Lake City used to land votes for 
the Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for the first time, the U.S. Olympic Committee was tied to  
the ever-widening corruption scandal by the report through a series 
of exchanges among three senior staffers involving ``promises ... 
made to secure votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Free trips to the Super Bowl, stays in ritzy Paris hotels, ski  
vacations and fistfuls of cash were among improper perks and 
payments cited in the 300-page report by an independent ethics 
panel for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch, bid committee  
president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the two universally credited for bringing the 2002  
Games to Salt Lake, even by those who divulged damning information 
about Welch and Johnson to the ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also were described as the architects of a scheme born  
on the day in 1991 that Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Games 
to Nagano, Japan, by just four votes of the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	From that day in Birmingham, England, where Welch claims to have  
turned down two offers of IOC member influence for cash, Welch and 
Johnson stretched Salt Lake's legitimate quest to win IOC member 
friends into an unethical and at times secretive mission, the 
ethics panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, Johnson and, to a lesser extent, former administrative  
officer Craig Peterson, had both a strategic and off-the-cuff 
approach for improper spending, said David Jordan, a former U.S. 
attorney on the five-member ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the bid board were not told of direct cash payments  
or details of bogus scholarships, and outside auditors failed to 
raise red flags about those expenditures, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel did not total up the amounts but the improper  
payments -- some in the form of scholarships -- exceeded $1 million. 
Another $1 million in air fare, hotel rooms and shopping sprees 
were donated to the bid committee and passed along to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Welch and Johnson were interviewed at length by the ethics  
panel, but Peterson and Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
declined to be interviewed, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch even made a wire transfer from his children's trust  
account when the wife of Siuli Paul Wallwork, the IOC member from 
Western Somoa, sought $30,000 for a friend in a serious situation. 
Welch later told a bid committee employee the money had been 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 IOC members mentioned in the report were not previously  
tied to Salt Lake's excesses. That brings the number of those 
implicated in vote-buying schemes to 24 -- roughly one-fifth of the 
IOC's total membership. Nine IOC members have been expelled or have 
resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 electronic-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It 
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network --  
the single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
The ethics panel did not have access to bank records and had no 
subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee, and  
the committee paid for his family to stay at the Intercontinental 
Hotel in Paris for 11 days in 1994 and 11 days in 1995 at $300 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also detailed eight wire transfers totaling  
$33,750 made in 1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish 
IOC member Pirjo Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract 
with Great Basin Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid 
Haeggman. Mrs. Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new IOC members mentioned in the report were Phillip  
Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, who with 
their families made four visits together to the United States, in 
one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted by Welch at 
a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee on several occasions paid for IOC members to  
stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended periods of 
time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City,'' the report 
said. Others received expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas, Niagara 
Falls and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> UBS Can't Find Buyer for 25 Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- UBS AG has failed to find a buyer for  
all 25 retail bank branches that regulators wanted it to sell as a 
condition for approval of the merger of Swiss Bank Corp. with Union 
Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's competition commission said Tuesday it will  
examine why a buyer couldn't be found and how hard the bank looked 
for a single buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	It will then decide on its next step. Possibilities include UBS  
being freed of the condition or given more time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as it looks today, it's not possible to sell the 25  
branches all at once,'' commission chairman Roland von Bueren said. 
There are interested buyers for some outlets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss regulators had given the new bank, created by last year's  
merger, until the end of March to find a buyer for all 25 branches.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Urges Payton on Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Evel Knievel called Walter Payton and  
suggested he come to Florida, saying the Chicago Bears Hall of 
Famer could get on a shorter list to receive a new liver 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said 'I don't care where you've been, who you've seen or  
what you've done. All I want is to tell you I love you and I want 
you to come down and see Dr. Ramos and LifeLink,'' Knievel said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel said Payton agreed to send blood profile information  
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, who waited eight months for his transplant, thinks  
Payton would be on a shorter wait list through Tampa-based LifeLink 
than in more highly populated areas where the wait can be up to 
three years. Payton has been told he could die within two years if 
he does not receive a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 44, was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis,  
which blocks the bile ducts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hector Ramos said how long a patient waits depends on a  
number of variables, especially degree of illness and organ match. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Duncan Bell, a LifeLink spokeswoman, said the program  
doesn't estimate how long a person may have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Knievel and Payton have O-positive blood, a common type  
which can both help and hinder donor prospects. The former because 
it improves chances for getting a liver and the latter because the 
type is shared by thousands of other people also awaiting the 
organ. He is on a national list through the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramos said he was pleased with Knievel's recovery from the Jan.  
27 surgery at Tampa General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God he's doing very well -- a little better than I  
expected him to do,'' Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Basketball Avoids Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama was spared NCAA sanctions today  
regarding accusations that a former assistant basketball coach 
tried to create a slush fund for recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the governing body of college sports said if Alabama  
commits any violations in the next five years it could face severe 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations concerned former assistant Tyrone Beaman. The  
NCAA said if any school wishes to hire him in the next four years 
it must get clearance from its infractions committee. The NCAA also 
could limit his duties at the new school. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaman was accused of seeking $5,000 from prominent boosters  
last year to illegally recruit two top prospects from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The boosters, Montgomery lawyers Charles Stakely and Truman  
Hobbs Jr., reported the request to the university. The school, in 
turn, notified the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaman, who was suspended for a time, denied wrongdoing and said  
then-head coach David Hobbs had nothing to do with any potential 
rules violations. Hobbs and his entire staff were fired after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's new coach, Mark Gottfried, had nothing to do with the  
case.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Work on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hoping to boost their  
popularity are honing a post-impeachment agenda, but they remain 
divided over tax cuts and whether to break spending limits enacted 
just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders told House GOP lawmakers at their retreat in  
Williamsburg, Va., last week that the party was lagging in the 
polls, in part due to the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
Internal GOP surveys showed voters preferring Democratic 
congressional candidates over Republicans by 46 to 39 percent, a 
Clinton approval rating of 70 percent, and Congress' disapproval at 
51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried, but everything we say right now is smothered by  
the impeachment message,'' Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who heads the 
House GOP's campaign operation, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 elections 21 months away, Davis said Republicans  
have time to correct things. But for now, he and others are warning 
colleagues that they could lose House control in next year's voting 
unless they aggressively formulate and execute a legislative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's impeachment trial of Clinton is likely to end this  
week with the president's acquittal. House GOP leaders hope to move 
quickly to budget and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Williamsburg meetings found Republicans disagreeing over  
specifics, especially when it comes to the GOP's top-tier issue of 
cutting taxes, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blow to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,  
R-Ohio, many Republicans voiced opposition to his plan for cutting 
income-tax rates by 10 percent across the board. Some complained 
that the proposal would be an easy target for Democrats arguing 
that Republicans were helping the rich, since better off taxpayers 
would benefit most because they pay higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservatives prefer eliminating the so-called marriage  
penalty, under which millions of married people pay higher taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense that for an across-the-board reduction in  
rates, there's not a lot of support for that,'' said Rep. Jerry 
Weller, R-Ill., a sponsor of legislation to end the marriage 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some moderates and conservatives prefer holding off on tax cuts  
and using the projected flood of annual budget surpluses to reduce 
the accumulated $5.6 trillion national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public understands this,'' said moderate Rep. Fred Upton,  
R-Mich. ``They don't want to see us spend the surplus away; they 
don't want to see it all on tax cuts either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across-the-board tax cuts have been endorsed by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	But key segments of the GOP's base prefer more-targeted  
alternatives. Small business and farmers would like elimination of 
estate taxes, while religious conservatives favor eliminating the 
marriage penalty. Leaders of the Family Research Council and other 
social conservative groups planned a news conference for today 
touting elimination of the marriage penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Pew poll last month, when people were asked what  
to do with the surplus, 50 percent favored using it for Social 
Security, 21 percent favored using it for domestic spending, 14 
percent favored tax cuts, 12 percent preferred paying off the 
national debt and 3 percent didn't answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, a potential GOP presidential candidate, hopes his  
committee will vote on a 2000 budget by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute also rages over whether to exceed spending limits  
enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing pact with President Clinton. 
That agreement set a $536 billion limit for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for this year ended up nearly $30 billion above that  
amount. That plus both parties' desires to boost defense and maybe 
education spending next year is pressuring lawmakers to exceed that 
cap -- a tough spot for a GOP that for years has insisted on cutting 
spending and shrinking government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's where the budget hawks and defense hawks kind of run into  
one another,'' said Rep. Robert Ehrlich, R-Md.

<HEADLINE> `Closed' Senate Debate Unusual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Senate rules require that impeachment  
trial deliberations be held behind closed doors, many momentous 
Senate debates have taken place in open session, including the 
decision to declare war after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 
December 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, from 1943 to 1963, the Senate had no closed sessions,  
Senate historian Richard Baker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just didn't feel a need for them,'' Baker said.  
``Generally a closed session -- with the glaring exception of the 
impeachment trial -- has been held only when there's national 
security-classified information they need to discuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debates on the formation of the League of Nations and the  
United Nations were held in open session, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate on Arms control treaties have been public, and most of  
the debate on the Panama Canal Treaty was open, except for two days 
in February 1978 when senators discussed allegations of corruption 
on the part of Panama's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the impeachment trial, the last big issue the Senate  
discussed in private was the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty in 
April 1997. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, banned 
the use, development, production and stockpiling of all chemical 
warfare agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate convened in private to hear reports from the war  
fronts on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8 in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	The next closed session didn't take place until April 1963, when  
the Senate assembled to discuss the $196 million Nike-Zeus missile 
production program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Military hardware in particular seems to trigger closed  
sessions, particularly during the Cold War era in the 1960s and 
1970s,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussion of the neutron bomb in July 1977 was closed.  
</P>
<P>
	Suggestions that a particular subject be discussed in closed  
session usually prompt a little scurrying around because closed 
sessions happen so rarely, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to figure out how to do it,'' he said. ``Every time  
it comes up, it's sort of a big deal because they haven't done it 
for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of the Senate, however, members assumed that  
most of their business would be conducted behind closed doors. 
Until 1929, the Senate discussed all treaties and nominations in 
closed session.

<HEADLINE> Gates' E-Mail Used at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government used a blunt e-mail from  
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to challenge a witness who insisted 
Tuesday that the company did ``absolutely not'' offer money to 
Intuit Inc. to distribute Microsoft's Internet browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	William Poole, who negotiated some of Microsoft's Internet  
deals, testified that it never offered executives at Intuit any 
money to distribute its browsers over one from rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, whose popular Quicken financial software is used by  
roughly 10 million people, agreed in June 1997 to give away 
Microsoft's browser, not Netscape's, with Quicken. In exchange, 
Microsoft gave Intuit prominent placement of its finance services 
within the Windows computer operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges the deal is an example of illegal  
exclusionary agreements that Microsoft brandished as part of its 
campaign to ``crush'' rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous interviews with government lawyers, Gates dismissed  
the Intuit deal, saying it ``certainly wasn't something that could 
have been very significant to me because I don't have a 
recollection of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies cited a July 1996 e-mail  
printout from Gates again Tuesday describing a conversation with 
Scott Cook, Intuit's founder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates wrote that he was ``quite frank with him that if he had a  
favor we could do for him that would cost us something like $1 
million, to do that in return for switching browsers in the next 
few months I would be open to doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poole testified previously he hadn't seen the Gates e-mail, but  
acknowledged he had no reason to doubt it was true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are you going to believe?'' Boies asked reporters outside  
the courtroom. ``Your own eyes, or what they say?'' Boies on Monday 
described the Gates offer as ``in economic terms, a bribe, an 
inducement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft explained that Intuit was already working with  
Netscape in 1996 and said Gates was merely offering financial help 
to cover its costs in switching technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any discrepancy at all,'' Microsoft  
spokesman Mark Murray said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit's chief executive officer, William Harris, testified  
previously for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole portrayed Microsoft's Internet agreements Tuesday as  
``very common among many different industries,'' and called them 
exclusive ``only in the broadest sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He compared them, for example, with agreements between The Walt  
Disney Co. and McDonald's Corp. to promote movies with hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't find Disney characters in Burger King kids' meals,''  
Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies also confronted Poole with e-mail from Disney complaining  
in October 1997 about restrictions that Microsoft had placed on its 
business deals with Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	In the e-mail, a Disney executive wrote: ``We are being roughed  
up by the 1,000-pound gorilla of the industry.'' Microsoft was 
upset that Disney had allowed Netscape to use its familiar mouse 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it somewhat ironic that the King Kong of content would  
be worried about a 1,000-pound gorilla,'' Poole shot back. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, now in its 15th week, could be due for a lengthy  
recess next month. The case originally was expected to take six to 
eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting with lawyers, U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson indicated he will call a break to allow 
Microsoft's lead attorney to keep his vacation plans and to permit 
Boies to attend another previously scheduled trial, expected to 
last two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge told lawyers not to talk about it with reporters,  
according to a transcript of the meeting at the close of court 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply tell them that you have no comment about it because I  
have not made any definitive determination yet, other than the fact 
that you'll get your vacation,'' the judge told Microsoft lawyer 
John Warden. ``And Mr. Boies will get to Philadelphia by March 
15.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Discusses Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates used lucrative  
incentives to help clinch deals with companies that promised to 
promote Microsoft's Internet browser and drop the one made by rival 
Netscape, a Microsoft manager admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates urged his executives to use such inducements to help  
encourage widespread use of the company's then-emerging browser, 
said William Poole, Microsoft's director of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was sort of the high-level message from Mr. Gates,''  
Poole testified Monday during Microsoft's antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The incentives, characterized as a bribe by Justice Department  
attorney David Boies, came up in an e-mail Gates wrote to his 
executives about his talks with Intuit founder Scott Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do  
for him that would cost us something like $1 million to do that in 
return for switching browsers in the next few months I would be 
open to doing that,'' Gates said in the July 1996 memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, which makes the popular financial software Quicken,  
signed a deal with Microsoft the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies used the memo to demonstrate how the software giant  
allegedly took advantage of its monopoly power to crush its 
competition. The government contends Microsoft often used illegal 
tactics to discourage clients from distributing the browser made by 
Netscape, which once dominated the Internet software business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cameron Myhrvold, vice president of Microsoft's Internet  
customer unit, scheduled to be the next witness called by the 
company, said Netscape lost the browser war because of poor 
business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony released Monday, Myhrvold said Netscape  
made ``a number of strategic mistakes'' over the past few years 
that decreased its browser's popularity. It originally charged too 
much for the software, which Microsoft gave away for free. Netscape 
also failed to maintain its reputation for cutting-edge technology, 
said Myhrvold, who could take the witness stand as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, during his cross-examination, was questioned about his  
role in securing the Intuit deal. The negotiations were structured 
around the Windows ``channel bar,'' a list of prominent Internet 
sites that appears when a computer using Windows is turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit was offered a prime spot on the channel bar in a contract  
that prohibited the company from promoting Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit President and Chief Executive Officer William Harris  
testified earlier in the trial about learning ``that any such 
agreement would require, as a condition, that Inuit forgo any 
business relationships with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said Intuit agreed to the restriction because a place on  
the Windows desktop was ``very important to them.'' The spot would 
help provide access to millions of computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said the exclusionary contract was not much different from  
those signed between major businesses in other industries.

<HEADLINE> Can We Afford To Lose Broadcast TV? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There is a shadow on the land: The future of  
broadcast television is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The big networks, whose shows are intended for mass consumption,  
are increasingly losing ground to cable channels and fledgling 
networks willing to settle for a small, targeted piece of the TV 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``narrowcasting'' pleases advertisers, allowing them to  
zero in on the exclusive club of 12- to 18-year-olds shopping for 
acne creams or young adults yearning for a new VW Bug. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, NBC and CBS, which have made a royal living off the public  
airwaves for generations, put on a brave face as they watch viewers 
defect and profits fall. They will make a stand for programming 
that serves the entire country, they say, as newcomers like WB 
sneak off to spoon with the younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a child of broadcast television, I felt knee-jerk dismay  
at the prospect of the end of the communal viewing experience. 
There goes the family gathered for ``The Waltons''; there goes the 
joy of recounting ``Seinfeld'' jokes in the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, there is shared viewing on cable as well, and some  
cable fare, including sports or major news events, may draw a 
fairly big audience. But even high-rated cable programs reach only 
around 6 million homes; broadcast's top show, ``ER'' on NBC, is 
seen in closer to 19 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' may be the last widely popular series for any broadcast  
network, observers say, and its audience share is a fraction of 
what a hit network show used to get in the days before cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Say it ain't so; stethoscopes and I.V.s danced in front of my  
eyes as I began to hyperventilate. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as if slapped with a copy of TV Guide, I came to my  
senses. What exactly are we worried about preserving here? 
</P>
<P>
	To be accurate, I was hit with the TV Guide Awards show -- after  
being pummeled by the Super Bowl Commercial Extravaganza. These are 
the kind of ``event'' programs broadcasters consider one road to 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
	They are also the kind of startlingly mediocre, even offensive  
programs that could make me a believer in electronic euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
	Start with TV Guide's new entry among the glut of awards  
programs honoring any person, place or thing to ever act, sing or 
create really swell needlepoint. Lots of us watch 'em, so networks 
are delighted to air them. But in the larger scheme of things, do 
they really have any lasting importance? 
</P>
<P>
	TV Guide's effort was the bottom of the barrel. Featuring such  
highlights as a self-promoting display of years of TV Guide covers, 
it seemed to be as much an ordeal for the celebrities involved as 
for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	You got the impression that actors had to attend, or forfeit any  
hope of future TV Guide magazine publicity. David Duchovny (``The 
X-Files'') looked underwhelmed by his favorite dramatic actor 
award, and co-host French Stewart (``3rd Rock From the Sun') 
appeared to be weighing a change in representation. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was, at least, not crass. Not so with the Super Bowl,  
which helped broadcast television move the good-taste goal post 
back more than a few yards, toward cable TV territory. 
</P>
<P>
	There were violent and sexy World Wrestling Federation  
commercials, which two TV watchdog groups called inappropriate for 
a show with broad family appeal. Other sponsors' lighthearted 
commercials showed a piano crushing an elderly woman to death and a 
man sniffing a dog's tail end. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not ``South Park'' gross, but close enough.  
</P>
<P>
	Granted, both the awards show and Super Bowl were on Fox, which  
has long cultivated a raucous image and young audience-- but which 
has tried to stretch in recent years into more of a full-service 
broadcaster offering sports and news. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast landscape in general, however, is bleak, dotted  
with a few good series but mostly filled with unfunny, ethnically 
segregated sitcoms; mawkish movies; cloned news magazines and talk 
shows; and, increasingly, cheap reality shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of many programs also has drawn criticism: Critics  
have said TV sends questionable messages to young viewers by 
heavily emphasizing sex in early-evening shows. 
</P>
<P>
	If broadcasters are spurning a tradition of family viewing, they  
also are easing away from another longtime role. With the rise of 
cable news channels like CNN and CNBC, networks feel less compelled 
to provide intensive coverage of major news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	In a world of alternative TV sources via cable and satellite,  
however, broadcasting still has a role to play. According to 
Nielsen Media Research, nearly one-third of American homes -- 32.6 
percent -- are without cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people don't want it or don't have access to it; others,  
undoubtedly, can't afford it. It is up to the networks to serve 
these viewers with news and entertainment that doesn't demean them. 
Worthy as it is, PBS can't shoulder the entire job. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about broadcasting's role as a kind of national  
campfire? 
</P>
<P>
	I could wax sentimental about this, given my childhood memories  
of Sunday nights with my family and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' You 
only get to discover the Beatles once, and we did it together. 
</P>
<P>
	I have even warmer thoughts, however, of vacations, ball games  
and heated dinner table debates -- the kind of activities where we 
actually talked to each other and didn't rely on television to lead 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Labalme, executive director of TV-Free America, which  
encourages people to curtail their TV viewing, suggests we have 
falsely romanticized broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the shared viewing experience was a myth, to some  
extent. ... A sort of Norman Rockwell-ish portrait of the American 
family that maybe existed for a brief period,'' Labalme said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, he said, the TV industry ``has tried to  
segment the audience so they could sell it to the various sponsors. 
... It's just gotten more so now with the proliferation of 
channels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those office water-cooler sessions that revolve around  
television are just as suspect. Despite lamentations about the 
``Balkanization'' of America into tiny special interest groups, we 
must have something left to share besides television. 
</P>
<P>
	How about those Mets? The Y2K bug? The future of Social  
Security? The kids? 
</P>
<P>
	If our only common ground is Jerry Seinfeld and Drew Carey,  
there's more to worry about than the future of broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Which could very well be the case, according to one media  
expert. Popular culture is the glue that holds a nation together, 
said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of 
Popular Television at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a mass touchstone, whether television or a substitute,  
America's future as a nation could be in doubt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When technology is so sophisticated that it can serve  
audiences so specifically, are we ultimately going to have a 
situation that governing a population that big and that diverse 
under one federal body is going to be impossible?'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Save broadcast TV, save ourselves? Sounds like a Faustian  
bargain.

	Home Shopping Net, Lycos To Merge  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc. is merging its Home Shopping  
Network and other properties with Lycos Inc., the popular World 
Wide Web destination, in a deal that creates a formidable new 
Internet company. The merger is the latest seeking to combine the 
strengths of an established Internet company with a television 
network to entice more people to visit the World Wide Web. The new 
company will advertise its Web services on USA Networks' cable TV 
shows, and Lycos' Web sites will include ads for TV. USA Networks 
will also merge its Ticketmaster operation with Lycos. Shares in 
Lycos fell 33 to 94 1/4. USA Networks shares rose 3 11/16 to 41 5/8.

benefited from inside information about problems with two popular 
diet drugs that were later recalled. The class-action suit had 
alleged that AHP hid the troubles with Redux and Pondimin while the 
executives sold nearly $25 million in stock. AHP shares fell 1 1/2 to

	Nike Pulls Ad After Complaint  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nike plans to drop a television commercial that  
showed an in-line skater racing a train, because a congressman 
complained the ad might encourage youths to try the risky maneuver. 
Nike spokesman Scott Reames said Monday the ad was intended to be 
fantasy and wasn't meant to encourage reckless behavior. The 
commercial, which began running Jan. 1, won't be extended past this 
week, largely in response to a complaint by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, 
D-Ohio, who wrote to Nike President Tom Clark. Nike shares fell 1/4

	Gates' E-Mail Used at Trial

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government used a blunt e-mail from  
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to challenge a witness who insisted 
that the company did ``absolutely not'' offer money to Intuit Inc. 
to distribute Microsoft's Internet browser software. William Poole, 
who negotiated some of Microsoft's Internet deals, testified that 
it never offered executives at Intuit any money to distribute its 
browsers over one from rival Netscape Communications Corp. A July 
1996 e-mail printout from Gates decribed a conversation with Scott 
Cook, Intuit's founder. Gates wrote that he was ``quite frank with 
him that if he had a favor we could do for him that would cost us 
something like $1 million, to do that in return for switching 
browsers in the next few months I would be open to doing that.''

	Burst of Productivity Should Extend  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of productivity at the end of 1998  
suggests the economy can continue to have its cake and eat it, too 
-- grow robustly with low inflation -- for a while longer. Output per 
hour of work by nonfarm, nonsupervisory employees increased a 
healthy 2.2 percent last year, the Labor Department said. During 
the final three months of the year, productivity surged at a 3.7 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate, the biggest advance since 
the first three months of 1996.

	Is Y2K More Urgent Than Disclosed?  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corporate America has fallen far behind in  
disclosing its readiness for the Year 2000 and how much the 
preparations and computer upgrades have been costing, the chief 
accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission said. A check 
of financial reports that publicly traded companies must submit to 
the SEC shows that ``many companies are still not complying'' with 
Year 2000 disclosure requirements, Lynn Turner said at a conference

<HEADLINE> Strength of Grip May Predict Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A firm handshake may make a good first  
impression, but its real importance might not be felt for years. 
</P>
<P>
	A study found that middle-aged men with strong grips are less  
likely to develop disabilities in old age. 
</P>
<P>
	Good muscle strength in middle age can give people a margin of  
safety in later years, when they may face long periods of 
inactivity after surgery or illness, the researchers said in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study followed 3,218 men over a 25-year period, beginning in  
1965, when they were 45 to 68. 
</P>
<P>
	At the final exam, researchers timed the men's walking speed and  
checked their ability to rise from a chair. Researchers also asked 
the participants whether they had any trouble doing day-to-day 
tasks such as raking leaves, climbing a flight of stairs or caring 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-third with the weakest grips at midlife were twice as  
likely to have problems caring for themselves as those in the upper 
third. They were also significantly more likely to have problems 
with household chores and walking.

<HEADLINE> ACC Chief Urges Auburn Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Because Auburn canceled its game with  
Florida State, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner says that 
maybe the Tigers shouldn't play against any of his nine schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Auburn athletic director David Housel, ACC  
commissioner John Swofford wrote, ``If this is the way Auburn 
University is going to conduct its business, I feel it is my 
obligation as conference commissioner to ask all of our member 
institutions to seriously evaluate whether it makes sense to 
schedule Auburn in any sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel obtained a copy of Swofford's letter.  
</P>
<P>
	Housel said Auburn received the letter before making the  
decision to cancel the game, but did not elaborate. Reached at home 
Monday night, he said he ``would have no comment'' on the memo. 
Auburn is a member of the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford called it ``absolutely reprehensible that a university  
the stature of Auburn would ever consider canceling a contracted 
football game that has been scheduled for national television less 
than seven months prior to kickoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn isn't the only team canceling games against ACC schools.  
Kent University, who is in the Mid-American Conference, recently 
backed out of a deal to play North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent athletic director Lang Kennedy said the Golden Flashes  
entered into a contract with the Tar Heels in 1994, but recently 
decided it would be better for their program if they scheduled 
teams closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels said they didn't learn that Kent planned to play  
Pittsburgh instead on Sept. 18 until mid-January -- after the Golden 
Flashes published their 1999 football schedule. North Carolina is 
looking for an opponent to replace Kent. 
</P>
<P>
	There is at least one ACC football team scheduled to play  
Auburn. Clemson and Auburn hold contracts for four games from 2005 
through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson associate athletic director Dwight Rainey said Sunday he  
didn't foresee the series being dropped, ``but there may be some 
slight changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey said Clemson coach Tommy Bowden was supposed to meet with  
Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville during a trip last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's brother, Terry, resigned as Auburn coach in the middle  
of last season. Last week, Auburn bought out its game next season 
with Florida State and its coach, Bobby Bowden, who is Tommy and 
Terry's father. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a Tommy Bowden thing, it's a Clemson-Auburn  
thing,'' Rainey said in Monday's The Greenville News. ``Are we 
against playing Auburn? No, we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey said it may take six months to a year to resolve any  
Clemson concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as other games against Florida State go, the Seminoles  
are scheduled to return a basketball game to Auburn next year, and 
coach Steve Robinson indicated last week he planned to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Sept. 2 season opener against Florida State was  
scheduled to be televised on ESPN. Under the contract, Auburn had 
to buy out the game contract with $500,000 to Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford, who express-mailed the letter to Housel before Auburn  
made a final decision on canceling the game, said the ACC will 
demand an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league will lose if 
the Seminoles are unable to find an opponent suitable for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just cannot conduct business this way,'' Swofford wrote.  
``It damages the entire enterprise of intercollegiate athletics. It 
is simply wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Monday, Florida State athletic director Dave Hart  
began making phone calls to conferences and schools across the 
country, searching for an opponent. Pickings are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from eight major conferences -- SEC, Big Ten, Big 12,  
Pac-10, Big East, Mid-American, WAC and Conference USA -- said all 
their teams' schedules were completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult,'' said Hart, adding that Florida State's  
Thursday night slot on ESPN was all but dead. ``Because of the 
calendar ... it goes without saying we're very short on time. We're 
up against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SEC commissioner Roy Kramer said Monday night he was unaware of  
Swofford's memo and had no comment on it.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Maz Returns As Instructor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates are taking one of the  
most famous numbers in their history -- Bill Mazeroski's No. 9 -- out 
of retirement for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski, one of the best fielding second basemen in major  
league history, will work with infielders from Feb. 24 until March 
8 at the Pirates' camp in Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time Gold Glove winner at second base, Mazeroski, 62,  
is best remembered for his Game 7 home run to beat the New York 
Yankees in the 1960 World Series. It is the only game-ending homer 
to win a World Series Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	A seven-time All-Star during his 17-year career from 1956-72,  
Mazeroski still holds numerous major league fielding records for 
assists and double plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski lives in Greensburg, Pa., near Pittsburgh, but spends  
most of the winter in Florida.

<HEADLINE> German Metalworking Talks Break Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Contract negotiations broke off  
between a German metalworkers union and employers Tuesday -- the day 
before a deadline that could bring crippling strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	No new talks were scheduled, and the powerful IG Metall union,  
which represents millions of workers, had set a deadline of 
midnight Wednesday for agreement. The union said it would call a 
strike vote after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were too far apart,'' employers' representative Klaus  
Fritsche said after the talks broke off in Baden-Wuerttemberg 
state, home to auto giant Daimler-Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are aware of the danger of a fight and will still try to  
avoid it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Fritsche had said the employers were prepared to  
increase their 2.3 percent pay raise offer, but first wanted to 
know how much the union was willing to decrease its demand of a 6.5 
percent raise. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall regional leader Berthold Huber said the union would  
not discuss lowering its demand until the employers made a new 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say giving in to the union's demands would cost jobs  
at a time of slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Labor Office reported Tuesday that unemployment for  
January rose to 11.5 percent, from 10.9 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says that after years of modest wage increases,  
workers should receive a greater share of the increased profits 
reported by many German companies last year. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall represents about 3.4 million metal and electrical  
workers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major strike in the nation's metal industry was in  
1984, when six weeks of walkouts virtually shut down then-West 
Germany's auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Federal Nuclear Unit Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported  
Tuesday that it has made the necessary adjustments in its computer 
systems to avert any problems in dealing with the Y2K problem at 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it has made the necessary changes or replaced 88  
computer systems used by the NRC to avert any problems caused with 
the so-called millennium bug at the beginning of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions addressed computers used by the agency for such  
things as nuclear plant data collection, communications, security 
at agency buildings and operation of its Emergency Response Center. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the computer systems involved actual operation of  
nuclear power plants were covered by the readiness report. 
Individual utilities continue to address needed computer software 
changes at their power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The North American Reliability Council recently said that  
utilities are spending more than $2 billion to test and prepare 
their computers and replace software to deal with the Y2K problem, 
which is expected to cause computers to read the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gent, the reliability council's president, said so far  
``no Y2K problem has been found that would prevent any safety 
system from shutting down a (nuclear) plant in an emergency.'' More 
tests are being conducted, however.

<HEADLINE> Senate Begins Clinton Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate shut its doors Tuesday to debate  
its verdict on the impeachment of Bill Clinton, with the outcome so 
evident that one Republican said ``bipartisan acquittal'' was 
possible by week's end for the second president in history to be 
put on trial for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	After a month and a day spent listening in silence to opposing  
legal arguments, senators began their private deliberations in 
midafternoon in a Senate chamber cleared of House prosecutors, 
presidential lawyers and gallery spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
his efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators spoke from a lectern in the well of the Senate as the  
deliberations unfolded, according to congressional officials. 
Republicans used a sign-up list, while Democrats went by order of 
seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the first to speak were Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas  
and Slade Gorton of Washington as well as Democrats Edward M. 
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. The 
Senate's senior Democrat, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has 
suggested he could vote either way, chose to wait rather than claim 
the right to speak first among lawmakers in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate rules, lawmakers may deliberate for up to 25 hours,  
with 15 minutes allotted to each senator to speak. Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., preached the virtue of brevity, noting that 
Lincoln's Gettysburg address lasted but three minutes and John F. 
Kennedy's famed inaugural address scarcely seven. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort led by Democrats and Texas Republican Kay Bailey  
Hutchison to open the proceedings failed -- it gained a 59-41 
majority but that was short of the two-thirds needed -- with the GOP 
leadership helping to stiffen the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed-door deliberations are more conducive to thoughtful  
exchanges, said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``Sometimes a discussion 
breaks out. If it's in closed session, you will see more of a 
dialogue. If there's going to be any persuasion it's only going to 
be in closed session.'' Despite his remarks, Kyl voted to open the 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that we won't just have speeches and we will have  
deliberations,'' said Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator said he hoped that by closing the  
deliberations the Senate would be able to engage in a candid, 
nonpartisan discussion of a proposal to censure Clinton after his 
presumed acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have been leading the censure effort, with the support  
of a small number of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, lent her support during the day. A  
spokesman said she had succeeded in inserting language in a 
proposal under consideration to make it clear that Clinton would be 
treated like any other citizen after he leaves office -- a time when 
the government decides whether to prosecute him for any alleged 
crime -- and expressing the hope that no future Congress would 
rescind the censure. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said many  
GOP senators oppose censure, but he said he might be receptive as a 
way of dousing any plans for celebration at the White House. ``What 
we could end up having by the end of the week is a bipartisan 
acquittal, which I'm afraid could lead to a good deal of 
celebrating downtown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart has already declared that  
the White House will be a ``gloat-free zone'' after the Senate 
takes its votes. Republicans, in particular, were offended by 
Clinton's campaign-style appearance at the White House with 
Democratic lawmakers hours after the House voted last December to 
impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	With one or two possible exceptions, the Senate's 45 Democrats  
are expected to vote for Clinton's acquittal on both charges -- 
perjury and obstruction of justice. Most of the 55 Republicans are 
expected to vote for conviction, although several GOP senators have 
said in recent days the article of impeachment alleging perjury, in 
particular, could fail to achieve a majority vote. That would mean 
at least six Republicans voting for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the historic trial only days away, Republicans  
moved to tie up loose ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott dispatched a letter to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
containing what Republican officials said was information about a 
possible White House taping system that might have picked up 
telephone conversations between Clinton and Lewinsky. ``All I've 
done is make available information sent to me,'' Lott told 
reporters. He said he has had that information for about a week and 
discussed it with the GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart has denied the existence of  
such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., sought permission to have the Senate  
issue subpoenas for three individuals who have cast doubt on trial 
testimony given last week by White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Leader Tom Daschle objected, however. Republicans,  
who are eager to wrap up the trial without further political 
damage, let the matter die rather than demand a vote by the full 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Blumenthal denied that he had passed to the  
news media Clinton's false account from January 1998 about his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife  
signed affidavits stating that Blumenthal told them the former 
White House intern was a Clinton ``stalker.'' Journalist Scott 
Armstrong signed an affidavit Monday saying he was told by Hitchens 
and his wife, Carol Blue, about their conversation with Blumenthal 
and the ``stalker'' comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter sought subpoenas for Hitchens, Ms. Blue and Armstrong,  
as well as for Blumenthal to allow exploration of ``possible fraud 
on the Senate by alleged perjury'' on the part of the White House 
aide.

<HEADLINE>  Vanity Fair Talks To Blanchett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't worry -- Cate Blanchett won't be offended  
if you think she's not beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go ahead. Say it. I've looked ugly. That's O.K. ... I'm not  
opposed to looking what is commonly termed as ugly,'' she says in 
the March issue of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest compliment I think I've ever had was when another  
actor said I had `an actor's face' ... I'm as vain as the next

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Questioned on 2nd Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government raised questions Tuesday about  
a second video demonstration that Microsoft Corp. showed the judge 
at its antitrust trial, a sensitive issue for the company after its 
embarrassment last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledged Tuesday that two laptop computers used in  
a side-by-side Internet comparison were equipped with modems 
working at different speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said the impact on its test was negligible  
because one modem was working less than 3 percent faster than the 
other and because most of its demonstration took place offline. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft calculated that the difference accounted for 22  
seconds out of its 13-minute demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another red herring for the government,'' company  
spokesman Mark Murray said. ``It just shows how threadbare their 
case is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Microsoft suffered a debacle over questions about  
another of its demonstrations after acknowledging it had edited 
together video segments of several different computers so it 
appeared a single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge called that admission ``very troubling'' but allowed  
Microsoft to recreate its demonstration overnight with government 
lawyers watching. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
didn't comment on the company's video problem Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies raised the issue without  
much fanfare on an otherwise unremarkable day of testimony while 
questioning Cameron Myhrvold, a vice president at Microsoft who 
negotiated many of its contracts with Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the video, played in court as Myhrvold took the witness  
stand, Microsoft sought to demonstrate how newer versions of its 
computer operating system allow consumers to open an online account 
and begin using the Internet more quickly because the technology is 
built into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure took about five minutes using Windows 98 but  
almost three times as long using the company's much older Windows 
3.1. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies pressed Myhrvold on whether both computers used modems  
working at the same speed, which could influence results. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said afterward that Windows 98 actually connected to  
its so-called Internet Referral Server at 33,600 bits per second -- 
the server's top speed -- while the older Windows connected at 
28,800 bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, now in its 15th week, could be due for a lengthy  
recess next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting with lawyers, the judge indicated he will  
call a break to allow Microsoft's lead outside attorney to keep his 
vacation plans and to permit Boies to attend another previously 
scheduled trial, expected to last two to three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mom Is Big Fan on Clinton Aide Ruff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- White House counsel Charles Ruff's dramatic  
closing argument in President Clinton's impeachment trial got rave 
reviews from a special fan: his mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a sense of drama that's extraordinary,''  
Margaret Carson told The New York Times. ``Laurence Olivier 
couldn't do it any better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Leonard Bernstein's longtime press agent, Mrs. Carson  
understands dramatic flair and exposed her son early to a variety 
of influences. He went to his first opera when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carson wasn't surprised when Ruff, during his closing  
statement before the Senate Monday, referred to Iago's use of a 
handkerchief to betray Desdemona. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friends called and said, `I see Chuck is quoting  
Shakespeare,''' Mrs. Carson said. ``I said that I didn't think he 
was referring to Shakespeare. I think he was referring to Verdi. 
Because he knows the opera `Otello.'''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Discusses Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates used lucrative  
incentives to help clinch deals with companies that promised to 
promote Microsoft's Internet browser and drop the one made by rival 
Netscape, a Microsoft manager admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates urged his executives to use such inducements to help  
encourage widespread use of the company's then-emerging browser, 
said William Poole, Microsoft's director of business development. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was sort of the high-level message from Mr. Gates,''  
Poole testified Monday during Microsoft's antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The incentives, characterized as a bribe by Justice Department  
attorney David Boies, came up in an e-mail Gates wrote to his 
executives about his talks with Intuit founder Scott Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do  
for him that would cost us something like $1 million to do that in 
return for switching browsers in the next few months I would be 
open to doing that,'' Gates said in the July 1996 memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, which makes the popular financial software Quicken,  
signed a deal with Microsoft the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies used the memo to demonstrate how the software giant  
allegedly took advantage of its monopoly power to crush its 
competition. The government contends Microsoft often used illegal 
tactics to discourage clients from distributing the browser made by 
Netscape, which once dominated the Internet software business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cameron Myhrvold, vice president of Microsoft's Internet  
customer unit, scheduled to be the next witness called by the 
company, said Netscape lost the browser war because of poor 
business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In written testimony released Monday, Myhrvold said Netscape  
made ``a number of strategic mistakes'' over the past few years 
that decreased its browser's popularity. It originally charged too 
much for the software, which Microsoft gave away for free. Netscape 
also failed to maintain its reputation for cutting-edge technology, 
said Myhrvold, who could take the witness stand as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, during his cross-examination, was questioned about his  
role in securing the Intuit deal. The negotiations were structured 
around the Windows ``channel bar,'' a list of prominent Internet 
sites that appears when a computer using Windows is turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit was offered a prime spot on the channel bar in a contract  
that prohibited the company from promoting Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit President and Chief Executive Officer William Harris  
testified earlier in the trial about learning ``that any such 
agreement would require, as a condition, that Inuit forgo any 
business relationships with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said Intuit agreed to the restriction because a place on  
the Windows desktop was ``very important to them.'' The spot would 
help provide access to millions of computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said the exclusionary contract was not much different from  
those signed between major businesses in other industries.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV Price Controls To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cable rates are set to be deregulated next  
month and the Clinton administration won't try to stop that from 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's existing price controls  
on cable TV end, or ``sunset,'' on March 31 under a 1996 
telecommunications law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will let it set as of March 31,'' Commerce Secretary  
William Daley told reporters Monday at a briefing on the law, 
enacted three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the price of the most basic level of cable service, which  
consists of broadcast and a few cable channels, will continue to be 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the administration supports the scheduled  
sunset of cable price regulation,'' said National Cable Television 
Association President Decker Anstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry opposes regulating prices beyond March 31,  
saying it would halt investment in new services -- such as 
high-speed Internet access and digital TV -- and discourage 
companies from adding new channels. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups were disappointed by Daley's comments. ``The  
administration is doing nothing to challenge skyrocketing prices 
charged by cable monopolists,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of 
the Consumers Union's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration will keep a close eye on cable  
rates after the price controls are lifted. ``We will watch it. We 
will not let anyone take advantage ... and gouge consumers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable prices have increased 21 percent since the law's  
enactment, while overall inflation has risen 6 percent during the 
same period, consumer groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry says that with each rate increase, customers have  
gotten more channels, improved service and better picture and sound 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress set the expiration date with the hope that competition  
for cable would materialize and make continued price regulation 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups don't believe that sufficient competition  
for cable has developed to keep rates in check and have asked 
Congress to stop the scheduled deregulation. Their efforts haven't 
gained momentum on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry says competition is growing from satellite  
providers, phone companies and municipally owned cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration is encouraged by cable industry  
statements that ``they plan to keep their rates somewhat under 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry says rates are unlikely to spike higher after  
they are deregulated by the government. Anstrom has said increases 
could be in the 4 percent to 5 percent range, compared with the 
average 7 percent increases seen in 1997 and part of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases reflect cable companies' increased business  
costs, including programming, upgrading cable TV systems and labor 
costs.

<HEADLINE> Senators Fail in Bid To Open Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate shut its doors to the public  
Tuesday for final deliberations in President Clinton's impeachment 
trial, but only after a pair of votes that threatened to disrupt 
the well-laid plans for the trial's end. 
</P>
<P>
	A 59-41 vote to change the rules and open the final discussions  
to the public was eight votes short of the two-thirds majority 
required. All 45 Democrats and 14 Republicans voted in favor of 
open debate, arguing that their constituents had a right to know 
how their senators reached conclusions on whether to convict or 
acquit the president on impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Their motion was opposed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott  
and other Republicans who said that as jurors in a trial their 
deliberations should be in private, and that a closed session would 
make for better debate and less grandstanding before the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberations in the trial of Andrew Johnson, the only other  
president to be impeached, were closed and remain sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota  
then offered a compromise to the open-debate supporters, winning 
acceptance of a motion that would allow senators, if they so 
choose, to print their statements made during the deliberations in 
the Congressional Record after the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-debate side made one more move, forcing another vote on  
approving the closing of the doors. Under a ruling by the 
parliamentarian read by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the 
failure to get a majority 51 votes would have resulted in final 
deliberations being canceled and the Senate going directly to votes 
on conviction or acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid that, all Republicans except Sens. Kay Bailey  
Hutchison, R-Texas, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., backed the closed 
debate in a 53-47 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have had a little bit of a stalemate,'' if that  
motion had been defeated, said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a leader in 
the drive to make the debate public. He said that would have forced 
reconsideration of their main objective of opening up the 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Wis., said the compromise allowing later  
publication of statements was ``a very poor substitute'' that 
``represents a great leap sideways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a representative democracy it's terribly important,'' he  
said, ``that these deliberations not be behind closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the doors were closed, Lott reminded his colleagues that  
if the 100 senators each took the 15 minutes allowed for remarks, 
the deliberations would take at least 25 hours. With most members 
having made up their minds and acquittal a near certainty, he urged 
succinctness, pointing out that the Gettysburg Address was 
delivered in less than three minutes and President Kennedy's 
inaugural address in less than seven minutes.

<HEADLINE> Browns Load Up on Linemen, DBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns showed their football  
smarts in the NFL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing within the rules established by the league, they picked  
37 players -- only one older than 30 years old -- but used up only 
$18.062 million in salary cap room, leaving them with $39 million 
to spend in the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	They stocked their offensive line with a mixture of youngsters  
and proven veterans, big guys who can protect a quarterback like 
Tim Couch or open holes for a running back like Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	They selected 10 defensive backs, many of whom also played on  
special teams on their previous teams. And following a rule of good 
theater, the Browns finished with a bang to send their fans home 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're young. We're cap-friendly. We're energetic. I think  
we've covered our bases,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears so.  
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by bronzed Hall of Fame busts of Jim Brown, Lou Groza  
and Leroy Kelly, the Browns entered the next phase of their NFL 
return by picking more no-name players on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Priming for the Browns' return this season after a three-year  
absence, Cleveland selected Detroit center Jim Pyne with its first 
pick, and then capped its day with the surprising selection of 
Antonio Langham, a former Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafting Pyne No. 1 set the tone for a draft in which the Browns  
spent wisely -- only two players have salary cap costs over $1 
million -- and loaded up on young players with upside potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland bypassed bigger-named players in order to save money  
in the short-term while being successful well into the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to impress anybody in '99,'' said Dwight  
Clark, the Browns' director of football operations. ``We're not 
going to mortgage our future and spend a lot of cap money and cash 
on guys that we think the arrow's pointing down on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some good players that we could have taken that  
would have probably helped us win some games next year, but then 
we're out trying to fill those spots. So we want to get some guys 
we thought we could mold into the type of players that can help us 
down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 10 d-backs and nine offensive lineman, the  
Browns picked up five linebackers, four running backs, four wide 
receivers, four defensive lineman, and one quarterback, Tampa Bay's 
Scott Milanovich. 
</P>
<P>
	The average expansion player is 25.6 years old and has a cap  
value of $502,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL required the Browns to take 30 to 42 players or spend 38  
percent ($21.77 million) of their salary cap ($57.288 million) on 
players they took in the expansion draft. So although they can't 
compete on the field, being frugal will allow the Browns to compete 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
	They can begin signing free agents on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have a tidy sum available for free agency,'' Policy  
said, putting his arm around Al Lerner, Cleveland's billionaire 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion draft went about as well as the Browns could have  
hoped. Clark said the team only had to adjust its wish list three 
times when teams pulled back players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, 27, started all 16 games for the Lions last season after  
spending his first three years with Tampa Bay. His versatility made 
him attractive to the Browns, as did his salary cap number of 
$1.885 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland chose to use its last pick to take Langham despite his  
$3.02 million cost against the cap. The Browns feel he can regain 
the form that made him one of the league's top corners and because 
Langham's agent has agreed to rework the player's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a special pick for us,'' Clark said. ``And Antonio  
wanted to come back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former first-round draft pick by the Browns from Alabama,  
Langham, 26, lost his starting job this season with the 49ers. 
Clark, however, thinks Langham's problems are more mental than 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he wants to admit this, but it's a total lack of  
confidence,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland invited its first five picks -- Pyne, Dallas defensive  
end Hurvin McCormack, New England tackle Scott Rehberg, Cincinnati 
wide receiver Damon Gibson and San Francisco center Steve Gordon -- 
to the event, and each was greeted with a rousing ovation as they 
made their way to the Canton Civic Center stage to be presented a 
Browns cap by Policy and Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to play in front of the Dawg Pound,'' Gibson  
said. ``I want to beat Cincinnati now. Nothing personal, that's 
just the way it is. I'm a Cleveland Brown now.''

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Speedway Sells Its Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Selling the naming rights of sports venues,  
a practice that has become commonplace in team sports in recent 
years, spilled over into auto racing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's Companies Inc., the nation's second-largest home  
improvement retailer, agreed to pay $35 million in a 10-year period 
to have Charlotte Motor Speedway renamed to Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlotte Motor Speedway has been around since 1960, so  
there's definitely going to be a period of adjustment,'' said H.A. 
``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of Speedway Motorsports Inc., the 
company that owns the 1.5-mile superspeedway. ``But this is the way 
of sports today. This opens the flood gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the deal is the first of its kind in racing -- a sport  
where drivers and their cars often billboards -- it's unlikely to be 
the last. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI alone operates six tracks that stage races for various  
stock-car and open-wheel circuits, and company officials said they 
expect similar naming rights contracts to be announced in the 
coming months at some of their other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely two SMI candidates are Atlanta Motor Speedway  
and Texas Motor Speedway, both of which hold races for NASCAR's 
Winston Cup and Busch Grand National circuits as well as the Indy 
Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I know that some other NASCAR tracks not owned by us have  
been approached by other companies,'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lowe's deal was put together by Marcus G. Smith, SMI's  
manager of new business development. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to find good corporate fits,'' Smith said. ``We don't  
want to do this with just any company. It's important that there be 
a mesh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that when SMI decided to sell Charlotte's naming  
rights, the company contacted a dozen major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only did all express interest,'' he said, ``but there is  
still substantial interest, so we're not letting that go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Lowe's is not a high-technology or financial  
services company separates it from many of the corporations that 
have bought naming rights for team sports facilities, such as 
Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, Cinergy Field in Cincinnati and the 
FleetCenter in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's, based in North Wilkesboro, N.C., has 487 stores in 27  
states and plans to open an additional 100 stores in the West and 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a perfect fit for us,'' Lowe's chairman and  
chief executive officer Bob Tillman said. ``Our demographics show 
that Lowe's and NASCAR attract virtually the same person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lowe's deal represents another first for the Charlotte  
track. It also was the first facility in Winston Cup racing to 
offer stock publicly and the first to build luxury suites and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will do nothing but help our identity,'' Wheeler said.  
``The folks at Lowe's are great marketers, and that's what we need 
in this sport. We've got another couple levels to go up in this 
sport, and I think they can help take us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which already sponsors a Winston Cup team and  
several other ventures in stock car racing, said it spent an 
estimated $30 million in racing last year and expects that figure 
to climb to $40 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal further strengthens the retailer's position as a major  
player in helping Winston Cup racing diversify its sponsorship 
base. The sport has relied for decades on money from tobacco 
interests, but with that industry coming under increasing fire from 
the federal government, sponsors without tobacco ties are becoming 
more and more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what the federal government is going to do,''  
Tillman said. ``You've got to be prepared to broaden the base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the money from the name change would be used to add  
seats, roads and parking at the track. Seating capacity is expected 
to increase to about 156,000 for May, when the IRL, Winston Cup, 
Grand National and ARCA circuits all hold races at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first heard about the name change around here,  
there was a certain amount of grief -- not against Lowe's, but just 
because of the change,'' Wheeler said. ``But when people found out 
about the dollars, that made a lot of difference because they know 
it's not just the dollars, it's what we can do with the dollars for 
the race fan.''

<HEADLINE> Results of Impeachment Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from polls released this week on President Clinton,  
the Senate and the impeachment trial. If results don't total 100 
percent, the remainder either didn't know or offered no response. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is  
handling his job as president? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 66 percent; disapprove, 29 percent (CBS News); Approve  
66 percent, disapprove 33 percent (ABC News). The president's 
approval rating has been in the 60s throughout the last year. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the Senate should or should not remove Clinton  
from office? 
</P>
<P>
	Remove Clinton, 33 percent; should not remove, 65 percent (ABC  
News). The number who wanted Clinton impeached was near 20 percent 
in some polls in June, grew to a third of the population by 
September and has stayed near that level. 

</P>
<P>
	--If the Senate votes on whether or not to censure President  
Clinton, would you want your senators to vote in favor of censuring 
the president or vote against censuring him? 
</P>
<P>
	Vote in favor of censure, 55 percent; vote against censure, 37  
percent (CBS News). The sentiment for censure has dropped slightly 
from early fall, when about two-thirds in some polls said the 
president should be censured. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way Republicans in the  
Senate are handling the impeachment trial? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 32 percent; disapprove 62 percent (ABC News). The  
number who approve of the Republican handling of the case has been 
at 40 percent or lower ever since September when Congress got the 
case. 

</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way Democrats in the Senate  
are handling the impeachment trial? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve, 44 percent; disapprove 47 percent (ABC News). Approval  
of Democratic handling of the Senate trial has dropped by about 10 
points from some polls taken last month. 

</P>
<P>
	--Are you interested in hearing more about the impeachment case  
or would you say you're sick of it? 
</P>
<P>
	Interested in hearing more, 18 percent; sick of it, 81 percent  
(ABC News). 

</P>
<P>
	The ABC News poll of 803 adults was taken Saturday and Sunday  
and has a margin or error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
The CBS News poll of 632 adults was taken Sunday and has a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Hopefuls Need Big Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Determined to pass the first test of the  
presidency, John Kasich surveyed two dozen lawyers, developers and 
executives gathered in a Boston boardroom and made his pitch: ``I 
need you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked them to raise money -- $10,000, $20,000 apiece -- to put  
punch in his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. 
Within days, the Ohio congressman made similar pleas to the 
well-heeled in New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year before the first primaries, it is dollars, not  
votes, that presidential contenders must campaign for. Politicians 
and strategists say a candidate needs to raise $20 million by the 
end of this year to properly finance a campaign in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's $2,283 for every hour of every day in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	Recalling his recent fund-raising forays, Kasich said that for  
the son of a mailman, gathering that huge sum is ``comparable to 
climbing Mount Everest without oxygen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scaling the $20 million mountain early is crucial. Large states  
like New York and California have moved next year's primaries to 
early March, leaving candidates little time to convert strong 
performances in the early contests of Iowa or New Hampshire into 
campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the year of the invisible primary,'' said James  
Thurber, director of American University's Center for Congressional 
and Presidential Studies. ``You really have to have the money in 
the bank in order to be competitive. You can't go out and collect 
money in the middle of campaigning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one potential GOP candidate, Elizabeth Dole, is raising  
money before filing with the Federal Election Commission, using a 
provision that allows aspirants to gauge support in advance of a 
full-fledged candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in 1996, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes can  
finance his presidential campaign by writing checks rather than 
raising money. For the others, raising the $20 million is ``a big 
test,'' former Vice President Dan Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the test trickier, federal election laws require that the  
money come in chunks no larger than $1,000 per donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe said a successful  
presidential campaign needs a base of at least 100 people who can 
raise $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could care less about a guy who can give $100,000,'' said  
McAuliffe, who was finance chairman for President Clinton's 
re-election campaign. ``It is the individual who has the ability to 
tap their neighbors, their friends, their relatives. You have got 
to create an army of true believers who are going to spend all day 
calling people on the telephone, asking for money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To assemble that army, a candidate's money people seek out  
veteran fund-raisers, old friends, new friends and friends of 
friends. Many fund-raisers are real estate developers, contractors, 
investors, lawyers or small-business owners -- folks that come with 
long lists of clients, vendors or associates they can ask for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The script has the candidate join a small group in a room, or at  
least get on the telephone with potential donors, to seal the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to feel like he cares enough that he picked up the  
phone and called them. And if they called him back two weeks later, 
he would take the call,'' said Quayle's chief fund-raiser, Richard 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, Kasich met over coffee and cola with a group gathered  
by one of his fund-raisers, former Massachusetts GOP Chairman Jim 
Rappaport. With windows overlooking the Charles River as his 
backdrop, Kasich followed his pitch for money by fielding questions 
about tax cuts, the budget and Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some big fund-raisers hope one day to bring their issues  
directly to the next president or one of his top aides. Others want 
nothing more than an autographed picture to hang on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ego plays a tremendous part in this business,'' McAuliffe  
said. ``To say they've just had dinner with the president plays a 
huge role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small contributions, raised through phones and mail, also are  
important. Most candidates agree to limit the amount of money they 
spend in primaries -- $37 million in 1996 -- making them eligible for 
federal matching funds of up to $250 per contributor. While only 
$250 of a $1,000 contribution is matched, small donors' dollars are 
doubled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Direct mail is an emotional medium,'' Norman said. ``You've  
got to use some pretty emotional language to talk someone into 
pulling out their checkbook when they don't even know you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hence Quayle's January fund-raising letter, which takes a poke  
at Texas Gov. George W. Bush: ``I have ordered my staff to never -- 
EVER -- utter the words 'compassionate conservatism.' This silly and 
insulting term was created by liberal Republicans and is nothing 
more than code for surrendering our values and principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparing for another round of fund raising, Kasich said money  
matters too much in presidential politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The huge sums make it disproportionately important,'' Kasich  
said. ``It takes away from the process of electing a president.''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Nominations To Be Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- It started as a one-picture runaway  
with ``Saving Private Ryan'' and became a two-picture race with 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' Then everybody remembered ``The Truman 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was before the contenders were even announced.  
</P>
<P>
	So perhaps the only real drama going into today's announcement  
of the Academy Award nominations centered on the two remaining 
best-picture slots -- whether such small films as ``Gods and 
Monsters'' and ``The Opposite of Sex'' would get nods instead of 
the bigger-budget front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	With a dearth of high-quality studio movies to pick from,  
another question was whether this year would rival 1996, when four 
of the five best-picture nominees were produced outside the big 
Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed more likely that medium-sized studios like DreamWorks  
and Miramax would dominate. One foreign-language film, Italy's 
``Life is Beautiful,'' also had an outside shot at best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Oscar nominations follow a race of greater suspense  
than last year, when the blockbuster ``Titanic'' overpowered the 
field early and then stayed the course with a record-tying 14 
nominations and 11 awards. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Saving Private Ryan'' was released last summer, it was  
instantly hailed as best-picture material, with strong chances for 
Oscars for director Steven Spielberg, star Tom Hanks, any number of 
supporting actors and for the screenplay and cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie stood out from countless war sagas with its brutally  
realistic Normandy Beach sequence, giving what many veterans said 
was the most accurate screen treatment of combat, in all its 
cruelty, randomness and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the fall, along came the Elizabethan romantic romp  
``Shakespeare in Love,'' starring Joseph Fiennes as the Bard, a 
struggling writer seeking his muse. When he finds her in Gwenyth 
Paltrow, the words -- and the clothes -- fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost lost in the talk over whether the Academy would favor  
love or war was ``The Truman Show,'' an unsettling story of media 
power featuring Jim Carrey as a man who unwittingly stars in his 
own 24-hour television show. A raft of Golden Globe nominations put 
``Truman'' in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced March 21 at a ceremony televised  
live on ABC from the Los Angeles Music Center, with Whoopi Goldberg 
back for a third time as emcee. The Sunday night event is a change 
from the traditional Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars have always attracted their share of controversy and  
this year the fireworks started early when the Academy announced 
that it will present a special Oscar to Elia Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's  
Agreement'' alienated many in the film world by naming names before 
the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating communist 
infiltration in Hollywood during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Several industry notables were quick to criticize Kazan's  
selection, including actor Rod Steiger and screenwriter Abraham 
Polonsky, who was blacklisted as a result of the committee's highly 
charged hearings.

	Senate Begins Impeachment Debate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate shut its doors today and began  
debating its verdict on President Clinton's impeachment. An effort 
to open the proceedings failed to gain the two-thirds vote needed. 
Closed-door deliberations are more conducive to thoughtful 
exchanges, said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``Sometimes a discussion 
breaks out. If it's in closed session, you will see more of a 
dialogue. If there's going to be any persuasion it's only going to 
be in closed session.''

<P>
	Clinton To Nominate Holbrooke  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton moved ahead with plans to  
nominate Richard Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations 
after Holbrooke agreed today to pay $5,000 to settle civil charges 
that he violated federal ethics laws. The veteran diplomat denied 
in the settlement the Justice Department's allegations that he 
improperly contacted a U.S. diplomat in 1996 on behalf of his 
employer.

	First Lady Backs Womens' Rights  
</P>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton declared at  
a U.N. conference on population today that all women should be 
allowed to make their own family planning choices. Mrs. Clinton was 
addressing 1,500 delegates from 180 countries in The Hague. It's 
the first major review of progress since a landmark 1994 U.N. 
population conference produced a 20-year plan to stem population 
growth and empower women worldwide. She praised those fighting 
China's restrictive one-child rule. ``That is a decision that 
should be made freely and responsibly without government 
coercion,'' Mrs. Clinton said of family planning. 

</P>
<P>
	Medicare Fraud Cut in Half  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare lost about 7 cents of every dollar  
spent to fraud, waste and mistakes in 1998, government auditors 
said today. That amounts to more than $12 billion -- but it's about 
half of what was lost by the health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled just two years ago. That's 7.1 percent of the 
total $176.1 billion Medicare paid directly to health care 
providers, including doctors and hospitals. By comparison, in 1996 
-- the first year such estimates were made -- improper Medicare 
payments were pegged at $23.2 billion, or 14 percent. 

</P>
<P>
	Avalanches Kill Four in Europe  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Heavy snow brought parts of Europe to a standstill  
today, causing major avalanches in the French Alps that killed four 
people. Roads and airports were shut down, mountain villages were 
evacuated and thousands of tourists were stranded at ski resorts in 
Switzerland and Austria. In two villages outside the French resort 
of Chamonix, 200 rescue workers, using sensors and dogs, searched 
for those believed trapped inside a dozen wooden chalets buried 
under tons of snow. By late today, 20 people had been pulled out 
alive. 

</P>
<P>
	'Shakespeare,' 'Ryan' Lead Oscars  
</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The romantic comedy ``Shakespeare  
in Love'' collected a near-record 13 Oscar nominations today. 
Steven Spielberg's war epic ``Saving Private Ryan'' had 11

	Jim Pyne Is Browns' First Pick  
</P>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Priming for their return this season after a  
three-year absence, the Cleveland Browns selected Detroit center 
Jim Pyne with their first pick in today's NFL expansion draft. 
Pyne, 27, started all 16 games for the Lions last season after 
spending his first three years with Tampa Bay. His versatility made 
him attractive to the Browns, as did his salary cap number of 
$1.885 million. More than 4,000 fans, including members of the 
famed Dawg Pound, were on hand for the 2 1/2-hour, made-for-television 
event.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Statements on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Frustrated that the Senate apparently won't  
pursue whether presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal lied, House 
prosecutors may find a more receptive audience at the Justice 
Department or prosecutor Kenneth Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife signed affidavits  
stating that Blumenthal told them last March that former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky was a stalker. Journalist Scott 
Armstrong signed an affidavit Monday saying he was told by Hitchens 
and his wife, Carol Blue, about their conversation with Blumenthal 
and the ``stalker'' comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal told the Senate last week that he never fed the news  
media President Clinton's false account from January 1998 about his 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the possibility of a criminal probe of Blumenthal,  
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly declined to comment and Justice 
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Congress has made no formal 
referral. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers pressed the Senate to subpoena the three  
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president may have engaged in an intimidation campaign''  
against Ms. Lewinsky in January 1998 and Blumenthal ``may have 
testified falsely before the Senate,'' House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wrote the Senate majority and minority 
leaders. Democrats eager to conclude the trial objected to Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott's motion to admit the affidavits of the 
three journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Blumenthal, he was told by the president in January  
1998 that Ms. Lewinsky said her peers referred to her as ``the 
stalker'' and Clinton said he'd rebuffed a sexual demand she made 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Blumenthal told the Senate, ``I never told any of my  
colleagues about what the president told me. ... I didn't mention 
it to my friends, I didn't mention it to my family, besides my 
wife. ... And I certainly never mentioned it to any reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Sunday, Blumenthal said, ``As I testified to the  
Senate, I talked every day about the stories in the news concerning 
Miss Lewinsky to my friends and family, just as everyone else is 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Nike Pulls Ad After Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nike Inc. plans to drop a television commercial  
that showed an in-line skater racing a train, because a congressman 
complained the ad might encourage youths to try the risky maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike spokesman Scott Reames said Monday the ad was intended to  
be fantasy and wasn't meant to encourage reckless behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial, which began running Jan. 1, won't be extended  
past this week, largely in response to a complaint by Rep. Dennis 
Kucinich, D-Ohio, who wrote to Nike President Tom Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering his plea, we felt there was no reason to extend  
it,'' Reames said. He was unaware of other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucinich, who represents part of Cleveland and its western  
suburbs, said some parents complained about the ad. He said 
residents are especially sensitive to rail safety because the 
merger of the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads will increase rail 
traffic through the area.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche on 12-Game Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Since returning from a prolonged contract holdout,  
Sandis Ozolinsh has made some mistakes that made him want to crawl 
under the nearest Zamboni. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stupid mistakes. Just dumb,'' Ozolinsh said Monday. ``I watch  
the video and feel embarrassed. I'm just standing there counting 
the light bulbs on the ceiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the miscues, Ozolinsh has become a Latvian good-luck  
charm for the Avalanche, who have won 12 straight games since he 
made his season debut in a 3-2 overtime victory at Chicago on Jan. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory tonight against the Calgary Flames would move the  
Avalanche one step closer to the Pittsburgh Penguins' NHL-record 17 
consecutive victories in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's getting more serious,'' Ozolinsh said when asked if  
he takes credit for Colorado's 12-game win streak. ``The first 
three games, yeah. Four games, yeah. Not when it's 12 games. It's 
getting kind of old. After each game, everybody wants to rub my 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The month-long streak has put Colorado back among the league's  
elite and helped erase the memory of an 0-4 start that had people 
writing off the Avs just three seasons removed from their Stanley 
Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we look back at our start, no one ever thought we'd  
get on a little role like we have lately,'' forward Adam Deadmarsh 
said. ``I think everyone around the room was a little frustrated 
with that and felt we could do a little better. I don't know what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no shortage of theories.  
</P>
<P>
	Long before Ozolinsh returned, Colorado coach Bob Hartley made a  
serendipitous lineup change that helped the Avalanche (29-19-4) go 
from two games under .500 to their perch atop the Northwest 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of watching his team struggle offensively, the rookie  
coach moved center Peter Forsberg to left wing on Dec. 2, putting 
him on the same line as fellow All-Star Joe Sakic. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won its first five games after the switch, but went  
3-6-1 when injuries split the pair for three weeks. The dangerous 
duo has been healthy for all but one game of the current streak, 
and the Avalanche are 17-2-1 when both are playing side-by-side. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my business, we have to do experiments every day,'' Hartley  
said. ``At the time we decided to put Peter and Joe together, we 
wanted to create a spark. We wanted to create excitement in the 
dressing room. It's one of those combinations that could have 
failed all the way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having regained its scoring punch, Colorado signed goalie  
Patrick Roy to a $15 million contract extension two weeks ago, and 
he has responded with 11 straight victories (backup Craig 
Billington won the first game of the streak). 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who leads active goalies with 401 wins, has three shutouts  
and has allowed two or fewer goals eight times during his tear. In 
the 12-game streak, Colorado has outscored its opponents 47-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm on the bench watching the top two lines, and the  
defense and Patrick, I am sitting there kind of saying, `What a 
show these guys are putting on,''' rookie center Chris Drury said. 
``It's been unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drury, who was named college's top player in 1997, has done his  
part as well. Skating on Colorado's third line with Stephane Yelle 
and Shean Donovan, Drury has two goals and seven assists in the 
last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that every game, there's a different line or a  
different guy coming out to really give us that big play or that 
big goal,'' Hartley said. ``It's a sign of a healthy club right 
now. The guys feel real confident. They're having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fun could end if Colorado has a letdown tonight following  
four road victories against Boston, Buffalo, Detroit and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really didn't find ourselves until this road trip,'' Sakic  
said. ``We knew we won eight in a row, but we didn't play any of 
the elite teams. Winning those games was definitely a good 
confidence boost. We have to keep building on that.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Roz Kelly, who played Fonzie's biker  
girlfriend Pinky Tuscadero on ``Happy Days,'' has pleaded innocent 
to three felony firearms charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, 56, is accused of grabbing a shotgun and shooting up her  
neighbor's car and apartment after being awakened by a blaring car 
alarm. She has remained jailed on $305,000 bail since her Nov. 29 
arrest. 
</P>

medical problems from a knee injury and surgeries. She also asked 
permission to represent herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Court Commissioner Michael Duffey continued the hearing until  
next week to determine whether Kelly is mentally capable of serving 
as her own attorney. If convicted, Kelly faces up to six years in 
prison or probation, prosecutors said.

legs.

	``They told me all I could do was rest,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gov. Hopes To Keep Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gov. Paul Cellucci, holding out hope of keeping  
the New England Patriots in Massachusetts, asked legislative 
leaders to be ready for further negotiations with team owner Robert 
Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft plans to move the NFL team to Hartford, Conn., but a  
development deal has not been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want people to be thinking about it,'' Cellucci told  
the Boston Herald on Monday after meeting with Senate President 
Thomas Birmingham and House Speaker Thomas Finneran. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's at least a potential that it could not go forward down  
there,'' the governor said of Connecticut. ``I don't think the news 
coming out of Connecticut is good. The cost seems to be escalating 
at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What started off as $350 million seems to me to be  
substantially higher now, and every new hurdle they face seems to 
be adding to that cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci has not talked to the Patriots about changing their  
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's the appropriate time when they're having  
press conferences saying we're working hard to finalize this thing 
in Connecticut. But let's see what happens,'' Cellucci said.

<HEADLINE> Commander: Maneuver by Pilot Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot took risks by bringing  
a video camera and doing a 360-degree roll in his jet the afternoon 
the plane cut an Italian ski gondola cable and killed 20 people, 
the pilot's former commander testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Richard Muegge testified after the jury flew to a  
nearby base to sit in the cockpit of an EA-6B Prowler, the same jet 
flown by Capt. Richard Ashby last Feb. 3 in Cavalese, Italy. During 
the four-hour trip, the jury also went to a bombing range to watch 
a Prowler and an FA-18 fly over at 1,000 feet and nearly 600 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in Ashby's court-martial say the corkscrew maneuver,  
called a flaperon roll, occurred just before the collision. The 
defense says the roll was normally used to cross mountain ridges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very safe,'' Muegge told jurors. ``It doesn't take  
much to lose altitude. It can be disorienting. It's not commonplace 
and it's never been condoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muegge said Ashby also put the flight at risk by taking a video  
camera aboard. Muegge said he didn't ban cameras on jets in his 
squadron, but didn't like them. 
</P>
<P>
	A tape from the camera was destroyed, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, he faces a maximum 
penalty of more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and other pilots of the Prowler anti-radar jets stationed  
at the Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station usually flew at 
altitudes of 20,000 to 25,000 feet, Muegge said. The jets flew over 
Bosnia from the Aviano, Italy, air base. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the jet was flying too low and too fast,  
violating altitude restrictions of 1,000 feet. The cable was hit 
around 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys contend the ski area on Mount Cermis wasn't on  
Ashby's map and that he may have experienced an optical illusion 
that made him think he was higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Muegge said it was common knowledge that there were ski areas in  
the Alps.

<HEADLINE> Congress Begins Olympics Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investigative wing of Congress is moving  
ahead with an inquiry into how federal money is used to promote 
Olympic venues in the United States, an official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office will look at how the Salt Lake  
City 2002 winter games, troubled by charges of corruption, are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid, said Bernie Ungar, GAO director of government business 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,  
ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee. Ungar met with 
committee staff Monday to plan the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ungar said his office will examine how federal money was spent  
at the Atlanta summer games in 1996 and what kind of federal help 
Salt Lake City is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	He said finding the exact amount of aid is difficult because it  
comes from a number of sources. Also of interest, he said, are 
``what requirements, if any, are attached, and what controls 
exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell requested the study after revelations that Salt Lake  
City organizers lavished expensive gifts on members of the 
International Olympic Committee to help win votes for the right to 
host the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell quoted one press report claiming that the city was  
seeking more than $171 million in federal funds for road, airport 
and mass transit expansion, security, housing and other special 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests the real possibility that Salt Lake City stands  
to be rewarded for the improper or possibly illegal activities 
engaged in'' or in its behalf, he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Rests in Minister Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Shortly after prosecutors rested their case  
Tuesday against Rev. Henry Lyons, the National Baptist Convention 
USA leader briefly took the witness stand -- but jurors weren't 
there to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Susan Schaeffer wanted to hear from Lyons about a 1995  
letter offering a list of the black church organization's purported 
8.5 million members to a magazine publisher for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had wanted to admit the letter as evidence in his  
racketeering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by prosecutors whether such a list even existed at  
that time, he hesitated and then responded: ``Just trying to get my 
dates together. ... I don't believe so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His statements cannot be presented before jurors unless he  
decides to testify on his own behalf. His defense lawyers, 
scheduled to begin presenting their case Wednesday, have not said 
whether they will call him. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer said she would rule on the letter's admissibility  
later. 
</P>
<P>
	During two weeks of prosecution testimony, witnesses said Lyons  
and co-defendant Bernice Edwards courted companies seeking to do 
business with the church organization and spent their money on 
expensive homes, jewelry and cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said the membership figure of 8.5 million was  
greatly inflated to attract companies.

<HEADLINE> Dog Show Is All About Beauty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smallest dog proved the biggest and best of  
them all as a dainty papillon floated to victory Tuesday as 
best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club's 123rd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-pound dog -- who came within a whisker of the prize in 1996  
-- lived up to his own name, Loteki's Supernatural Being, and his 
breed's name, French for butterfly, as he flew around the ring with 
handler-owner John Oulton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st best-in-show for Kirby, at 9 years old a veteran  
of the show ring. He also collected top prize this summer at the 
World Championship in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helsinki was incredible, of course, there were 16,000 dogs,''  
Oulton said. ``But I think this is really, for me, the top, top 
award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ed Embry Bivin praised all seven finalists, chosen Monday  
and earlier Tuesday to represent their breed groups, but said Kirby 
stood head and batlike ears above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a pack that was really something to see,''  
he said. ``This little dog was so on for this night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby came in second to a clumber spaniel in 1996, then didn't  
even win his breed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, unlike most Westminster winners, he won't retire to the  
home he shares with Oulton and 10 other pets in Norwalk, Conn., 
though Oulton already limits him to a few shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never retire this dog because he loves to show so  
much,'' he said. ``He may make two or three appearances a year just 
to let him have the fun of it.''

<HEADLINE> Tim McCarver May Call Yankees Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim McCarver is close to signing a deal that  
will allow him call about 40 games for the New York Yankees this 
season, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, fired by the New York Mets last week after 16 years as  
the team's analyst, is also Fox Sports' lead national baseball 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said he was unaware of an imminent deal discussed in  
Tuesday's editions of the New York Post and New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Bob Rosen, said Tuesday he had not been contacted by  
the Yankees or WNYW, the Fox affiliate that will televise Yankees 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a done deal,'' Rosen said. ``We haven't even begun  
negotiations yet, but Tim is interested and I'm just waiting for 
the call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver's schedule with Fox Sports would force him to miss at  
least eight Yankees games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any problem with Fox accommodating Tim's  
schedule,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who has 10 Emmy Award nominations, was fired by the  
Mets last week and replaced by Tom Seaver, the only New York Mets 
player to have his number retired by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons for the change was believed to be because  
McCarver was often critical of the Mets.

<HEADLINE> Winter Storm Shuts I-80 in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A storm that buried the Sierra Nevada with  
more than 8 feet of snow in four days pummeled the region again 
Tuesday, closing Interstate 80 and taxing the patience of drivers 
and residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting very sick of this,'' Sara Olson said at the J&AMP;L  
Food Mart, in Truckee, Calif. ``If I have to pick up another 
shovel, someone's going to get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several major roads were shut down Tuesday because of avalanche  
dangers, spinouts and near-blizzard conditions. Hundreds of state 
workers were sent home early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to remember a time in the middle of the day when we  
had this many roads closed,'' KRNV weatherman Dave Finley in Reno 
said at noon Tuesday. ``It is kind of tough to get out of Nevada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A winter storm warning remained in effect for much of the  
northern and central Sierra through Tuesday night into Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding rain also plagued Northern California. In San  
Francisco, gusty winds up to 60 mph uprooted trees and collapsed a 
three-story scaffold onto six parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Three homes were crushed in the wine country town of Calistoga,  
Calif. when strong winds toppled a huge oak tree near the Napa 
River. The houses were not occupied at the time.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Confident at Daytona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- When Rusty Wallace controlled the  
Winston Cup circuit almost to the degree Jeff Gordon is dominating 
it today, there was one huge flaw on his record. 
</P>
<P>
	Five seasons later, Wallace is among those hoping he can stop  
Gordon, or at least make his run at a third straight series title 
more difficult. But Wallace has another piece of unfinished 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to win the Daytona 500, a race in which he was a  
non-factor until a year ago. But in his 16th attempt to win the 
jewel of stock car racing, Wallace wound up a career-best fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	That, and being the fastest Ford this year at Daytona  
International Speedway, has given the 42-year-old driver from St. 
Louis plenty to be optimistic about. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he scans the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really think Dale Earnhardt is going to be super strong,''  
Wallace said of the defending race champion who broke through last 
year after 19 previous losses. ``I think Gordon is going to be 
super strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has already proved that by winning the pole for the race  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, who last Sunday won the non-points Bud Shootout to  
break an 0-for-72 slump at DIS, was perhaps the only reason Gordon 
had to settle for a record-tying 13 victories in 1998. Martin won a 
career-best seven races, and now he can win on the track that had 
for so long haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are two-time Daytona 500 winners Dale Jarrett and  
Sterling Marlin. There's Terry Labonte, a three-time runner-up in 
The Great American Race, and his brother, Bobby, a major threat on 
any superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is so close this year,'' Wallace said. ``I've never  
seen qualifying times so close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 series champion has carried himself with an easy  
confidence this February, in part the residue of his success here a 
year ago, in part a derivative of knowing he has the equipment he 
always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great car, and I haven't had a race setup in it  
yet,'' Wallace said. ``This is the best car I've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But don't seek him as a seer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic ... I'm just not making any predictions,''  
Wallace said. ``I'm glad I didn't make any predictions yesterday. I 
would have looked like a fool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was alluding to what he called a ``stupid mistake'' -- missing  
the driver introductions for the Bud Shootout. His penalty was 
being sent from the front to the rear of a field limited to the 
fastest cars in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But that gave Wallace an opportunity to learn how fast his  
package really is. He started 15th and moved to fourth in the 
25-lap sprint on the 2 1/2-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion about the timing of introductions is a not a serious  
problem. But Wallace knows such a blunder could prove costly in a 
points race. 
</P>
<P>
	So, he's done something about it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got hired right now to look after me,'' he said. ``Let's  
face it, I could be standing here talking to you right now while a 
meeting's going on and get distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distraction could be a problem for Tony Stewart, who makes his  
Winston Cup debut from the outside of the front row. Told that 
Gordon predicted he would be toyed with, Stewart agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's absolutely right,'' said Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing  
League champion. ``He knows because he's been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart believes a rookie must earn respect from his brethren.  
He also thinks the veteran drivers will make sure he is properly 
schooled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those lessons that you learn ... you have to remember  
those in order to be successful in this series,'' he said. ``Trust 
me, it's a big book ... bigger than the Encyclopedia Britannica.''

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Ten more IOC members were implicated  
Tuesday by an ethics panel report that described in shocking detail 
-- from ritzy hotels to fistfuls of cash -- the extreme means Salt 
Lake City used to land votes for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the U.S. Olympic Committee was tied to the  
ever-widening corruption scandal, with the report citing a series 
of exchanges among three senior staffers involving ``promises ... 
made to secure votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 International Olympic Committee members mentioned in the  
report were not previously tied to Salt Lake's excesses. In all, 24 
IOC members have been implicated in vote-buying schemes -- roughly 
one-fifth of its membership. Nine IOC members have been expelled or 
have resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Free trips to the Super Bowl, stays in ritzy Paris hotels, ski  
vacations and piles of cash were among improper perks and payments 
cited in the 300-page report by an independent ethics panel for the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch, bid committee  
president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the two universally credited for bringing the 2002  
Winter Games to Salt Lake, even by those who divulged damning 
information about Welch and Johnson to the ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also were described as the architects of a scheme born  
on the day in 1991 that Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Games 
to Nagano, Japan, by just four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	From that day in Birmingham, England, where Welch claims to have  
turned down two offers of IOC member influence for cash, Welch and 
Johnson stretched Salt Lake's legitimate quest to win IOC member 
friends into an unethical and at times secretive mission, the 
ethics panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted the lengths to which Salt Lake's boosters went to  
win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Welch made a wire transfer from his children's  
trust account when the wife of Siuli Paul Wallwork, the IOC member 
from Western Samoa, sought $30,000 for a friend in a serious 
situation. Welch later told a bid committee employee the money had 
been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, Johnson and, to a lesser extent, former administrative  
officer Craig Peterson, had both a strategic and off-the-cuff 
approach for improper spending, said David Jordan, a former U.S. 
attorney on the five-member ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the bid board were not told of direct cash payments  
or details of bogus scholarships, and outside auditors failed to 
raise red flags about those expenditures, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel did not total up the amounts but the improper  
payments -- some in the form of scholarships -- exceeded $1 million. 
Another $1 million in air fare, hotel rooms and shopping sprees 
were donated to the bid committee and passed along to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Welch and Johnson were interviewed at length by the ethics  
panel, but Peterson and Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
declined to be interviewed, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 electronic-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It 
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network --  
the single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
The ethics panel did not have access to bank records and had no 
subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee, and  
the committee paid for his family to stay at the Intercontinental 
Hotel in Paris for 11 days in 1994 and 11 days in 1995 at $300 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also detailed eight wire transfers totaling  
$33,750 made in 1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish 
IOC member Pirjo Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract 
with Great Basin Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid 
Haeggman. Mrs. Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new IOC members mentioned in the report were Phillip  
Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, who with 
their families made four visits together to the United States, in 
one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted by Welch at 
a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee on several occasions paid for IOC members to  
stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended periods of 
time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City,'' the report 
said. Others received expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas, Niagara 
Falls and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

panel, but Peterson and Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
declined to be interviewed, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 electronic-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It 
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network --  
the single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
The ethics panel did not have access to bank records and had no 
subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee, and  
the committee paid for his family to stay at the Intercontinental 
Hotel in Paris for 11 days in 1994 and 11 days in 1995 at $300 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also detailed eight wire transfers totaling  
$33,750 made in 1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish 
IOC member Pirjo Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract 
with Great Basin Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid 
Haeggman. Mrs. Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new IOC members mentioned in the report were Phillip  
Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, who with 
their families made four visits together to the United States, in 
one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted by Welch at 
a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee on several occasions paid for IOC members to  
stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended periods of 
time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City,'' the report 
said. Others received expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas, Niagara 
Falls and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo  
following comments by Japan's officials seen as supportive of the 
greenback. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.70 yen in late trading, up 1.20 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
114.43 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 114.25 yen to 
114.90 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 89.83 points,  
or 0.64 percent, to end at 13,902.66 points. On Monday, the average 
closed up 94.41 points, or 0.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground in Tokyo in line  
with an overnight trend in New York after Eisuke Sakakibara, vice 
minister for international affairs with Japan's Finance Ministry, 
said Monday an excessively strong yen is not good for Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks make yen buyers wary the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to stem the yen further appreciation against the U.S. 
currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said early Tuesday that it is  
up to the Bank of Japan to decide on monetary policy, a remark 
interpreted to mean that the government and the central bank could 
agree on some action to control interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Action by the Bank of Japan to cap rates would help boost the  
dollar because higher interest rates tend to favor the rise of that 
nation's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The view that easier monetary policy will be implemented in  
some form is leading to a weaker yen,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, 
senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was at 129.68 yen, up from 127.66 yen late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, many investors have already held back to  
see what steps the Bank of Japan may take on the recent rise in 
long-term interest rates at its Friday's policy-board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 6.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,083.65 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a  
low 306 million shares, although it was up from 261.2 million 
shares Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 782 to 336, 
while 151 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.010 percent from Monday's finish of 2.160 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.34 yen from 97.19 yen.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Election Suit Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld the  
dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Ross Perot's Reform Party that 
challenged election laws, calling much of the suit frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought damages for alleged illegal funding of  
``issue ads'' by Democrats and Republicans in the 1996 presidential 
race, attacked the Federal Elections Commission's composition of 
three Republicans and three Democrats, and claimed discrimination 
in a law that bases campaign funding on a party's share of the 
presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker dismissed the lawsuit last  
February without a trial. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
upheld his ruling by a 3-0 decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Mary Schroeder's opinion said a 1976 Supreme Court ruling  
upheld the federal campaign funding law, which tied parties' 
federal matching funds to their share of the last presidential 
vote. Parties that get more than 25 percent of the vote receive the 
most money, with lesser subsidies to parties winning between 5 
percent and 25 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the 1992 presidential election, the Democrats and  
Republicans each got $62 million in federal funds for 1996, and the 
Reform Party, with Perot as its candidate, got $29 million. The 
appeals court said the 1976 decision recognized those disparities 
and found no illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party also had challenged the makeup of the Federal  
Elections Commission, which is covered by a law that limits 
appointments from any party to three. The appeals court said 
striking down the law wouldn't affect minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the lawsuit accused Democrats and Republicans of  
flouting legal limits on ``soft money,'' contributed by 
corporations and unions, by using it for ads devoted to issues that 
promoted each party's 1996 presidential candidate. Claiming the ads 
cost Perot votes, the Reform Party sought damages for the resulting 
loss of future federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the only legal remedy for an election law  
violation is a complaint to the FEC. 
</P>
<P>
	David White, a lawyer for the Reform Party, refused to comment.  
The party's chairman, Russell Verney, said last year the lawsuit 
would be taken to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Ex-Presidents at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even on the way to his grave, King Hussein  
worked a few final acts of political magic. His funeral put Syria 
in the room with Israel, planted Democrats beside Republicans on a 
long plane ride, and returned Boris Yeltsin to the world stage from 
which he seemed to have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton marveled at the unifying force that hovered  
over ceremonies for Hussein in Amman on Monday. He said the makeup 
of the Israeli delegation alone showed Hussein will always be a 
force for progress and compromise in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hardly believe my eyes. All the candidates for prime  
minister,'' Clinton told U.S. Embassy workers at a hotel in 
downtown Amman. ``They were all walking together. I don't know if 
they talk at home, but they were talking here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was as if Hussein were hugging them all,'' Clinton said.  
``People coming from all around the world -- countries that are at 
each other's throats -- here, meeting in peace and friendship, 
(under) the sanctity of the umbrella of this great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ordinary Jordanians wept in the streets over the loss of  
Hussein, 63, who died of cancer Saturday, the world leaders flocked 
to Amman to touch base with Hussein's newly crowned eldest son, 
King Abdullah, 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures from the world's mightiest powers spent the entire day  
praying with heads bowed or hands raised before Hussein's coffin; 
milling about in the winter chill while Hussein's male relatives 
prepared his body for burial; chatting with Abdullah on plush gold 
sofas inside the royal palace. 
</P>
<P>
	As the night air rang with a wailing Muslim call to prayer,  
Abdullah personally escorted his palace visitors to their cars one 
by one: Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan. French President Jacques 
Chirac. Charles, Prince of Wales. The Sultan of Brunei. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton buttonholed grieving leaders from Gen. Abubakar of  
Nigeria to President Hafez Assad of Syria, who vaguely assured that 
he, too, is committed to helping Jordan thrive in the post-Hussein 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	During their meeting, Assad ``sort of said yes'' when Clinton  
told him, 'I hope you will support Jordan,''' said Clinton national 
security adviser Sandy Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger contrasted Hussein's rites with the 1981 funeral of  
assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Then, only the Sultan 
of Oman showed up among Arab nations, Berger said; On Monday, 
``Assad was in the same place as Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin ignored his own ailments to make the trip. The moment he  
saw the president, Yeltsin ``stood up and said, 'Beell Cleen-ton!' 
in his big bear voice,'' Berger said. The Russian president locked 
Clinton in a tight hug, and they launched into talks that were 
``mostly just personal chatter,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yeltsin's gregariousness could not hide his shaky health.  
The Russian president's frailty startled Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., 
who said he hadn't seen Yeltsin in more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really shocked. Very, very shocked,'' Leahy said. But  
despite that, Yeltsin was of sharp mind, and offered some ``strong 
opinions,'' Leahy said. He didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of his role as an official mourner, Clinton also reveled  
in his status as the junior member of the American presidents' 
club. He said they were able to make the journey to Jordan together 
because their mutual respect for Hussein outweighed their political 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are, two Democrats and two Republicans,'' Clinton told  
the embassy workers. ``We've agreed on many things, and disagreed 
on a thing or two over time. But we know that America's interests 
and America's heart were close to this king's country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He listened admiringly as former Presidents Ford, Carter and  
Bush expressed their confidence in Abdullah's ability to rule. He 
seemed touched by Carter's story of embracing a weeping King 
Hussein on a White House balcony in 1977, mere weeks after the 
king's third wife, Queen Alia, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said he suggested Hussein take time to hunt and fish in  
south Georgia, and made a helicopter available for the king 
``without asking anybody's permission, since I was commander in 
chief. I think he enjoyed it.''

<HEADLINE>  France To Try HIV-Tained Blood Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A former French prime minister appeared in court  
today on the first day of a trial of three ex-ministers linked to a 
scandal involving the use of AIDS-tainted blood in transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The somber-looking former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, current  
speaker of parliament, entered the courtroom accompanied by his 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabius, former Health Minister Edmond Herve and former Social  
Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix were all to appear before the 
special court, the first time since World War II that government 
ministers were being tried for their official acts. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are charged with employing a ``strategy of  
favoritism'' that delayed systematic testing for AIDS with an 
American-made test until a French test was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 4,000 people in France contracted AIDS from transfusions  
in the early 1980s. An experts' report in 1991 showed that about 
300 contaminations were ``avoidable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three are accused in the deaths of five people from AIDS and  
the infection of two others in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the trial began, representatives of people who have  
contracted AIDS from transfusions gathered outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rules of the trial are completely unfair,'' said Olivier  
Duplessis, president of the French Association of Transfusion 
Victims, who complained that families of victims could not take 
part in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Four health officials already have been convicted in previous  
trials, but the trial starting today is the first time courts will 
judge the accountability of top government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Three judges and 12 legislators are sitting in judgment of the  
ministers in the trial expected to last at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The three all served under Socialist President Francois  
Mitterrand from 1984-86, when AIDS was surfacing as a modern-day 
plague. 
</P>
<P>
	The American test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, was  
available in March 1985. But it was not until Aug. 1, 1985 that 
systematic testing of blood donors went into effect in France -- on 
Fabius' orders -- using a French test by Diagnostics Pasteur. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants say they never knowingly approved the use of  
contaminated blood products in transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my soul and conscience, in the deepest part of my being and  
before God, I do not feel guilty,'' Dufoix has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-ministers are accused of involuntary homicide and  
``attacking the physical integrity of others.'' They face up to 
five years in prison and a maximum fine of $90,000 on the first 
count, and up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of 
$55,000 on the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Dufoix and Herve are accused of a delay in making available  
imported and costly heated blood products, cleansed of the virus, 
instead of allowing non-heated blood with ``100 percent 
contamination'' to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating blood products to deactivate the virus was practiced in  
Germany and the United States by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the scandal was revealed in a government-ordered  
report released in September 1991 that showed ranking health 
officials knowingly allowed tainted blood products to be used in 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the special court's investigative commission  
concluded that authorities were aware of potential contamination of 
blood products by early 1985, ``sufficient time for a rapid 
reaction.''

<HEADLINE>  France To Try HIV-Tained Blood Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A former French prime minister appeared in court  
today on the first day of a trial of three ex-ministers linked to a 
scandal involving the use of AIDS-tainted blood in transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The somber-looking former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, current  
speaker of parliament, entered the courtroom accompanied by his 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabius, former Health Minister Edmond Herve and former Social  
Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix were all to appear before the 
special court, the first time since World War II that government 
ministers were being tried for their official acts. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are charged with employing a ``strategy of  
favoritism'' that delayed systematic testing for AIDS with an 
American-made test until a French test was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 4,000 people in France contracted AIDS from transfusions  
in the early 1980s. An experts' report in 1991 showed that about 
300 contaminations were ``avoidable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three are accused in the deaths of five people from AIDS and  
the infection of two others in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the trial began, representatives of people who have  
contracted AIDS from transfusions gathered outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rules of the trial are completely unfair,'' said Olivier  
Duplessis, president of the French Association of Transfusion 
Victims, who complained that families of victims could not take 
part in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Four health officials already have been convicted in previous  
trials, but the trial starting today is the first time courts will 
judge the accountability of top government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Three judges and 12 legislators are sitting in judgment of the  
ministers in the trial expected to last at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The three all served under Socialist President Francois  
Mitterrand from 1984-86, when AIDS was surfacing as a modern-day 
plague. 
</P>
<P>
	The American test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, was  
available in March 1985. But it was not until Aug. 1, 1985 that 
systematic testing of blood donors went into effect in France -- on 
Fabius' orders -- using a French test by Diagnostics Pasteur. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants say they never knowingly approved the use of  
contaminated blood products in transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my soul and conscience, in the deepest part of my being and  
before God, I do not feel guilty,'' Dufoix has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-ministers are accused of involuntary homicide and  
``attacking the physical integrity of others.'' They face up to 
five years in prison and a maximum fine of $90,000 on the first 
count, and up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of 
$55,000 on the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Dufoix and Herve are accused of a delay in making available  
imported and costly heated blood products, cleansed of the virus, 
instead of allowing non-heated blood with ``100 percent 
contamination'' to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating blood products to deactivate the virus was practiced in  
Germany and the United States by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the scandal was revealed in a government-ordered  
report released in September 1991 that showed ranking health 
officials knowingly allowed tainted blood products to be used in 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the special court's investigative commission  
concluded that authorities were aware of potential contamination of 
blood products by early 1985, ``sufficient time for a rapid 
reaction.''

<HEADLINE> Lutheran Group Gets S&AMP;L Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agribusiness giant, a long-distance phone  
company, and a coffin maker are among the companies getting new 
federal savings and loan charters in recent months. The latest to 
join the stampede: a Lutheran group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Tuesday that it had  
given approval to the Lutheran Brotherhood to buy Metro Community 
Bank of Minneapolis and open a new branch of the thrift institution 
in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutheran Brotherhood describes itself as a fraternal benefit  
society of 1.1 million Lutherans that manages more than $22 billion 
in assets and specializes in insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Community, which offers mortgage loans, home equity loans  
and other savings and loan services in the Minneapolis metropolitan 
area, has $24 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to building a stronger community through the  
opportunities that this acquisition presents,'' Rolf F. Bjelland, 
the Lutheran Brotherhood's executive vice president and chief 
investment officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Metro Community will be renamed LB Community  
Bank &AMP; Trust. Its products will be available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal thrift agency approved the application on condition  
that the Lutheran Brotherhood comply with consumer protection laws 
in operating the thrift and get permission in advance for any 
changes to its business plan -- including expanding beyond the 
Minneapolis area. In his statement, Bjelland said there were plans 
for the thrift to gradually expand throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, LB Community must conduct market research that  
measures the effectiveness of its public advertising compared with 
its marketing through Lutheran Brotherhood's insurance agents, the 
OTS said. 

</P>
<P>
	The agents who cross over to sell loans must be trained in  
federal rules regarding consumer protection and fair lending. Any 
affiliate that sells securities brokerage services must operate as 
a separate entity from the savings and loan, and at least 40 
percent of the thrift's directors must not be employees of the 
Lutheran Brotherhood or any affiliate of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency has a backlog of around 50 pending  
applications to establish federally chartered S&AMP;Ls, many of which 
are from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The OTS, part of the Treasury Department, has reviewed and  
approved applications from a number of insurance companies, 
brokerage firms and other businesses outside the banking industry 
seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting the requests, the 
regulators have chipped away at Depression-era laws separating 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Legislation to 
lift the barriers died in Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new S&AMP;L charters in recent months include  
agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., long-distance 
telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and coffin manufacturer 
Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The OTS recently gave insurance giant State Farm permission to  
operate a federal thrift after it mollified concerns about lending 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others,  
American Express Co., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., GE 
Capital and Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Nears Presidency Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Leaving little doubt about her  
intentions, Elizabeth Dole says America needs a president ``worthy 
of her people'' and already is raising money from supporters who 
think she is worth a look in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm talking to people about finances and policy and  
organization,'' she told reporters on her first trip to New 
Hampshire since leaving the American Red Cross in January to 
consider a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging for me,'' she said. ``There are a lot of  
people volunteering, and there is some money coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark surprised her advisers, who initially said they did  
not know how she was collecting the money. Later they said checks 
made out to ``Elizabeth Dole exploratory committee'' were being 
accepted and could be used to defray expenses, though papers 
forming a committee -- viewed as the first step toward a 
presidential campaign -- had not yet been filed with the Federal 
Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Such fund raising is permitted, as long as the money is used to  
open an office, buy stamps and pay for travel, Mrs. Dole said as 
she headed to a breakfast meeting with potential supporters in 
Bedford this morning. She did not answer a question about how much 
money had been raised, and her advisers said they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole is almost certain to become a candidate, said the  
advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. She plans to travel 
to Iowa next week, hire campaign staff as early as this week and 
officially form an exploratory committee in the near future, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole made the offhanded comment about money Monday before  
addressing 1,200 people at a Chamber of Commerce awards dinner. The 
speech offered a hint at plans to position herself as a moderating 
force in the campaign, someone who can put a happy face on the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reagan conservatism wore a smile,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She called for lower taxes, better schools, a war against  
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I revere free enterprise,'' she said, yet ``capitalism is  
imperfect. Conservatives should never hesitate to speak out against 
the unregulated, unadulterated pursuit of cash if it leads to the 
coarsening of our culture, to the pollution of the airwaves or the 
pollution of the air,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who shares top billing with Mrs. Bush  
in most GOP presidential polls, has labeled his brand of politics 
``compassionate conservatism.'' She promised not to label anybody's 
politics -- liberal or conservative -- because, ``America needs 
leaders, not labels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming President Clinton, she said the nation's current  
leader is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when the presidency has been tainted ... our  
confidence in our leaders is shaky,'' she said. ``But we can 
rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be an important reason why: Because the  
United States of America deserves a government worthy of her 
people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, warned voters of a ``sleaze  
factor in the White House'' late in his failed 1996 campaign for 
president. ``The White House should be a place of public trust, not 
public suspicion,'' Dole said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, served in the Cabinets of Presidents Reagan and  
Bush after starting in politics in the Democratic administration of 
President Johnson. She was a key player in her husband's 
presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole would be in a field of potential GOP candidates that,  
besides Bush, includes businessman Steve Forbes, former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle and social activist Gary 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	She read her speech Monday word-for-word and rather flatly, and  
it received only polite applause. But crowd members said afterward 
they were satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got a lot better reception than Bob Dole ever did,'' said  
Chris Stawasz. 
</P>
<P>
	Women appeared to be particularly struck by Mrs. Dole's call for  
civility in politics, and her reference to the next president -- 
``he or she.'' Good reviews crossed party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she was not necessarily a good speaker but I like what  
she said,'' Ghee Fry said. ``She kept saying she was a 
conservative, but sounded like a Democrat, like a liberal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived in this first-in-the-nation primary state late  
Monday and planned to leave today, following a private breakfast 
meeting with supporters. She disappointed some New Hampshire 
Republicans by inviting a wide variety of people to the breakfast, 
including at least one big Democratic donor, and few party 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she left the clear impression that she would be back to see  
anybody she missed -- next time as presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Maenhout of Manchester approached Mrs. Dole at a private  
reception and offered a deal: Her youth foundation would help 
25,000 kids nationwide if Mrs. Dole would publicly praise the 
organization at the end of that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honey,'' Maenhout quoted Mrs. Dole as saying, ``we might be  
talking sooner than that!''

<HEADLINE> VA Nurses Getting Cut in Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To the great surprise of Congress, which made  
it legal, the Department of Veterans Affairs in recent years has 
frozen or cut the pay of registered nurses at its hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an unintended consequence of the Nurse Pay Act of 1990,  
created to give agency administrators the flexibility to offer 
competitive wages in a time of nursing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage eased shortly after the law took effect, but  
administrators at many department facilities took advantage of the 
newfound wage flexibility to freeze or slash pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unintentional and unconscionable,'' said Alice Staggs, a  
registered nurse at the Cincinnati Medical Center. ``No one 
realized there could be cuts in pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staggs only got a 1 percent raise last year while other federal  
workers in Cincinnati, including non-nurses at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, got 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	No precise figures are available on how many of the agency's  
roughly 39,000 registered nurses had their pay frozen or cut under 
the law. A consultant's report for the department said mid-level 
registered nurses at 47 percent of the medical centers had taken 
pay cuts or freezes in 1997. Such cuts or freezes were imposed at 
21 percent of the centers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth Kizer, head of the Veterans Health Administration,  
sent out memos late last year strongly urging medical center 
directors to raise pay in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been putting some pressure on from headquarters here,''  
said Jack Price, staff director of VHA's management support office. 
``But we've been somewhat restricted because of the interpretation 
that we have no authority from headquarters to tell the directors 
what to do. It's kind of interesting when you tell the 
undersecretary for health he doesn't have the power to change 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to nurses employed by the department in Texas, North  
Carolina and Ohio found that after several years of minimal raises, 
or none at all, the 1999 pay adjustments were considerably higher. 
But it couldn't be learned immediately whether the medical centers 
in the field uniformly followed that policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers' pay is adjusted every January. For most civil  
service employees, it goes up by an amount determined by the local 
cost of living -- called locality pay -- plus an across-the-board 
increase set in a presidential executive order. Thus, most 
government workers got a minimum 3.1 percent increase beginning 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of registered nurses either got a fraction of  
that, none of it, or, in some cases, pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intention of the law was excellent. In practice, it hasn't  
worked out,'' said Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they anticipated that some nurses' pay would be  
frozen for, in some cases, five years, and that when they received 
raises they'd be less than what's going on with the rest of the 
federal workforce,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourette is preparing legislation to undo the unintended  
consequences, which gave administrators authority to adjust pay to 
keep it competitive, based on surveys of other hospitals in their 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hospital budgets were being balanced on the backs of the  
nurses,'' said Bobby L. Harnage Sr., president of the American 
Federation of Government Employees, the union for more than 10,000 
of the department's roughly 39,000 nurses. ``You do not give 
someone total discretion without expecting some abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It left a lot of discretion at the local facility level,''  
said registered nurse Cheryl Peterson of the American Nurses 
Association. ``It did do what it was supposed to do at some places. 
But as these local facilities looked at a shrinking budget, the 
only place they had discretion to make cuts was nurses' pay.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Makes Strides Vs. Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare lost about 7 cents of every dollar  
spent to fraud, waste and mistakes in 1998, government auditors 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That amounts to more than $12 billion -- but it's only about half  
of what was lost by the health insurance program for the elderly 
and disabled just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows a very significant turnaround,'' said Health and  
Human Services Department Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, who 
attributed the improvement to stricter government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are taking it seriously that someone is going to check  
on what's going on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's audit looked at the medical bills  
submitted to Medicare on behalf of 600 beneficiaries nationwide 
during the government's fiscal year 1998, which ended Sept. 30. Of 
those 5,540 bills, auditors discovered problems with 915. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the dollar value of the sample bills, auditors estimate  
that overall, Medicare paid out $12.6 billion it shouldn't have 
last year. That's 7.1 percent of the total $176.1 billion Medicare 
paid directly to health care providers, including doctors and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, in 1996 -- the first year such estimates were made  
-- improper Medicare payments were pegged at $23.2 billion, or 14 
percent. In 1997, they fell to 11 percent, but auditors hesitated 
to call the improvement significant. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Brown said, ``we've turned a corner.''  
</P>
<P>
	A government crackdown on Medicare waste that began in 1993 with  
new money and power granted by Congress seems to be paying off, she 
said. Since then, the percentage of the program's 860 million bills 
a year that are reviewed by auditors has risen from 5 percent to 14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Justice Department is working more closely with  
Medicare auditors to investigate suspicious claims and prosecute 
cases of suspected fraud -- including one against the nation's 
largest hospital chain, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they know that we're watching,'' said Medicare  
Administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health care providers have complained the anti-fraud  
tactics have been too harsh, threatening those who've made innocent 
mistakes and chilling caregivers' work with the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many lawmakers concerned about a cash shortage expected  
to face Medicare in less than a decade support even tighter 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not time for a victory lap,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,  
D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals received the most improper Medicare payments in 1998 --  
$2.8 billion for care involving overnight stays and $1.2 billion 
for outpatient care. Home health care companies showed the biggest 
improvement, with overpayments dropping to $800 million from $2.5 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors did not immediately attempt to distinguish between  
attempts to defraud the government and simple errors in their 
report -- although they are following up each individual case. The 
most common problem found -- accounting for $7 billion in improper 
payments -- was that services provided were not considered medically 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	In one example, a home health care company was paid $1,198 for  
25 nursing visits to a woman, although auditors found she was able 
to drive and therefore not homebound -- a requirement for Medicare 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly fewer cases were found than in the past of  
insufficient documentation in medical records required to support 
Medicare bills. Auditors said that may be due in part to the fact 
that they were more aggressive in chasing that documentation down. 
</P>
<P>
	Incorrect reporting of codes representing the severity of  
patients' medical conditions -- which can affect Medicare payment 
levels in some situations -- continues to cost Medicare more than $2 
billion annually.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Profits Fall 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reuters Group PLC announced Tuesday its pretax  
profits fell 7 percent last year and the company forecast lower 
sales growth in 1999 because of a downturn in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The news and financial information provider's pretax profit fell  
to 580 million pounds ($928 million) in 1998 from 626 million 
pounds in 1997. The 1998 results were reduced by 51 million pounds 
to cover acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 5 percent to 3.03 billion pounds ($4.85 billion)  
from 2.88 billion pounds, due to gains in Europe, Africa and the 
Middle East and strong volume on its Instinet electronic trading 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	But revenue from the Asia-Pacific region dropped 6 percent for  
the year, and chief executive Peter Job predicted Reuters' overall 
revenue growth would slow in 1999 amid weakness in Asian and Latin 
American markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blowout in the emerging markets has not gone away, but  
hopefully it won't repeat itself in the same way,'' Job said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Out 3-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After playing only two games for his new team,  
Latrell Sprewell will be out of action again. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will be sidelined 3-6 weeks with a stress fracture of  
his right heel, the New York Knicks announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Sprewell said. `I had every  
intention of suiting up to play (Wednesday), but the injury was 
more than I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell sat out the final 15 minutes of practice Monday and the  
entire practice Tuesday. An X-ray and a CT scan failed to show the 
injury, but an MRI exam disclosed a tiny fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known exactly how Sprewell suffered the injury. He  
scored only five points in his regular-season home debut Sunday, 
shooting 2-for-12 in a loss to Miami that dropped New York's record 
to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell scored 24 points in his first game, a loss at Orlando  
on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a microscopic fracture of the heel,'' team physician  
Dr. Norman Scott said. ``No surgery will be required. Latrell will 
wear a walking boot, also known as a removable cast, to provide 
stress relief. He will continue conditioning on the bike and in the 
pool. This will have no long-term effect on his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who were using Sprewell as their starting small  
forward, were struggling to incorporate him into their offense. The 
three-time All-Star found himself forcing shots in New York's first 
two games, and several of his attempts Sunday missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's out of the lineup, the Knicks may move Larry  
Johnson to small forward and insert Kurt Thomas into the starting 
lineup at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly for Latrell, but the reality is we now have to  
get ready to face Washington without him,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said in a statement released by the team. ``We expect Latrell's 
rehabilitation to go smoothly so he can get back in the lineup as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired Jan. 21 from Golden State for John Starks,  
Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, received the longest non-drug 
related suspension in league history last season -- 68 games -- for 
attacking and choking his former coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be frustrating to have to watch from the  
sidelines after such a long time away, but we have a great group of 
players who I'm confident will be successful,'' Sprewell said.

<HEADLINE> IBM, Record Companies Battle Bootleggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The record industry has launched the latest  
salvo in its war with Internet music pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Five leading record companies are teaming with IBM to test a new  
technology that lets people quickly record CD-quality albums off 
the Internet, while trying to protect the copyrights of musicians 
and their labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The test announced Monday is the first major step in an industry  
effort to develop security standards for digital music sales, while 
battling increasingly popular technology that lets people easily 
download free and often illegally copied songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales now represent just a tiny fraction of the  
$12 billion music industry. The major record companies hope they 
can outdo the online bootleggers by offering better-quality sound 
and greater choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial offers an extraordinary window on the future of the  
music business,'' said Roger Faxon, senior vice president of 
business development at EMI, whose music catalog includes the 
Beatles, Janet Jackson and Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the spring, IBM's new technology will be tested  
over six months by about 1,000 people in San Diego. BMG 
Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group will create an online 
music store with more than 2,000 albums. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have not yet determined how much to charge. But it  
shouldn't cost any more than buying a CD from a local record store, 
said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at technology research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to gauge consumer interest by charging a  
premium for this stuff,'' Mooradian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM system would allow people to order songs or entire  
albums over the Internet, then store and play them on their 
computer. Customers will also be able to download an album's cover 
art and liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology will include encryption coding to foil pirates  
who would copy the songs and distribute them over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback is that the only way for the consumer to transfer  
the music out of the computer is to buy a CD recording device, 
which generally costs anywhere from $150 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniel Lee, a 27-year-old lawyer from London, said Monday he  
would still be interested because the expense of the CD recorder 
would be offset by the convenience of online shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would assume they would keep a massive database, so you  
would be able to get something you ordinarily wouldn't find in the 
stores,'' Lee said as he browsed through Mick Jagger CDs in a 
Manhattan record store. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference announcing the test, an IBM executive  
downloaded the Dave Matthews Band album ``Crash'' in about three 
minutes, and recorded it onto a CD in about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The test initially will include only computer users with  
high-speed cable TV modems -- a tiny fraction of Internet-surfing 
public. Eventually a service for more common, but slower, telephone 
modems will be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies hope industrywide security standards will be  
ready in time for the next holiday season. They are trying to 
combat a technology called MP3 that is gaining popularity as a way 
to easily store and distribute audio on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While some MP3 songs being distributed on the Internet are legal  
and endorsed by record labels, the amount of bootlegged material 
has grown rapidly. Once downloaded, an MP3 file can be copied 
endlessly and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. was one of several  
technology companies that pledged in December to help the music 
industry develop security standards. Others include AT&AMP;T Corp., 
America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Toshiba Corp.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Coffee Exports Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's coffee exports are up sharply  
from a year ago and are expected to soar this month, reflecting the 
recent currency devaluation that has reduced the price of beans the 
world's leading coffee producer sells on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports last month totaled 1.39 million bags, each weighing 132  
pounds, the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters reported 
Tuesday. While that was the lowest monthly total since the crop 
year began in July, shipments were up 68 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	With a lower price, the federation predicts coffee shipments  
will nearly double to 1.8 million bags in February from 955,500 
bags a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the rising volume of shipments, the nearly $170  
million earned from January exports was barely changed from the 
$168.7 million of January 1998. That's because the average price 
per bag in January was $121.50, compared to $202.70 a bag a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency, the real, was devalued Jan. 13 and has since  
plunged about 37 percent against the dollar, making Brazilian 
commodities less expensive on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's current crop is estimated at 34.6 million bags, the  
largest in 10 years. The government calculates the harvest in the 
1999-2000 harvest at 23.1 million bags.

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker To Sell 2 U.S. Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The huge drug maker SmithKline Beecham PLC is  
selling its U.S. pharmacy-benefits and clinical-lab businesses for 
nearly $2 billion and plans to cut 3,000 jobs, or 5.2 percent of 
its work force, within four years. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham chief executive Jan Leschly said today the  
sales reflected the company's desire to focus on its pharmaceutical 
and consumer healthcare businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also anounced a restructuring that will cost $750  
million through 2002 and yield $200 million in savings per year 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will lead to the loss of 3,000 jobs by the end of  
2002, most of them in manufacturing operations, the company said. 
SmithKline currently employs about 58,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ending up after these announcements with a stronger  
company, and a more focused company,'' Leschly said at a news 
conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects 13 percent earnings growth this year.  
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline, which has its U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia,  
said that Quest Diagnostics Inc., based in Teterboro, N.J., was 
buying its Clinical Laboratories business for $1.27 billion. That 
includes $1.025 billion cash plus a 29.5 percent stake in Quest 
worth $245 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical Laboratories is based in Collegeville, Pa., and employs  
11,400 people in its network. In 1998, the company earned $179 
million on net sales of $1.55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline is also selling Diversified Pharmaceutical Services,  
based in Minneapolis to Express Scripts Inc., from St. Louis for 
$700 million cash. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham paid $2.3 billion for Diversified  
Pharmaceutical in 1994. The company said the post-tax loss on the 
deal was about $713.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Film Documentary Market Said Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A boom in history-based television productions  
is opening new markets for filmmakers, making the past more 
accessible for viewers and pushing a once low-profile art form 
toward television's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	At a weekend meeting in Washington, documentary filmmakers said  
the growth of new markets on such channels as A&AMP;E, the History 
Channel and the Discovery Channel is a blessing, even if some of 
the work is not as in-depth as traditional documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's best-known documentary filmmakers agrees  
that the channels are valuable because they offer outlets for 
documentaries. But he cautioned in a phone interview Monday that as 
these new markets have production and time pressures that work 
against some of the most valuable aspects of the in-depth 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite often, the demands of a commercial network are in  
opposition to the complexity and intelligence of a documentary 
film,'' said Ken Burns, whose 1990 series ``The Civil War'' set 
records for public television viewership. 
</P>
<P>
	A disadvantage of commercial television is the frequent  
interruptions for advertisements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a clicker generation, as soon as an ad comes on, people  
fly,'' Burns said. ``Because the cable audience is so small, there 
is not a huge budget for these. There is a more superficial, more 
journalistic approach, rather than working for five years on 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Moore, a director of photography on several of Burns'  
projects, said in an interview that not all documentary producers 
can get the kind of money raised by Burns for popular projects, 
such as his works on the Civil War and baseball. But the growth of 
the market for documentaries is good for the industry, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we can expand our audience to the value of  
documentary material, the better off we'll all be in the long 
run,'' Moore said. It's not fair to compare the longer Burns series 
to cable shows produced more quickly, such as the ones on A&AMP;E's 
popular ``Biography'' series, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most American viewers want material that is intelligent and  
informative. But they don't always want to watch a production that 
runs over several days, said filmmaker Nina Seavey, a co-producer 
of the film: ``A Paralyzing Fear: The Story of Polio in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She questioned whether filmmakers given a rushed schedule and  
limited budgets will have the time to question the complexity of 
their film's topic ``and then express that complexity in an 
intelligent way.''

<HEADLINE> Papillon Wins at Westminster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smallest dog proved the biggest and best of  
them all as a dainty papillon floated to victory Tuesday as 
best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club's 123rd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-pound dog -- who came within a whisker of the prize in 1996  
-- lived up to his own name, Loteki's Supernatural Being, and his 
breed's name, French for butterfly, as he flew around the ring with 
handler-owner John Oulton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st best-in-show for Kirby, at 8 years old a veteran  
of the show ring. He also collected top prize this summer at the 
World Championship in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helsinki was incredible, of course, there were 16,000 dogs,''  
Oulton said. ``But I think this is really, for me, the top, top 
award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Edd Embry Bivin praised all seven finalists, chosen Monday  
and earlier Tuesday to represent their breed groups, but said Kirby 
stood head and batlike ears above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a pack that was really something to see,''  
he said. ``This little dog was so on for this night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby came in second to a clumber spaniel in 1996, then didn't  
even win his breed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, unlike most Westminster winners, he won't retire to the  
home he shares with Oulton and 10 other pets in Norwalk, Conn., 
though Oulton already limits him to a few shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never retire this dog because he loves to show so  
much,'' he said. ``He may make two or three appearances a year just 
to let him have the fun of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby was chosen from among 2,500 dogs representing 152 breeds.  
Westminster is essentially a beauty contest: The dogs are judged 
solely on how they meet the American Kennel Club standards for 
their breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other group winners chosen Monday and Tuesday were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Non-sporting: Lake Cove That's My Boy, a standard poodle who  
also won the group last year, owned by longtime Westminster 
exhibitor Mrs. Alan Robson of Glenmoore, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrier: Sunspryte's Just In Thyme, a Welsh terrier owned by  
comedian Bill Cosby with Jean Heath and Beth Bates of Pleasanton, 
Calif. Another Cosby-Heath dog, the Lakeland terrier Revelry's 
Awesome Blossom, was fourth in the group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Working: Mentmore's Windy Meadow, a 3-year-old Bernese  
mountain dog owned by Cheryl Paterson of London, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sporting: Bit O Gold Titan Treasure, who also won the group in  
1997 and 1998. The Gordon setter is is owned by Susan Lubrand, 
Barry Rose, Judy Brown and Peggy Nowak of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hound: Sundown Alabster Treasure, a graceful saluki owned by  
James D. Black of San Andreas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Herding: Windwalker's Yes Virginia, a German shepherd who beat  
the old English sheepdog that won the group last year. The 
4-year-old dog belongs to Jamie Walker and Joe Greer of 
Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> INS Detainees To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service plans to  
release 1,500 immigrants with nonviolent criminal records to ease 
what a spokesman called overcrowding in its Eastern Region 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Dan Kane said the detained immigrants will be  
released Monday, the Miami Herald reported today. The 1,500 people 
represent nearly one-fourth of all detainees in the region that 
includes Florida and 24 other states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will release only those immigrants who INS believes,  
following a thorough case-by-case review, are not a threat to 
public safety in Miami or any other community around the nation,'' 
Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will not release ``terrorists, rapists or murderers,  
or any other violent criminals into the community,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, INS has about 16,000 people in custody, triple the  
number it had before Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration 
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That act made it almost impossible for legal immigrants  
convicted of certain nonviolent crimes to stay in the United 
States. It also required the INS to detain those immigrants instead 
of allowing the release of those who are not believed to pose any 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had a two-year grace period during which it was not  
required to lock up such immigrants. But that expired last year, 
and Congress rejected the agency's request to extend the grace 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The housing crunch is worst in the agency's Eastern Region, Kane  
said. There is funding for 5,434 beds, but the INS is detaining 
6,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We no longer have space and we have to create space,'' Kane  
said. ``We did not receive appropriate funding to carry our 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INS will release the immigrants to their families or  
nongovernmental agencies with contacts with the agency. They will 
be required to report regularly to local deportation officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane said detention centers throughout the region will keep  
immigrant felons as long as there is space, but if the agency runs 
into a situation where they need space again, they will release 
more people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unhappy With Japan Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed  
unhappiness with a lack of progress after two days of talks with 
Japanese negotiators about eliminating regulatory barriers U.S. 
firms believe are keeping them from expanding sales in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries hope to reach concrete agreements in such areas  
as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and construction by the end 
of March. But U.S. officials said the Japanese side had shown 
little willingness to put forward meaningful deregulation proposals 
during discussions that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. wants Japan to take steps to open its economy, said a  
senior U.S. trade official who spoke to reporters on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated the administration's position that Japan must do  
more to remove trade barriers at a time when the Asian financial 
crisis is pushing the U.S. trade deficit to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, aimed at forcing Japan to remove various regulations  
that hinder foreign companies, were started in June 1997. President 
Clinton and then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced a 
breakthrough in several areas last May when the two leaders were in 
Birmingham, England, for the annual economic summit of industrial 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since then U.S. officials have complained that Japan  
has been slow to implement its promises and reluctant to go forward 
with a second phase of deregulation. In October, the United States 
put forward new proposals with a goal of reaching a new agreement 
by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is hoping for results before Japanese Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi makes his first visit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said discussions aimed at achieving new agreements  
will continue in the first week of March when a U.S. delegation led 
by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher visits Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators have focused on implementation of a new law  
removing restrictions on the location of large retail stores, 
something the United States has been pressing Japan to accomplish 
for years in the belief that establishment of bigger discount 
stores would make more U.S.-made products available to Japanese 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other issues in dispute are high telephone connection  
charges that Japanese companies have been imposing to keep U.S. 
telecommunications firms out of the market and lengthy regulatory 
procedures for getting new drugs approved for sale in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Prince Splits With IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, the  
heir to the Dutch throne, has suspended his work as an IOC member 
to distance himself from the widening Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said Tuesday the prince will not  
resume Olympic activities until after a special meeting in March of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear, however, precisely what IOC work awaited the  
prince in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The prince's position in the IOC has been in question in the  
Dutch parliament since accusations surfaced last year of bribery 
and corruption in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The prince is in no way implicated in the scandal but  
parliamentarians fear he could be damaged by association with the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has called a special March 17-18 at which its members  
will vote on proposals to change the selection process for host 
cities and expel members tied to the Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special sitting of the IOC will have to clarify whether  
the organization has the power to clean up its act and is therefore 
crucial for the question of whether the Prince of Orange will be 
able to continue his activities in the interests of international 
sport within the IOC,'' Kok wrote in a letter to parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The prince will reassess his IOC role, as will the Dutch  
government, after the March meeting. An IOC spokesman said the 
organization respects the prince's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands Olympic Committee said it understood  
Willem-Alexander's decision but hoped he would soon be able to 
return to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Willem-Alexander was invited to join the IOC a year ago  
at the Nagano Olympics.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Work on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hoping to boost their  
popularity are honing a post-impeachment agenda, but they remain 
divided over tax cuts and whether to break spending limits enacted 
just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders told House GOP lawmakers at their retreat in  
Williamsburg, Va., last week that the party was lagging in the 
polls, in part due to the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
Internal GOP surveys showed voters preferring Democratic 
congressional candidates over Republicans by 46 to 39 percent, a 
Clinton approval rating of 70 percent, and Congress' disapproval at 
51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried, but everything we say right now is smothered by  
the impeachment message,'' Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who heads the 
House GOP's campaign operation, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 elections 21 months away, Davis said Republicans  
have time to correct things. But for now, he and others are warning 
colleagues that they could lose House control in next year's voting 
unless they aggressively formulate and execute a legislative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's impeachment trial of Clinton is likely to end this  
week with the president's acquittal. House GOP leaders hope to move 
quickly to budget and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Williamsburg meetings found Republicans disagreeing over  
specifics, especially when it comes to the GOP's top-tier issue of 
cutting taxes, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blow to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,  
R-Ohio, many Republicans voiced opposition to his plan for cutting 
income-tax rates by 10 percent across the board. Some complained 
that the proposal would be an easy target for Democrats arguing 
that Republicans were helping the rich, since better off taxpayers 
would benefit most because they pay higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservatives prefer eliminating the so-called marriage  
penalty, under which millions of married people pay higher taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense that for an across-the-board reduction in  
rates, there's not a lot of support for that,'' said Rep. Jerry 
Weller, R-Ill., a sponsor of legislation to end the marriage 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some moderates and conservatives prefer holding off on tax cuts  
and using the projected flood of annual budget surpluses to reduce 
the accumulated $5.6 trillion national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public understands this,'' said moderate Rep. Fred Upton,  
R-Mich. ``They don't want to see us spend the surplus away; they 
don't want to see it all on tax cuts either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across-the-board tax cuts have been endorsed by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	But key segments of the GOP's base prefer more-targeted  
alternatives. Small business and farmers would like elimination of 
estate taxes, while religious conservatives favor eliminating the 
marriage penalty. Leaders of the Family Research Council and other 
social conservative groups planned a news conference for today 
touting elimination of the marriage penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Pew poll last month, when people were asked what  
to do with the surplus, 50 percent favored using it for Social 
Security, 21 percent favored using it for domestic spending, 14 
percent favored tax cuts, 12 percent preferred paying off the 
national debt and 3 percent didn't answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, a potential GOP presidential candidate, hopes his  
committee will vote on a 2000 budget by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute also rages over whether to exceed spending limits  
enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing pact with President Clinton. 
That agreement set a $536 billion limit for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for this year ended up nearly $30 billion above that  
amount. That plus both parties' desires to boost defense and maybe 
education spending next year is pressuring lawmakers to exceed that 
cap -- a tough spot for a GOP that for years has insisted on cutting 
spending and shrinking government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's where the budget hawks and defense hawks kind of run into  
one another,'' said Rep. Robert Ehrlich, R-Md.

<HEADLINE> Browns Need Some Expansion Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns have done their homework  
and are going into the expansion draft armed with pages of scouting 
reports, medical profiles and the inside dope on 150 of the NFL's 
most unwanted players. 
</P>
<P>
	After all that, picking the right ones might involve more luck  
than research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for needle-in-a-haystack-type players,'' said  
Dwight Clark, the Browns' football operations director. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's expansion draft day has arrived, and the Browns were  
to add more names to their roster today. They are choosing from a 
list of players deemed overpaid, underachieving or over the hill by 
the league's 30 other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns aren't looking for Pro Bowlers or Hall of Famers.  
They're searching for bodies, preferably ones who will be around 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to go with young guys who can be ready in two or  
three years,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be tough to do when considering that of the 66 total  
players taken by Jacksonville and Carolina in the 1995 expansion 
draft, four remain on either team's rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and the Browns are starting to feel better about the first  
and less important of their two player drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 150 players from whom Cleveland can choose didn't look very  
appealing at first to Clark, who knew little or nothing about them. 
</P>
<P>
	But after spending hours breaking down game films, making phone  
calls and dissecting the list, Clark is convinced he can find some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I initially looked at the list, it didn't blow me away,''  
Clark said. ``But some of the players I had not been that familiar 
with. Ultimately, you start digging in and finding more information 
about them. That's when you start getting excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excited about the expansion draft?  
</P>
<P>
	It may be hard for the rest of the league to believe, but  
Cleveland is pumped. After a three-year hiatus, the NFL is back in 
football-mad northern Ohio. And to trumpet the Browns' rebirth, the 
league decided to conduct the expansion draft in the birthplace of 
pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	All 4,000 tickets made available for the event at the Canton  
Civic Center were scooped up quickly by Browns fans, who haven't 
been able to get together and cheer for their beloved team in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dawg Pound will be out in full force, woofing for each of  
the Browns' selections during the 2 1/2-hour draft, to be carried live 
by ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	The players who have the Browns most excited have small  
contracts and big potential. Cleveland inherits a player's 
contract, so dollar figures are as important as rushing average and 
sack totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for guys with an up side,'' Browns coach Chris  
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some big-name players available -- Denver's Darrien  
Gordon and Neil Smith, Green Bay's Robert Brooks and Reggie White, 
the Jets' Glenn Foley, Oakland's Desmond Howard and Washington's 
Gus Frerotte -- but all come with some kind of baggage. They're 
either overpaid, underachieving, injured or, in White's case, 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at some of the names and, from that side of the  
table, you say, `That guy's a no-brainer, they have to take him,''' 
Clark said. ``But when you look a little closer, you start to 
understand why a guy might be on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who can begin signing free agents Friday, probably  
will use the expansion draft to load up on offensive lineman. There 
are several good ones available, including Detroit center-guard Jim 
Pyne, New England guard Todd Rucci, Chicago tackle Andy Heck, Miami 
tackle Jeff Buckey, Baltimore guard Ben Cavil and Minnesota tackle 
Scott Rehberg. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the list of players, the NFL gave the Browns a  
list of rules. Among the most important are: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cleveland will have three minutes to make a selection and can  
take 30 to 42 players. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Browns must use 38 percent of their salary cap (expected  
to be $57.5 million) on players they pick. 
</P>
<P>
	--After the Browns select a player, that player's team will have  
two minutes to decide if it wants to pull back one of the four 
remaining players it has left unprotected. However, teams can 
choose to leave all of their players available. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Browns can trade a player they select, but not back to the  
player's previous team.

<HEADLINE> Skater Allen Climbing Back to Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The hours of rehab turned into days, weeks  
and months for Damon Allen. There were the usual moments of doubt, 
which he wiped away with more hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Allen has a healthy knee and a realistic shot at a medal at  
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have ruined two of his last three seasons, just when  
Allen was progressing through the strong ranks of American men. 
Those ranks have thinned in this post-Olympic year, and Allen hopes 
he can hold off the next wave of quadruple-jumping kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty down having to take the year off,'' Allen said  
Tuesday, when nationals began with the compulsory ice dance. ``I'd 
done it two years before that with a stress fracture in my knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have learned a lot of lessons, that you've got to keep  
persevering, keep being determined to pull back to the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top spot seems reserved for Michael Weiss, the runner-up the  
last two years to Todd Eldredge. Everything else is wide open, and 
Allen believes a place on the U.S. team for next month's world 
championships in Helsinki, Finland, is attainable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was third in the Finlandia Trophy on the rink they'll use  
for worlds,'' he said. ``When I was there, I bought this set of 
glasses and I already have broken two. So I have to go back and 
finish the set back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even thinking about nationals or worlds was painful a year ago.  
Allen, in the midst of rehabilitation from surgery on his right 
knee, worked for the U.S. Figure Skating Association at the 
Philadelphia nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two guys who made it were really good, but nationals were  
tough for me,'' he said. ``Other than the top two, the others 
really weren't all that wonderful. I thought, `Oh, man, I could be 
on the podium, I could be third.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was trying to get healthy again. Allen needed nearly  
three months after surgery on Oct. 2, 1997 before he could perform 
before an audience, at a show in his native Rockford, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about eight weeks after the surgery, in December, that  
I got back on the ice in Colorado Springs,'' he said. ``That was 
just 10 minutes of steps on the ice, just stroking. It was like, 
`Thank God I'm back on.' It was very sweet to get my blades back on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go really slow and it is really hard for me. I always  
was, `Oh, it felt really good, I'll try one more thing.' They had 
to harness me pretty much, keep me on a very restrictive pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That meant no spins for the first two weeks back on ice, and no  
major footwork. It meant no testing jumps. For a top-level skater 
such as Allen, it meant taking baby steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really didn't come strongly back until April-May, a good  
six months of full recovery,'' he said. ``I had no coordination in 
the air, I kind of lost a lot of that, my quickness and snap in 
jumps and that took the most time in coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first double axel was a sweet reward: I can still do  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How much can he do this week?  
</P>
<P>
	``My main goal is to have a lot of wins through the week. Find  
the good in each practice session and enjoy the week. I won't have 
my mind set on the short program and the long program. A really 
good week would be great practices and stay focused on my job and 
have two strong programs. I am feeling very ready.''

<HEADLINE> Ng Jury Begins Deliberations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Jurors have begun deliberating 12  
counts of murder against Charles Ng, more than 14 years after men, 
women and children disappeared in what prosecutors say was a 
sex-slavery ring that ended in death. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old British subject from Hong Kong is accused of  
helping a fugitive friend, Leonard Lake, kill seven men, three 
women and two baby boys in Calaveras County in 1984 and 1985. His 
case has become California's longest homicide prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was expected to be the first full day of deliberation for  
the nine-woman, three-man jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors must decide whether he is guilty of first-degree murder,  
which could result in capital punishment, guilty of second-degree 
murder or innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, prosecutor Sharlene Honnaka reminded jurors of  
videotape segments they have seen time and again since the trial 
began Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes show Ng and Lake taunting and threatening two  
handcuffed women in 1985 at Lake's house in Wilseyville, 150 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng last month took his attorneys by surprise, testifying in his  
own defense. He portrayed himself as subservient to the older Lake 
but said he wouldn't kill anyone for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's testimony opened the way for Honnaka to introduce new  
evidence, including cartoons drawn by Ng showing babies being 
smashed, drowned, fried in a wok or put in a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with his artwork, Ng said the cartoons were merely a  
satire on the charges against him and that they had no basis in 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all adds up to Lake,'' defense attorney Lewis Clapp said in  
his final argument. Ng's attorneys have blamed all the murders on 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake committed suicide in jail in 1985. South San Francisco  
police had begun questioning Lake after he and Ng were spotted 
shoplifting at a building supply store. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake left behind plans to kidnap and make women subservient to  
his sadistic fantasies. Victims' remains were found buried around 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng went to Canada, where he fought extradition for six years.  
There, prosecutors say, he told of the murders to a fellow inmate.

<HEADLINE> Browns Need Some Expansion Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns have done their homework  
and are going into the expansion draft armed with pages of scouting 
reports, medical profiles and the inside dope on 150 of the NFL's 
most unwanted players. 
</P>
<P>
	After all that, picking the right ones might involve more luck  
than research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for needle-in-a-haystack-type players,'' said  
Dwight Clark, the Browns' football operations director. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's expansion draft day has arrived, and the Browns were

<HEADLINE> Day Trading Worries NASD Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of Wall Street's self-policing group  
is asking brokerage firms to report on any problems arising from 
day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zarb, the chairman and chief executive the National  
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, said in a letter to NASD members dated last Thursday that 
``investors must be made to understand what they are getting 
into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb noted the ``sometimes frenetic'' electronic stock trading  
in recent weeks and the rising number of amateur day traders -- who 
he said ``may not be able to absorb the risk'' when they are 
extended credit to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless trading firms respond appropriately, Zarb warned, ``we  
increase investor risk, with some losing savings that they cannot 
afford to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading has attracted a small but growing breed of investors  
-- estimated at a few thousand nationwide -- many of whom have 
abandoned their regular jobs for the prospect of quick riches. Day 
traders seek out stocks solely for their sharp price swings, buying 
and selling them quickly to capitalize on the short-term movement 
in price and rarely holding a position overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities regulators have expressed concern that some  
day-trading companies, which sell training courses and specialized 
software and provide computer work space to investors, could be 
misleading them about potential profits and causing them to get in 
over their heads. State regulators have stepped up their scrutiny 
of day-trading firms and a handful, particularly in Massachusetts, 
have filed fraud charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Zarb cited reports that some trading firms may be  
extending credit inappropriately and that a few have set up 
``pools'' in which they combine different day-trading investors' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, some firms are encouraging investors to  
cover each other's trading debts at the end of the day ``so that 
everything looks fine by the time regulators scrutinize their 
books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While certain of this activity may technically be within the  
letter of the law, it is not within the spirit of what should be 
our mutual goal of protecting investors,'' Zarb wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, warned recently that day trading can be ``highly 
risky'' for Main Street investors, who should engage in it only 
``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed dismay at 
stories he had heard of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading companies acknowledge it's not for  
everyone, but they say it can give financial freedom to ordinary 
people who study and learn trading techniques. They maintain the 
regulators are unfairly tarnishing their industry because of a few 
rogue firms that may have misled investors about what kind of money 
they could make.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Calls 'Teletubby' Gay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell is trying to out  
Tinky Winky, suggesting that the purple, purse-toting character on 
television's popular ``Teletubbies'' children's show is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., which licenses the  
Teletubbies in the United States, said the purse is actually Tinky 
Winky's magic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay,''  
Steve Rice said. ``It's a children's show, folks. To think we would 
be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of 
outlandish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The February edition of the National Liberty Journal, edited and  
published by Falwell, contains an article warning parents that the 
rotund Teletubby with the triangular antenna may be a gay role 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	To support its claim, the publication says Tinky Winky has the  
voice of a boy but carries a purse. ``He is purple -- the gay-pride 
color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle -- the gay-pride 
symbol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell contends the ``subtle depictions'' are intentional and  
issued a statement Tuesday that said, ``As a Christian I feel that 
role modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British show aimed at toddlers began airing on U.S. public  
television stations last spring. The Teletubbies are portrayed by 
actors in oversized, brightly colored costumes. They all have 
television screens on their tummies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said Falwell was attacking ``something sweet and innocent''  
to further his conservative political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell's spokeswoman, Laura Swickard, said the founder of the  
now-defunct Moral Majority agreed with everything that was in the 
NLJ article and would not comment beyond his one-paragraph 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Can Fight While Serving Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson can resume his boxing career while  
in jail, but he'll need the permission of the judge who sentenced 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion can begin training at a gym  
outside jail if he behaves during the first two months or so of his 
one-year sentence for assaulting two motorists, Montgomery County, 
Md., officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Tyson wants to travel out of state to fight, he would  
have to be cleared by District Judge Stephen Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to have a fight, they would petition the judge,''  
prosecutor Douglas Gansler said. ``It's not atypical. People do it 
all the time for weddings, funerals or sometimes for work-related 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been scheduled to fight an undetermined opponent April  
24 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no contest stemming from the August fender  
bender, has been in the Montgomery County jail since Friday. Shelly 
Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said those who have visited the boxer 
describe him as ``depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect a sentence of this severity at all,'' Finkel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, a prisoner with Tyson's sentence would serve about 60  
days in the jail before being transferred to the county's 
pre-release center, where inmates can leave during the day for work 
and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any person who has a profession, we would make sure they could  
continue their work,'' Department of Corrections spokeswoman Claire 
Gunster-Kirby said. ``We would work with Mr. Tyson or anyone to 
make they could continue in their profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Tyson could train at a gym and later earn other  
privileges, such as home visits during the day to spend time with 
his wife, Gunster-Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing hearing, witnesses said Tyson had $20  
million in debts, mostly to the IRS, and would need to fight three 
or four times this year to pay them off. 
</P>
<P>
	At 32, Tyson is nearing the twilight of his boxing career even  
if it had not been interrupted by two jail sentences and a 
suspension for biting Evander Holyfield's ear during their 1997 
title bout. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unlikely Tyson would have time to train for his April 24  
bout if he remains in jail the full 60 days before transferring to 
the pre-release center. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if Tyson appeals his sentence he could face a jury  
trial and a potentially harsher sentence if convicted. Tyson's 
lawyers, who have 30 days to appeal, did not return calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel said the lawyers want to see what action, if any, will be  
taken in Indiana, where Tyson remains on probation until March for 
a 1992 rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's Indiana probation officer, George Walker, said the  
Maryland jail sentence would not automatically lead to a probation 
violation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the way, we might get everyone together and  
say, `Hey, do we really want a big circus in town to do something 
with him, or can we do something without a hearing and save a lot 
of taxpayer money?''' Walker told The Washington Post. ``There are 
different ways of working on it.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Lean Against Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans expressed a willingness  
Tuesday to let President Clinton walk away from his impeachment 
ordeal with an acquittal, leaving judgment of his conduct to 
history rather than any Senate-approved rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. Some Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're 
``seeking cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of censuring Clinton -- either immediately following  
his trial or later -- has strong Republican opposition but remains 
on life support with backing of most Democrats and a handful of GOP 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But to have a such a measure considered in the 100-member  
Senate, supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected 
stalling action by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the leading 
opponent of a censure resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings on a censure are expected to become intense immediately  
after the Senate renders a verdict on the impeachment charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. With 67 votes needed for 
conviction and removal of the president, both parties agree that 
acquittal is virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, has been  
drafting and redrafting censure language with the help of 
Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah. They would not release 
their latest language, which likely would change again anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has threatened to offer innumerable amendments to any such  
resolution, an approach that could amount to a filibuster, 
requiring 60 votes to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Censure to Gramm is a ``covering your fanny approach'' -- letting  
those who want to acquit Clinton on impeachment still express 
disapproval of his behavior. Gramm has said it's not allowed by the 
Constitution and would set a dangerous precedent for the future 
concerning the separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent a hard nose-count, Republicans disagreed on the prospects  
for censure. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the proposal 
``is waning as an option -- alive but on life support.'' But Sen. 
John Chafee, R-R.I., cautioned that ``No one should be compiling a 
dirge over censure; if anything, I believe we are picking up 
support on the both sides of the aisle....'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of GOP senators Tuesday morning, worries that  
Democrats would use censure as political cover after acquittal was 
``raised by some of the Republicans,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, 
R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are aware of that thinking. Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,  
said he needs no political cover: ``I just had my election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he could support a censure  
resolution only ``if the language would refer'' to the perjury and 
obstruction language in the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not likely, since Democrats have expressed strong  
opposition to a declaration that Clinton committed impeachable 
offenses -- especially after the Senate fails to reach the 
two-thirds majority to convict the president and remove him from 
office. A censure resolution would only need a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the large procedural hurdles facing a censure  
resolution dim prospects for consideration immediately after the 
impeachment verdict, Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota 
has set in motion a possible procedural vote that could allow 
Democrats to express themselves. He also has talked of trying to 
attach censure language to legislation after senators return from 
next week's week-long recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said it would be extremely difficult to return to  
such an unpleasant subject as Clinton's conduct once the lawmakers 
are concentrating on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets more difficult to pass'' after the recess, said Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It becomes an exercise in futility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a member of the Democratic leadership, Sen. Robert  
Torricelli of New Jersey, said the censure issue is ``not time 
sensitive. I don't even think we should try (this week). We should 
do it when we return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, signed on to censure after winning  
support for language that would declare Clinton could not be 
treated differently than any other citizen after he leaves office 
and that no future Congress could override the censure. A censure 
of President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s was overturned by a 
subsequent Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell acknowledged that many  
in his party ``think it's a bad idea,'' but added: ``I'm open to a 
censure alternative. What you could end up with is having a 
bipartisan acquittal which can lead to a good deal of celebration 
downtown'' at the White House.

<HEADLINE> NBC Pays To Settle Rivera Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has agreed to pay $10,000 to a lawyer who  
claimed Geraldo Rivera reneged on a promise to pay the sum to 
anyone who could prove a person had been prosecuted for lying about 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera issued the sex-perjury challenge Sept. 24 on the CNBC  
television show ``Rivera Live'' that was devoted to analysis of the 
investigations of President Clinton's relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokesman John Brine said the network will pay Mark Bogatin  
rather than slog through a lengthy legal fight, even though it 
``continues to believe that none of the claims have satisfied the 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely a business decision,'' Brine said Tuesday.  
``Geraldo strongly disagrees with NBC's decision to settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, a lawyer, contended the investigation of Clinton for  
allegedly lying about his sexual conduct was unprecedented and that 
criminal prosecutions are simply not brought for lies about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogatin said he found five cases and sent them to Rivera. The  
show failed to pay, and he sued. Bogatin said the network's 
decision to settle ``represents an acknowledgment that Rivera was 
wrong to deny my claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has paid $10,000 to Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing, a  
husband-wife lawyer team in Washington, because cases they 
submitted met the criteria of the challenge, Brine said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney, and his wife, a former Justice  
Department official, frequently appear on television as 
conservative commentators. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple donated the money to the Ronald McDonald House, Brine  
said.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Cut Brown on Payroll Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Offensive tackle Jamie Brown, an  
expensive acquisition who flopped with the San Francisco 49ers, was 
released Tuesday as part of the team's effort to cut the payroll 
and comply with the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's release provided $2.3 million in relief for the 49ers,  
who began the week about $13 million over next season's projected 
$57.5 million cap. Teams must be at or under the cap by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players in danger of being released because of the 49ers'  
cap crunch include safety Merton Hanks and guard Kevin Gogan, both 
former Pro Bowlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining to provide specifics, general manager Bill Walsh also  
said the 49ers have restructured the contracts of wide receiver 
Jerry Rice and linebacker Lee Woodall. The team also is reworking 
the deals of safety Tim McDonald, linebacker Winfred Tubbs and 
Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers realized an additional $3 million in cap savings when  
cornerback Antonio Langham, a free-agent disappointment with San 
Francisco, was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the expansion 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh was in the middle of a conference  
call with reporters discussing the 49ers' cap status when he 
learned the Browns had used their 37th pick on Langham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have a steak dinner tonight,'' Walsh exulted.  
``No, I was just teasing. I wish him well in Cleveland and I think 
he'll do OK. He had some good years there and with his experience 
he could be a mainstay for them. It just didn't work out here. But 
the cap factor was critical to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was acquired from Denver last April in exchange for the  
49ers' 1999 second-round pick. Walsh said for all of the cap 
savings achieved by his release, knowing the team wasted a 
second-round pick on him was tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big hole in our draft. We're going to miss that  
pick,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Projected as a starting left tackle, Brown fell behind almost  
from the moment he joined San Francisco, missing most of training 
camp due to a persistent groin strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and team management feuded over how hard he worked on his  
rehabilitation and he wound up being suspended three weeks for 
conduct detrimental to the team after he skipped a preseason game 
and showed up late for another. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Mariucci wanted to cut Brown immediately after he  
came off suspension, but former general manager Dwight Clark, who 
pulled the trigger on the trade, persuaded Mariucci to give Brown 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of injury problems, the 49ers were forced to give Brown  
five starts, but he played poorly, including one outing in which he 
was repeatedly beaten by Buffalo's Bruce Smith. The 49ers pretty 
much gave up on him during the second half of the season, playing 
him sparingly or listing him as inactive. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the 49ers still will need to slash several more  
million dollars from the cap, even with the half dozen or so 
contract restructures. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco also is trying to gain enough cap relief to make a  
run at re-signing some of their potential free agents, including 
receivers J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks, hampered by an Achilles tendon problem last season, could  
be let go, along with Gogan, a Pro Bowler in each of the last two 
years, who may become a casualty because of the 49ers' bloated 
payroll. Defensive end Roy Barker and tight end Irv Smith also are 
under the microscope. The four have a combined cap figure of about 
$9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very simple arithmetic, really,'' Walsh said. ``We're  
dealing with that cost factor and our ability to meet those 
costs.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Attorney Seeks Law License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- In three years of law school, Matt Hale  
made decent grades, participated in student groups and played 
violin in two orchestras. He also helped revive a white supremacist 
group that advocates a racial holy war. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale graduated last May, passed the bar exam and was hired by an  
Illinois law firm. But he never got his law license, snubbed by a 
state committee that reviews the ``character and fitness'' of 
prospective attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, comprised of two lawyers and a judge, cited his  
racist leanings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale is ``free ... to incite as much racial hatred as he desires  
and to attempt to carry out his life's mission of depriving those 
he dislikes of their legal rights,'' panel members wrote in their 
2-1 opinion in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in our view he cannot do this as an officer of the  
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miffed by the vote -- all but 25 of more than 3,000 applicants  
last year were approved -- Hale has appealed to a separate state 
committee that could overturn the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that I can't be lawyer because of my views is  
ludicrous,'' he said, sitting in a home office where an Israeli 
flag serves as a doormat, swastika stickers decorate the walls and 
the flag of Hale's group, the World Church of the Creator, hangs 
from a window. He is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's effort to gain a law license has attracted some unlikely  
supporters, including the Anti-Defamation League and renowned 
attorney Alan Dershowitz, who said he may help in Hale's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Character committees should not become thought police,''  
Dershowitz said. ``It's not the content of the thoughts I'm 
defending, it's the freedom of everybody to express their views and 
to become lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy in East Peoria, Hale immersed himself in books about  
Nazis and formed a ``Little Reich'' group at school. In high school 
and at Bradley University he attended ``white power'' rallies and 
sent letters filled with racial slurs to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had brushes with the law, including a citation for  
littering after trying to distribute racist newspapers to homes. He 
was elected head of the World Church of the Creator while attending 
Southern Illinois University law school. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, founded in 1973 in Florida, espouses a racial holy  
war against Jews and blacks. One group member is serving a life 
sentence for killing a black sailor in Florida in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, which foundered for a few years, has thrived under  
Hale's leadership, according to the ADL. Hale's claim of as many as 
30,000 supporters could not be verified. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois officials say the last case similar to Hale's was in  
the early 1950s, when a law student refused to take an 
anti-Communist loyalty oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court last considered a similar case in 1971,  
when two applicants for law licenses in other states would not 
reveal their political beliefs. The court ruled in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADL believes Hale shouldn't be denied a law license because  
of the ``slippery slope'' it creates, said Andrew Shoenthal, 
assistant director in the group's Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Shoenthal asked, could a prospective lawyer who  
opposes abortion or supports school prayer be denied a license if a 
majority in his community held an opposite view? 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois State Bar Association has yet to take a position on  
Hale's case, but spokesman Dave Anderson said the case ``is a hot 
topic (among lawyers) right now, with spirited debate on both 
sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, meanwhile, was fired by the law firm because he couldn't  
obtain the license. He lives with his parents in East Peoria, with 
an office in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	He is optimistic he'll get his license and plans to open a solo  
practice. He hopes to challenge affirmative action laws and the 
littering law for which he was cited. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the true test of character is whether a person says  
what they think, which is what I have always done,'' Hale said. ``I 
believe I show more character than most attorneys in that I 
actually practice what I preach.''

<HEADLINE> Alcott, Daniel To Enter LPGA Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Amy Alcott was weary of hearing  
well-intentioned folks remind her of the one victory she's lacking 
to qualify for the LPGA Hall of Fame. She won't have to listen to 
it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott and Beth Daniel are in, thanks to a vote of tour players  
that softened the criteria for the toughest Hall of Fame in sports. 
Only 14 women had qualified since the hall was created in 1967. 
Betsy King was the last inductee in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really kind of gotten tired of people telling me, even  
though it's out of the goodness of their heart, `Come on, Amy, you 
can win that one more,''' Alcott said. ``In my heart, I know I 
will. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is not going to change 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The old rules required a player to have 30 victories, including  
two majors, or 35 victories with one major or 40 wins with no 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the previous system, Alcott's 29 wins left her one short  
of qualifying. Her last win came at the 1991 Dinah Shore, one of 
five major titles in a 24-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent way too much time on the one Amy didn't get  
instead of celebrating the excellence of her 29 wins, including 
five major championships,'' Hall of Famer Pat Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel has 32 career victories, including one major since her  
1979 LPGA debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, a player will have to win either a major  
championship, Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average or player of 
the year, and then have accumulated 27 points. Two points would be 
awarded for each major, with one point each for a victory, Vare 
Trophy or player of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, 14 years in the making by the LPGA board of  
directors, won approval by 98 percent of the tour players in voting 
conducted Jan. 12 to Feb. 5, tour commissioner Jim Ritts announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled the criteria has been changed,'' Hall of Famer  
Patty Sheehan said. ``It lets the world know we finally have a 
respectable hall of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott's and Daniel's first tournament as Hall of Famers will be  
the Valley of the Stars Championship beginning Friday at Oakmont 
Country Club in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that means the most to me is the fact that  
the current Hall of Famers all agree with this criteria,'' Daniel 
said. ``Had even one Hall of Famer not agreed with it, it wouldn't 
have meant quite as much to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new criteria, Alcott would have qualified for the Hall  
of Fame in 1985 by virtue of her 35 points, while Daniel would have 
made it in 1990 based on her 39 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to have an asterisk by my name, saying she  
needed one more,'' Alcott said. ``I don't think one more win should 
mean anything. I've had a great career, I've known it in my own 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott will be inducted on March 22, along with Seve Ballesteros  
and Lloyd Mangrum, at the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel chose to wait until March 2000 for her induction.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt March was too soon to get everything ready and my  
family ready,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other current players close to qualifying for the Hall of Fame  
are 1998 player of the year Annika Sorenstam (24 points), 
three-time U.S. Open winner Hollis Stacy (22 points) and Laura 
Davies (22 points). 
</P>
<P>
	The players also voted to establish a 12-person veterans  
committee to nominate one retired player for the Hall of Fame. 
However, no one will be inducted in the veterans category this year 
because the committee will not be named until the LPGA Championship 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired players most likely to be considered include Donna  
Caponi (20 wins, four majors), Marlene Hagge (24 wins, one major), 
Marilynn Smith (19 wins, two majors), Judy Rankin (26 wins), Sandra 
Palmer (17 wins, two majors), Jane Blalock (27 wins) and Ayako 
Okamoto (17 wins).

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Falls 158.08 By PATRICIA LAMIELL / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors dumped technology shares for the third  
day in a row Tuesday, erasing the Dow's gain for the year and 
raising questions about whether the market was embarking on a 
long-awaited correction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average lost 158.08, or 1.7 percent, to  
close at 9,133.03, nearly 50 points below its close at the end of 
last year. But broad market indexes, in which technology companies 
are heavily represented, posted much bigger losses. The Nasdaq 
index tumbled 3.9 percent in its third-biggest point loss, and the 
S&AMP;P 500 fell 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, described the  
losses as ``a sneeze in a cold. It is a long-overdue correction 
that clearly has been focused in the winning groups of 1998 and the 
first part of 1999: technology and health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson  
Lane in Charlotte, N.C., said the losses could be the start of a 
significant retreat. ``The loss in leadership in the technology 
sector is the most important,'' he said, adding that the ``highest 
expectation should be for a correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price movements were erratic enough throughout the session to  
support either case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow average was down 118 points before recovering most of  
its losses in the early afternoon, but retreated a second time in 
the final hour. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 2 to 1 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, but volume was only moderately heavy 
at 884.97 million shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite lost 94.13, or 3.91 percent, to close at  
2,310.79 in its third-biggest point loss ever. The Nasdaq is still 
up 128 points for the year but almost 200 points below its closing 
high reached Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell 27.63 points, or 2.2  
percent, to 1,216.14, 13 points below where it closed last year and 
63 points shy of its closing high, also reached on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the modest strength in manufacturing shares last week,  
market watchers had been hoping that investors would replace stocks 
they sold with shares in other industries, a process known as 
``rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that trend failed to emerge Tuesday. Riley said he believed  
at least some investors were keeping their money in cash rather 
than buying new stocks, in a sign that fears of more volatility 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by technology shares IBM,  
down 4 1/4 at 162 3/4, and AT&AMP;T, down 3 5/8 to 87 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft-drink and beverage stocks were stronger, with Coca-Cola up  
7/16 at 61 15/16, suggesting that investors were seeking the safe 
haven of recession-resistant consumer stocks. But drug stocks, 
which are also perceived to be less vulnerable to economic cycles, 
were also lower. Merck fell 4 1/2 at 145 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the announcement of a splashy Internet deal failed to  
breathe life into technology stocks or the overall market. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Networks is merging its Home Shopping Network and  
Ticketmaster service with Lycos, a leading destination on the World 
Wide Web. But Lycos shares lost 33 points, or 26 percent, to close 
at 94 1/4, although USA Networks shares gained 3 11/16 to 41 5/8, both in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market news, the New York Stock Exchange composite  
index fell 10.02 to 576.62 , and the American Stock Exchange 
composite index fell 10.66 to 692.24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.20 to 403.13.  
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index eased 0.64 percent. But prices  
dropped sharply in Europe following concerns about the economy 
there. London's FT-SE 100 index fell 0.94 percent, Frankfurt's DAX 
index slid 2.44 percent, and the CAC in Paris dropped 2.78 percent.

<HEADLINE> Report: Church President Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president of the Seventh-day Adventist  
Church is stepping down amid a controversy over his business 
dealings, The Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Folkenberg, 58, had been under pressure from officials of  
the 10-million-member denomination to resign since mid-January, 
when the church began to review his business dealings. The review 
was prompted after a California businessman filed a lawsuit against 
Folkenberg and the church, saying that they had reneged on a 1993 
business deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said Folkenberg told staff members of the Silver  
Spring, Md.-based denomination Monday that the controversy ``is 
detracting from God's work. To avoid additional pain and conflict 
to my family and the church I love I am ... tendering my 
resignation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	G. Ralph Thompson, secretary of the church's top policy-making  
body, will serve as acting president. The church's General 
Conference Executive Committee, which was scheduled to consider 
Folkenberg's dismissal on March 1, will now select a new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkenberg had been president of the denomination since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Lincoln Center Honors Harold Arlen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbara Cook's clear voice came from behind the  
curtain at Alice Tully Hall, singing a verse from ``Somewhere Over 
the Rainbow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the curtain was raised and Audra McDonald, Debbie Gravitte,  
Ken Page and Richard Muenz traded phrases with Cook in the song's 
chorus, as they began a tribute to Harold Arlen, who wrote the 
melody. 
</P>
<P>
	American Songbook, a new Lincoln Center series, began Friday  
night with the Arlen tribute. Radio personality Jonathan Schwartz 
was master of ceremonies. Arlen, who died in 1986 at 81, was chosen 
as the first in the series, Schwartz said, because he is 
undercelebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz called Harold Arlen ``droll and melancholy.'' He said  
``Last Night When We Were Young'' was Arlen's favorite song. And 
Schwartz told the audience a little trivia: Ira Gershwin, who had 
gone to high school with Yip Harburg, wrote the last two lines to 
Harburg's lyric for ``Over the Rainbow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slides of Arlen photos were projected to cover the back wall  
during each song. Since Arlen wrote the melodies, the evening 
didn't concentrate only on words but included two orchestral 
medleys, one of famous tunes and one from his Broadway show, ``St. 
Louis Woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen McGovern, scheduled to sing, had flu and Debbie  
Gravitte, who won a Tony in 1989 for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' 
sang in her place. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's high mezzo-soprano carried the audience into the  
sadness of ``The Man That Got Away.'' Bassist Jay Leonhart sang two 
songs, ``A Sleepin' Bee'' and ``Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive,'' in 
the gently swinging humorous vein that is his specialty. Diana 
Krall played piano and sang ``I've Got the World on a String,'' 
showing that Arlen's tunes were a fine basis for jazz. Judging by 
the applause she received at the end, the audience would like to 
have heard from Krall more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone sang impressively and enjoyably, the star clearly  
was Cook, evoking pure music in ``I Wonder What Became of Me?'' and 
``I Had Myself a True Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next American Songbook presentations will be two concerts of  
Richard Rodgers music in March and James Van Heusen and Jerome Kern 
music next fall. Schwartz said performers will be drawn from a 
company of 44.

<HEADLINE> Carjackers Put Man in Trunk, Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two men in ski masks abducted a man from his  
garage, stuffed him in the trunk of his Bentley and led police on a 
chase that ended in a fiery crash, police said. The victim was 
critically hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	KABC-TV reported that the victim, Chris Rawlings, 30, is an heir  
to the Rawlings sporting goods fortune, but police could not 
confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate arrests were made.  
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings was thrown from the white, British-made luxury car when  
it crashed into a utility pole and burst into flames, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized with severe head injuries. Police said that  
his temple was punctured with a sharp object but that they didn't 
know whether he had been stabbed or was injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings' wife had called police Monday night to report that her  
husband was being attacked at their home in the city's wealthy 
Woodland Hills section. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Bentley crashed, the masked men ran off, and later  
stole another car, police said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Chelsea Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush joined President  
Clinton and his wife in voicing disappointment over a magazine 
cover story on Chelsea Clinton, saying concerns about his own 
teen-age daughters remain a factor as he considers running for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president and Mrs. Clinton are disappointed that their  
daughter's on the cover of the magazine, I'm disappointed for 
them,'' Bush said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to understand better how teen-agers feel. It's a  
sensitive age. I respect their desire for privacy. I'm sorry it 
happened,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Clintons said they were ``profoundly saddened''  
by People magazine's decision to do a cover story on Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and his wife, Laura, have twin daughters, who are 17.  
</P>
<P>
	``My daughters matter a lot to me. I love them more than life,''  
the Republican governor said. ``My most important job is father. So 
I'm concerned, as I say, about the meat-grinder of national 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think one magazine cover is going to be the deciding  
factor; I think the issue's much bigger than that. But that's a 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush repeated that remains undecided about a presidential bid  
next year.

<HEADLINE> Comic Book Creator Has McGwire Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd McFarlane knows how fleeting his fame could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after revealing he was the man who spent more than  
$3 million to buy Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball, McFarlane said 
his deal would be a giant mistake if someone hits 71. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the record falls,'' he said, ``I go from being a nut who  
paid $3 million for the crown jewel of sports memorabilia to an 
idiot who spent $3 million on a $5 ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a rambling one-hour news conference Monday in the Baroque  
Room of The Plaza hotel -- the same place baseball launched its 
Jackie Robinson celebration two years ago -- McFarlane sounded like 
anyone who calls all-sports radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn comic books, held an  
offbeat news conference, quickly admitting he was a ``psycho fan'' 
and a ``sports geek'' and saying his purchase ``was a mixture of 
business, charity and self-indulgence to the Nth degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports make you forget death, taxes and politics, and all the  
other garbage that goes on in life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Canadian, who now lives in Tempe, Ariz., is a  
minority investor in the NHL's Edmonton Oilers. With a company that 
makes action figures, he said the timing of his announcement was 
tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 last month for No. 70, did not  
see the ball until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a 
stay at the Baltimore Orioles' fantasy camp in Florida. Behind him 
was a banner with ``Todd McFarlane Productions'' spelled out 103 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The balls were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine  
columns -- white and gray for No. 70, black for the others -- with 
four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five 
men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would like to allow the Hall of Fame to show  
McGwire's 70th home run ball at times, would make it available to 
charities to raise money and would let individual major league 
teams display it. 
</P>
<P>
	The price?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league  
ballpark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig,  
said purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. He 
mentioned the proposed $800 million sale of the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, I'm up 799 million bucks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he isn't worried about someone breaking the record  
McGwire set last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets too close, I saw what Tonya Harding did a few years  
ago, so there are options,'' he said, referring how Harding's 
entourage hired someone to attack rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and  
Sammy Sosa, including McGwire's first, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, 
and Sosa's 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane bought the ball at auction Jan. 12, paying $2.7  
million to Philip Ozersky, a research scientist at Washington 
University who caught the ball Sept. 27 at Busch Stadium in St. 
Louis. Guernsey's auction house got an additional $305,000 as its 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66, cost McFarlane  
$172,500. All the others he bought at the auction cost under 
$20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who rooted for the San Diego Padres growing up  
because he felt sorry for the players in the mustard-colored 
uniforms, is a fan of the Arizona Diamondbacks and went to about a 
dozen games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As an anonymous telephone bidder, he outbid Irwin Sternberg, the  
president of the neckwear firm Stonehenge Ltd., for No. 70. 
Sternberg stopped at $2.6 million; McFarlane said $2.9 million was 
as high as he was willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew my life savings on this,'' McFarlane said. ``I'm not  
Donald Trump. I don't have a lot of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of balls will be called ``The McFarlane Collection.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I'll name  
it after myself,'' he said. ``Better than `The Guy Who Has More 
Money Than Brains Collection.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife understood the reasons for his purchase, but  
wouldn't have gone ahead on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't have these same wants and needs of silliness that  
men have,'' he said. ``What's the equivalent of the 70th home run 
ball to women?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane said that if he owned a team, he would take batting  
practice every day. And he would make some changes to his team's 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make sure the fences were hydraulic,'' he said, ``so when  
I came up they could move in 30 feet.''

<HEADLINE> Novelist Iris Murdoch Dies at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Iris Murdoch, whose macabre yet comic  
sensibility made her one of Britain's most admired modern 
novelists, has died at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch died Monday at Vale House in Oxford, said Patricia  
O'Leary, administrator at the home for Alzheimer's disease 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cause of death was not announced, Murdoch was  
diagnosed in 1996 as suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a 
condition she described in its early stage as ``a very, very bad, 
quiet place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Bayley, who had cared for his wife through her last years,  
was with her when she died, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayley, the academic, critic and writer who had shared Murdoch's  
life for more than 40 years, wrote of her life and the progression 
of her disease in ``Elegy for Iris,'' published in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voyage is over,'' Bayley wrote, ``and under the dark  
escort of Alzheimer's she has arrived somewhere. So have I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Hodges, the neurologist who diagnosed Murdoch's ailment,  
said, ``It was tragic seeing someone who had been a literary giant 
not remembering the details of the books she had written -- it was 
heart-rending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philosophical speculation, religion, magic and metaphysics run  
through many of Murdoch's 26 novels. One of her most famous -- ``A 
Severed Head,'' published in 1961 -- was a black farce about 
infidelity, incest and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow author Rachel Billington once wrote that Murdoch's  
characters ``seem to walk a tightrope, with only darkness below and 
no particular end in view; yet sustained by the very act of staying 
on and, as Miss Murdoch says, constrained to be always in 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow novelist Malcolm Bradbury on Monday rated her ``amongst  
the four or five great novelists of the second half of this century 
to come out of Britain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born into an Anglo-Irish family in Dublin on July 15, 1919, Jean  
Iris Murdoch was educated in England at Badminton School, at 
Somerville College, Oxford University, and at Newnham College, 
Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning to teach at Oxford, Murdoch spent a year at  
Cambridge studying with disciples of the Austrian philosopher 
Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, she married Bayley, with whom she kept a famously  
chaotic household -- for many years in the village of Steeple 
Ashton, 100 miles west of London, then in a vine-covered house in 
north Oxford. Books were stacked on the floors in pyramids, and 
sacks overflowing with papers and manuscripts shared space with a 
collection of stones. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book was nonfiction -- ``Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''  
in 1953 -- and she wrote on philosophy throughout her career. 
``Existentialists and Mystics,'' a collection of her essays and 
articles, was published in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's first published novel was ``Under the Net'' in 1954,  
and it won immediate praise. She wrote prolifically. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invent the whole thing before I start writing,'' she once  
explained. ``Even the conversations are in my head. I don't start 
writing the thing until I've got the whole of it absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most admired novels was 1973's ``The Black Prince,''  
about a middle-aged would-be writer and his professional rival's 
young daughter. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, ``The Sea, The Sea,'' about a retired film director  
trying to win back his first love, won the Booker Prize, widely 
considered Britain's highest literary honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, the equivalent of a knighthood for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Her last novel, ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' was published in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch didn't put up with editing, not even allowing  
punctuation changes -- an attitude that some critics blamed for the 
length of some of her less successful novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she could be a severe critic of her own work.  
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is not being great,'' she said in a 1988 interview.  
``I'm in the second league, not among the gods like Jane Austen, 
and Henry James and Tolstoy. My characters are not as memorable as 
theirs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 interview, she said two of the most important things  
in her life were her parents and her work. ``But above all else, 
the most important thing in my life is my husband,'' she said. ``To 
have had a happy marriage is a very good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by her husband. They had no children.  
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

	-- Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from the Republic of Congo,  
received along with his family in excess of $250,000. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Salt Lake City bid committee president Tom Welch in November  
1991 made a wire transfer when the wife of Siuli Paul Wallwork, the 
IOC member from Western Samoa, sought $30,000 for a friend in a 
serious situation. Welch wrote the money was taken from his 
children's' trust account. He later told a bid committee employee 
the money had been repaid. 

</P>
<P>
	-- In October 1991, management authorized the first tuition  
payments from committee funds. That month Sibo Sibandze, the son of 
David Sibandze, the IOC member from Swaziland, began attending the 
University of Utah with his tuition and living expenses paid by the 
bid committee. 

</P>
<P>
	-- On April 1, 1992, bid committee management started paying the  
expenses of Yekaterina Soukhorado at the University of Utah. Like 
Sibo Sibandze, Soukhorado was introduced to the bid committee by an 
IOC member. 

</P>
<P>
	-- The bid committee also paid for Bold Magvan, the son of the  
IOC member from Mongolia, Shagdarjav Magvan, to attend classes at 
the University of Utah. While these expenses were relatively 
minimal ($762), Magvan did not come to Salt Lake primarily to 
attend classes; rather, he had been invited by the First Security 
Bank, where he had a yearlong internship. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Sometime in the spring of 1992, Welch, using bid committee  
funds, arranged for the son of Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from 
South Korea, to work at a local communications company, reimbursing 
all costs associated with his employment. 

</P>
<P>
	-- In June 1992, Nancy Rignault Arroyo, the daughter of Agustin  
Arroyo, IOC member from Ecuador, arrived in Salt Lake. The next 
month, the bid committee started paying her living expenses at the 
Santa Fe Apartments. Payments on her behalf continued into 1995, 
and totaled nearly $23,000. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Mahmoud El Farnawani, a consultant based in Toronto who  
focuses on IOC members from the Mediterranean, was paid $148,260 
over three years. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Muttaleb Ahmad, the director general of the Olympic Council of  
Asia, was paid $62,400 from June 1994 through June 1995. 

</P>
<P>
	-- ``Citius,'' which has been linked to Alfredo La Mont, who  
recently resigned as the USOC director of international relations 
and protocol, was paid $25,714.35 from March 1990 to May 1991. 

</P>
<P>
	-- ARCA Inc., also affiliated with La Mont, was paid $18,185.90  
through October 1995. The bid committee records state monthly 
payments of $3,000 were passed through ARCA to Austin Sealy, an IOC 
member from Barbados. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo  
Haeggman, was paid $33,750 from May 4, 1994, through June 7, 1995. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Raouf Scally, whose Olympic connection was unclear, was paid  
$14,500 from February 1993 through February 1996. 

</P>
<P>
	-- The committee paid $108,350 in rent, tuition and expenses for  
Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late IOC member Rene Essomba of 
Cameroon, from August 1993 until November 1996. The committee also 
paid for Essomba's family to stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in 
Paris on Dec. 8-12 and 23-28, 1994 and on December 8-12 and 23-28, 
1995 at the rate of approximately $300 per night. 

</P>
<P>
	-- In August 1993, the committee flew Essomba along with Moriba  
and Mohammed Keita, the sons of the IOC member from Mali, Lamine 
Keita, round trip from Washington to Salt Lake City, so Essomba and 
Keita could help organize the U.S. national gymnastics 
championships. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Zuhair Gadir, the son of Gen. Zein El Abdin Mohamed Ahmed  
Abdel Gadir, an IOC member from Sudan, was paid $17,000 from Feb. 
1, 1994, to June 7, 1995. 

</P>
<P>
	-- The committee paid for IOC members and their relatives --  
sometimes more than one -- to fly first class to Salt Lake City -- 
often more than once -- and on some occasions paid for their travel 
to other Olympic events. Some were taken to the Super Bowl. There 
are other examples of IOC members enjoying additional stays at the 
committee's expense at locations other than Salt Lake, including 
New York, Paris and London for extended periods of time both before 
and after trips. 

</P>
<P>
	-- Sergio Santander-Fantini, a member of the IOC from Chile who  
also served as the president of the Chilean National Olympic 
Committee, received $20,050 from December 1993 to January 1994. 

</P>
<P>
	-- A November 1995 e-mail exchange among three USOC staff  
directors contained repeated references to an agreement to help 
train athletes from the Sudan at committee facilities as part of 
Salt Lake's campaign. ``A lot of promises were made to secure 
votes,'' wrote Alfredo La Mont, then the USOC's director for 
international relations. ``Our and SLC's debt is to train them for 
Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Going for 3rd Daytona Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett proved twice that he  
knows how to win the Daytona 500. Still, knowing how and getting 
the job done are two different things. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Jarrett and the rest of the Ford drivers in the  
Winston Cup series came to Daytona International Speedway for the 
season-opening race in transition after Ford discontinued the 
Thunderbird and introduced the Taurus as its new entry in NASCAR's 
top stock car series. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance of the new car at Daytona was far from  
embarrassing. Jeremy Mayfield's Taurus finished third behind the 
Chevrolet of winner Dale Earnhardt and the Pontiac of runner-up 
Bobby Labonte, and four other Ford drivers were in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the Taurus may well be the car to beat in Sunday's  
500-miler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just were not ready last year car-wise going into the  
season,'' said Jarrett, who finished a disappointing 34th in the 
500. ``This year we're much better prepared going into the season. 
I think we've got good race cars here. We've got good race cars for 
Rockingham, Vegas and Atlanta ready to go, so we're in much better 
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a slow start last year that kept Jarrett from mounting  
any real challenge to two-time defending series champion Jeff 
Gordon. Jarrett wound up a distant third in the points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're ready to get out of the gate a little quicker,  
and that will help us challenge him more,'' Jarrett said. 
``Hopefully, we'll win more races and, when we don't win, we can 
finish right up there with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, though, the business at hand is making the Daytona  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was 18th overall in two days of time trials, putting him  
ninth in the starting lineup for the second of the twin 125-mile 
qualifying races on Thursday. Those races will determine positions 
3-30 in Sunday's 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon and rookie Tony Stewart were the fastest in time trials,  
clinching the front row starting spots for Sunday. But the rest of 
the field is still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jarrett fails to make the race by finishing among the top 14  
or 15 -- depending on whether Gordon or Stewart finish near the 
front in their qualifiers -- he will either get in by virtue of his 
speed in the time trials or by his third-place finish in the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Other drivers are not in the same position. In fact, 16 of the  
59 drivers entered here will fail to make the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a huge amount of pressure for some people,''  
Jarrett said. ``We're in the Daytona 500. We don't have to worry 
about it. To be in a position of not knowing if your speed is going 
to get you in, with the prestige of this race, that's brought on a 
lot of pressure -- more than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see some guys on Thursday take a few  
more chances than we've seen. Plus, it's your best opportunity to 
see exactly what your car is going to do for Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he knows where he will start on Sunday, Jarrett will  
concentrate on trying to become only the fourth driver to win 
NASCAR's biggest race more than twice. Richard Petty won it seven 
times and Cale Yarborough and Bobby Allison each won it three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the key is getting yourself in position,'' Jarrett  
said. ``First, you have to have a really good race car. The second 
thing is being patient. The first 400 miles here really don't 
matter. All you do is try to keep yourself out of trouble and make 
adjustments on your car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, in the last 100 miles, you get yourself into position to  
win.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall Below $5 a Bushel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices on Tuesday sank below $5 a bushel on the  
Chicago Board of Trade for the first time since 1987 ahead of a 
government report expected to show weak global demand will cause 
inventories to remain at their highest in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also retreated. On other markets, gold and silver  
tumbled, while palladium rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department early Wednesday was expected to  
increase its estimate of the amount of soybeans that will be left 
over before the next harvest after a dismal few months of export 
demand for bumper fall-harvested crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected report pushed soybeans for March delivery down 9  
cents to $4.99 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last month said the surplus likely would stand at  
390 million bushels, but market participants expected that figure 
to rise well above 400 million bushels as foreign countries lack 
adequate funds for purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Further depressing prices for soybeans has been ideal growing  
conditions in Brazil, the world's second-largest producer behind 
the United States. The beneficial weather has boosted fears Brazil 
will harvest bumper competing crops, which the government could 
confirm in its predictions for foreign crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also noted there is concern that American farmers this  
spring will plant more acres to soybeans than corn or other crops 
because the price differential still favors growing beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures sank on continued beneficial weather in growing  
regions of Argentina and on the weakness in the soybean market. 
Losses were limited, however, amid expectations that USDA will 
lower its ending inventory estimates for corn as exporters 
benefited from unexpectedly strong export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated amid predictions U.S. inventories will  
continue to grow in the face of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat fell 2 cents to $2.64 1/2 a bushel; March corn fell 1 1/4  
cents to $2.16 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.06 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold and silver futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as recent rallies prompted heavy producer selling. That 
came as the U.S. dollar firmed against other currencies, making it 
more expensive to buy the metals elsewhere. Most commodities are 
priced in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	April gold fell 2.10 cents to $289.20 an ounce; March silver  
fell 11.7 cents to $5.51 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures, after taking a brief respite from sharp  
rallies last week, rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
as Western manufacturers continued to await new exports from 
Russia, the world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has not shipped precious metals since December amid  
bureaucratic delays. In the previous two years, those delays have 
extended into June, causing palladium to become the world's most 
valuable precious metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have increasingly turned to palladium for use in  
electronics and automobile catalysts that are required in many 
countries to reduce emissions. While many Japanese producers in 
particular have stocked up in anticipation of such a scenario with 
Russia, most have inventories that will comfortably last only 
through February. 
</P>
<P>
	March palladium rose $5.50 to $351.50 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Student Slaying Suspect Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) -- A man sought in the beating death of a  
Southwest Texas State University student apparently committed 
suicide, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshal Wilkerson, 21, apparently killed himself before police  
could obtain a warrant charging him with capital murder, said 
Police Chief Steve Griffith said. His body was found Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	No other details were available.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilkerson, who was a Southwest Texas student in 1996-97, had  
been wanted in connection with the beating death of Nicholas George 
Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 21, a junior communications major and pledge at Tau  
Kappa Epsilon, died Monday at an Austin hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had been sleeping on the ground floor of the  
fraternity house early Sunday after a party when he was beaten, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the suspect and three other men thought not to be  
students at the university had been involved in an earlier incident 
at the fraternity house and were asked to leave the party.

<HEADLINE>  Report Targets Utah Bid Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The top two officials of Salt Lake's  
Olympic bid were condemned today for ethical violations by an 
internal investigation of the biggest corruption scandal in the 
history of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report focused on Tom Welch, who directed the successful bid  
for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Dave Johnson, his top lieutenant. 
It also singled out Craig Peterson, the former finance chief for 
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the independent panel, headed by a former  
Utah Supreme Court justice, found no evidence of criminal conduct, 
said SLOC attorney Beth Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an ethical dilemma, and we did find several instances  
in which individuals stepped over the line,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The impetus for the Salt Lake bid committee's misconduct was  
traced to 1991, when the city was beaten by Nagano, Japan, for the 
1998 Games, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted witnesses as saying that Nagano had won with a ``more  
sophisticated and extravagant'' effort. For example, the Japanese 
gave International Olympic Committee members video cameras while 
Salt Lake was giving away disposable cameras prior to the 1991 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behavior of some IOC members was eye-opening as well,''  
the report said. Welch was approached by two representatives of 
unidentified IOC members asking for cash in exchange for votes, but 
he turned them down, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In summarizing the more than 300-page report, SLOC chairman  
Robert Garff said Johnson and Welch made unauthorized payments to 
IOC members and their relatives and then hid their actions from the 
bid committee's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody disputed that the mission of the bid committee was to  
secure IOC votes, Garff said, but ``what was not part of the plan 
was Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson's direct payments to IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the bid committee's chief financial officer, Peterson was  
responsible for signing every check. The ethics panel found that 
many large disbursements lacked complete documentation, and 
payments by wire transfers seldom included the required paperwork 
and approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said that while the bid board could have provided better  
oversight, the ethics panel didn't fault its members for the 
excesses of Welch and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel found that Jean Claude Ganga, the IOC member  
from the Republic of Congo who has been suspended by the IOC, and 
members of his family received more than $250,000 in medical care, 
travel and lodging and other gifts and expenses from the bid 
committee and SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the panel found no evidence the bid committee had  
provided female escorts for visiting IOC members, an allegation 
that had been widely reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It detailed eight wire transfers totaling $33,750 made in  
1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo 
Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract with Great Basin 
Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid Haeggman. Pirjo 
Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here wasn't right, and we are setting it  
right,'' Leavitt said just before the report was released. 
``Olympic corruption did not start here, but it must end here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an SLOC meeting today, the bid committee's board of  
directors wondered how they could have failed to see the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight failed, in my view, because of collusion,  
concealment, deception and the outside auditors' lack of finding 
the management's evasion of established procedures,'' said Spence 
Eccles, chief executive of First Security Bank, a member of both 
the bid committee and the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	David Jordan, a member of the ethics panel, said there was  
plenty of blame to go around. ``There were many places the system 
fell down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report noted they did not have subpoena  
powers and some people refused to be interviewed. The board spent 
much of its time examining documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the chairman of the bid committee who later became  
SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on the bid board 
had been screened from the details and that he was dismayed to 
learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive Jan. 8, the same day he  
demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry was just one of five investigations  
into Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation, which issued its report last month but is  
still ongoing, focused on its own members. The ethics panel looked 
only at Utah Olympic boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC found that $800,000 in cash payments, scholarships,  
medical care and travel expenses was paid to 14 IOC members. So 
far, nine have been expelled or have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials also may announce this week the selection of  
a new SLOC president. The front-runner is believed to be 
Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, meanwhile, officials said today they found no  
wrongdoing in Nagano's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service that the  
investigation showed that the bidders' treatment of IOC members was 
``within the scope of common sense.''

<HEADLINE> Cash, Trips Among Salt Lake Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- IOC members and their families tapped into  
a golden spigot of cash, free vacations, cosmetic surgery and even 
a refrigerator when they befriended Salt Lake's boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's bid committee doled out $23,000 in living expenses  
for one International Olympic Committee member's 44-year-old 
daughter, who was divorced and in desperate straits. It moved her 
to Salt Lake and placed her in job after failed job. 
</P>
<P>
	When the son of another member was laid off by NBC Sports in New  
York, the bid committee arranged for a local satellite company hire 
him and used bid money to reimburse $45,000 of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the $10,000 two-week ski vacation in Park  
City, the stay at a pricey hotel in Paris, Utah Jazz tickets, a 
Colorado River trip, $1,488 worth of bathroom fixtures, and $673 
for door knobs. 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics panel spent seven weeks scrutinizing 50,000 pages of  
documents and interviewing dozens of witnesses before issuing a 
300-page report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the examples:  
</P>

	-- Jean-Claude Ganga, IOC member from the Republic of Congo, got  
$250,000 in cash, travel, hotels and meals when he and his wife, 
son and mother-in-law made a half-dozen trips to Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	They loved to shop, and Mrs. Ganga in particular liked to buy  
rugs and draperies at Wal-Mart, tapping out a bid committee 
employee's credit card. Another bid employee helped the Gangas plan 
decor for their new kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was free medical care for the Ganga entourage. Ganga  
was treated for hepatitis, his wife had cosmetic surgery and his 
mother-in-law had a knee replacement. The bid committee paid 
$17,172 of the medical expenses and Intermountain Health Care 
donated $28,000 worth, but the ethics panel said the bulk of the 
medical costs were donated by the doctors at the behest of top bid 
executive Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga and Welch also were partners in an investment company  
called Claudet Investment, and Johnson said he often acted as a 
courier for Ganga, carrying envelopes of cash back from overseas 
trips for deposit in Ganga's Salt Lake account. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The tab on a sampling of shopping trips and outings thrown by  
the bid committee amounted to $64,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenses were $1,010 for retrievers; $793 for an  
exercise machine; a $524 violin, a $3,395 family trip to New York; 
a $1,791 Las Vegas trip, and $1,702 for a tour on the Colorado 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	One department store told the panel it had given away $25,000 in  
free merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Welch arranged to pay $108,340 in tuition and living expenses  
for Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late IOC member from 
Cameroon, Rene Essomba. He also acted as her attorney, drafting a 
letter to break an apartment lease and having his secretary fly to 
Washington to help move Ms. Essomba's furniture to a new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash and the committee paid for  
his family to stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris at $300 a 
night for 22 nights in 1994 and 1995. He died last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Welch and bid vice president Dave Johnson drew up a phony  
contract between Great Basin Engineering of Ogden, Utah, and Bjarne 
Haeggman, ex-husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo Haggeman, as cover 
for $33,750 in payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjarne Haeggman was to prepare a report on reforestation  
practices in Finland, although no such report was found in the bid 
committee's files or at Great Basin Engineering. The company says 
it never hired Haeggman. 
</P>
<P>
	-- When Julie Wallwork, the wife of Western Samoa IOC member  
Siuli Paul Wallwork, sought $30,000 for a desperate friend, Welch 
took money from his own daughters' trust account. Welch later 
embarrassingly had to ask for a loan repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The families of IOC members Phillip Coles of Australia and  
Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala made four visits together to the 
United States, in one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, 
costing the committee $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	-- IOC member Charles Mukora from Kenya even put his expectation  
for personal assistance in writing. In a January 1994 letter he 
expressed his hope that ``people who promised assistance will honor 
their pledges before it is too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel said Mukora ultimately got $29,450 funneled  
into his personal account. That came after a $5,000 payment to a 
sports group he worked with. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seven relatives and friends of IOC members traveled to  
Budapest, where the IOC voted to give Salt Lake the games, on the 
bid committee's dime. The committee spent more than $27,000 for the 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ethics panel gave many examples of those with their  
hands out, it noted one instance in which bid executives tried to 
persuade the son of an IOC member to accept help finding a job at a 
Utah university. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrei Siperco, son of Alexandru Siperco of Romania, refused.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was clearly Dr. Siperco's understanding that it would be  
inappropriate for a relative of an IOC member to trade on this 
relationship and accept money from a bid or organizing committee,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should have been the understanding of the bid committee's  
management as well.''

<HEADLINE>  Salt Lake Awaits Ethics Panel Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The top two officials of Salt Lake City's  
Olympic bid are expected to be the focus of a lengthy report from 
an internal ethics investigation of the biggest corruption scandal 
in the history of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, scheduled for release today, is expected to  
concentrate on the actions of Tom Welch, who directed the 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Dave Johnson, his 
top lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here wasn't right, and we are setting it  
right,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt said just before the report was 
released. ``...Olympic corruption did not start here, but it must 
end here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Leavitt said the report by the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee's ethics panel should not be looked at as complete, since 
the panel did not have subpoena powers and some people refused to 
be interviewed. The board spent much of its time examining 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel probe is one of five investigations into the  
payments of cash and freebies to International Olympic Committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the IOC commission report last month, which focused on  
international committee members, the report by the SLOC ethics 
panel concerned the role Utah Olympic boosters played in seeking 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation said $800,000 in cash payments,  
scholarships, medical care and travel expenses was paid to 14 IOC 
members. So far, nine have been expelled or have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials said today they had not seen the report in  
advance of the briefing, but several newspapers quoted unidentified 
sources as providing some details. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and USA Today said the report would primarily  
target Welch and Johnson, with the Times reporting that the two 
would be accused of hidden payments and deceptive practices that 
kept other members of the committee from knowing what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said that Welch's dealings with Alfredo La  
Mont, the U.S. Olympic Committee's former director of international 
relations, will be detailed in the report. The Post, citing an 
unidentified source, also said an investigative panel appointed by 
the USOC is focusing on La Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont resigned from the USOC in January after revealing a  
business arrangement with Welch. Welch's lawyer, Thomas Schaffer, 
said Welch hired La Mont ``strictly as a lobbyist'' to influence 
IOC members from Latin America and South America and paid him from 
$2,500 to about $3,500 a month. The Post's sources said the 
payments totaled about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said the report also would identify  
Craig Peterson as a central player. Peterson handled finances for 
the bid committee after he joined in 1990 and continued in that job 
after the city won its bid and formed SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, meanwhile, officials said today they found no  
wrongdoing in Nagano's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service that the  
investigation showed that the bidders' treatment of IOC members was 
``within the scope of common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that people familiar with the probe said  
investigators had little, if any, access to Welch, Johnson and 
Peterson, and attorneys for the three refused to allow their 
clients to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted Schaffer as saying the ethics panel refused a  
confidentiality agreement and feared information would be turned 
over to the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt and others 
named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of detail of the 
gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said last week that he had met about 50 IOC members and  
their families, posed for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of 
diplomacy, but, ``I did not ever personally see a gift of great 
value. I was doing everything I could to be charming. I was doing 
my diplomatic duty as the governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the volunteer chairman of the bid committee who  
later became SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on 
the bid board had been screened from the details and that he was 
dismayed to learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said last week that it obtained copies of letters  
written by Joklik and bid committee member James Beardall, seeking 
a forestry job for the husband of a Finnish member of the IOC. The 
letters to Weyerhaeuser Company on behalf of Bjarne Haeggman were 
sent in 1993. The Wall Street Journal said the ethics committee 
report ``doesn't completely exonerate'' Joklik and cites him for 
the Weyerhaeuser letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive Jan. 8, the same day he  
demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal quoted an unidentified source familiar with the  
investigation as saying the report was adamant that the Welch, 
Johnson and Peterson did not inform board trustees about their 
work. The report concludes that ``they not only didn't tell the 
board, they kept it from the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, SLOC board member Ken Bullock has long complained about  
not getting answers to questions about rumored scholarships and 
getting no support from other board members when he sought 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said he asked about the scholarships each of the last  
three years during board meetings, and got vague answers. He said 
there was a ``don't ask'' sentiment -- that others board members 
wanted him to ``leave it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee also was expected to address the  
question of contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the investigations by the SLOC ethics panel, the IOC and  
the USOC, the Justice Department is looking into violations of 
federal law, and Utah Attorney General Jan Graham -- who also was on 
the bid committee -- is examining potential violations of state 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads the IOC investigation,  
said Monday the Salt Lake panel's report might help advance that 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have seen a lot of documents we have not seen and talked  
with a lot of people we have not talked to, so it may be quite 
helpful,'' he said. ``If it concentrates on their end and gives the 
facts, that helps us on our end. I hope we can avoid endless 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials also may announce this week the selection of  
a new SLOC president. The front runner is believed to be 
Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands suspended  
his IOC work until after next month's special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special sitting of the IOC will have to clarify whether  
the organization has the power to clean up its act and is therefore 
crucial for the question of whether the Prince of Orange will be 
able to continue his activities in the interests of international 
sport within the IOC,'' Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok wrote in a 
letter to parliament.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Nears Presidency Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Leaving little doubt about her  
intentions, Elizabeth Dole says America needs a president ``worthy 
of her people'' and already is raising money from supporters who 
think she is worth a look in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm talking to people about finances and policy and  
organization,'' she told reporters on her first trip to New 
Hampshire since leaving the American Red Cross in January to 
consider a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging for me,'' she said. ``There are a lot of  
people volunteering, and there is some money coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark surprised her advisers, who initially said they did  
not know how she was collecting the money. Later they said checks 
made out to ``Elizabeth Dole exploratory committee'' were being 
accepted and could be used to defray expenses, though papers 
forming a committee -- viewed as the first step toward a 
presidential campaign -- had not yet been filed with the Federal 
Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Such fund raising is permitted, as long as the money is used to  
open an office, buy stamps and pay for travel, Mrs. Dole said as 
she headed to a breakfast meeting with potential supporters in 
Bedford this morning. She did not answer a question about how much 
money had been raised, and her advisers said they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole is almost certain to become a candidate, said the  
advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. She plans to travel 
to Iowa next week, hire campaign staff as early as this week and 
officially form an exploratory committee in the near future, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole made the offhanded comment about money Monday before  
addressing 1,200 people at a Chamber of Commerce awards dinner. The 
speech offered a hint at plans to position herself as a moderating 
force in the campaign, someone who can put a happy face on the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reagan conservatism wore a smile,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She called for lower taxes, better schools, a war against  
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I revere free enterprise,'' she said, yet ``capitalism is  
imperfect. Conservatives should never hesitate to speak out against 
the unregulated, unadulterated pursuit of cash if it leads to the 
coarsening of our culture, to the pollution of the airwaves or the 
pollution of the air,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who shares top billing with Mrs. Bush  
in most GOP presidential polls, has labeled his brand of politics 
``compassionate conservatism.'' She promised not to label anybody's 
politics -- liberal or conservative -- because, ``America needs 
leaders, not labels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming President Clinton, she said the nation's current  
leader is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when the presidency has been tainted ... our  
confidence in our leaders is shaky,'' she said. ``But we can 
rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be an important reason why: Because the  
United States of America deserves a government worthy of her 
people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, warned voters of a ``sleaze  
factor in the White House'' late in his failed 1996 campaign for 
president. ``The White House should be a place of public trust, not 
public suspicion,'' Dole said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, served in the Cabinets of Presidents Reagan and  
Bush after starting in politics in the Democratic administration of 
President Johnson. She was a key player in her husband's 
presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole would be in a field of potential GOP candidates that,  
besides Bush, includes businessman Steve Forbes, former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle and social activist Gary 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	She read her speech Monday word-for-word and rather flatly, and  
it received only polite applause. But crowd members said afterward 
they were satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got a lot better reception than Bob Dole ever did,'' said  
Chris Stawasz. 
</P>
<P>
	Women appeared to be particularly struck by Mrs. Dole's call for  
civility in politics, and her reference to the next president -- 
``he or she.'' Good reviews crossed party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she was not necessarily a good speaker but I like what  
she said,'' Ghee Fry said. ``She kept saying she was a 
conservative, but sounded like a Democrat, like a liberal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived in this first-in-the-nation primary state late  
Monday and planned to leave today, following a private breakfast 
meeting with supporters. She disappointed some New Hampshire 
Republicans by inviting a wide variety of people to the breakfast, 
including at least one big Democratic donor, and few party 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she left the clear impression that she would be back to see  
anybody she missed -- next time as presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Maenhout of Manchester approached Mrs. Dole at a private  
reception and offered a deal: Her youth foundation would help 
25,000 kids nationwide if Mrs. Dole would publicly praise the 
organization at the end of that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honey,'' Maenhout quoted Mrs. Dole as saying, ``we might be  
talking sooner than that!''

<HEADLINE>  Report Targets Utah Bid Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The top two officials of Salt Lake's  
Olympic bid were condemned today for ethical violations by an 
internal investigation of the biggest corruption scandal in the 
history of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report focused on Tom Welch, who directed the successful bid  
for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Dave Johnson, his top lieutenant. 
It also singled out Craig Peterson, the former finance chief for 
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation by the independent panel, headed by a former  
Utah Supreme Court justice, found no evidence of criminal conduct, 
said SLOC attorney Beth Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an ethical dilemma, and we did find several instances  
in which individuals stepped over the line,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The impetus for the Salt Lake bid committee's misconduct was  
traced to 1991, when the city was beaten by Nagano, Japan, for the 
1998 Games, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted witnesses as saying that Nagano had won with a ``more  
sophisticated and extravagant'' effort. For example, the Japanese 
gave International Olympic Committee members video cameras while 
Salt Lake was giving away disposable cameras prior to the 1991 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The behavior of some IOC members was eye-opening as well,''  
the report said. Welch was approached by two representatives of 
unidentified IOC members asking for cash in exchange for votes, but 
he turned them down, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In summarizing the more than 300-page report, SLOC chairman  
Robert Garff said Johnson and Welch made unauthorized payments to 
IOC members and their relatives and then hid their actions from the 
bid committee's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody disputed that the mission of the bid committee was to  
secure IOC votes, Garff said, but ``what was not part of the plan 
was Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson's direct payments to IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the bid committee's chief financial officer, Peterson was  
responsible for signing every check. The ethics panel found that 
many large disbursements lacked complete documentation, and 
payments by wire transfers seldom included the required paperwork 
and approvals. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said that while the bid board could have provided better  
oversight, the ethics panel didn't fault its members for the 
excesses of Welch and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel found that Jean Claude Ganga, the IOC member  
from the Republic of Congo who has been suspended by the IOC, and 
members of his family received more than $250,000 in medical care, 
travel and lodging and other gifts and expenses from the bid 
committee and SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said the panel found no evidence the bid committee had  
provided female escorts for visiting IOC members, an allegation 
that had been widely reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It detailed eight wire transfers totaling $33,750 made in  
1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo 
Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract with Great Basin 
Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid Haeggman. Pirjo 
Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here wasn't right, and we are setting it  
right,'' Leavitt said just before the report was released. 
``Olympic corruption did not start here, but it must end here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During an SLOC meeting today, the bid committee's board of  
directors wondered how they could have failed to see the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight failed, in my view, because of collusion,  
concealment, deception and the outside auditors' lack of finding 
the management's evasion of established procedures,'' said Spence 
Eccles, chief executive of First Security Bank, a member of both 
the bid committee and the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	David Jordan, a member of the ethics panel, said there was  
plenty of blame to go around. ``There were many places the system 
fell down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report noted they did not have subpoena  
powers and some people refused to be interviewed. The board spent 
much of its time examining documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the chairman of the bid committee who later became  
SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on the bid board 
had been screened from the details and that he was dismayed to 
learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive Jan. 8, the same day he  
demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry was just one of five investigations  
into Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation, which issued its report last month but is  
still ongoing, focused on its own members. The ethics panel looked 
only at Utah Olympic boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC found that $800,000 in cash payments, scholarships,  
medical care and travel expenses was paid to 14 IOC members. So 
far, nine have been expelled or have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials also may announce this week the selection of  
a new SLOC president. The front-runner is believed to be 
Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, meanwhile, officials said today they found no  
wrongdoing in Nagano's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service that the  
investigation showed that the bidders' treatment of IOC members was 
``within the scope of common sense.''

members. So far, nine have been expelled or have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials said today they had not seen the report in  
advance of the briefing, but several newspapers quoted unidentified 
sources as providing some details. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and USA Today said the report would primarily  
target Welch and Johnson, with the Times reporting that the two 
would be accused of hidden payments and deceptive practices that 
kept other members of the committee from knowing what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post said that Welch's dealings with Alfredo La  
Mont, the U.S. Olympic Committee's former director of international 
relations, will be detailed in the report. The Post, citing an 
unidentified source, also said an investigative panel appointed by 
the USOC is focusing on La Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont resigned from the USOC in January after revealing a  
business arrangement with Welch. Welch's lawyer, Thomas Schaffer, 
said Welch hired La Mont ``strictly as a lobbyist'' to influence 
IOC members from Latin America and South America and paid him from 
$2,500 to about $3,500 a month. The Post's sources said the 
payments totaled about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said the report also would identify  
Craig Peterson as a central player. Peterson handled finances for 
the bid committee after he joined in 1990 and continued in that job 
after the city won its bid and formed SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, meanwhile, officials said today they found no  
wrongdoing in Nagano's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service that the  
investigation showed that the bidders' treatment of IOC members was 
``within the scope of common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that people familiar with the probe said  
investigators had little, if any, access to Welch, Johnson and 
Peterson, and attorneys for the three refused to allow their 
clients to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	It quoted Schaffer as saying the ethics panel refused a  
confidentiality agreement and feared information would be turned 
over to the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt and others 
named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of detail of the 
gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said last week that he had met about 50 IOC members and  
their families, posed for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of 
diplomacy, but, ``I did not ever personally see a gift of great 
value. I was doing everything I could to be charming. I was doing 
my diplomatic duty as the governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the volunteer chairman of the bid committee who  
later became SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on 
the bid board had been screened from the details and that he was 
dismayed to learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said last week that it obtained copies of letters  
written by Joklik and bid committee member James Beardall, seeking 
a forestry job for the husband of a Finnish member of the IOC. The 
letters to Weyerhaeuser Company on behalf of Bjarne Haeggman were 
sent in 1993. The Wall Street Journal said the ethics committee 
report ``doesn't completely exonerate'' Joklik and cites him for 
the Weyerhaeuser letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive Jan. 8, the same day he  
demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal quoted an unidentified source familiar with the  
investigation as saying the report was adamant that the Welch, 
Johnson and Peterson did not inform board trustees about their 
work. The report concludes that ``they not only didn't tell the 
board, they kept it from the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, SLOC board member Ken Bullock has long complained about  
not getting answers to questions about rumored scholarships and 
getting no support from other board members when he sought 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock said he asked about the scholarships each of the last  
three years during board meetings, and got vague answers. He said 
there was a ``don't ask'' sentiment -- that others board members 
wanted him to ``leave it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee also was expected to address the  
question of contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the investigations by the SLOC ethics panel, the IOC and  
the USOC, the Justice Department is looking into violations of 
federal law, and Utah Attorney General Jan Graham -- who also was on 
the bid committee -- is examining potential violations of state 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads the IOC investigation,  
said Monday the Salt Lake panel's report might help advance that 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have seen a lot of documents we have not seen and talked  
with a lot of people we have not talked to, so it may be quite 
helpful,'' he said. ``If it concentrates on their end and gives the 
facts, that helps us on our end. I hope we can avoid endless 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics officials also may announce this week the selection of  
a new SLOC president. The front runner is believed to be 
Massachusetts venture capitalist Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands suspended  
his IOC work until after next month's special meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The special sitting of the IOC will have to clarify whether  
the organization has the power to clean up its act and is therefore 
crucial for the question of whether the Prince of Orange will be 
able to continue his activities in the interests of international 
sport within the IOC,'' Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok wrote in a 
letter to parliament.

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Ties With Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China suspended diplomatic relations with  
Macedonia on Tuesday after the former Yugoslav republic switched 
its ties to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing was also considering whether to veto a U.N. resolution  
supporting peacekeeping in Macedonia, a Chinese government 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	China lodged the strongest possible protest with the Macedonian  
government and decided to suspend diplomatic relations and halt 
implementation of all bilateral agreements, the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan and Macedonia announced their new ties last month. China  
considers Taiwan part of its territory with no right to its own 
international relations, and severs ties with any country that 
recognizes Taiwan as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the severing of relations was announced Tuesday night,  
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said China may change its 
mind about supporting peacekeeping in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The mandate of the 1,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission  
expires on Feb. 20. China, as a permanent member of the Security 
Council, could veto renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	The force was deployed in 1992 during the Bosnian war to prevent  
the spread of the ethnic conflict in other parts of the former 
Yugoslavia. In July, the council unanimously increased its size to 
prevent violence in Kosovo from crossing the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has diplomatic relations with just 28 countries, most of  
them poor, small nations in Latin America and Africa that it 
supports with aid, loans and investment. In Europe, the Vatican is 
the only other state to recognize Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Wichita St. Disciplines Hoops Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Wichita State basketball coach Randy  
Smithson was publicly reprimanded by the university Tuesday for 
violations of NCAA practice limits and for his conduct while 
coaching the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's investigation of the basketball team stemmed from a  
dispute involving star player Maurice Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans quit the team, missing two games before he returned, and  
was quoted as saying that Smithson berated him and other players, 
who he said were also considering quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the university report was on violations of practice  
limits and did not mention Smithson's treatment of players. 
</P>
<P>
	The university announced the reprimand and other disciplinary  
measures in hopes of avoiding sterner NCAA action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am committed to us running an honest, straightforward  
program,'' university president Donald Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithson has three years left on his contract, and athletic  
director Bill Belknap said the university will decide next year 
whether to extend his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In other self-imposed penalties, the school will cut practice  
hours, and neither Smithson nor his assistants will receive pay 
raises for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's report will be forwarded to the Missouri Valley  
Conference and then to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our expectation ... our actions will be strong enough  
that they will be satisfied with what we have done, and that is one 
of the reasons why we took strong actions,'' Belknap said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, a top Division I scorer, left practice late last month,  
complaining of Smithson's treatment. He missed two games but 
returned to avoid being labeled a quitter. The furor over his 
temporary departure prompted an investigation by a university 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithson, whose team has a record of 10-13, apologized to the  
university and fans during a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never try to harm this university and this basketball  
program. ... My goal has always been to work, work, work until that 
job is finished,'' Smithson said. ``However, I feel it is time to 
step back. This has been a tremendous learning experience. It is 
time to find new approaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coaches Carlos Diggins, Donn Parr and Fred Andrews  
were rebuked for exceeding practice limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The disciplinary measures -- which begin immediately and extend  
through March 31, 2000 -- call for more consideration by coaches of 
the need for athletes to spend time with their families and friends 
during the basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also criticized the staff for isolated use of  
profanity during practice. But it found no intended physical abuse 
or mistreatment of players by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the recommendations is that the coaching staff reassess  
its coaching and motivational techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Ayres, the university lawyer who ran the investigation,  
called the coaches ``committed, well-meaning and quality 
individuals'' who became ``enmeshed in an unfortunate 
circumstance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that during one week in November and two weeks  
between Thanksgiving and the end of the fall semester, coaches 
exceeded NCAA limitations on practice time by four to six hours a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches are allowed to hold practices for up to 20 hours a week.  
Now, the team will be restricted to 15 hours of practice weekly.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Patient Looking Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Speaking publicly for the first time  
since receiving a hand transplant, Matthew Scott says he looks 
forward to tackling simple, everyday tasks like holding his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who underwent the transplant operation Jan. 25, said he  
has no feeling in the new left hand, but feels lingering pain from 
where nerves in his arm were attached to the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to, literally, retrain my brain, to think differently  
with my left hand than I do my right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said he also is looking forward to a new two-handed life  
with his wife and two boys, ages 7 and 2, and his job as a 
paramedic and paramedics instructor in Abescon, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``To stand in front of my classroom with an open book in my left  
hand and writing on the chalkboard with my right, to pick my sons 
up in two hands, both of them at the same time -- there are so many 
tiny little things in life that two hands vs. one can make so much 
easier,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott is an assistant director at the School of Paramedic  
Science at Camden County College in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who lost his hand in a 1985 fireworks accident, was  
chosen from dozens for the operation. The world's other hand 
transplant recipient is an Australian who underwent the graft in 
France in September. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was emotional the first time he saw his new hand -- as  
if the last 13 years since the fireworks accident had ``just 
evaporated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott will spend the next three months in a temporary residence  
near Jewish Hospital, where he will continue to undergo physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Scott has had no complications from drugs that he  
will take for the rest of his life that make it less likely his 
body will reject his new hand. The drugs, however, suppress his 
immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dangerous procedure, I understood that going in,''  
Scott said. ``But it's also a chance to break through, to get 
beyond where we are now.''

<HEADLINE> Mario Lemieux Mulls Buying Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins officially began the  
search for different ownership Tuesday when co-owner Roger Marino 
withdrew his request to be solely permitted to reorganize the 
team's finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The only prospective buyer to identify himself so far: None  
other than Mario Lemieux, the greatest player in Penguins history. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino initially planned to ask U.S. Bankruptcy Court to extend  
his exclusive reorganization rights for at least another month, but 
withdrew that request after creditors and the National Hockey 
League Players Association voiced opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those interested in acquiring all or part of the team is  
Lemieux, who is owed $26.2 million in deferred salary by the 
current ownership -- the most of any of the team's numerous 
unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, a six-time NHL scoring champion who retired in 1997,  
heads the creditors committee and was pleasantly surprised with 
Marino's change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to find some investors who would not only buy the  
team but keep them in Pittsburgh,'' Lemieux said. ``It's a great 
hockey town and the fans deserve something better than a team in 
bankruptcy. We've been working very hard, and it's looking pretty 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux did not elaborate on the reasons for his optimism and  
did not identify any possible investors. But he said, ``This is 
something that has gotten to happen soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in  
October, but Marino has continued to run the team as federal 
bankruptcy court sorts out the team's financial mess. 
</P>
<P>
	The team owes creditors about $125 million, or more than the  
franchise's total worth of approximately $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is optimistic of finding partners willing to put money  
into the long-successful but money-losing franchise and keep it in 
Pittsburgh, the Penguins' only home since joining the NHL as an 
expansion franchise in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said at the All-Star Game in Tampa  
last month there were two groups interested in acquiring all or 
part of the Penguins from Marino and co-owner Howard Baldwin. He 
did not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The SMG management group is also believed to be interested in  
acquiring an ownership stake. SMG operates the Civic Arena and 
Three Rivers Stadium and is rumored to be interested in running the 
soon-to-be-expanded David L. Lawrence Convention Center in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG acquired the Civic Arena operational rights from former  
Penguins owner Edward J. DeBartolo for $24 million. The Penguins' 
lease has been renegotiated several times since, and now requires 
them to pay $5 million a year to rent a 38-year-old arena that will 
soon be the oldest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has to be done with the lease,'' Lemieux said. ``SMG  
has smart people, tough people, but for the team to survive here, a 
(lease) deal has to be struck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One possible scenario: SMG declines to renegotiate the lease,  
thus scaring off any prospective investors, only to step forward 
with a reorganization plan of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	However, SMG has never said if it is interested in buying or  
operating the two-time Stanley Cup champions or if it is willing to 
sign a new lease with different owners. 
</P>
<P>
	If a local buyer does not step forward to keep the Penguins in  
Pittsburgh, it is believed that Marino will ask Bankruptcy Judge 
Bernard Markovitz for permission to sell to out-of-town owners or 
relocate the team himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino reportedly contacted as many as nine cities last summer  
in an effort to gauge support for a possible Penguins relocation, 
but later was ordered by Markovitz to cease shopping the team. 
Among the cities reportedly contacted were Kansas City, Houston and 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Penguins' ongoing financial troubles, they have seen  
attendance drop only slightly this season and are currently sixth 
in the Eastern Conference standings.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Diet Drugs Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a shareholder  
lawsuit charging that executives at American Home Products 
benefited from inside information about problems with two popular 
diet drugs that were later recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action suit had alleged that AHP hid the troubles with  
Redux and Pondimin while the executives sold nearly $25 million in 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan ruled Friday that he  
could not sustain charges that AHP improperly withheld damaging 
medical data before the September 1997 recall. Politan noted that 
AHP's stock rose after the problems were disclosed two months 
earlier, and only fell after the recall was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of damage suits are still pending against AHP,  
alleging that the diet drugs caused heart valve damage. AHP, based 
in Madison, N.J., said the suit dismissed by Politan is the only 
one claiming securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholder lawyer Marian P. Rosner said Tuesday that her team  
is studying the decision. ``We have not decided yet, but in all 
likelihood we will appeal,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products spokesman Lowell Weiner said, ``We  
certainly agree with the decision, and we're pleased with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shareholders contended that the company should have informed  
investors after learning in February 1994 of heart valve problems 
in 25 European patients taking Redux. AHP also should have 
disclosed that the Mayo Clinic told the company in March 1997 about 
heart valve problems with five patients taking similar drugs, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Politan ruled that the company did not mislead investors by not  
disclosing that information before July 1997, noting that medical 
authorities had said the findings raised questions but were 
inconclusive and required comprehensive study. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits filed nationwide over Redux and similar drugs were  
consolidated in December 1997 before U.S. District Judge Louis C. 
Bechtle in Philadelphia. A proposed $70 million settlement 
regarding Redux and its developer, Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
of Lexington, Mass., is under consideration there. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released in April 1998 concluded that most of the 2  
million Americans who took Redux were probably not harmed by it. 
Georgetown University researchers said they found no sign that the 
drug caused leaky valves in those who took it for a couple of 
months.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Demotes Miranda Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that  
despite the Supreme Court's landmark 1966 Miranda ruling, 
prosecutors can use a confession from a suspect who opens his mouth 
before he has been read his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling Monday, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals said a 1968 federal law on voluntary 
confessions takes precedence over the Miranda ruling in federal 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision could touch off a new Supreme Court battle over the  
rights of criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the new ruling is law in five states --  
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1966 ruling in Miranda vs. Arizona, handed down by a Supreme  
Court far more liberal than it is today, is known to generations of 
Americans from TV cop shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court said police who question suspects must first tell  
them of their right to remain silent and warn them that anything 
they say can be used against them. They must be told of their right 
to a lawyer, and informed that one will be appointed for them if 
they cannot afford one. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal and state prosecutions ever since, failure to recite  
such warnings most often resulted in a valuable piece of evidence -- 
a confession or some incriminating statement -- being lost to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Congress passed a law that said such confessions can be  
used as long as federal judges are sure the suspects' statements 
were voluntary and not coerced. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, however, the U.S. Justice Department has declined to  
rely on the 1968 law during appeals. In a letter to Congress two 
years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno called it unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 4th Circuit panel ruled that Charles Thomas  
Dickerson's confession to FBI agents that he had robbed a bank in 
Alexandria was admissible. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson said his 1997 statement was given before he was told  
of his right to remain silent and see an attorney. A lower-court 
judge had thrown out the confession. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, a constitutional scholar at Georgetown University  
Law Center, said the Supreme Court is certain to review the case. 
``The court here took a position more pro-government than the 
government,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, who filed a  
friend-of-the-court brief arguing the confession was admissible, 
said the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the Rocky Mountain 
region made a similar ruling, but it did not reach the Supreme 
Court.

<HEADLINE>  `Shakespeare,' `Ryan' Lead Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Hollywood rewarded moviemakers who  
broke the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' opened with a half-hour of unspeakable  
carnage. ``The Thin Red Line'' meandered its way through the battle 
for Guadalcanal with a lot of poetry and very little plot. And 
``Life Is Beautiful'' used comedy to tell a Holocaust story. 
</P>
<P>
	The three movies joined two films that reinvented the  
Elizabethan-era costume drama -- ``Shakespeare in Love'' and 
``Elizabeth'' -- as best-picture nominees Tuesday for the 71st 
Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a tribute to the veterans,'' said ``Private  
Ryan'' director Steven Spielberg, whose movie got 11 nominations. 
``It's important that before this century is out ample recognition 
is paid to the veterans who saved the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' a rollicking romance about the Bard  
seeking his muse, emerged with a leading 13 nominations, one shy of 
the record 14 by ``Titanic'' last year and ``All About Eve'' in 
1950. The most wins for a film is 11, a record held by 1959's 
``Ben-Hur'' and ``Titanic'' last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' about the intrigues behind the throne, tied with  
``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' with seven 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars will be presented March 21 on ABC, with Whoopi  
Goldberg back for a third time as host. 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly the nominations spoke to Hollywood's -- and America's --  
interest in World War II, with three of the five best-picture 
nominees set during that period. At least eight movies dealing with 
the war have won best-picture Oscars, including Spielberg's own 
``Schindler's List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the nominated war pictures bore the stamp of the  
directors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Spielberg, who as one of Hollywood's most powerful filmmakers,  
had the resources to create what many called the most realistic 
depiction of battle ever filmed, with 30 minutes of bloody, noisy, 
confusing and arbitrary hell on the beaches of Normandy. 
Nominations included those for director Spielberg, star Tom Hanks 
and Robert Rodat, for original screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrence Malick, in a triumphant return to Hollywood after a  
two-decade absence (his previous film was ``Days of Heaven'' in 
1978), created in ``The Thin Red Line'' a lyrical film that 
alternated brutal war scenes with stunning nature shots. Malick's 
direction and adapted screenplay were nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roberto Benigni, who is already one of the biggest stars in  
Italy, combined low comedy with tragic circumstances in ``Life Is 
Beautiful'' to tell the story of a father trying to shield his son 
from the horrors of a concentration camp. In a rare feat, Benigni 
was nominated for lead actor, director and screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' also became the first film since 1969's  
``Z'' to be nominated for both best picture and best 
foreign-language film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Academy's interest in World War II was rivaled only by its  
fascination with England's Queen Elizabeth, who reigned 400 years 
ago. Two actresses who played the monarch were nominated: Judi 
Dench, for a supporting role in ``Shakespeare,'' and Cate 
Blanchett, for a lead role in ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare'' also brought nominations to director John  
Madden, star Gwyneth Paltrow, supporting actor Geoffrey Rush and

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. May Investigate Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is inching toward  
opening an investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
handling of the Lewinsky affair, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's internal watchdog agency, the Office of  
Professional Responsibility, recently wrote Starr that it intends 
to investigate Starr's office over several matters, but the office 
is awaiting Starr's response to that notification before starting 
the inquiry, according to officials who spoke Monday on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	One topic for the impending investigation is the Jan. 16, 1998,  
offer by Starr's deputies to former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it 
with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department rules prohibit government prosecutors from  
discussing immunity deals with defendants outside the presence of 
their lawyers. Starr's office is required to follow these rules 
unless doing so would undermine the purpose of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied any impropriety in his office's dealings with  
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The other topics of investigation could not be learned  
immediately. The letter to Starr was first reported by Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the department also went to the brink of  
investigating Starr over the handling of the immunity deal and 
other matters, but he protested in a visit with top Justice 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	After Starr's visit, Attorney General Janet Reno said Justice  
officials had dismissed some of the allegations against Starr but 
had written him a letter at that time seeking his response to other 
outstanding allegations. She also said then no investigation of 
Starr had been opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has authority to fire Starr if she finds ``good cause.''  
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Starr have come from legal observers,  
some Democratic members of Congress and President Clinton's lawyer 
David Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has let U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson handle  
the investigation of alleged grand jury leaks from Starr's staff, 
because Johnson, as chief judge here, oversees the grand jury. The 
judge named a special master to look into those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has picked a team of former Justice officials to oversee  
an investigation of whether one of his key Whitewater witnesses, 
David Hale, received cash from people working for the conservative 
American Spectator magazine.

<HEADLINE> California Drops Probe on Abramson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The State Bar of California has dropped its  
misconduct probe of celebrity attorney Leslie Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar said in a letter to Abramson's lawyer last week that  
there was insufficient evidence showing she committed a violation 
during her defense of parent killer Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
	``This dragged on for three years,'' Abramson said. ``Let's just  
talk about what's fair to people. My goodness gracious, I've been 
embarrassed all that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erik and his brother, Lyle Menendez, were tried twice for the  
1989 shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. 
The 1993 trial ended in a deadlock but the second resulted in their 
conviction. Both are serving life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	At the second trial in 1996, an expert witness, psychiatrist  
William Vicary, suggested that Abramson pressured him to remove 
incriminating material from his notes on interviews with Erik. She 
denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE>  `Shakespeare,' `Ryan' Lead Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Hollywood rewarded moviemakers who  
broke the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan'' opened with a half-hour of unspeakable  
carnage. ``The Thin Red Line'' meandered its way through the battle 
for Guadalcanal with a lot of poetry and very little plot. And 
``Life Is Beautiful'' used comedy to tell a Holocaust story. 
</P>
<P>
	The three movies joined two films that reinvented the  
Elizabethan-era costume drama -- ``Shakespeare in Love'' and 
``Elizabeth'' -- as best-picture nominees Tuesday for the 71st 
Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a tribute to the veterans,'' said ``Private  
Ryan'' director Steven Spielberg, whose movie got 11 nominations. 
``It's important that before this century is out ample recognition 
is paid to the veterans who saved the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' a rollicking romance about the Bard  
seeking his muse, emerged with a leading 13 nominations, one shy of 
the record 14 by ``Titanic'' last year and ``All About Eve'' in 
1950. The most wins for a film is 11, a record held by 1959's 
``Ben-Hur'' and ``Titanic'' last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' about the intrigues behind the throne, tied with  
``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' with seven 
nominations.

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Announcer Sues Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An announcer at one of the nation's top  
thoroughbred race tracks has sued his employer over job 
requirements he says could rekindle the gambling fever that nearly 
ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bothe, 43, contends his compulsive gambling is a disability  
and that the Meadowlands Racetrack management is guilty of 
discrimination for asking him to handicap races on a daily 
closed-circuit television show. 
</P>
<P>
	While other workers have won back pay and other claims against  
employers who fired them for problem gambling, Bothe's lawsuit is 
believed to be one of the first by someone employed in the gambling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe, known as ``The Voice of the Meadowlands,'' began working  
at the track in 1979. Beset by debts, he said he made his last bet 
April 12, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard at the beginning,'' said Bothe, who  
remembered calling fellow members of Gamblers Anonymous between 
races for support. ``I had the full support of the Meadowlands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute arose in December, when Bothe was told his new  
duties on a daily TV show for track patrons would include 
``handicapping'' the races -- predicting the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe said he balked at the requirement and track officials  
responded by threatening to cut his pay from $73,000 to $52,000. 
Bothe's lawyer, Noel Crowley, said the Meadowlands is making 
Bothe's life difficult in an apparent attempt to make him quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The track operator, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition  
Authority, would not comment on pending litigation, spokesman John 
Samerjan said. The Meadowlands complex is a few miles outside New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit filed Monday, Bothe asks that he retain his job with  
no reduction in pay or benefits, and seeks damages for injury to 
his professional stature and loss of public esteem.

<HEADLINE> Jim Pyne Is Browns' Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Jim Pyne got to live the lineman's dream  
Tuesday -- a crowd cheering just for him. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Cleveland Browns first pick in the expansion draft, the  
five-year veteran who started at center for Detroit last season 
found himself in the rare position of standing in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, who was at the Canton Civic Center for the draft, seemed a  
bit awed by the experience. He looked a little flushed as his name 
was called and the Dawg Pound, Cleveland's rowdiest fans, stood up 
and barked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody asked me when the last time I got a standing ovation  
was,'' he said. ``I don't know. I think my mom might have stood up 
at a game one time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, 27, who has a salary cap value of $1.8 million, asked the  
Lions to leave him exposed to the draft. He wasn't happy with the 
offense at Detroit (5-11 last season), and its tendency to run 
Barry Sanders wide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bad situation,'' Pyne said. ``I wanted to be on the  
expansion list -- this is exciting for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer said he was impressed that Pyne has  
played both center and guard earlier in his career at Tampa Bay. 
Pyne's unhappiness in Detroit ``isn't a concern of mine,'' Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne is the youngest of three generations of linemen in his  
family to play pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, George III, was a defensive lineman for the Boston  
Patriots in 1965, while his grandfather, George II, played on both 
sides of the ball for the Providence Steam Rollers in 1931-32. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne didn't even know his father played pro ball until he found  
his old newspaper clippings in the attic. His dad didn't want to 
put pressure on his three sons to play football, Pyne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the center keeps his own trophies hidden away. But Pyne's  
low-key attitude was thrown a little by his greeting from the 
Browns fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a center,'' he said. ``It's not a glamorous position and  
I'm not a glamorous guy. Well, I guess I am now.''

<HEADLINE> Gotti Co-Defendant Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Another of John A. ``Junior'' Gotti's  
co-defendants accepted a plea bargain Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvatore Locascio, 39, son of an imprisoned mob consigliere,  
admitted in federal court that he received $260,000 from an illegal 
gambling operation in 1991 and 1992 and failed to report it on his 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal guidelines call for a prison sentence of 10 to 16  
months. Locascio also agreed to forfeit $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All charges against Locascio relating to racketeering and  
extortion at the Manhattan topless club Scores -- charges Gotti 
still faces -- were dropped in exchange for his plea. He was not 
required to admit membership in the Gambino crime family. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea leaves Gotti with just four co-defendants, down from  
the original 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had described Locascio as a capo in the Gambino  
family who was designated to act for his father, Frank Locascio. 
The elder Locascio was convicted of murder with John J. Gotti, 
father of ``Junior'', in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti is accused of helping to run the Gambino family, extorting  
Scores and plotting a telephone-card scam. He could get 20 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, Bruce Cutler, said Gotti is ``resolved to fight  
the accusations.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian, U.S. Skiers Crack Top 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Darin McBeath has done enough in the World  
Alpine Ski Championships to have his name pronounced correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	It's McBeth, like the Shakespearean character, not Mc-Beeth as  
he's been called while posting top results for the Canadian men's 
Alpine team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in wanting to finish in the top 15 in super-G and  
downhill,'' the 22-year-old speedster from Calgary said. ``I didn't 
accomplish that, but I'm happy with my experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McBeath was thrust to the forefront when Canada lost veteran  
downhillers Cary Mullen and Edi Podivinsky to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their -- what would you call it? -- un-luck was my good  
fortune,'' McBeath said. ``It opened the door for me to show the 
coaches what I could do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You miss the experience and the camaraderie of having Cary and  
Edi around, but I couldn't wait for them to get well. I had to 
start my own career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McBeath was 20th in the downhill, ranking second to 16th-place  
Brian Stemmle among Canadian racers. McBeath started 30th in the 
downhill, by which time wind and snow was making it impossible for 
late starters to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe if I'd had better luck with the weather, I'd have  
reached my goal of finishing in the top 15,'' McBeath said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 21st in the super-G and, on Tuesday, finished 13th in the  
combined, in which skiers combine their times for one run of 
downhill and two of slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to the combined for a chance to maybe do  
better in the downhill,'' he said. ``I wanted to ski solid. I 
wasn't sure how I would do in slalom since I haven't trained a lot 
of slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he completed his first World Championships without  
contending for a medal, McBeath took away some valuable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know now why I put in all those long hours of training,'' he  
said. ``At times I wasn't sure what I was doing it for, but being 
here showed me this is what I have to do and what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala, a native of the Czech Republic raised in Breckenridge,  
Colo., is, at 23, something of a mirror image of McBeath. He's 
mainly a speedster who came in 28th in the downhill after battling 
impossible weather conditions on Beaver Creek's Birds of Prey 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing much was expected of him in the combined, but he ranked  
14th in the downhill portion and managed two solid if unsensational 
slalom runs to finish 16th in the field of 40 that began the 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to make it down today,'' he said. ``I had a  
lot of problems down this pitch (Pepi's Face). It was steep and 
icy. To come through the finish was a big result for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiala and McBeath both got a lift from the American crowd, and  
it made the Canadian look ahead to another American ski party, the 
2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they like Canadians. Whatever, the fans were loud when I  
came into the finish and I appreciated it,'' McBeath said. ``Since 
way back, I've been thinking about 2002. I don't want to base my 
career on the Olympics but it's definitely something I want to do. 
Just making the Olympics is tough.''

<HEADLINE> Ina, Zimmerman Favored in US Pairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- It's rare that a newly created team is  
favored in any sport. It's particularly unusual in figure skating, 
where years of detailed practices are necessary for a couple to 
challenge for a title. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, together only a few months,  
are the odds-on choice to win the pairs competition at the U.S. 
Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina has been at the top before, with previous partner Jason  
Dungjen. They won the last two American crowns and were fourth at 
the Nagano Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But the skaters barely were coexisting after seven years  
together, and after Dungjen's injury forced them to withdraw from 
the world championships last March, they split. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still wanted to skate, so I began looking for an experienced  
partner, which isn't an easy thing to find,'' Ina said. ``John has 
been successful as a pairs skater and he was looking for a partner, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Zimmerman couldn't have imagined he would wind up with  
one of the best pairs skaters in the United States. He smiles when 
asked about the pressure of teaming with someone who has won the 
national championship and been to two Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't want to skate with someone like Kyoko, who's won  
all those championships and knows how to handle the pressure?'' 
said Zimmerman, who at 25 is one year younger than Ina and finished 
third in U.S. pairs in 1997 with former partner Stephanie Stiegler. 
</P>
<P>
	Even better, they now train with Tamara Moskvina, the most  
accomplished pairs coach in the world. Moskvina had the top two 
couples at Nagano and, in addition to being the best storyteller in 
the sport, she is an innovator. Moskvina will gamble with routines, 
pairs maneuvers and, yes, the makeup of her duos. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the best,'' Zimmerman said. ``It's really an honor to  
work with her, and after what she's done with so many great pairs, 
we're working very hard to learn from Tamara.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've learned their early lessons well. Ina and Zimmerman  
already have qualified for the Grand Prix finals, although they 
have yet to win a competition. They were second at the prestigious 
Trophee Lalique, however, and have been skating against high-level 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	They won't meet such impressive competition at nationals, which  
begin tonight with compulsory dance and several junior events. With 
1998 world runners-up Jenni Meno and Todd Sand now skating on tour, 
two teams of siblings figure to challenge for medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle and Steve Hartsell steadily have moved up the ranks and  
were third at last year's nationals, just missing a trip to Nagano. 
They began this season with a win at the Vienna Cup and were fourth 
at the Skate America and NHK Trophy international events. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells are 18 and 21, respectively. That gives them the  
edge in age over sister-brother combination Tiffany and Johnnie 
Stiegler: she is 15 and he is 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stieglers -- both younger siblings to Stephanie, Zimmerman's  
onetime partner -- were fourth at the '98 nationals and also came in 
fourth at the most recent world junior championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Another strong junior team, Laura Lynn Handy and J. Paul  
Binnebose, placed second at those worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult to picture any of those young couples beating Ina  
and Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next big step,'' Zimmerman said. ``Making the  
Grand Prix finals was big, and this is our first nationals. We've 
had a good year so far, but there's a lot more ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Mayor To Seek Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Mayor Wellington Webb said Tuesday he would seek a  
third four-year term, backing off an earlier pledge to step aside 
after two terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, speaking to 400 supporters, said he still had some  
``unfinished business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, the city's first black mayor, said he wants to build on  
Denver's successes by improving poor neighborhoods, easing traffic 
congestion and managing growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, 57, is expected to easily defeat the Rev. Gil Ford and  
political newcomer Stephanie Huey, a pastor, in the nonpartisan 
election set for May 4.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Dawgs Unleashed at Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- After three years in the kennel, the Dawg  
Pound was finally unleashed Tuesday -- and they were ready to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Four thousand of Cleveland's most loyal fans packed into the  
Canton Civic Center to watch the Browns pick castoff players from 
the NFL's other teams in the expansion draft, including that 
section of bone-waving, mask-wearing fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is something isn't it?'' said Tim Jenks of Northeast,  
Pa., as he looked down from the Dawg Pound at the made-for-TV set 
where the Browns made their picks. ``All this for an expansion 
draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenks and fellow season ticket-holder Dan Malm of Toronto had  
been in town since Monday, looking for tickets to the draft. They 
finally snagged a pair while tailgating hours before the draft 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't get any better than this for Browns fans,'' said  
Jenks, a felt Browns helmet perched on his head. ``Your heart is 
just constantly beating fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day felt like a Woodstock for Cleveland lovers.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Hooper, beaming through orange and brown face paint at the  
chance to sit next to John ``Big Dawg'' Thompson, kicked off his 
festivities about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was about the third guy here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once they were in the arena, the fans were primed to bark.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Browns like Bernie Kosar were mobbed by autograph seekers  
as they walked through the crowd, and the Pound gave a standing 
ovation to Cleveland owner Al Lerner and team president Carmen 
Policy as they stepped into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Chants of ``Here we go Brownies -- here we go! Woof! Woof!''  
ripped through the Dawg Pound. Every time former Browns owner Art 
Modell, who moved the old team after the 1995 season, was shown on 
a highlight film that played before the draft started, the Pound 
booed long and loud. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd only cooled after giving another round of standing  
ovations to the team's first five picks, who were all on hand to 
see themselves get drafted: Jim Pyne, Hurvin McCormack, Scott 
Rehberg, Damon Gibson and Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they settled down to watch their own draft charts,  
the media savvy Dawgs still barked on queue for the ESPN2 cameras 
showing the event live. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the die-hards, right here,'' Malm said.

<HEADLINE> Tucker OKs $1.6M Deal With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Outfielder Michael Tucker and the Cincinnati  
Reds avoided arbitration by agreeing today to a $1.6 million, 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds had offered Tucker $1.4 million. Tucker had asked for a  
raise from $370,000 to $1.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, 27, hit .244 with 13 home runs and 46 RBIs last year  
with Atlanta. He was traded to the Reds on Nov. 10 along with 
left-hander Denny Neagle and a minor leaguer for second baseman 
Bret Boone and left-hander Mike Remlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing left the Reds with just player eligible for  
arbitration: right-hander John Hudek.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Ten more IOC members were implicated  
Tuesday by an ethics panel report that described in shocking detail 
-- from ritzy hotels to fistfuls of cash -- the extreme means Salt 
Lake City used to land votes for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the U.S. Olympic Committee was tied to the  
ever-widening corruption scandal, with the report citing a series 
of exchanges among three senior staffers involving ``promises ... 
made to secure votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 International Olympic Committee members mentioned in the  
report were not previously tied to Salt Lake's excesses. In all, 24 
IOC members have been implicated in vote-buying schemes -- roughly 
one-fifth of its membership. Nine IOC members have been expelled or 
have resigned in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Free trips to the Super Bowl, stays in ritzy Paris hotels, ski  
vacations and piles of cash were among improper perks and payments 
cited in the 300-page report by an independent ethics panel for the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch, bid committee  
president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the two universally credited for bringing the 2002  
Winter Games to Salt Lake, even by those who divulged damning 
information about Welch and Johnson to the ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also were described as the architects of a scheme born  
on the day in 1991 that Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Games 
to Nagano, Japan, by just four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	From that day in Birmingham, England, where Welch claims to have  
turned down two offers of IOC member influence for cash, Welch and 
Johnson stretched Salt Lake's legitimate quest to win IOC member 
friends into an unethical and at times secretive mission, the 
ethics panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted the lengths to which Salt Lake's boosters went to  
win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Welch made a wire transfer from his children's  
trust account when the wife of Siuli Paul Wallwork, the IOC member 
from Western Samoa, sought $30,000 for a friend in a serious 
situation. Welch later told a bid committee employee the money had 
been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, Johnson and, to a lesser extent, former administrative  
officer Craig Peterson, had both a strategic and off-the-cuff 
approach for improper spending, said David Jordan, a former U.S. 
attorney on the five-member ethics panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the bid board were not told of direct cash payments  
or details of bogus scholarships, and outside auditors failed to 
raise red flags about those expenditures, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel did not total up the amounts but the improper  
payments -- some in the form of scholarships -- exceeded $1 million. 
Another $1 million in air fare, hotel rooms and shopping sprees 
were donated to the bid committee and passed along to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Welch and Johnson were interviewed at length by the ethics  
panel, but Peterson and Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, 
declined to be interviewed, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 electronic-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It 
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network --  
the single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
The ethics panel did not have access to bank records and had no 
subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee, and  
the committee paid for his family to stay at the Intercontinental 
Hotel in Paris for 11 days in 1994 and 11 days in 1995 at $300 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also detailed eight wire transfers totaling  
$33,750 made in 1994-95 to Bjarne Haeggman, the husband of Finnish 
IOC member Pirjo Haeggman, under the guise of a consulting contract 
with Great Basin Engineering Inc. of Ogden, Utah, which never paid 
Haeggman. Mrs. Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new IOC members mentioned in the report were Phillip  
Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, who with 
their families made four visits together to the United States, in 
one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted by Welch at 
a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee on several occasions paid for IOC members to  
stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended periods of 
time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City,'' the report 
said. Others received expenses-paid trips to Las Vegas, Niagara 
Falls and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> NBC Pays To Settle Rivera Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has agreed to pay $10,000 to a lawyer who  
claimed Geraldo Rivera reneged on a promise to pay that sum to 
anyone who could prove a person had been prosecuted for lying about 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera issued the sex-perjury challenge Sept. 24 on the CNBC  
television show ``Rivera Live'' that was devoted to analysis of the 
investigations of President Clinton's relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokesman John Brine said the network will pay Mark Bogatin  
rather than slog through a lengthy legal fight, even though it 
``continues to believe that none of the claims have satisfied the 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely a business decision,'' Brine said. ``Geraldo  
strongly disagrees with NBC's decision to settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogatin said after about five hours of research in a law  
library, he found five cases and sent them to Rivera. The show 
failed to pay, and he sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogatin said the network's decision to settle ``represents an  
acknowledgment that Rivera was wrong to deny my claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, a lawyer, contended the investigation of Clinton for  
allegedly lying about his sexual conduct was unprecedented and that 
criminal prosecutions are simply not brought for lies about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has paid $10,000 to Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing, a  
husband-wife lawyer team in Washington, because cases they 
submitted met the criteria of the challenge, Brine said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney, and his wife, a former Justice  
Department official, frequently appear on television as 
conservative commentators. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple donated the money to the Ronald McDonald House, Brine  
said.

	Total meals and lodging expenses for several IOC members  
exceeded $10,000 and two IOC members' expenses were more than 
$25,000, the report said, while gifts of everything from luggage, 
golf clubs, dogs and an exercise machine to appliances, doorknobs 
and lawn equipment were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Ecuador's IOC member Agustin Arroyo was given a  
$10,000 two-week vacation at a Park City condominium. His daughter, 
Nancy Rignault Arroyo, was given $23,000 in living expenses 
because, as Welch put it, she needed the personal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show $3,000 per month passing through a  
company affiliated with a consultant to Austin Sealy, an IOC member 
from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted the grandson of Mohamed Zerguini, the IOC  
member from Algeria, was given $14,500 in cash at the suggestion of 
Toronto consultant Mahmoud El Farnawani. It was unethical for El 
Farnawani, who was paid $148,260 for presumably legitimate 
consulting work, to broker that kind of a payment, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report details why Kim Un-yong, the IOC member from  
South Korea, remains under investigation by that body. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid committee records show it paid $45,000 toward the salary of  
Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company then based in Salt Lake. The checks 
indicated they were for satellite transmission consulting. 
Keystone's former chief executive said the bid committee paid all 
of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch had arranged the job when Kim sought help for his son who  
was in New York and being laid off from his job. The elder Kim's 
attorney told the ethics panel the IOC member did not know the bid 
committee had reimbursed Keystone for his son's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid committee also arranged for Kim's daughter, a pianist,  
to perform with the Utah Symphony in 1995. She was paid $5,000 and 
the bid committee paid $3,750 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also notes that Kim sought bid committee help  
in getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student, 
Yekaterina Soukhorado, at the University of Utah. The committee 
ended up spending $15,000 on Soukhorado. The relationship between 
the two is not clear, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing, and Welch last week  
said Gov. Mike Leavitt and others knew what was going on. Leavitt 
and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied knowledge of 
detail of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has refused to discuss his role in the bid committee,  
in part because he signed a contract that demanded his silence 
about Olympic matters when he left SLOC in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, U.S. 
Olympic Committee, Justice Department and Utah attorney general. 
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is 
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting by what is certain to be millions of dollars in federal 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid board, comprised largely of Salt Lake business leaders,  
could have had better procedures to catch the problems, the panel 
concluded. It's not clear why the spending was not noticed by 
outside auditors, who didn't give the panel access to papers or 
interviews, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. May Investigate Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is inching toward  
opening an investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
handling of the Lewinsky affair, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's internal watchdog agency, the Office of  
Professional Responsibility, recently wrote Starr that it intends 
to investigate Starr's office over several matters, but the office 
is awaiting Starr's response to that notification before starting 
the inquiry, according to officials who spoke Monday on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	One topic for the impending investigation is the Jan. 16, 1998,  
offer by Starr's deputies to former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it 
with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department rules prohibit government prosecutors from  
discussing immunity deals with defendants outside the presence of 
their lawyers. Starr's office is required to follow these rules 
unless doing so would undermine the purpose of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied any impropriety in his office's dealings with  
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The other topics of investigation could not be learned  
immediately. The letter to Starr was first reported by Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the department also went to the brink of  
investigating Starr over the handling of the immunity deal and 
other matters, but he protested in a visit with top Justice 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	After Starr's visit, Attorney General Janet Reno said Justice  
officials had dismissed some of the allegations against Starr but 
had written him a letter at that time seeking his response to other 
outstanding allegations. She also said then no investigation of 
Starr had been opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has authority to fire Starr if she finds ``good cause.''  
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Starr have come from legal observers,  
some Democratic members of Congress and President Clinton's lawyer 
David Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has let U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson handle  
the investigation of alleged grand jury leaks from Starr's staff, 
because Johnson, as chief judge here, oversees the grand jury. The 
judge named a special master to look into those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has picked a team of former Justice officials to oversee  
an investigation of whether one of his key Whitewater witnesses, 
David Hale, received cash from people working for the conservative 
American Spectator magazine.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor Nixes Talks for Olympic Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A major sponsor said Tuesday it was canceling  
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in ads to protest the 
International Olympic Committee's failure to deal with the growing 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations officer of  
John Hancock insurance, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch, for its 
handling of the bribery case that started in Salt Lake and has 
spread worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day, the IOC loses a bit more credibility,'' he said.  
``It's clear the leaders of the IOC want to wake up and this is all 
gone away and they have their club back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from his Boston office, D'Alessandro  
stopped short of calling for Samaranch to resign. But in perhaps 
the harshest words so far from within the tightknit community of 
Olympic officials, broadcasters and sponsors, the John Hancock 
chief said Samaranch's days at the top of the IOC may be running 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think Kenny Rogers said it best: `Know when to hold  
'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to 
run,''' D'Alessandro said. ``I think Samaranch is getting close to 
the end of his `fold 'em' stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network was unaware of  
D'Alessandro's decision on the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no issues with other advertisers,'' she said.  
``We've continued to have tremendous interest in the Olympics and 
have closed major deals with several advertisers in the past few 
weeks. They've understood that the Olympics are about the games and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro's company pays about $50 million to be the official  
life insurance and annuities sponsor of the Olympics and use the 
five-ring logo in its ads. 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alessandro said that the IOC had become ``a cult of  
royals,'' and since the scandal broke in early December there had 
been only two high points for the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	One, he said, was when vice president Dick Pound was appointed  
to investigate the Salt Lake allegations for the IOC ``instead of 
one of their ventriloquist dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second, he continued, came when nine members of the IOC  
resigned or were expelled and Samaranch apologized for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first moment in which the sponsors correctly said,  
`Oh, he gets it,''' D'Alessandro said. ``You know what? That was 
the last moment when it could be correctly said, `Oh, he gets 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So now, after weeks of supporting the IOC leadership,  
D'Alessandro laid out a plan to distance his company from the 
committee despite a contract that runs through the Sydney Games in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has removed the Olympic Rings from his company's  
annual report and from correspondence due to be sent out over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings also have been removed from John Hancock billboards at  
Fenway Park in Boston and other stadiums and arenas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to the expense of putting them back on,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And D'Alessandro said he had stopped talks about Olympic  
commercial time on NBC, the U.S. broadcast rights holder for the 
games through 2008. He estimated that package was worth $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was meant to pressure the network, the single biggest  
revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion rights contract, to 
try to convince the committee of the need for meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC tells them to change, you don't think the IOC will listen?  
What are they going to do, go find someone else?'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The needed changes include open meetings and voting, term limits  
for members and more democratic proceedings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
		   D'Alessandro said the IOC contract offered no direct escape  
clause, ``but you don't have to promote it, you don't have to use 
the rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if the rings become too devalued as an  
advertising tool, ``we would approach it as we would if we had 
bought the Olympic car. If that car does not operate properly and 
as expected, you no longer drive that car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said he had not spoken with other sponsors  
regarding the scandal but had taken his concerns to top IOC 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their response was, `We're going to investigate thoroughly and  
we're going to do things right,''' he said. ``Please!''

<HEADLINE> Nike.com Opens for Business Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike launched its first electronic sales  
effort Tuesday with Nike.com, opening its doors directly to 
consumers who want to buy sneakers, clothing and sports equipment 
with a mouse click. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales will be limited to Nike's ``Alpha Project'' line of new  
products for the first three months. The world's largest shoemaker 
plans to expand its offerings later this year after studying 
consumer reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike chairman Phil Knight likened it to returning to his roots,  
when he began the business by selling shoes out of the trunk of his 
1964 Plymouth Valiant. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Internet, we have an opportunity to recapture a level  
of intimacy with our consumer,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kate Buckley, director of new business ventures for Nike,  
said the site will be good for both Nike and consumers. Not only 
will it provide consumers a wealth of information about the 
technology behind the products, but Nike will get a better view of 
customer tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're designing the store so that consumers can get more  
information than they can get from any retail clerk,'' Buckley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nike Web site also will serve as a model for some of the  
major retailers, who have not been very effective online so far, 
said John Shanley, an analyst for Van Kasper, a San Francisco 
investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanley said he met with a number of major retail executives  
Tuesday, and their fears that Nike might be cutting into their 
market with the online service had eased with the addition of a 
locator service on the Web site that will list retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are walking a fine line,'' Shanley said of Nike. ``I come  
from a retail background, and retailers are understandably 
reluctant to give up any share of their pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alpha Project products include the Air Zoom GP basketball  
shoe that features a self-ratcheting system, the Air Zoom Citizen 
running shoe that weighs less than 11 ounces, and Dri-FIT apparel, 
designed to move sweat off the skin to the surface of the clothing 
to evaporate.

<HEADLINE> Oprah Winfrey May End Her TV Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime  
television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready 
to bail out of her long-running show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am all talked out,'' Winfrey told The Sunday Times. ``My  
contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows 
because I feel they are going to burn themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah  
Winfrey Show'' in September 1986. Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it 
recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told  
the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her 
stint on the movie set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more  
dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling  
his show a ``vulgarity circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just  
hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have 
sexual intercourse -- and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy 
pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes 
a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted 
as telling the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping  
her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a 
publicist in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued  
Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey 
would continue the show after the end of her current contract.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Get Word on Possible Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators have decided to pass on to  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr unsubstantiated information that 
suggests the White House has a taping system that might have 
recorded telephone conversations between President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart has denied the  
existence of such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators received information about a week ago raising the  
possibility that such a system might exist, but they have not 
confirmed it. Eager to finish the impeachment trial, they decided 
it would be best sent to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I've done is make available information sent to me,''  
Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate officials said the information was raised at a meeting of  
GOP senators, who showed little appetite for delaying the trial to 
find out whether any such tapes exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking about what to do about this and I suggested  
why don't we turn it over to Starr,'' Assistant Majority Leader Don 
Nickles said. ``It's for him to handle; its not for us to handle.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators say they have given  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr what they admit is 
unsubstantiated information that suggests there is a taping system 
in the White House that captured phone calls between President 
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not aware of any taping system,'' White House spokesman

	Toiv said there are occasional instances where the president

<HEADLINE> Artichoke Crop Tender, Abundant / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTROVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Kenny Lazzerini picks a  
softball-sized artichoke from a bin and gives it a squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear that squeak?'' the grower asks. ``This is going to be  
an excellent year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three rough seasons of floods, heat and El Nino rains brought  
soggy, small, expensive and silent artichokes to store shelves. 
This year, barring a late freeze, the cycle will be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fields surrounding Castroville, the self-proclaimed  
Artichoke Capital of the World, chest-high plants are laden this 
month with the tender, edible thistles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really want consumers to enjoy their artichokes this year  
because Lord knows, it's been rough,'' said Mary Comfort, executive 
director of the California Artichoke Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Artichokes, first commercially grown in the United States in  
1922 by Italian immigrants, are produced exclusively in California 
and almost entirely on the central coast in a foggy, moist 
microclimate where it's never too hot or cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the crop value was $46 million, with most sold in  
large metropolitan areas on the East and West coasts. More than 
one-third of Americans have eaten a fresh, cooked artichoke, but 
those who have tried to enjoy one during the past few years have 
been sadly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	The most severe weather problems many farmers can remember came  
in March 1995, just weeks before the harvest peaked. One of the 
most vicious storm systems in state history washed away millions of 
dollars worth of vegetables on the Central Coast, including about 
half the artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers worked to recover, replanting the perennials with root  
cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came El Nino, bringing more than $500 million of damage to  
California's agriculture, and soaking the roots of the artichokes 
until they couldn't absorb nutrients from the soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``After El Nino, the artichokes were scarce, they were expensive  
and they didn't taste so good,'' said Ray Bei, whose family has for 
35 years run the Giant Artichoke produce market in Castroville, 
about 80 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional Green Globe artichoke farmers grow plants cloned  
from root stock planted 80 years ago. As their crops declined in 
recent years, large produce companies have been experimenting with 
several new types of hardier artichokes grown from seed -- the Big 
Heart, Imperial Star and Desert Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	So far these hybrids lack the flavor and texture of the classic  
Green Globes, but consumers -- many unaware that they were trying a 
new variety -- have had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried growing them last year, but people came to me and  
said, 'I want a real artichoke. Not one of these cardboard things,' 
'' said Lazzerini. ``I had to stop growing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year has been easy on artichokes. Rainfall has been  
moderate, and four days of bitter temperatures in late December 
that almost entirely wiped out California's citrus crop barely 
frosted the artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Those being harvested this month are reaching store shelves with  
some brownish scars on the outside, but no internal damage. And 
when the artichoke season reaches its height in March and April, 
the vegetables should be green, robust, heavy and tastier than 
they've been in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices, which have reached as high as $3 each for jumbo  
artichokes in recent years, are expected to drop to below $1 each. 
Smaller artichokes may be as cheap as 20 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	That's wonderful news to Therese DesCamp of Carmel, who laid out  
$2.99 for one artichoke last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was incredibly expensive,'' she said. ``But I just had to  
have one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DesCamp bought artichokes last week from a roadside stand,  
grinning as she discussed how creamy, sweet and fun this year's 
crop will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have them for dinner,'' she said. ``We'll have them as  
appetizers. We'll have them a lot.''

<HEADLINE> American's Passengers Left Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Luz Maria Torres sat on a stroller, her 1-month-old  
son on her lap, as she waited in frustration Tuesday for an 
American Airlines flight to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``One was going to leave at 8 a.m., and they canceled it.  
Another was going to leave at 10:30, and they canceled it also,'' 
said Ms. Torres, who arrived at Miami International Airport Monday 
night only to be put up in a hotel and shuttled back to the airport 
several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 American flights have been canceled since talks  
bogged down between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association 
late Friday. Nearly one-third of American's 2,250 flights were 
canceled Tuesday, with Miami and New York the hardest-hit regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Torres, 19, who left Boston expecting a short stop in Miami,  
said she spent more than $100 during the delay -- on food for 
herself, a taxi to buy a clean shirt for Luis Manuel and some extra 
canned milk. ``My milk for him ran out because I only had enough 
for yesterday,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the terminal around her, passengers passed the hours dozing  
on carts stuffed with luggage, slumped in their chairs or collapsed 
on the carpet. A few cursed aloud after learning their flights were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	On the airline's computer monitors, ``CANCELED'' blinked in blue  
lettering next to a list of destinations: Nassau, Bahamas; Santo 
Domingo, Dominican Republic; St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers at other airports were having similar experiences.  
</P>
<P>
	Beatriz Chichizola, a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, said  
she had to wait hours at Los Angeles International Airport before 
receiving an explanation about the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were to happen in Argentina, they would burn the  
airport,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines referred calls from the news media to a  
recorded telephone message with general information about canceled 
flights. It said representatives would not be available to provide 
information about specific cancellations in each city. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations between the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline and its  
pilots union resumed Tuesday over how quickly the company can 
integrate pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into its work 
force. No agreement was reached and both sides agreed to resume 
negotiations Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	American's pilots have been bickering with the airline's parent  
company, AMR Corp., saying the company should be adding Reno Air 
pilots to its roster more quickly, thereby moving employees up on 
its pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons between the two airlines' wage scales are difficult  
because of several variables. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old Reno Air only flies MD-80 jets, while pilots of  
different aircraft at American receive different rates of pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A captain at Reno with six years of experience makes roughly  
$75,000 a year, said Reno Air pilot spokesman Bob Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Airlines salary contract listings, an  
MD-80 captain with 12 years of experience makes $174.53 an hour, 
flying a full schedule of 78 hours a month, or roughly $164,000 a 
year. At this time, however, no American pilot can actually hold an 
MD-80 captain job at only six years seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law does not allow American pilots to strike over the  
issue, but scores of pilots have called in sick and refused 
overtime on extra flights, creating an unusually severe shortage of 
cockpit crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a farmer from South Otselic, N.Y., left nearby  
Syracuse for a weeklong vacation to Aruba and was stranded with 
five friends at Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've given us the run-around,'' he said. ``We think the  
pilots on strike should be fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 people waited in line at the American Airlines counter  
at San Francisco International Airport -- Dorothy Krumper of 
Flanders, N.J. among them. Although her flight to New York was 
canceled, she was smiling and said the airline's employees treated 
her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very nice. I'm being re-ticketed to United,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International, the gateway to Latin America for many  
American flights, Ms. Torres was having trouble keeping her tired 
infant from whimpering. Only after she put his bottle's rubber 
nipple in his mouth did his tiny hands relax. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Torres said she hoped it would not be much longer until she  
could be with her mother in San Francisco de Macoris, in the 
northern region of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like this,'' she said. ``This has never happened to  
me.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower this afternoon but trimming  
their morning losses, which were led by a sharp sell-off in 
technology shares. At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down 39.13 at 9,251.98. The Dow got as low 
as 9172.42, down 118 points, before retracing most of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower, with the technology-heavy  
Nasdaq composite index down 43.81 at 2,361.11, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index down 9.47 at 1,234.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 8 to 5 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.98 million shares, down 
from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are taking profits in technology shares, which had  
clearly led the market higher in recent months, and not replacing 
them with other stocks at the moment, traders said. ``The loss of 
leadership in the technology sector is the most important,'' said 
Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in 
Charlotte, N.C. ``The highest expectation should be for a 
correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stock prices were going through a ``a very natural  
correction'' after huge run-ups in recent months, said Ciaran 
O'Kelly, a technology-stock trader at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is over,  
``the market is looking for a new catalyst for these companies, and 
right now there doesn't seem to be that catalyst,'' O'Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos's acquisition of USA Networks Inc.'s Home Shopping Network  
and other properties, announced this morning, was expected and did 
not prove to be that catalyst. Lycos shares were trading at 95 
5/16, down 31 15/16, while USA Networks shares were up 5 5/8 at 43 1/2, 
both in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile technology names were sharply lower in both  
Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange trading. AOL was down 9 3/4 at 149 1/4 
in leading volume on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft-drink and beverage stocks were stronger, suggesting a  
possible favoring by investors of recession-resistent consumer 
stocks. But drug stocks, which also are viewed as 
recession-resistent but have performed well lately, were taking big 
hits. The Dow industrials were led lower by Merck, down 4 1/16 at 
145 13/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down 1 at 83.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry made his debut as spokesman  
for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, saying 
he is optimistic about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees slugger, who spent time at a drug clinic,  
told about 70 recovering addicts at the council's offices Monday 
that he started drinking beer and using marijuana in junior high 
school. He called his behavior ``normal things kids do that we 
think are fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his dependence increased when he made it to the pros,  
where ``there's more pressure to be somebody everybody else wants 
you to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 36, underwent surgery in October to remove a  
cancerous tumor from his colon and has had chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of hope after suffering through cancer and  
recovering from cancer and alcohol and drugs,'' Strawberry told the 
group. ``What more can a man go through?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry will attend Yankees spring training, which starts  
Wednesday. He agreed to a minor-league contract for 1999 until he 
is able to play in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Albright Plans Asia Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans a  
trip to Asia at month's end, the State Department announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright will visit China, Thailand and Indonesia to confirm  
continued U.S. strategic commitments to the region and to take up 
other topics such as the Asian financial crisis and progress toward 
free election in Indonesia, said spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	She leaves Sunday, Feb. 28, for China, moves on to Thailand  
March 3 and Indonesia the next day, Rubin said. Indonesia has 
scheduled a presidential election for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's meetings in China will prepare for the visit of  
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to the United States in the spring, 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will be in Indonesia to provide her an opportunity to  
explore with the government and opposition leaders key 
developments, including preparations for national elections, 
scheduled for this June, the future of East Timor, and 
strengthening prospects for early economic recovery,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright had been scheduled to visit Indonesia after the  
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur in November 
but canceled the trip to deal with the crisis in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Editor Charged With Wife's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- When Nancy Adams Holt was reported  
missing, her husband told police she probably went away for a few 
days to think over their marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks later, Donald Wayne Holt offered authorities a  
different explanation for his wife's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, the senior editor for a national cancer  
center journal told them they could find his wife dead, under a 
blanket, in her car's back seat at the airport. She had been 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, who is being held without bond on a murder charge,  
allegedly confessed to killing his wife in their garage Jan. 18, 
driving to the airport and taking a cab back to their home in the 
rolling hills of suburban Mount Airy. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Richard Bricken didn't return telephone calls  
from The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say they were unaware of any trouble between the Holts,  
who had been married 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They presented themselves pretty much like any ordinary family  
in the community,'' said the Rev. Carol Yocum, a pastor at Calvary 
United Methodist Church, where both were active in fund-raising 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, 44, is a senior editor of the Journal of the National  
Cancer Institute in Bethesda, where he prepared research papers for 
publication. Mrs. Holt, 43, worked for the federal Health Care 
Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had 11-year-old twins and a 9-year-old daughter, who  
are now staying with their maternal grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	After Holt failed to show up for a police interview, police  
found him at his brother's home. Holt requested to be taken to a 
hospital, where he admitted himself for a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	He confessed there Saturday, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Letters to Party Urge Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Rockefeller family member delivered to the  
Republican National Committee three file boxes filled with letters 
from Republicans nationwide urging senators to vote to censure 
President Clinton for his behavior, not to oust him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Rockefeller, nephew of the late Vice President and New  
York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller -- one of the most prominent moderate 
Republicans of his day -- said he delivered the 3,500 letters 
Tuesday because he felt the GOP has been influenced too strongly by 
its conservative branch. 
</P>
<P>
	``As Republicans, we are fed up with our party's controlling  
right wing,'' said Rockefeller as he delivered the letters to a 
security guard at the Capitol Hill headquarters of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller was upset that no party officials were available to  
receive the letters, despite their knowing about the delivery, 
saying, ``I guess the Big Tent is not big enough for Republicans 
who oppose impeachment and favor censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Rockefeller's moderate views were so well-known that  
fellow GOP moderates became nicknamed ``Rockefeller Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, who has never held elected office, is the first  
cousin of Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Capital One Adding 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Capital One Financial Corp., one of the  
country's largest credit card issuers, will hire more than 3,000 
people in Virginia this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to enjoy a very rapid growth trajectory,'' said  
Richard D. Fairbank, Capital One's chairman and chief executive 
officer, on Tuesday. ``We're currently adding 20,000 new customers 
a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the new jobs will be for marketers and customer call  
center representatives, said Diana Don, a company spokeswoman. The 
company already has nearly 8,000 employees in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Capital One was spun off from Signet Banking Corp.,  
which since then has been taken over by First Union Corp. of 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital One has become the country's eighth-largest issuer of  
Visa and MasterCard credit cards. It also handles installment and 
automobile loans and has begun selling wireless telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Dec. 31, 1998, it had 16.7 million customers and $17.4  
billion in managed loans.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton moved ahead with plans to  
nominate Richard Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations 
after Holbrooke agreed Tuesday to pay $5,000 to settle civil 
charges that he violated federal ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will soon send to the Senate my nomination of Richard C.  
Holbrooke,'' Clinton said in a statement issued from the White 
House shortly after the federal lawsuit and settlement were filed 
simultaneously in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran 57-year-old diplomat denied in the settlement the  
Justice Department's allegations that he improperly contacted a 
U.S. diplomat on behalf of his employer. Instead, Holbrooke said he 
was acting as a special government employee asked to explain U.S. 
policy to Asian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Holbrooke did not willfully violate  
the law barring former government officials from contacting 
ex-colleagues about business for one year after leaving government. 
The department also said the contact produced no direct financial 
gain for Holbrooke or his employer, the investment banking firm of 
Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``From building lasting peace in Bosnia to searching for a  
political settlement in Kosovo, to finding a workable solution in 
Cyprus, Richard C. Holbrooke's intellect, vigor and diplomatic 
skills have significantly advanced the values and the interests of 
the American people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been eight months since Clinton first picked Holbrooke,  
the chief architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord and last fall's 
ceasefire in Kosovo, for the U.N. post formerly held by Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said in a statement Tuesday that he settled the ethics  
suit ``in order to allow my nomination to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I now look forward to appearing before the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee for the confirmation hearings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms,  
R-N.C., who has taken no position on the nomination, appeared in no 
hurry to schedule hearings. Before hearings, ``we're going to very 
closely examine the Justice Department report, ... to walk through 
their investigation step by step,'' said Helms spokesman Marc 
Thiessen. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate GOP sources, requesting anonymity, said Helms was likely  
to insist, as a condition of moving on the nomination, that the 
administration push for U.N. budget cuts and a reduction in the 
U.S. assessment for the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke resigned in February 1996 as assistant secretary of  
state for European and Canadian Affairs. In the next three months, 
the government said, he wrote James Laney, U.S. ambassador to South 
Korea, on CS First Boston stationery seeking official action by 
Laney: 
</P>
<P>
	--To arrange a meeting with Korean President Kim Young Sam.  
</P>
<P>
	--To arrange a lunch at Laney's residence attended by Holbrooke,  
two other CS First Boston employees and Korean government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that Holbrooke also sought to have Laney  
attend an opening ceremony for CS First Boston's branch office in 
Seoul. The government did not allege that this effort was made on 
CS First Boston stationery, as the first two were. Holbrooke denied 
inviting Laney. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Lord, who served as assistant secretary of state for  
East Asia and Pacific affairs from 1993 to 1997, said in an 
interview last month that he asked Holbrooke as a State Department 
consultant and special government employee to visit foreign 
officials and explain U.S. policy on any trips he made to Asia and 
to report back his impressions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord said, ``It would have been ridiculous if (Holbrooke)  
hadn't'' contacted Laney in South Korea while he was a government 
consultant meeting Korean officials to explain U.S. policy at 
Lord's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department acknowledged in the court filing that  
``it may have been in the United States' national interest to have 
Holbrooke discuss certain foreign policy issues with certain 
high-level Korean officials.'' But it said his communications with 
Laney ``were made, at least in part, on behalf of his then 
employer, CS First Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke acknowledged that his company paid for the trip.  
</P>
<P>
	The government said the meeting with President Kim had to be  
canceled because of a schedule conflict. Holbrooke denied the 
meeting had any connection to his firm and said he sought it to 
brief Kim on U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government acknowledged that the lunch, paid for by the U.S.  
government, was first suggested by Laney. Although Holbrooke and 
two other CS First Boston employees attended, ``the government does 
not allege that any specific business interests related to CS First 
Boston were discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department said that Laney's expense  
justification for the lunch attributed its purpose 70 percent to 
promotion of U.S. national interests and 30 percent to promotion of 
U.S. economic activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the government said, there is evidence Holbrooke asked  
Laney to attend the CS First Boston ribbon-cutting on May 9. 
Although Laney was among 20 to 30 guests, Holbrooke said he did not 
invite the ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed to settle ``to avoid the expense, delay and  
uncertainty of potentially protracted litigation.''

	When the nature of the allegations against Holbrooke emerged  
last month, the White House reaffirmed that Clinton remained 
``lock, stock and barrel'' behind the outspoken diplomat, whose 
ambition and forceful personality have won him detractors as well 
as fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is extraordinarily well qualified for this vital  
position,'' Clinton said, calling Holbrooke ``a strong and capable

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Oscar Nominations To Be Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- It started as a one-picture runaway  
with ``Saving Private Ryan'' and became a two-picture race with 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' Then everybody remembered ``The Truman 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was before the contenders were even announced.  
</P>
<P>
	So perhaps the only real drama going into today's announcement  
of the Academy Award nominations centered on the two remaining 
best-picture slots -- whether such small films as ``Gods and 
Monsters'' and ``The Opposite of Sex'' would get nods instead of 
the bigger-budget front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	With a dearth of high-quality studio movies to pick from,  
another question was whether this year would rival 1996, when four 
of the five best-picture nominees were produced outside the big 
Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed more likely that medium-sized studios like DreamWorks  
and Miramax would dominate. One foreign-language film, Italy's 
``Life is Beautiful,'' also had an outside shot at best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Oscar nominations follow a race of greater suspense  
than last year, when the blockbuster ``Titanic'' overpowered the 
field early and then stayed the course with a record-tying 14 
nominations and 11 awards. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Saving Private Ryan'' was released last summer, it was  
instantly hailed as best-picture material, with strong chances for 
Oscars for director Steven Spielberg, star Tom Hanks, any number of 
supporting actors and for the screenplay and cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie stood out from countless war sagas with its brutally  
realistic Normandy Beach sequence, giving what many veterans said 
was the most accurate screen treatment of combat, in all its 
cruelty, randomness and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in the fall, along came the Elizabethan romantic romp  
``Shakespeare in Love,'' starring Joseph Fiennes as the Bard, a 
struggling writer seeking his muse. When he finds her in Gwenyth 
Paltrow, the words -- and the clothes -- fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost lost in the talk over whether the Academy would favor  
love or war was ``The Truman Show,'' an unsettling story of media 
power featuring Jim Carrey as a man who unwittingly stars in his 
own 24-hour television show. A raft of Golden Globe nominations put 
``Truman'' in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced March 21 at a ceremony televised  
live on ABC from the Los Angeles Music Center, with Whoopi Goldberg 
back for a third time as emcee. The Sunday night event is a change 
from the traditional Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars have always attracted their share of controversy and  
this year the fireworks started early when the Academy announced 
that it will present a special Oscar to Elia Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's  
Agreement'' alienated many in the film world by naming names before 
the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating communist 
infiltration in Hollywood during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Several industry notables were quick to criticize Kazan's  
selection, including actor Rod Steiger and screenwriter Abraham 
Polonsky, who was blacklisted as a result of the committee's highly 
charged hearings.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Rookies Move in Fast Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Beginning a Winston Cup career at the  
Daytona 500 is like making an NFL debut at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Three drivers will be doing just that Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart has moved to NASCAR from the Indy Racing League,  
where he is a past champion. He nearly won the Daytona pole and 
will start from the outside of the front row in the 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	The learning curve is steeper for Stanton Barrett and Mike  
Harmon. Both will have to make the season-opening Winston Cup race 
by finishing near the front in one of the 125-mile qualifying races 
on Thursday at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The two qualifiers will determine positions three through 30 for  
Sunday's race, with 14 coming out of each event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon and Stewart already have locked up starting spots on  
the front row with their first-day qualifying laps. Positions 31-36 
will be filled by the remaining fastest drivers from the three days 
of time trials, and the rest of the lineup will be filled based on 
last year's top 40 in the season car-owner points. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Barrett and Harmon were 45th and 48th on the speed list,  
that option doesn't appear open for either. 
</P>
<P>
	Harmon drives for Junie Donlavey, whose team finished 29th in  
the season points last year. That gives the 41-year-old driver an 
outside chance to make it as a provisional, but Barrett's new team 
has no history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming in here walking lightly, wanting to gain the  
respect of the drivers so they'll run with us and be comfortable 
with us,'' said Harmon, who has raced mostly on short tracks in his 
native Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just taking a conservative approach. You don't take any  
chances that you shouldn't at this point. We've all been veterans 
in other series and, when the rookies came in, I would help them as 
much as I could and maybe I'd give them a little more room than 
normal to run with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett, a 26-year-old Hollywood stuntman whose father once held  
a world land speed record and was an occasional Winston Cup driver, 
is in much the same boat. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran 16 NASCAR Busch Series races last year in an  
apprenticeship for a Daytona debut. He ran into some trouble in 
practice Tuesday, spinning on pit lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're trying to learn as much as you can in a limited amount  
of time and you put an extreme amount of pressure on yourself,'' 
Barrett said. ``That just makes it worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Daytona is only the beginning for Stewart, Harmon and  
Barrett, who are scheduled to compete for 1999 rookie of the year 
honors against Elliott Sadler, Buckshot Jones and Dan Pardus. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers retain rookie eligibility by racing in no more than five  
races in any year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 28, has the most experience among the rookies with one  
start in 1997 and five last year. Sadler, 23, ran in two Winston 
Cup races in 1998, while Pardus, 35, has one start in NASCAR's top 
stock car series. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are in the much the same situation as the other  
rookies. Pardus was 30th, Sadler 35th and Jones 40th in time 
trials. Neither Pardus nor Jones has any team points to fall back 
on. Sadler, who drives for the Wood Brothers after taking over the 
seat formerly occupied by Michael Waltrip, has 17th-place points 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we're going to have to race for it,'' Jones said.  
``It's a big challenge for us, particularly since this race is the 
first one of the year. But every race is a challenge for a 
rookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he learned from his six previous Winston Cup starts,  
Jones said: ``If someone is faster than you, let them go. If 
someone gets outside out you, don't take them up the track. There's 
not anything especially new to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to give a lot. But you're running with the  
elite guys now and you learn from what they do. We're going to have 
to learn it in a hurry.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Unveil Championship Banner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael, Scottie and Dennis were all there  
Tuesday night. Not in person, of course, but on videotape as the 
Chicago Bulls briefly celebrated the past by unveiling a sixth NBA 
championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, now in retirement, Pippen, now in Houston, and Rodman,  
still in limbo, were featured prominently in a video tribute on the 
huge scoreboard hanging over the floor of the United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Carole King's ``Now and Forever'' and Green Day's  
``Time Of My Life,'' the video closed with Jordan sinking his 
game-winning jumper against Utah last June just before he and 
Pippen embraced for what would be the final time as Bulls 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's jumper brought a loud response from a sellout crowd at  
the United Center, followed moments later by awkward applause as 
the banner was uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls in the video hardly resembled the ones that took the  
floor minutes later, a collection of free agents, rookies and 
assorted veterans. With the team gutted following Jordan's 
retirement, it will be a long time before another championship team 
calls Chicago home. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no ring ceremony, as is usually the custom at the home  
opener the following season, and no chance for the fans to boo 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan got his ring at his retirement news conference and  
holdovers from last year's team, like Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper, 
got theirs before a practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls say they will also deliver, either in Chicago or at  
their new locale, championship rings to Pippen and players like 
Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler and Luc Longley, who played on the last 
three title teams before joining other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New coach Tim Floyd, who replaced the popular Phil Jackson,  
watched the ceremony from a seat at the end of the bench. When he 
was introduced before the game, firecrackers were going off and 
there was little reaction from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked before the game what type of reception he expected, Floyd  
said: ``I'm not worried about it. I haven't thought about it. I'm 
worried about coaching this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd had been booed at a pre-season scrimmage at the United  
Center. But that was before the Bulls lost two close exhibition 
games and were 1-1 on their first road trip of this 
lockout-shortened season, playing a surprisingly strong game at 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure who we are and we really shouldn't be,'' said  
Floyd, whose family flew in from Iowa for the game. ``We've only 
had four looks (games.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of reminders of Jordan and Pippen.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's uniform No. 23, unveiled at his retirement news  
conference, hung behind the sixth championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Life-size cutouts of last year's championship team were still in  
the concourse of the United Center, as were replica lockers for 
both Pippen and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens, victimized by Jordan so many times  
when he coached in Cleveland, added himself to the list of those 
who will miss the superstar. But he warned that his team wouldn't 
overlook these watered-down Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not worried about who's here and who's not. They're  
professional players,'' he said.

	Deliberations Next in Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will convene in about an hour and  
the first order of business will be whether to open deliberations 
in President Clinton's trial to public view. Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss., says he is opposed to opening up the debate, 
and the motion is expected to fail. Both sides gave closing 
arguments yesterday as Clinton faces charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice in connection with his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. However, it is virtually certain Clinton will be 
acquitted, and a bipartisan group of senators is drafting a censure 
resolution that calls Clinton's conduct ``shameless, reckless, and 
indefensible.''

	'Shakespeare,' 'Ryan' Dominate Oscars  
</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The romantic comedy ``Shakespeare  
in Love'' collected a near-record 13 Oscar nominations today to top 
the early favorite, Steven Spielberg's war epic ``Saving Private 
Ryan.'' The Italian film ``Life Is Beautiful'' became the first in 
three decades to be nominated for best picture and best foreign 
language movie. ``Saving Private Ryan'' had 11 nominations, 
including best picture, director Steven Spielberg and leading actor 
Tom Hanks. Among the nominations for ``Shakespeare in Love'' were 
best picture, director and actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. Other best 
picture nominees were ``Elizabeth'' and ``The Thin Red Line.''

	Kosovo Talks Remain Deadlocked

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serbs and ethnic Albanians are  
deadlocked over a pledge to keep Yugoslavia's borders intact with 
peace talks aimed at ending the crisis in Kosovo in their fourth 
day. U.S. envoy Christopher Hill admitted that the Serb and Kosovo 
Albanian sides were trying to sidetrack the proceedings with fresh 
demands, but said negotiations ``are moving ahead.'' But an ethnic 
Albanian rebel commander reportedly said the Kosovo Liberation Army 
``cannot accept'' the international proposal to end the conflict. 
Hill said the plan drafted by the United States and five European 
countries does not envisage independence for Kosovo, a demand of 
the ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the province.

	End to Forced Family Planning Urged

<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton urged

allow women to make their own reproductive decisions. Mrs. Clinton 
said she is referring to governments which ban abortion outright, 
severely limit family planning services or -- like China -- impose 
strict limits on family size. All women, she said, should have 
access to family planning programs including safe abortion.

	Oprah Winfrey May End Her TV Show

	LONDON (AP) -- Talk-show host Oprah Winfrey says she's fed up  
with the sleaze on daytime television and is ready to bail out of 
her long-running show. Winfrey has two years left on her contract, 
and she told the Sunday Times of London that she will then get out 
because ``such shows ... are going to burn out.'' Winfrey's show 
has gathered 32 Daytime Emmys and has been a ratings success, but 
has recently fallen behind the outrageous ``Jerry Springer Show.''

	Productivity Surges in 4th Quarter  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in productivity during the final three  
months of 1998 helped produce a healthy 2.2 percent increase in 
Americans' output per hour of work last year. The advance marked a 
significant improvement over the 1.2 percent gain in 1997 and came 
close to the 2.4 percent rise in 1996. Economists consider healthy 
productivity gains the key to prosperity and rising living 
standards. Sizable gains mean companies can pay employees more.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Lawyers Discuss Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If a no-contest plea got Mike Tyson a year in  
jail, what would a guilty verdict bring? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the crux of the discussion inside the offices of Tyson's  
lawyers as they consider whether to risk an appeal of the former 
heavyweight champion's sentence for assaulting two motorists after 
a fender bender in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no-contest -- meaning he neither contested the  
charges nor admitted guilt -- in December. His one-year sentence, 
levied Friday by District Court Judge Stephen Johnson, could mean 
the end of the career of the 32-year-old boxer, once on course to 
become one of the greatest heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	One corrections department official, however, raised the  
possibility that Tyson might be allowed to train, and perhaps fight 
out of town, while serving his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since boxing is his employment and his job, we'd have to  
verify where he is and that he remained drug- and alcohol-free,'' 
Russ Hamill, acting director of the Montgomery County (Md.) 
Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, told The Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	He would be eligible for the work-release program within 60  
days, the Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers must decide within 30 days of the sentencing whether  
Tyson's career would be further jeopardized by an appeal to Circuit 
Court, where a judge could then decide not to accept the no-contest 
plea and order a trial by jury. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Tyson would not only have another conviction on  
his record, but would again be subject to Maryland sentencing 
guidelines that call for a jail term of three to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a conviction would worsen Tyson's standing in  
Indiana and Nevada. Indiana authorities must decide whether Tyson 
violated his probation for a 1992 rape conviction, and Nevada 
boxing authorities could revoke Tyson's boxing license for the 
second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's  
rape trial, is awaiting paperwork from Maryland before ruling on 
whether he violated probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post also reported that Tyson's Indiana probation officer,  
George Walker, suggested that the Maryland jail sentence would not 
automatically lead to a probation violation hearing in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the way, we might get everyone together and  
say, `Hey, do we really want a big circus in town to do something 
with him, or can we do something without a hearing and save a lot 
of taxpayer money?''' the newspaper quoted Walker as saying. 
``There are different ways of working on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of an appeal was discussed at length by Tyson's lawyers  
on Monday, a source inside the office of lawyer Paul Kemp told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Neither Kemp nor 
Tyson's other attorney, Robert Greenberg, returned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Douglas Gansler, who led the call for jail time for  
Tyson, said the boxer could be fighting again in 1999 under his 
current sentence if he behaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong argument to be made that he's better off not  
appealing,'' Gansler said. ``If he were treated like any ordinary 
prisoner, like he has been, he would be in the (Montgomery County) 
jail about two to three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Tyson could be transferred to a prerelease center, a  
sort of halfway house where he could leave during the day to go to 
work and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be in the system about nine months,'' Gansler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gansler said Tyson is being held in a private cell ``for his own  
protection.'' If an appeal is filed, Tyson could ask for a bond 
hearing and be released pending a trial.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Dawgs Unleashed at Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- After three years in the kennel, the Dawg  
Pound was finally unleashed Tuesday -- and they were ready to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Four thousand of Cleveland's most loyal fans packed into the  
Canton Civic Center to watch the Browns pick castoff players from 
the NFL's other teams in the expansion draft, including that 
section of bone-waving, mask-wearing fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure is something isn't it?'' said Tim Jenks of Northeast,  
Pa., as he looked down from the Dawg Pound at the made-for-TV set 
where the Browns made their picks. ``All this for an expansion 
draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenks and fellow season ticket-holder Dan Malm of Toronto had  
been in town since Monday, looking for tickets to the draft. They 
finally snagged a pair while tailgating hours before the draft 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't get any better than this for Browns fans,'' said  
Jenks, a felt Browns helmet perched on his head. ``Your heart is 
just constantly beating fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day felt like a Woodstock for Cleveland lovers.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Hooper, beaming through orange and brown face paint at the  
chance to sit next to John ``Big Dawg'' Thompson, kicked off his 
festivities about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was about the third guy here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once they were in the arena, the fans were primed to bark.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Browns like Bernie Kosar were mobbed by autograph seekers  
as they walked through the crowd, and the Pound gave a standing 
ovation to Cleveland owner Al Lerner and team president Carmen 
Policy as they stepped into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Chants of ``Here we go Brownies -- here we go! Woof! Woof!''  
ripped through the Dawg Pound. Every time former Browns owner Art 
Modell, who moved the old team after the 1995 season, was shown on 
a highlight film that played before the draft started, the Pound 
booed long and loud. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd only cooled after giving another round of standing  
ovations to the team's first five picks, who were all on hand to 
see themselves get drafted: Jim Pyne, Hurvin McCormack, Scott 
Rehberg, Damon Gibson and Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they settled down to watch their own draft charts,  
the media savvy Dawgs still barked on queue for the ESPN2 cameras 
showing the event live. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the die-hards, right here,'' Malm said.

<HEADLINE> Kernen Leading Ski Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Moments after he taking a slim lead  
in the downhill portion of the men's combined event, Switzerland's 
Bruno Kernen tried to savor the accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough season for me, but I always knew I could ski  
fast,'' he said Monday. ``This is the first race this season that I 
could enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even Kernen knew his enjoyment could be short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
	Lurking just off the lead were multitalented Norwegians Kjetil  
Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus, who have made the combined event their 
personal playground all season. They seemed certain to overtake 
Kernan today in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Two slalom runs, scheduled for today, finished the event, with  
the combined times for all three runs determining the combined 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two Norwegians are legitimate threats in slalom,  
Kernen, although he has had some success in combined events 
throughout his career, hasn't scored a point in slalom on the World 
Cup circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea how I can ski in slalom, sometimes good,  
sometimes bad,'' Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt said he was happy with his position. ``I'm 8-hundredths  
behind Kernen and 6-hundredths ahead of Kjus, and they'll be my 
main competitors,'' he said. ``I think the slalom is going to be 
interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus was likewise satisfied. ``It's good not to be too far  
behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernen, gold medalist in downhill and silver medalist in  
combined at the last world championships in 1997 in Sestriere, 
Italy, had a smooth run that was timed in 1 minute, 13.44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was lurking a mere .08 seconds back, however, and Kjus  
was only .14 seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians know the territory. Kjus was first and Aamodt  
second in a combined in Wengen, Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week 
later, Aamodt was first and Kjus second in a combined in Kitzbuhel, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who tied Austrian ace Hermann Maier for the gold medal in  
the super-G on Tuesday and finished second to Maier in the downhill 
on Saturday, was the early leader in Monday's race. Racing sixth, 
Kjus bettered the time of Austrian Werner Franz, finishing in 
1:13.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Two racers later, Aamodt, the defending world champion in  
combined, came across .06 seconds quicker than Kjus at 1:13.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernen, 26, was next, and avoided the problems in a couple of  
corners that hurt him in the downhill, when he paced seventh on 
this same Birds of Prey course. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz was fourth in 1:13.91, followed by Kristian Ghedina of  
Italy in 1:14.15 and Paul Accola of Switzerland in 1:14.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was ninth in 1:14.87. Jakub Fiala of  
Breckenridge, Colo., was the top American, placing 14th in 1:15.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion, was  
far back in 18th place at 1:16.14, but relieved to have finished 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this downhill was too tough,'' said Reiter, 28. ``I  
will not ski a downhill that is so fast again. I'm too old for that 
to risk my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``My chances are, of course, very, very small. But there's at  
least another 100 slalom gates to go, and you never know what 
happens in slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., had a wild run. Miller was out  
of control early in his run, then crashed near the finish, losing 
his left ski. He bounced on the snow several times, but rose to his 
feet and crossed the finish line on one ski to post a time of 
1:21.48. He was later disqualified for missing a gate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lending Crunch Threat Recedes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of a U.S. lending crunch, which  
reared up after the Russian ruble collapsed in August, has receded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestic banks were no longer tightening business lending  
standards,'' the Federal Reserve said Monday in its quarterly 
survey of senior bank lending officers, conducted last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 7 percent of 55 domestic banks -- including 28 of the  
largest banks in the country -- reported exercising greater caution 
on whether or not to lend to large and middle-market companies and 
only 4 percent on loans to small firms. 
</P>
<P>
	That's down dramatically from November when a survey had found  
37 percent and 15 percent of banks reporting stricter loan 
standards for larger and small firms, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, demand for business loans has increased, the bankers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But foreign banks operating in the United States remain  
cautious. Fifty-six percent reported tightening standards for 
business loans during the past three months, down only slightly 
from November. 
</P>
<P>
	And, concern over the economic outlook continues to prompt a  
significant, though declining, number of domestic banks to charge 
more for loans, both through fees and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, 31 percent in January reported increasing their  
profit margin on loans, down from 47 percent in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found little evidence of substantial change in  
lending to consumers. Several banks said they were more willing to 
make consumer installment loans but a modest number said they had 
tightened standards for credit cards.

<HEADLINE> Tim McCarver May Call Yankees Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim McCarver is close to signing a deal that  
will allow him to call about 40 games for the New York Yankees this 
season, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, fired by the New York Mets last week after 16 years as  
the team's analyst, is also Fox Sports' lead national baseball 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver said he was unaware of an imminent deal discussed in  
Tuesday's editions of The Record of Hackensack (N.J.), the New York 
Post and New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Bob Rosen, said Tuesday he had not been contacted by  
the Yankees or WNYW, the Fox affiliate that will televise Yankees 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a done deal,'' Rosen said. ``We haven't even begun  
negotiations yet, but Tim is interested and I'm just waiting for 
the call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver's schedule with Fox Sports would force him to miss at  
least eight Yankees games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any problem with Fox accommodating Tim's  
schedule,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who has 10 Emmy Award nominations, was fired by the  
Mets last week and replaced by Tom Seaver, the only New York Mets 
player to have his number retired by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons for the change was believed to be because  
McCarver was often critical of the Mets.

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals traded former  
first-round draft choice Sean Lowe to the Chicago White Sox Tuesday 
in a swap of minor league right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals acquired John Ambrose, 24, who is 24-37 with a  
4.98 ERA in four minor league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, the 15th overall selection in 1992, is 0-5 in his major  
league career. He was 12-8 with a 3.18 ERA last year at Triple-A 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose was 9-12 with a 5.18 ERA in 1998 at Double-A Birmingham.  
But he posted a 2.95 ERA in nine relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose was drafted by the White Sox in the second round of the  
1994 amateur draft.

<HEADLINE> Organizers React to Olympic Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt says he didn't know.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither, by their account, did a host of Salt Lake Olympic bid  
committee members, who expressed dismay Tuesday about just how far 
the city went to buy favor for its winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role was to serve on the bid committee basically as a  
diplomatic officer of the state,'' said Leavitt, noting he had 
never attended any committee meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor was among many who, in responding to a  
report of an ethics panel's investigation, placed the blame for the 
worst scandal in Olympic history squarely on the International 
Olympic Committee and Salt Lake's top two bid officials, Tom Welch 
and Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has an obligation to root out all of those who may  
have been involved in unethical behavior,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ethics panel's report showed the bid committee's  
board should have established more controls on its top officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, it also documents a clear pattern of  
deception by a few principals with day-to-day management 
responsibilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Olympic critics refused to buy Leavitt's and the report's  
conclusion that only Welch and Johnson were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we can let anyone off the hook, neglecting  
their fiduciary responsibilities, and that's what people did, 
including the governor,'' said Utah House Majority Whip David Ure, 
like Leavitt a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Ure said it was the board's responsibility to oversee all  
aspects of the 1995 bid that won the city the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so intrigued with getting the games we didn't want to  
ask the hard questions. It was just, `Mr. Welch: Get us the 
games,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee members themselves were more  
circumspect, apparently willing to go along with the report's 
conclusion that while the bid committee board could have done more, 
Welch and Johnson took pains to cover their payments of cash, gifts 
and other blandishments to IOC members and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much did I know and when?'' asked Anita DeFrantz, an IOC  
vice president and SLOC board member. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everything today,'' she said, waving a copy of the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The oversight failed, in my view, because of collusion,  
concealment, deception and the outside auditors' lack of finding 
the management's evasion of established procedures,'' said Spence 
Eccles, chief executive of First Security Bank, a member of both 
the bid committee and the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Schaffer, Welch's attorney, said the report validated what  
Welch has been saying: The intent of the bid committee was to lobby 
the IOC, not buy votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, Schaffer noted, the ethics panel found only  
unethical conduct, but nothing criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dilemma for the bid committee was balancing the  
expectations of the community with the reality of the IOC,'' 
Schaffer said. ``It's an ugly system and distasteful system and it 
needs to be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff said that the questionable courting  
of IOC members aside, Salt Lake won the games ``fair and square.''

<HEADLINE> Witness Recalls Cable Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Carlo Demattio was walking his dogs  
through a valley in the Italian Alps when he heard the roar of a 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and I saw an airplane coming down very, very  
fast,'' Demattio, of Cavalese, Italy, recalled in a courtroom 
Monday. ``There was this loud noise and I looked up and screamed, 
`What, are they crazy to be flying so low over a residential area?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, `The cable, the cable.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later the cable, strung across the valley and the  
lifeline of a gondola carrying 20 skiers, was severed by a wing on 
the EA-6B Prowler jet. The gondola plummeted to the ground, killing 
everyone inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the destruction, I knew there was nothing to do,''  
said Demattio, a former police officer who testified through an 
interpreter. ``In fact, nobody answered me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony came at the court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby,  
31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. Ashby, a Marine pilot, is charged with 
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the incident on Feb. 3, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-man military jury was to be flown today to the Marine  
Corps Air Station at Cherry Point to sit in the pilot's seat of a 
Prowler, then to a flight range to watch a Prowler and another jet 
fly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Ashby was negligently flying too low and  
performed an unauthorized barrel roll with the jet just before it 
severed the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say a map issued to Ashby didn't show the  
Mount Cermis ski lift, the jet's radar altimeter wasn't reliable 
and the crew didn't have enough training. They also say Ashby 
doesn't deny hitting the cable and that he regrets the deaths every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``His actions aren't criminal,'' defense lawyer Capt. Jon  
Shelburne told the jury. ``They were just doing their jobs. It was 
just an accident. It was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, whose squadron was based at Cherry Point, was on his  
second tour of duty at Aviano air base in Italy at the time of the 
accident. He faces a maximum of more than 200 years in prison if 
convicted of the manslaughter counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is scheduled to be tried next month for the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Teen Dies During Basketball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMOT, Wis. (AP) -- An 18-year-old Wilmot Union High School  
senior died after collapsing during a basketball game Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Vance Dalzin confirmed the player died despite efforts  
to revive him by a doctor who serves as assistant coach for the 
opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Rasmussen, director of strategic communications at  
Burlington Memorial Hospital, said Mark Barranco of Silver Lake had 
no pulse when he arrived, and he was pronounced dead of apparent 
heart failure at 8:47 p.m. with his family at his side. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen's father was attending the game between Wilmot and  
Kenosha St. Joseph's when his son collapsed. His sister, a member 
of the school's cheer and dance team, also was present. His mother 
arrived at the scene later. 
</P>
<P>
	Barranco, a 6-foot-1 forward, came off the bench with 4 minutes,  
4 seconds left in the first quarter and his team trailing St. 
Joseph 13-9. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after entering the game, Barranco grabbed a defensive  
rebound and ran upcourt and then collapsed to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of about 300 grew silent and Dr. Ray Knight, a St.  
Joseph assistant coach, immediately ran to Barranco's aid and began 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you why it happened,'' Knight said. ``I think the  
young man was sick before he hit the floor. I've seen this kind of 
thing happen a couple of times before and it's pretty scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Maastricht, a registered nurse, assisted Knight with the  
CPR. Maastricht's son Brian was replaced by Barranco in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The care that he got ... as far as what Dr. Knight did and  
Mrs. Maastricht did, the response was super,'' Wilmot coach Jerry 
Christiansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	All fans and players were cleared from the gym shortly after  
Knight began CPR. Stunned fans milled around outside, many crying 
and holding each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics then arrived and tried to revive Barranco for about  
20 minutes to no avail before he was taken by ambulance to the 
hospital, where dozens of relatives, friends and parents gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never complained about anything as far as conditioning,''  
Christiansen said. ``He always ran hard. It's unbelievable. He was 
such a good kid. God meant to take him, so he took him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barranco also participated in baseball and football.  
</P>
<P>
	Dalzin said counselors and clergy would be available at the  
school Wednesday to help students cope. 
</P>
<P>
	In another recent case in southeastern Wisconsin, Whitefish Bay  
junior Adam Lemel collapsed on the basketball court and died Jan. 
22 in a junior varsity game at Grafton.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Big 12 Conference commissioner Kevin Weiberg  
reprimanded Baylor coach Sonja Hogg on Tuesay for comments she made 
about officiating in Saturday's game against Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State beat Baylor 58-56.  
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Hogg said, ``You don't call an intentional foul  
in a one-point ballgame when someone's going after the ball and 
somebody falls down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They can reprimand me all they want, but this is the most  
inconsistent year we've ever had and that I've seen in 25 years and 
there's just no call for it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiberg said Hogg's statements violated the Big 12's Code of  
Conduct regarding public comment relative to officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	A second violation could result in a one-game suspension and a  
fine of $5,000 payable by the school, Weiberg said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Future Clouded by Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are three big ifs blocking Mike Tyson's  
path before he can resume his boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge who sentenced Tyson to jail permits him to travel  
out of state, if Indiana authorities don't revoke his probation and 
if Nevada authorities don't strip him of his boxing license, Tyson 
could very well be headlining a card in Las Vegas this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts with Tyson's behavior in the Montgomery County,  
Md., jail. If he doesn't cause trouble, he could begin training at 
an outside gym after the first two months or so of his one-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, if Tyson's promoters can schedule a fight, he and his  
lawyers would appear once again before District Court Judge Stephen 
Johnson and request to travel outside Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to have a fight, they would petition the judge,''  
Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler said. ``It's not 
atypical. People do it all the time for weddings, funerals or 
sometimes for work-related business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no-contest to charges stemming from the  
August fender-bender, has been in the jail since Friday. Shelly 
Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said those who have visited the boxer 
describe him as ``depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect a sentence of this severity at all,'' Finkel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, a prisoner with Tyson's sentence would serve about 60  
days in the jail before being transferred to the county's 
prerelease center, where inmates can leave during the day for work 
and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any person who has a profession, we would make sure they could  
continue their work,'' Department of Corrections spokeswoman Claire 
Gunster-Kirby said. ``We would work with Mr. Tyson or anyone to 
make they could continue in their profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Tyson could train at a gym and later earn other  
privileges, such as home visits during the day to spend time with 
his wife, Gunster-Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing hearing, witnesses said Tyson had $20  
million in debts, mostly to the IRS, and would need to fight three 
or four times this year to pay them off. 
</P>
<P>
	At 32, Tyson would be nearing the twilight of his boxing career  
even if it had not been interrupted by two jail sentences and a 
suspension for biting Evander Holyfield's ear during their 1997 
title bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been scheduled to fight a yet-to-be-named opponent  
April 24 in Las Vegas, although it's unlikely he could make that 
date if he remains in jail the full 60 days before transferring to 
the prerelease center. 
</P>
<P>
	Any plans for Tyson to fight could be thwarted by the Nevada  
Athletic Commission, which has the power to revoke the fighter's 
boxing license in light of the jail sentence. Tyson only recently 
was reinstated after a one-year suspension for the Holyfield 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation could also change if Tyson appeals his sentence.  
He could then face a jury trial and be acquitted -- or get a 
potentially harsher sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers, who have 30 days to appeal, did not return  
calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel said the lawyers want to see what action, if any, will be  
taken in Indiana, where Tyson remains on probation until March for 
a 1992 rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> NBC Will Happily Live in the '60's / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's return to the 1960's for a miniseries and  
to the 1980s for a mini ``Cheers'' reunion helped the network to a 
comfortable ratings victory during the first week of the important 
February ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Part one of NBC's music-packed miniseries, ``The '60's,'' was a  
hit on Sunday despite a tepid critical reaction. Its audience of 15 
million viewers was bigger than any other program outside of NBC's 
Thursday night schedule, Nielsen Media Research said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' the week's second most-watched show, drew higher  
ratings than normal Thursday night with actor Woody Harrelson 
reprising his ``Cheers'' role. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most popular show, as is customary, in its  
countdown to George Clooney's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	In what's becoming a tradition in one of the four ``sweeps''  
months when ratings are watched closely to set local advertising 
rates, Fox drew solid numbers with dramatic nonfiction programming. 
Last Thursday's duo of specials included ``World's Most Shocking 
Moments'' and a daredevil jump by Robbie Knievel. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 10.3 rating and 17 share. CBS was a  
solid second with a 9.3 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.9 rating 
and 13 share and Fox was at 7.2 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the developing networks, the WB had a 3.3 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program, the third week in a row it has won or shared the lead. ABC 
had an 8.7 rating and 17 share, NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 8.4 
and 16 and the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.7 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: 
</P>
<P>
	``ER,'' NBC, 20.3; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.0; ``Friends,'' NBC,  
16.9; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: The '60's, Part One,'' NBC, 15.1; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 14.7; 
``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.5; ``Dateline 
NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 13.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Night Ride Home,'' 
CBS, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Burst of Productivity Should Extend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A burst of productivity at the end of 1998  
suggests the economy can continue to have its cake and eat it, too 
-- grow robustly with low inflation -- for a while longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Output per hour of work by nonfarm, nonsupervisory employees  
increased a healthy 2.2 percent last year, the Labor Department 
said Tuesday. During the final three months of the year, 
productivity surged at a 3.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual 
rate, the biggest advance since the first three months of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's symbolic of the extraordinary strength of this economic  
expansion,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``This really is the bottom line: 
Strong productivity growth means living standards are rising 
quickly. ... And the momentum the economy is exhibiting will carry 
over into 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.2 percent gain in 1998 marked a significant improvement  
over the 1.2 percent increase in 1997 and was nearly as good as the 
2.4 percent rise in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity, after growing at nearly a 3 percent rate in the  
1960s and early 1970s, slowed to an anemic 1 percent rate from 1974 
through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at nearly a 2 percent 
rate, leading some economists to speculate that the economy has 
embarked on a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers 
and other high-tech innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe productivity recently has been even better than  
measured because it's difficult to gauge the output of many 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to  
prosperity because sizable increases mean companies can pay 
employees more, hold the line on prices and still deliver profits 
to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The robust productivity data suggest that the economy can grow  
at a faster pace with less inflation,'' said economist Veronika 
White of First Union Bank Corp. in Philadelphia. ``Indeed, the 
economy has been doing this for a number of years now, and 1999 
will probably surprise on the upside, once again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, employees have been reaping more of the benefits of  
increased productivity, in contrast to earlier in the decade, when 
the benefits flowed into corporate profits and stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and  
benefits jumped 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of underlying  
inflation pressures, slowed last year. They rose 2 percent, 
compared with 2.3 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, unit labor costs fell at a 0.2 percent  
annual rate, the first decline since the first quarter of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At factories, many of them hard hit by loss of export sales to  
Asia and other economically struggling parts of the world, 
productivity still increased a strong 4.3 percent in 1998, down 
from a five-year high of 4.9 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In the manufacturing of durable goods -- items from cars to  
computers expected to last three or more years -- productivity 
surged 6.8 percent, the biggest advance since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of manufacturers to maintain, and in many cases  
improve, productivity reflects their determination to operate 
efficiently in the face of lost sales abroad. That, in turn, has 
caused the loss of more than 200,000 jobs in the sector since 
March.

<HEADLINE>  Quartey Is Test for De La Hoya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unbeaten WBC welterweight champion Oscar De  
La Hoya says his title defense against Ike Quartey will be the 
first true test of his boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey, also unbeaten, has ``zero doubt,'' he'll win Saturday  
night's 12-round bout at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas by 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters appeared Tuesday at a packed Dodger Stadium news  
conference attended by, among others, former welterweight champions 
Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, who are helping Top Rank, 
Inc., promote the card. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and Quartey were supposed to provide a special photo  
opportunity at home plate, but rain restricted them to the Stadium 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, of East Los Angeles, will be making the sixth  
defense of his welterweight title, while Quartey, of Ghana, will be 
fighting for the first time since in nearly 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of my previous fights have been preparations,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``I feel Ike Quartey will bring the best out of me. I respect 
the guy a lot. You have two warriors in that ring who really want 
to win. I'm prepared for a good, long war if that's what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ike Quartey is my very first test; 1999 will be a very big  
year for boxing and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bout was originally scheduled for last Nov. 21, but  
postponed because the 26-year-old De La Hoya, 29-0 with 24 
knockouts, suffered a lacerated left eyelid during sparring some 
three weeks beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say this is his toughest fight and that might  
very well be the case,'' said Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter. 
``He's prepared, he's ready. He's a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Quartey, who is 34-0-1 with 29 knockouts and holder of the  
WBA welterweight crown since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to beat Oscar, I'm going to win, zero doubt, maybe  
the later rounds, a knockout, for sure,'' said the 29-year-old 
Quartey. ``I think I'm the best, I'm very confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is being co-sponsored by the Las Vegas Hilton and  
Mandalay Bay, a new Las Vegas resort scheduled to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, it's likely his next fight will be  
against the winner of the Oba Carr-Frankie Randall 10-round bout, 
also on Saturday night's card, at Mandalay Bay's Events Center.

<HEADLINE> IBM, Record Companies Battle Bootleggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The record industry has launched the latest  
salvo in its war with Internet music pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Five leading record companies are teaming with IBM to test a new  
technology that lets people quickly record CD-quality albums off 
the Internet, while trying to protect the copyrights of musicians 
and their labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The test announced Monday is the first major step in an industry  
effort to develop security standards for digital music sales, while 
battling increasingly popular technology that lets people easily 
download free and often illegally copied songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales now represent just a tiny fraction of the  
$12 billion music industry. The major record companies hope they 
can outdo the online bootleggers by offering better-quality sound 
and greater choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial offers an extraordinary window on the future of the  
music business,'' said Roger Faxon, senior vice president of 
business development at EMI, whose music catalog includes the 
Beatles, Janet Jackson and Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the spring, IBM's new technology will be tested  
over six months by about 1,000 people in San Diego. BMG 
Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group will create an online 
music store with more than 2,000 albums. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have not yet determined how much to charge. But it  
shouldn't cost any more than buying a CD from a local record store, 
said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at technology research firm 
Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to gauge consumer interest by charging a  
premium for this stuff,'' Mooradian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM system would allow people to order songs or entire  
albums over the Internet, then store and play them on their 
computer. Customers will also be able to download an album's cover 
art and liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology will include encryption coding to foil pirates  
who would copy the songs and distribute them over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback is that the only way for the consumer to transfer  
the music out of the computer is to buy a CD recording device, 
which generally costs anywhere from $150 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniel Lee, a 27-year-old lawyer from London, said Monday he  
would still be interested because the expense of the CD recorder 
would be offset by the convenience of online shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would assume they would keep a massive database, so you  
would be able to get something you ordinarily wouldn't find in the 
stores,'' Lee said as he browsed through Mick Jagger CDs in a 
Manhattan record store. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference announcing the test, an IBM executive  
downloaded the Dave Matthews Band album ``Crash'' in about three 
minutes, and recorded it onto a CD in about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The test initially will include only computer users with  
high-speed cable TV modems -- a tiny fraction of Internet-surfing 
public. Eventually a service for more common, but slower, telephone 
modems will be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies hope industrywide security standards will be  
ready in time for the next holiday season. They are trying to 
combat a technology called MP3 that is gaining popularity as a way 
to easily store and distribute audio on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While some MP3 songs being distributed on the Internet are legal  
and endorsed by record labels, the amount of bootlegged material 
has grown rapidly. Once downloaded, an MP3 file can be copied 
endlessly and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. was one of several  
technology companies that pledged in December to help the music 
industry develop security standards. Others include AT&AMP;T Corp., 
America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Toshiba Corp.

<HEADLINE> Smoker Wins $1.5M in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A smoker who sued Philip Morris after being  
diagnosed with inoperable cancer won $1.5 million Tuesday in the 
first case to reach trial since California lifted a ban on lawsuits 
by individuals against tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensatory damages cover medical costs, pain and  
suffering. The Superior Court jury was expected to return Wednesday 
to consider punitive damages, attorneys for the plaintiff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Henley's case was the first since the repeal of a 1987  
tort reform law that banned lawsuits by cigarette smokers on the 
basis that the risks of smoking were well known. Dozens of cases 
were pending at the time were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature responded to criticism of the ban by repealing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November but cigarette makers still face class 
action lawsuits and individual lawsuits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, had been smoking since age 15.  
She quit in 1997 after suffering coughing fits and other health 
problems. She was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer in 
her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Philip Morris Cos., claiming there were no warnings on  
cigarettes when she began smoking more than three decades ago and 
that major tobacco companies failed to warn that smokers may be 
unable to give up the habit. Her lawsuit included charges of 
negligence, strict liability and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris claimed it was not liable for Ms. Henley's illness  
since she understood and assumed the risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Henley case was at least the fourth time a jury in a tobacco  
liability case awarded compensatory damages. The first three cases 
were overturned on appeal.

<HEADLINE> Ethics Report on Salt Lake Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Excerpts from the report released Tuesday  
by an independent ethics panel for the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee: 
</P>
<P>
                    *1991-92 -- The Campaign Begins    	
</P>
<P>
	... In November 1991, the wife of Seiuli Paul Wallwork, an IOC  
member from Western Somoa, sent a letter to Mr. Welch stating that 
she needed to speak with Mr. Welch on ``a matter of great 
urgency.'' The substance of Mrs. Wallwork's request is contained in 
a telegram dated November 12, 1991, in which she states that she 
needs Mr. Welch's assistance ``to help a friend in a serious 
situation'' and asks Mr. Welch to remit $30,000 U.S. dollars to her 
account in Auckland, New Zealand. The telegram also states that the 
loan has ``nothing to do with Paul (Mr. Wallwork) or bid city but 
(is to be) regard(ed) as (a) business arrangement between you and 
me.'' In response, the Bid Committee's records show, that Mr. Welch 
authorized a $30,000 wire transfer from his children's personal 
trust account to Mrs. Wallwork's account. While there is 
correspondence in 1992 indicating that the loan had not been repaid 
to Mr. Welch, in an interview with the Board of Ethics, Rod Hamson 
stated that Mr. Welch told him that it was eventually repaid. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... At the same time that Mr. Welch was lending money to Mrs.  
Wallwork, he and other senior Bid Committee officials embarked on a 
program to provide assistance to relatives of other IOC members. 
During the 1991-92 time period at least four relatives or 
associates of IOC members received tuition and/or living assistance 
from Bid Committee funds. This assistance has been widely described 
as a ``scholarship program,'' but in reality the payments bore 
little resemblance to traditional scholarships. ... 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *Scholarship Program    	
</P>
<P>
	In October 1991, management authorized the first tuition  
payments from Bid Committee funds. That month Sibo Sibandze, the 
son of David Sibandze, the IOC member from Swaziland, began 
attending the University of Utah with his tuition and living 
expenses paid by the Bid Committee. ... 
</P>
<P>
	On April 1, 1992, Bid Committee management started paying the  
expenses of Ekaterina Soukhorado at the University of Utah. Like 
Sibo Sibandze, Ms. Soukhorado was introduced to the Bid Committee 
by an IOC member. ... The files indicate that Ms. Soukhorado had 
been a student at the University of Maryland on a foreign student 
exchange in the spring of 1991. The files do not reveal the precise 
nature of Ms. Soukhorado's connection to Dr. Kim; there are, 
however, several pieces of correspondence between Dr. Kim, David 
Johnson and Ms. Soukhorado in October and November 1991, indicating 
that Dr. Kim was helping handle her arrangements with the Bid 
Committee. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the Soukhorado payments began, the Bid Committee 	
also paid for Bold Magvan, the son of the IOC member from Mongolia, 
Shagdarjav Magvan, to attend classes at the University of Utah. 
While these expenses were relatively minimal ($762), again there is 
no evidence that the ``scholarship'' criteria were applied. 
However, Bold Magvan did not come to Salt Lake City primarily to 
attend classes; rather, he had been invited by the First Security 
Bank, where he had a year-long internship. ... 
</P>
<P>
                          *Kim and Keystone 	
</P>
<P>
	Sometime in the spring of 1992, Mr. Welch, using Bid Committee  
funds, arranged for the son of Dr. Kim to work at a local 
communications company, reimbursing all costs associated with his 
employment. According to Mr. Welch, Dr. Kim contacted him, 
explaining that his son Jung Hoon (``John'') Kim was being laid off 
from his employment in New York City and needed to find other 
employment in the United States to retain his green card. Because 
John Kim had some experience in the telecommunications industry, 
Mr. Welch contacted David Simmons, the former CEO of Keystone 
Communications, a satellite telecommunications company based at 
that time in Salt Lake City. With Mr. Welch's assistance, Keystone 
hired John Kim. ... 
</P>
<P>
	According to interviews with Mr. Welch, Keystone ultimately felt  
that it had not received value from the relationship with Mr. Kim 
and demanded reimbursement for his salary from the Bid Committee. 
Mr. Simmons believed that to have been the arrangement from the 
beginning, and that Keystone's costs (salary, taxes, benefits) were 
all to be repaid to Keystone by the Bid Committee as ``consulting 
fees'' for putative consulting on satellite transmission. A 
consulting agreement between the Bid Committee and Keystone dated 
July 1, 1992, indicates that Keystone would be paid $30,000 for 
arranging ``private meetings with IOC members.'' Mr. Simmons has no 
recollection that Keystone was in a position to arrange such 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Simmons recalled that Keystone was reimbursed the full costs  
of John Kim's employment, which amounted to between $75,000 and 
$100,000. Mr. Simmons stated that pursuant to their arrangement, 
Keystone sent invoices to the Bid Committee, most likely on a 
monthly basis, requesting payment simply for ``consulting 
services'' without any information referencing Mr. Kim or his 
father. Mr. Simmons further stated that the Bid Committee paid all 
amounts due, though he recalls that at least one of the invoices 
was paid on behalf of the Bid Committee by a company that Mr. 
Simmons could not identify. Mr. Simmons does not remember that 
entity as being related to Mr. Welch or Mr. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Ethics' review of the Bid Committee's financial  
records revealed two payments to Keystone totaling $45,000. The 
first was on September 30, 1992, in the amount of $15,000; the 
second was on April 26, 1993, for $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a January 30, 1999 letter to the Board of Ethics, Dr. Kim's  
attorneys deny that he ever knew of the arrangement for the Bid 
Committee to pay Keystone for the costs of employing his son. ... 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                    *Scholarship Program Expands    	
</P>
<P>
	In July 1992, three months after Mr. Magvan and Ms. Soukhorado  
appear to have started classes at the University of Utah, Bid 
Committee management expanded its so-called ``Scholarship Program'' 
beyond educational costs to include the payment of living expenses 
for non-students. In June 1992, Nancy Rignault Arroyo, the daughter 
of Agustin Arroyo, IOC member from Ecuador, arrived in Salt Lake 
City. The next month, the Bid Committee started paying Ms. Arroyo's 
living expenses at the Santa Fe Apartments. Payments on Ms. 
Arroyo's behalf continued into 1995, and totaled nearly $23,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the documents do not provide a clear picture of Ms.  
Arroyo's stay in Salt Lake City, it is evident that she was not a 
student. Mr. Welch told the Board of Ethics that sometime in the 
spring of 1992 he was approached by Mr. Arroyo to with a request 
assist his daughter, who at the time was a citizen of the United 
States living in Texas. According to Mr. Welch, she was divorced 
and was having some personal problems. Mr. Welch agreed to bring 
her to Salt Lake City and assist her in finding a job. She worked 
for Salt Lake City, painting a mural at the Fair Grounds; later she 
worked for short periods at Tony Roma's restaurant and for the Bid 
Committee. Ms. Arroyo returned to Texas in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *Consultants    	
</P>
<P>
	The budgets also indicate that during 1993 and 1994 the Bid  
Committee entered into new contracts with several consultants to 
assist with introductions to IOC members. The Bid Committee had 
used consultants during its bid for the 1998 Games, but the 
consultants hired later appear to have played a more significant 
role. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mahmoud El Farnawani, a consultant based in Toronto, Canada, who  
focuses on IOC members from the Mediterranean, began to assist the 
Bid Committee in late 1992, but was not paid until October 5, 1993. 
The Bid Committee paid Mr. El Farnawani a total of $148,260 over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee also entered into a consulting contract with  
Muttaleb Ahmad, the Director General of the Olympic Council of 
Asia. Mr. Ahmad was paid $62,400 from June 1994 through June 1995 
to assist the Bid Committee with lobbying IOC members from the 
Middle East and some North African countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first bid period, the Bid Committee entered into a  
consulting contract with an entity called ``Citius,'' which has 
been linked to Alfredo La Mont, who recently resigned as the USOC 
Director of International Relations and Protocol. This agreement 
required Citius to arrange meetings and provide other lobbying 
services with IOC members. In consideration for these services, the 
Bid Committee agreed to pay Citius the sum of $20,000.00. The 
financial records of the Bid Committee indicate that between March 
1990 and May 1991, Citius was paid $25,714.35 by nine checks. While 
the consulting contract was signed on behalf of Citius by Antonio 
Aguilar, one copy of the draft contract was faxed to Mr. La Mont's 
fax number; the USOC has confirmed to the Board of Ethics that Mr. 
Aguilar and Mr. La Mont were business associates in Citius. The 
records of the Bid Committee do not reflect the extent of the 
services that Citius performed under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second bid period, the Bid Committee had a consulting  
relationship with another entity affiliated with Mr. La Mont called 
ARCA, Inc. While one payment to ARCA was made in February 1992, the 
bulk of the payments to ARCA were made in 1994 and 1995. Through 
October 1995, the Bid Committee made six payments totaling 
$18,185.90. The Bid Committee records do not indicate the extent of 
the contract services performed by ARCA under the consulting 
agreement. They do state that monthly payments of $3,000.00 were 
passed through ARCA to Austin Sealy, an IOC member from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson arranged a consulting  
relationship of a different sort between the Bid Committee and 
Bjarne Haggman, the husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo Haggman. 
Mr. Haggman, a forester with a masters degree in Forestry from the 
University of Helsinki, was previously employed from January 1989 
to September 1990 as a Forest Inventory Specialist with the Ontario 
Ministry of Natural Resources in Canada. It has been reported that 
he secured this job with the assistance of the Toronto Bid 
Committee, which made an unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Our review of the financial records revealed that the Bid  
Committee made eight wire transfers directly to Mr. Haggman, from 
May 4, 1994 through June 7, 1995, for a total of $33,750. When 
questioned about these payments, Mr. Johnson stated that Mr. 
Haggman approached him in 1993 and requested assistance in finding 
a job in the forestry industry. ... 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *Relative Assistance    	
</P>
<P>
	In February 1993, Mr. Johnson agreed to begin making regular  
payments to Raouf Scally. These payments, made from Bid Committee 
funds, appear to have been a $500 monthly commitment. Mr. Scally is 
notable among those who received funds under the NOC Program for 
the almost complete absence of any documentation relating to the 
origin or purpose of the payments. ... In total, Mr. Scally 
received $14,500, with the last $500 payment made in February 1996. 
...
</P>
<P>
	In August 1993, Bid Committee officials entered into one of the  
Bid Committee's most expensive relationships. The Bid Committee's 
records reveal that payments to Sonia Essomba, the daughter of 
Professor Rene Essomba, then the IOC member from Cameroon, were 
intended to support her as she attended American University in 
Washington, D.C. The records demonstrate that the Bid Committee 
paid Ms. Essomba's rent, tuition and expenses from August 1993 
until November 1996, at a total cost of $108,350. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Also in August 1993, the Bid Committee flew Ms. Essomba along  
with Moriba and Mohammed Keita, the sons of the IOC Member from 
Mali, Lamine Keita, round-trip from Washington, D.C. to Salt Lake 
City, so that Ms. Essomba, and Messrs. Keita could help organize 
the United States National Gymnastics Championships. In August 
1993, Professor Essomba sent Mr. Johnson a letter authorizing the 
Bid Committee to hire his daughter as a hostess for those 
championships. The Bid Committee flew Ms. Essomba to Salt Lake City 
again from December 18-22, 1994 for a visit with her family. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1993, Bid Committee officials began a relationship  
with Zuhair Gadir, the son of General Zein El Abdin Mohamed Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir (``General Gadir''), an IOC member from Sudan. Like the 
payments to Mr. Scally, these payments were made directly to 
Zuhair, not to a university, and were paid without regard to their 
ultimate use. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter from Mr. Welch to Zuhair, dated December 3, 1993,  
Mr. Welch stated that he had become aware through ``mutual 
friends'' that Zuhair was attending college at Southern Mississippi 
University. ... The direct payments to Zuhair, totaling $17,000, 
began on February 1, 1994, and continued through June 7, 1995.

	The Bid Committee paid for IOC members and their relatives  
(sometimes more than one) to fly first class to Salt Lake City 
(often more than once), and on some occasions paid for their travel 
to other Olympic events. While in Salt Lake City, IOC members were 
given extensive planned itineraries, which included trips to the 
venues and other local sites, and dinners at local restaurants and 
at private homes. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members invited by the Bid Committee to visit Salt Lake City  
typically stayed for three days. In many cases, rooms were donated 
by local hotels, so the Bid Committee's records do not indicate the 
length of the IOC member's stay. It is apparent, though, that 
several IOC members remained for extended stays at the expense of 
the Bid Committee. For instance, in December 1994, the Bid 
Committee paid for the family of Agustin Arroyo, the IOC member 
from Ecuador, to stay in a Park City condominium for a holiday 
vacation. This vacation, which appears to have lasted two weeks, 
cost the Bid Committee more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Bid Committee management hosted IOC members at  
their own homes as part of the ``Olympic Family.'' Some IOC members 
treated their site visits more like vacations. For instance, the 
families of IOC members Phillip Coles of Australia and Willi 
Kaltschmitt of Guatemala made a total of four visits together to 
the United States at the Bid Committee's expense. The Coles and 
Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels and followed the 
same recreational itinerary. Two of these trips were only four 
months apart in 1995, including a Super Bowl trip that does not 
appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City. Mr. Welch served 
as their host at the Super Bowl; the expenses were paid as 
reimbursements to Mr. Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other examples of IOC members enjoying additional  
stays at the Bid Committee's expense at locations other than Salt 
Lake City. The Bid Committee on several occasions paid for IOC 
members to stay in New York City, Paris and London for extended 
periods of time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City. 
While some IOC members from Third World countries may have needed a 
few days in Paris or London to arrange for U.S. visas, it is 
apparent from the SLOC records that many of these extended stays 
either had no relation to obtaining travel documents or were far 
longer than necessary. In more than one instance the Bid Committee 
paid for extended stays after a trip to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the documents indicate that the Bid Committee paid  
for the family of IOC Member Rene Essomba to stay at the 
Intercontinental Hotel in Paris on December 8-12 and 23-28, 1994 
and on December 8-12 and 23-28, 1995 at the rate of approximately 
$300 per night. The Bid Committee also paid for Mr. and Mrs. 
Essomba's first-class round-trip airfare from Cameroon to Paris for 
the December 1994 stay, and paid for the Essombas to continue that 
trip to New York, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City. A letter from Mr. 
Tom Welch to Mr. Essomba indicates that the Essombas visited Salt 
Lake City on that trip for a ``holiday'' following a meeting in 
Atlanta.

                      *Gifts and Entertainment    	
</P>
<P>
	Some gifts, particularly those with a Utah theme, were given  
uniformly to each IOC member; other gifts were personalized for 
individual members. Several prominent IOC members were given 
personalized gifts in recognition of their positions within the 
Olympic Family. The value of these gifts ran from $200 to $9,000. 
For instance, IOC President Samaranch was given a $9,000 limited 
edition pistol, which was donated by Browning. Norwegian IOC member 
Jan Staubo was presented with replica model airplane of the 
Spitfire he flew for the Norwegian Air Force during World War II. 
Stein Erickson, whose brother had flown next to Mr. Staubo and was 
killed in battle, presented the airplane to Mr. Staubo. These 
personalized gifts were intended to strengthen ties between the 
recipient and the Salt Lake City bid campaign. Presentations of 
these gifts typically occurred in the presence of other people; Bid 
Committee representatives and Trustees have never denied to the 
Board of Ethics that they occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Other gifts were not so personalized. Some IOC guests expressed  
an interest in shopping trips for themselves or their companions. 
While some of this shopping was paid for by the visitors, much of 
it was paid for by the Bid Committee. Shopping often took place 
with a Bid Committee representative present who would charge the 
purchases on a personal charge card for subsequent reimbursement by 
the Bid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, at least two major department stores had pledged  
sizeable VIK donations to the Bid Committee. Purchases made at 
these stores were charged against a pre-arranged credit line on 
store accounts. We received a summary from one participating 
department store that itemizes purchases totaling a $25,000 VIK 
contribution. Of this amount, $8,017 was expended on clothing 
items, $7,054 for fragrances, $2,560 for luggage and the remainder 
for sundry categories. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Other entertainment was more public, including catered banquets,  
sports events (such as Utah Jazz basketball games), cultural 
performances (such as the Utah Symphony) and recreational 
excursions (such as river running or exploring the Colorado River 
or Lake Powell). Some group activities were conducted in full view 
of the public. For example, large numbers of IOC members were 
honored during half-time breaks at Utah Jazz games and were 
presented with Jazz collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the gift-giving, some of the entertainment was more  
personalized. Many IOC members were taken skiing, and others were 
taken on trips to Moab, Yellowstone Park, Las Vegas and even 
Florida for the Super Bowl. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC members who visited Salt Lake City, Jean-Claude  
Ganga merits special mention. Many witnesses before the Board of 
Ethics described Mr. Ganga as the IOC member who most took 
advantage of the Bid Committee's and the community's generosity; 
indeed, Bid Committee and SLOC expenditures attributable to the 
Ganga family total more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in August 1993, Mr. Ganga became a frequent guest of  
the Bid Committee. While it is typical for an IOC member and a 
companion to make a single site visit to a bid city, Mr. Ganga 
visited Salt Lake City on at least a half-dozen occasions. He was 
accompanied variously by his wife, Eugenie, his son, Jean-Jacques, 
and his mother-in-law, Pauline Biyendolo. Since 1990, the total 
amount paid by the Bid Committee and the Organizing Committee for 
the travel expenses of Mr. Ganga and his family amounted to more 
than $115,000; meals and lodging for the Gangas cost the Bid 
Committee $13,900. 
</P>
<P>
	During their many trips to Salt Lake City, Mr. Ganga and his  
family members received extensive medical care. For example, Mr. 
Ganga was treated for hepatitis, his mother-in-law underwent knee 
replacement surgery, and his wife had cosmetic surgery. Some 
medical expenses were covered by health insurance. Other medical 
expenses were paid directly by the Bid Committee. However, the bulk 
of the medical expenses were furnished without charge by the health 
care providers. ... The Bid Committee directly paid $17,172.37 for 
health care expenses for Mr. Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                          *Direct Payments    	
</P>
<P>
	In late 1993, the Bid Committee began a series of direct  
payments to Charles Mukora, an IOC member from Kenya. While Mr. 
Welch maintains that the first payment to Mr. Mukora was for a 
Kenyan NOC program, he acknowledges that the other payments were 
for Mr. Mukora's personal use. From November 1993 through May 1995, 
Mr. Mukora received direct payments of Bid Committee funds in the 
amount of $34,650. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1993 and January 1994, two direct payments of Bid  
Committee funds were made to Sergio Santander-Fantini, a member of 
the IOC from Chile, who also served as the President of the Chilean 
National Olympic Committee throughout the bid period. Both checks, 
totaling $20,050, lack proper documentation. While the Bid 
Committee's files contain no information related to these payments, 
interviews conducted by the Board of Ethics revealed that they were 
authorized by Mr. Welch and used for Mr. Santander's political 
campaign. ... 
</P>
<P>
	On October 10, 1994, Mr. Johnson received a fax from the Bid  
Committee's consultant, Muttaleb Ahmad, requesting that the Bid 
Committee send $1,000 per month to the ``daughter'' of General 
Gadir, the IOC member from Sudan. From recent admissions by General 
Gadir to the IOC, it appears that he has no daughter named 
``Zema,'' but rather that this is a pseudonym for General Gadir 
himself. Mr. Johnson responded immediately to the request, without 
any apparent knowledge of the existence of Zema Gadir and wire 
transfers began two weeks later. In any event, there is little, if 
any, difference between these ``direct payments'' made to IOC 
members and the ``assistance'' given to relatives of IOC members, 
particularly where Bid Committee officials did not attempt to 
ascertain whether there was a legitimate educational purpose for 
the payments.

<HEADLINE> American's Passengers Left Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Luz Maria Torres sat on a stroller, her 1-month-old  
son on her lap, as she waited in frustration Tuesday for an 
American Airlines flight to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``One was going to leave at 8 a.m., and they canceled it.  
Another was going to leave at 10:30, and they canceled it also,'' 
said Ms. Torres, who arrived at Miami International Airport Monday 
night only to be put up in a hotel and shuttled back to the airport 
several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 American flights have been canceled since talks  
bogged down between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association 
late Friday. Nearly one-third of American's 2,250 flights were 
expected to be canceled Tuesday, with Miami and New York the 
hardest-hit regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Torres, 19, who left Boston expecting a short stop in Miami,  
said she spent more than $100 during the delay -- on food for 
herself, a taxi to buy a clean shirt for Luis Manuel and some extra 
canned milk. ``My milk for him ran out because I only had enough 
for yesterday,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the terminal around her, passengers passed the hours dozing  
on carts stuffed with luggage, slumped in their chairs or collapsed 
on the carpet. A few cursed aloud after learning their flights were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	On the airline's computer monitors, ``CANCELED'' blinked in blue  
lettering next to a list of destinations: Nassau, Bahamas; Santo 
Domingo, Dominican Republic; St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers at other airports were having similar experiences.  
</P>
<P>
	Beatriz Chichizola, a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, said  
she had to wait hours at Los Angeles International Airport before 
receiving an explanation about the delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were to happen in Argentina, they would burn the  
airport,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines referred calls from the news media to a  
recorded telephone message with general information about canceled 
flights. It said representatives would not be available to provide 
information about specific cancellations in each city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline and its pilots union agreed  
to resume negotiations Tuesday over how quickly the company can 
integrate pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into its work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	American's pilots have been bickering with the airline's parent  
company, AMR Corp., saying the company should be adding Reno Air 
pilots to its roster more quickly, thereby moving employees up on 
its pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons between the two airlines' wage scales are difficult  
because of several variables. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old Reno Air only flies MD-80 jets, while pilots of  
different aircraft at American receive different rates of pay. 
</P>
<P>
	A captain at Reno with six years of experience makes roughly  
$75,000 a year, said Reno Air pilot spokesman Bob Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Airlines salary contract listings, an  
MD-80 captain with 12 years of experience makes $174.53 an hour, 
flying a full schedule of 78 hours a month, or roughly $164,000 a 
year. At this time, however, no American pilot can actually hold an 
MD-80 captain job at only six years seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law does not allow American pilots to strike over the  
issue, but scores of pilots have called in sick and refused 
overtime on extra flights, creating an unusually severe shortage of 
cockpit crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a farmer from South Otselic, N.Y., left nearby  
Syracuse for a weeklong vacation to Aruba and was stranded with 
five friends at Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've given us the run-around,'' he said. ``We think the  
pilots on strike should be fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 people waited in line at the American Airlines counter  
at San Francisco International Airport -- Dorothy Krumper of 
Flanders, N.J. among them. Although her flight to New York was 
canceled, she was smiling and said the airline's employees treated 
her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very nice. I'm being re-ticketed to United,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International, the gateway to Latin America for many  
American flights, Ms. Torres was having trouble keeping her tired 
infant from whimpering. Only after she put his bottle's rubber 
nipple in his mouth did his tiny hands relax. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Torres said she hoped it would not be much longer until she  
could be with her mother in San Francisco de Macoris, in the 
northern region of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like this,'' she said. ``This has never happened to  
me.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Pick Attorney for Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A smoker who sued Philip Morris after being  
diagnosed with inoperable cancer won $1.5 million Tuesday in the 
first case to reach trial since California lifted a ban on lawsuits 
by individuals against tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensatory damages cover medical costs, pain and  
suffering. The Superior Court jury was expected to return Wednesday 
to consider punitive damages, attorneys for the plaintiff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Henley's case was the first since the repeal of a 1987  
tort reform law that banned lawsuits by cigarette smokers on the 
basis that the risks of smoking were well known. Dozens of cases 
were pending at the time were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature responded to criticism of the ban by repealing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November but cigarette makers still face class 
action lawsuits and individual lawsuits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, had been smoking since age 15.  
She quit in 1997 after suffering coughing fits and other health 
problems. She was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer in 
her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Philip Morris Cos., claiming there were no warnings on  
cigarettes when she began smoking more than three decades ago and 
that major tobacco companies failed to warn that smokers may be 
unable to give up the habit. Her lawsuit included charges of 
negligence, strict liability and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris claimed it was not liable for Ms. Henley's illness  
since she understood and assumed the risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Henley case was at least the fourth time a jury in a tobacco  
liability case awarded compensatory damages. The first three cases 
were overturned on appeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- J. Patrick Glynn, a 27-year career veteran of  
the Justice Department with long experience in complex injury 
cases, was chosen Tuesday to head the Justice Department's task 
force drafting a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	As director of environmental torts for the Civil Division for  
the past 13 years, Glynn, 52, guided the defense that defeated a 
legal campaign by the asbestos products industry in the 1980s and 
early 1990s to shift its liability for asbestos-caused illnesses to 
federal taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the industry gave its pursuit of the government in  
1996, federal taxpayers had paid out only $65,000 in one judgment 
and two settlements. By contrast, private industry ended up paying 
hundreds of millions of dollars to claimants. 
</P>
<P>
	Torts are the legal name for injuries against people or  
properties. A senior Justice official has said the Justice task 
force will draw up a legal strategy and a lawsuit or lawsuits to 
recover from tobacco companies the cost of federal health insurance 
payments for illnesses that can be traced to tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	This official, who requested anonymity, said the case or cases  
will be tort claims against the tobacco companies, possibly 
alleging fraud, negligence or breach of a special duty to provide 
the government all information on health effects of their product. 
</P>
<P>
	Glynn also directed the government's victory in the Supreme  
Court in 1996 over Agent Orange manufacturers who were seeking to 
have federal taxpayers foot the bill for their settlements with 
military veterans who suffered illnesses after exposure to their 
products. He also has led the lawyers handling lawsuits over human 
radiation experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1970 graduate of the Indiana University School of Law, Glynn  
served two years as assistant prosecuting attorney in St. Louis 
County, Mo., three years as an assistant U.S. attorney in St. Louis 
and between 1975 and 1985 moved through various posts in the 
Antitrust and Civil divisions. Before moving to the torts branch, 
he was director of the Civil Division's Office of Consumer 
Litigation.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV Price Controls To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cable rates are set to be deregulated next  
month and the Clinton administration won't try to stop that from 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's existing price controls  
on cable TV end, or ``sunset,'' on March 31 under a 1996 
telecommunications law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will let it set as of March 31,'' Commerce Secretary  
William Daley told reporters Monday at a briefing on the law, 
enacted three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the price of the most basic level of cable service, which  
consists of broadcast and a few cable channels, will continue to be 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the administration supports the scheduled  
sunset of cable price regulation,'' said National Cable Television 
Association President Decker Anstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry opposes regulating prices beyond March 31,  
saying it would halt investment in new services -- such as 
high-speed Internet access and digital TV -- and discourage 
companies from adding new channels. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups were disappointed by Daley's comments. ``The  
administration is doing nothing to challenge skyrocketing prices 
charged by cable monopolists,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of 
the Consumers Union's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration will keep a close eye on cable  
rates after the price controls are lifted. ``We will watch it. We 
will not let anyone take advantage ... and gouge consumers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable prices have increased 21 percent since the law's  
enactment, while overall inflation has risen 6 percent during the 
same period, consumer groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry says that with each rate increase, customers have  
gotten more channels, improved service and better picture and sound 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress set the expiration date with the hope that competition  
for cable would materialize and make continued price regulation 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups don't believe that sufficient competition  
for cable has developed to keep rates in check and have asked 
Congress to stop the scheduled deregulation. Their efforts haven't 
gained momentum on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry says competition is growing from satellite  
providers, phone companies and municipally owned cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration is encouraged by cable industry  
statements that ``they plan to keep their rates somewhat under 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry says rates are unlikely to spike higher after  
they are deregulated by the government. Anstrom has said increases 
could be in the 4 percent to 5 percent range, compared with the 
average 7 percent increases seen in 1997 and part of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases reflect cable companies' increased business  
costs, including programming, upgrading cable TV systems and labor 
costs.

<HEADLINE> Maine Nixes Bill Protecting Bikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- A panel of lawmakers unanimously decided  
Tuesday that bikers do not deserve special protection under the 
umbrella of the Maine Human Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorcycle enthusiasts claim their tough, tattooed and  
leather-clad appearance often leads to discrimination when they 
look for a place to dine or spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would have amended the rights act -- which bars  
discrimination based on race, sex, religion, national origin or 
disability -- to include people who operate motorcycles or who wear 
clothing displaying the name of a motorcycle group. It was rejected 
in a Judiciary Committee 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was modeled after a successful proposal in Minnesota.  
An Arizona legislative panel recently rejected a similar law. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Rep. Richard Thompson said the bill was easy to  
dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't doubt that there's been times when motorcyclists get  
refused services,'' Thompson said. ``It certainly didn't rise to 
the level of the type of protected class we want to include in the 
Maine Human Rights Act.''

<HEADLINE> `Death of a Salesman' Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Attention must be paid: A Broadway classic has  
come calling again. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty years after it first stunned critics and audiences, Arthur  
Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' has returned to the scene of its 
original triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	A new production of ``Salesman'' starring Brian Dennehy as the  
beaten-down Willy Loman opens Wednesday, exactly half a century 
after the drama's premiere at the Morosco Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Morosco has disappeared, torn down in 1982 to make  
way for a giant Times Square hotel. Gone too are the show's 
original stars, Lee J. Cobb, who played Willy; Mildred Dunnock, as 
his long-suffering wife, Linda; and Arthur Kennedy as their 
troubled son Biff. 
</P>
<P>
	But its author, at 83, is still here and still writing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot find a means of absorbing the idea of half a century  
rolling away beneath my feet,'' Miller wrote in the preface to a 
new anniversary edition of the play. ``Half a century is a very 
long time, yet I must already have grown up way back then, indeed I 
must have been a few years past 30, if my calculations are correct, 
and this fact I find indigestible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all the servicemen returning from World War II, the late  
1940s were a boom time on Broadway. ``Salesman'' opened two months 
after ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' and two months before ``South Pacific.'' 
``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Mister Roberts'' and ``Oklahoma!'' 
still were big hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a tremendous influx of energy into the culture, both  
highbrow and lowbrow,'' says theater critic and author Eric 
Bentley, who saw the original production. ``Miller had not actually 
been in uniform, but he was part of that generation. There was a 
great outpouring of enthusiasm after the war was over, and I think 
audiences had part of that enthusiasm as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' grabbed theatergoers like nothing else on Broadway.  
Critics debated whether it was an indictment of ruthless capitalism 
or a searing psychological portrait of a man unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Audiences responded more to its potent family drama. They  
sympathized and wept over the story of Willy, who bought into the 
American dream and ended up destroying not only himself but his 
golden football-hero son, Biff, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, it remains the greatest father-son play ever  
written,'' says Robert Falls, director of the new production. 
``This is a play where you walk into the men's room at the end of 
the night and men are unabashedly weeping trying to pull it 
together before they go out to be with their wives or their 
girlfriends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was something heartrendingly ordinary in Willy, a quality  
reiterated by his wife, who in the play's most famous speech 
declares: ``He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's 
a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So 
attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his 
grave like an old dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original ``Salesman'' was a triumph of collaboration. It was  
directed by Elia Kazan, who dominated Broadway during the postwar 
era, directing the plays of Miller and Tennessee Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, a bulky figure like Dennehy, gave an expansive,  
larger-than-life performance that many have likened to King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
	``In real tragedy, the hero has to fall from a height,'' Bentley  
says. ``In other words, he has to be at a height -- and Cobb was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' found success all over the world, with audiences  
having no trouble responding to the peculiarly American qualities 
of the Loman family. Paul Muni played Willy in London. In 1951, 
Luchino Visconti directed a Rome production that featured Marcello 
Mastroianni as Happy, Loman's younger son. Miller himself directed 
a Chinese production in 1983 in Beijing. Dustin Hoffman portrayed a 
feisty, bantam-like Willy in the last Broadway revival, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The current production was imported from Chicago's Goodman  
Theater and also stars Elizabeth Franz as Linda and Kevin Anderson 
as Biff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vision of `Salesman' is so enormous that over 50 years, it  
probably has worn down anybody who didn't think it was a great 
play,'' Falls says. ``It is one of those great plays like `Oedipus' 
or `Angels in America' that is both political and personal 
simultaneously. There are a lot of plays in the history of the 
theater that are either one or the other. This is both.''

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Links USOC to Bid Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	High-ranking U.S. Olympic Committee officials discussed  
``promises ... made to secure votes'' for Salt Lake City's 2002 
Winter Games bid, according to an investigation of the bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in the vote-buying case that records  
showed any indication USOC leaders may have known about what has 
turned into the biggest corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	A November 1995 e-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors  
contained repeated references to an agreement to help train 
athletes from the Sudan at committee facilities as part of Salt 
Lake's campaign, a Utah ethics commission reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, then the USOC's director for international relations. 
``Our and SLC's debt is to train them for Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the committee's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city had won the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in apparent reference to the Sudanese member of the IOC,  
Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of nine IOC delegates who 
have resigned or been expelled because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied it was part of any quid pro quo, such as the  
$800,000 in cash, gifts and other inducements to IOC members 
detailed in the ethics commission report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We committed to Salt Lake,'' USOC executive director Dick  
Schultz said. ``But we did not try to buy votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Moran, the committee's chief spokesman, said the training  
program at the USOC center in Colorado Springs, Colo., was within 
the rules and a model of exchanges between national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' Moran said. ``But we did 
not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said the case appeared to be part of the  
USOC's normal lobbying efforts for American bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC's solicitation of support from the Sudanese IOC  
member in exchange for financing the training of a group of 
Sudanese athletes is an example of this process,'' it said. But it 
added that national Olympic committees should avoid such 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there is nothing inherently improper about this kind of  
expenditure, it may draw bid cities into NOC assistance programs 
that are susceptible to abuse,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have spurred some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due diligence and hindsight is great, and, yes, it probably  
should have triggered an investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Page and Wilkinson remain at their USOC jobs. La Mont resigned  
last month after admitting he did consulting work for Tom Welch, 
the head of Salt Lake's Olympic bid. The ethics report detailed 
more than $33,000 paid to La Mont by the bid committee. Sources 
said at the time of his resignation that La Mont was paid to gather 
information about IOC members in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said the USOC ``should also ensure that its  
employees are not involved in private financial transactions with 
bid committees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The training program was initiated by Welch in a letter to  
Harvey Schiller, then USOC executive director and now president of 
Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In subsequent exchanges, Salt Lake agreed to reimburse the USOC  
for the cost of training the Sudanese athletes, all track runners 
aiming for the 1996 Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to hosting these athletes and to continued  
cooperation between our two countries,'' John Krimsky, then serving 
as the USOC's interim executive director, wrote in October 1994 to 
Kamal Hamid Shaddad, president of the Sudanese Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky acknowledged in that letter that Salt Lake would  
reimburse the USOC. Moran said such reimbursement was within the 
rules but could not immediately recall any similar cases.

<HEADLINE> Tammy Wynette's Doctor Speaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tammy Wynette's doctor says there is no  
reason to suspect the country superstar died from anything other 
than a blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Willis Marsh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center  
responded Monday to a campaign by three of Wynette's daughters to 
exhume their mother's body for an investigation into the cause of 
her death last April. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters -- Jackie Daly, Tina Jones and Georgette Smith --  
are suspicious of the blood clot finding because the police report 
said the only drugs the country singer was taking were antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters said their mother was on various prescribed pain  
medications for years, including Stadol, Valium, and Demerol. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Marsh said there is ``no doubt that her  
death resulted from the effects of blood clots to her lungs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, who was 55 when she died, had 20 No. 1 hits. She  
endured myriad health problems for much of her life, including 
painful intestinal scarring from several surgeries.

<HEADLINE> Aamodt Wins Combined Skiing Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Norwegians Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus  
maintained their season-long dominance in the men's combined, 
finishing 1-2 in the event Tuesday at the World Alpine Ski 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Paul Accola took the bronze medal as the top seven  
racers after the first slalom run held their positions in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined times of a downhill and two slalom runs determined  
the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is the worst competition for us because we  
know we're favorites,'' Aamodt said. ``The (time) difference in the 
downhill was small, so I knew I had to risk in the slalom to get 
the gold or take a medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus won his third medal of these championships, having already  
shared a gold with Austria's Hermann Maier in the super-G and 
earning a silver in the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very satisfied,'' Kjus said. ``I skied very well today.  
Kjetil skied a bit better. I tried to ski the fastest I could in 
the second run but it wasn't good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian men and women had claimed 10 out of a possible 15  
medals through the first five events, but they were shut out for 
the first time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway now has five medals, all accounted for by Kjus and  
Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was the top North American, placing 14th  
in 2:49.67. Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., was the top 
American, finishing 17th in 2:52.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, gold medalist in combined at the last world  
championships in 1997 in Sestrieres, Italy, led Kjus by .40 seconds 
entering the second heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus had the second-fastest time in the second run of 45.12  
seconds, giving him a combined time of 1 minute, 43.25 seconds and 
putting pressure on his teammate, who skied next. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, however, knew his lead was in jeopardy when he noticed  
that he had lost time to Accola in the second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, Aamodt was up to the challenge. Early in his run,  
he lost a few hundredths of his advantage but, punching out gates 
in a mad rush to the bottom, finished in 45.36 for a total time of 
1:43.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who finished second in the combined at the 1989 world  
championships in Colorado, overcame a slip near the finish when he 
got sideways between gates and still managed to post the fastest 
second run, 45.09. His combined time was 1:43.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a funny feeling,'' Accola said, ``and I'm very happy  
after having fought for so many years and not really had a lot of 
luck. I told myself today that it's either all or nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Christian Mayer placed fourth in 1:43.89.  
Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, who paced the downhill portion of the 
combined on Monday but slipped to fifth place after a mediocre 
first slalom run earlier Tuesday, was fifth in 1:44.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Michael Walchhofer remained sixth in 1:44.98, and  
Italy's Alessandro Fattori was seventh in 1:45.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the only skier to have won world-championship medals in  
all five disciplines, trailed Kernen by just .08 seconds in the 
downhill. Aamodt fashioned a first slalom run of 44.21 to move into 
first place overall at 1:57.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who was third in the downhill but only .14 seconds behind  
Kernen, was timed in 44.55 in the first slalom and was second 
overall at 1:58.13. He lost some ground on his teammate, however, 
falling .40 seconds behind Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt and Kjus had dominated the two combined events on the  
World Cup circuit this season. Kjus was first and Aamodt second in 
a combined in Wengen, Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week later, Aamodt 
was first and Kjus second in a combined in Kitzbuhel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, sixth after the downhill, moved into third with the  
second-fastest slalom run, 44.15, and had a total of 1:58.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer had the quickest slalom, 43.78, and was in fourth place in  
1:58.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion,  
straddled a gate on his first slalom and was disqualified.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Tony Martin Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Another Atlanta Falcons player is taking a legal  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Tony Martin, 33, who caught five passes in the Falcons'  
34-19 Super Bowl loss to Denver, returned to Miami on Monday, 
appearing in court in shackles to face money laundering and 
conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson was arrested the night before  
the Super Bowl on charges of soliciting oral sex from a female 
undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is due back in court March 2, but Martin is potentially  
is in much deeper legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not guilty of anything,'' Martin said after being released  
on $250,000 bond. ``This whole thing is ludicrous. After this trial 
is over, I will be cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's legal troubles spring from his longtime relationship  
with Rickey Brownlee, a convicted drug dealer known as ``the mayor 
of Opa-Locka'' for his Robin Hood style. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would pass out turkeys at Thanksgiving, give bicycles to  
little kids. But he was also selling heroin and cocaine,'' William 
Mitchell, special agent in charge of the DEA's Miami office, said 
when Brownlee was arrested in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was under investigation for months. His name appeared  
Monday on the third superseding indictment in the case, which also 
involves cocaine and heroin trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The receiver is not accused of involvement in Brownlee's drug  
business. Prosecutors said he wrote checks to lease luxury cars and 
pay legal fees for his friend because Brownlee's lawyers wouldn't 
take cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Jan. 6 interview, Martin insisted he was no longer a target  
of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just speculation,'' he said at the time. ``It wasn't  
even true. Really, it was just garbage. I knew in my mind that I 
didn't have anything to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee allegedly gave cash to Martin for deposits on the cars  
and the attorneys' fees. After his financial records were 
subpoenaed, Martin stopped payment on a $175,000 check to the 
attorneys and showed a copy of the subpoena to Brownlee's 
associates, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin also returned thousands in cash in an effort to conceal  
the scheme, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin thanked the Falcons organization for supporting him.  
Spokesman Charlie Taylor said the team planned no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's broken a law, then he'll pay for it,'' Taylor said.  
``If not, then he'll be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league was aware of the case  
and had no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired by the Falcons from San Diego last June, Martin led  
Atlanta with 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns this 
season. He added nine receptions for 192 yards in the playoffs as 
the Falcons reached their first Super Bowl in franchise history. 
Martin teamed with Terrance Mathis to give the Falcons the NFL's 
second-most productive pair of receivers in terms of yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin started in the NFL career with the Miami Dolphins before  
his career took off in San Diego, where he averaged 72 catches and 
1,046 yards in four seasons.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Glitch Used in Marketing Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Call it the ultimate ``going out of  
business'' sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 computer glitch that doomsayers warn will lead to  
the end of the world as we know it has begun showing up in sales 
pitches for companies ranging from Apple Computer to a small-town 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time we sort of poke fun at that which is  
current,'' said Richard Lewis, who oversees the Absolut vodka 
account at the TBWA Chiat/Day advertising firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The vodka distiller plans to incorporate the Year 2000 problem  
in one of its long-running series of ads featuring Absolut bottles 
in surprise settings. The ad will debut in the April issue of Wired 
magazine and will show a partially formed bottle made up of 0s and 
1s -- shorthand for the way computers store information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem arises from the use in early computer  
programs of a two-digit format to express a year. Such computers 
could read the ``00'' of 2000 as 1900, which could cause a variety 
of failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computer experts say the problems probably will result in  
isolated minor inconveniences if anything happens at all. Others 
fear a global economic meltdown, accompanied by food shortages and 
the collapse of the nation's power grid. 
</P>
<P>
	From a marketing perspective, it doesn't matter which scenario  
is the more accurate one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irrelevant what actually happens,'' Lewis says. ``It's  
all about the buildup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the extra attention might prove helpful to folks  
who aren't either technology wizards or militia members, says Bruce 
Webster, author of ``The Y2K Survival Guide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the problem is serious, but I don't think it's the end  
of the world,'' said Webster, a Dallas-based technology consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of people are going to have power that weekend,''  
he predicted. ``Everybody's car is going to start just fine. 
Frankly, I'm more concerned about the lack of general awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, whose book offers some basic tips for coping with the  
computer bug, said people ought to know they should keep track of 
their bank balances or credit card bill, for example, to make sure 
they're calculated correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	Peoples Bank in Gambier recently began offering Y2K-guaranteed  
savings accounts as a way to let its customers know it was dealing 
with the situation, said Joan Jones, chief executive officer of the 
one-branch bank about 50 miles northeast of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts, which carry a nominal interest rate on balances of  
a maximum $500, are aimed at people who might otherwise take their 
money out of the bank before Jan. 1, Ms. Jones explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there should be, God forbid, a run on cash, we're  
guaranteeing it will be there,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, two or three people have opened the accounts.  
</P>
<P>
	But even if the worst does strike, Ms. Jones isn't too worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can go back to being manual,'' she said, explaining that  
the bank didn't start using an in-house computer until about 1 1/2 
years ago and used ledger cards to keep track of loans until about 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is happy with the mainstreaming of the millennium  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much misinformation and noise out there already.  
This will only add to it,'' says Leon Kappelman, co-chairman of the 
Society for Information Management's Year 2000 working group at the 
University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It contributes to a false sense of security,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Take, for example, the ad Apple ran during this year's Super  
Bowl. It showed the talking computer Hal from ``2001: A Space 
Odyssey'' explaining that Macintosh was the only computer to 
operate perfectly as the year 2000 arrived and other computers 
malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, the hardware is fine,'' Kappelman noted. But even the  
most up-to-date computer could have a problem if its owner runs 
outdated software on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Theroux, a New York marketing and promotions consultant,  
has a different problem with the recent interest in the Y2K 
problem: ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Theroux, president of the Promotion Marketing Association, said  
companies ought to stick to describing the benefits of their 
products or services rather than hitching themselves to an 
unrelated and, in this case, potentially catastrophic event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see more of it, though, because it is a  
faddy type of creative process.''

<HEADLINE> Shopping Network, Lycos To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc. is combining its  
cable-television Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster service 
with Lycos Inc., the popular World Wide Web destination, in a deal 
that could create a powerful online seller of jewelry, clothing and 
other consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives in the deal put its stock-market value at $22  
billion, portraying it as the latest high-powered Internet merger. 
But shares of Lycos and Ticketmaster lost more than a quarter of 
their value Tuesday as skeptical investors balked at the terms of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, USALycos Interactive Networks, will have  
combined revenues of $1.5 billion. Most of that comes from USA 
Network's flagship cable channel, Home Shopping Network, as well as 
Ticketmaster's sales of tickets to concerts and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos is the fourth-most visited destination on the World Wide  
Web, offering a search directory, information and services 
unrelated to cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger gives Barry Diller, the entrepreneurial owner of USA  
Networks, an important new Web site to advertise his cable-TV 
channels to potential new viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Diller, who will be chairman of the combined company, plans to  
use the Lycos site to entice online shoppers to buy USA Networks' 
products, such as jewelry sold by the Home Shopping Network and 
tickets by Ticketmaster's online service. Shareholders of 
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., which is controlled by USA 
Networks, will own a minority stake in the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, this creates a major electronic commerce player  
with significant inroads into the local market,'' said Paul 
Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the companies face the challenge of integrating vastly  
different cultures and business models, as well as operations in 
different states. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entity will be based in Waltham, Mass., at Lycos'  
headquarters, meaning that management of key USA Networks 
properties will need to be shifted from their New York base. 
</P>
<P>
	That contrasts with last month's acquisition of Lycos rival  
Excite Inc. by At Home Corp., a next-door neighbor in Redwood City, 
Calif., that provides high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outside looking in, it's a far more complex  
integration challenge than the other Internet combinations that may 
have shared similar cultures and strategies,'' said James Breyer, 
managing partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm based in 
Palo Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, shareholders of Lycos and Ticketmaster appeared  
more concerned about the bottom line than hype surrounding the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would issue 174 million shares with a market  
value of $22 billion, executives said. That would mean each share 
is worth about $126, and that's the key to the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting a fat premium, Lycos shareholders appeared to  
be getting less than the closing stock price Monday of $127.25 a 
share. But for USA Networks' shareholders, the deal represented 
more than three times their company's closing price Monday of 
$37.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch investors, for their part, will  
exchange their shares for 0.44 of a share in the new company, worth 
$55 a share -- less than the $57.75 Ticketmaster's shares closed at 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors did the math and decided Lycos and Ticketmaster were  
losers and USA Networks and Barry Diller were winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' shares tumbled $33 to close at $94.25 a share on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, while USA Networks rose nearly 10 percent, or 
by $3.68 3/4 to $41.62 1/2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch skidded 27 percent, or  
by $15.50, to $42.25, also on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement ends rampant speculation about the future  
of Lycos, the only remaining independent large Web site after 
Yahoo! Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos had been in final negotiations with NBC until 10 days ago,  
when Diller stepped in with an offer, according to a financial 
analyst familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos was impatient with the pace of talks after several large  
rivals struck deals, including Yahoo!'s acquisition of GeoCities 
Inc., which helps people set up their own Web sites. Diller's 
reputation as a key media figure, including the development of the 
Fox broadcast television network, helped turn around Lycos 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was they were getting frustrated with NBC,  
because I don't think NBC really gets it like Barry Diller,'' said 
Alan Braverman, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, declined to  
elaborate on why USA Networks was successful, other than to say 
that the suitor was willing to contribute valuable properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to probably every company you could imagine,'' said  
Davis, who will be CEO of the new company. But Diller ``was willing 
to kick in Ticketmaster and Home Shopping Network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An NBC spokeswoman declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Weightlifter Banned for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian weightlifter Duncan Van  
Rooyen has been banned for two years after testing positive for 
anabolic agent Clenbuterol last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Rooyen, the fourth Australian weightlifter to test positive  
in the past nine months, had claimed the drug, which has medicinal 
use for asthma sufferers, must have been taken in a recreational 
drug he took at a party. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was taken after the national championships in early  
August and the ban was backdated to Aug. 4, the Australian Olympic 
Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive test was made public during last year's  
Commonwealth Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Rooyen missed out on the Games at the selection trials in  
July and returned a negative result to a test at that time before 
the positive test less than a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	``While at a gathering during this period I was offered some  
recreational drugs which I foolishly accepted. This is the only 
possible explanation for my positive test result,'' Van Rooyen said 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	His excuse was disputed by leading Australian sports doctor  
Brian Sando. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's right,'' Sando said last year. ``There  
wouldn't be any reason, advantage or effect for anyone to put 
Clenbuterol in recreational drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Australian Weightlifting Federation's rules, Van  
Rooyen will be required to repay all funding grants from the AWF 
and have all awards, placings and records won from Aug. 4 
withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> Curses Are Foiled Again in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Civil libertarians vowed to appeal a  
judge's decision to uphold an 1897 Michigan law that bans cursing 
in front of children, calling it a threat to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this statute is allowed to stand, then the police have  
unbridled discretion to determine what language is proper or decent 
and what language is not,'' said Michael Steinberg, legal director 
for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's ruling, County District Judge Allen Yenior ordered  
Timothy Boomer, 24, to stand trial for an incident last summer on 
the Rifle River. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy said he heard Boomer launch into in a  
three-minute barrage of profanity after tumbling from a canoe. A 
woman and her two young children were nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer could get up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine if  
convicted. His trial was set for Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer insisted his words have been exaggerated. He and the ACLU  
say the law violates the right to free speech. The judge disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Boomer's words, when used as they were, were  
constitutionally protected speech, then a person could stand on a 
crowded public beach and shout those same words all day,'' Yenior 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cannot be what the framers of the Constitution and the  
First Amendment intended to protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yenior ruled that what Boomer allegedly uttered did not meet the  
U.S. Supreme Court's definition of obscenity, but they could 
constitute ``fighting words,'' which the court has ruled lack 
constitutional protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has granted wide protection to speech, but those  
rulings have come in cases where the words conveyed ideas or 
thoughts about matters such as the military draft or abortion, 
Yenior wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Boomer's words were without any socially redeeming quality  
whatsoever,'' Yenior wrote. ``The First Amendment suffers no damage 
here by taking a backseat to the compelling interest in the 
morality of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, who issued the ruling in Standish, 120 miles  
northwest of Detroit, also found that a section of the law 
outlawing cursing in front of women is an unconstitutional 
violation of the equal protection clause.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Turned Down SLOC Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Andrei Siperco, whose late father was an  
IOC member, emerged as one of the few honest people in Tuesday's 
report detailing unethical behavior by Salt Lake's Olympic bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Siperco turned down an offer to enroll at Brigham Young  
University to work on his doctorate in history, saying it was 
improper because his father, Alexandru, would vote on the site of 
the 2002 Winter Olympics. Alexandru Siperco died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson, a vice president of the Salt Lake bidders, offered  
the son ``a modest living expense as part of our approved grant 
program'' along with plane tickets and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please believe dear Mr. Johnson, that if I had the slightest  
idea that (you will) ... offer some financial help from the 
organizing committee of the Winter Olympic Games, I would not even 
mentioned to you my intention,'' Andrei Siperco wrote on Dec. 1, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank you for your generous offer that I have to  
decline because I consider that it is not appropriate for me to 
take any advantage ... (of a) member of family of the IOC in my 
relations with people involved in Olympic activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Johnson wrote back in an attempt to ``convince  
you to reconsider declining the offer to come and work at the BYU 
University in their History Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A scholarship program has been established by the Organizing  
Committee to develop better relationships with other national 
Olympic committees and their countries,'' Johnson wrote in the 
letter, which was an exhibit to Tuesday's report. ``It is within 
the scope of the scholarship program to finance your living 
expenses while you are working at the BYU University. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if you prefer, other means not associated with  
Olympic activity can be developed that you might deem more 
appropriate. We certainly want you to feel comfortable in coming 
and living in Utah while you work on your doctorate dissertation, 
and we are willing to take whatever steps necessary to make this 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> School Bus Cuts Off Woman's Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCKAHOE, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman's foot was severed when she was  
hit by a school bus and emergency workers had to search under and 
around the bus for the missing body part while about 20 
kindergartners waited inside. 
</P>
<P>
	June Koike, 42, was in critical condition Tuesday after surgeons  
tried to reattach part of her foot that had been severed in the 
Monday afternoon accident. Hospital officials would not say whether 
the foot had been saved. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was crossing the street when she was hit by the bus,  
which was making a left turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Parlapino, a cook at a nearby deli, said emergency  
workers ``were looking everywhere'' for the foot, while 20 children 
waited on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The pupils didn't appear to fully understand what happened, said  
Jerry Cicchelli, the interim Eastchester schools superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver and a bus monitor were treated at the hospital  
for emotional trauma. The driver has a clean record, and Academy 
Bus Co. of Yonkers said it would wait for a police report before 
possibly taking any action against him.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Faces Threat of ACC Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- After Terry Bowden quit as Auburn's football  
coach, the school wanted to restore order. Instead, there's a nasty 
spat with Florida State and the threat of an Atlantic Coast 
Conference boycott of Auburn in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has taken one hit after another since Bowden resigned  
last October, but nothing prepared it for what came Monday when it 
was revealed that ACC commissioner John Swofford wanted all nine of 
his member schools to boycott playing the Tigers in any sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if the ACC never thinks about playing Auburn  
again,'' Auburn trustee Lowell Barron said. ``We've got 100 
athletic events scheduled and only seven or eight are with ACC 
schools. They're only a big thing in their own mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford was angered by Auburn's decision to buy its way out of  
a nationally televised Sept. 2 season opener against Florida State. 
Since Bowden was no longer Auburn's coach, school officials -- and 
new coach Tommy Tuberville -- weren't too eager to open the season 
against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no longer a father-son matchup. It looked more like a  
grudge game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This football team had a very hard time for two months after  
coach Bowden resigned,'' Tuberville said Tuesday. ``I didn't want 
them to have to go through that again, take even more scrutiny when 
they really should be trying to heal from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville said he was the one who told Auburn athletic director  
David Housel to cancel the game, but not because he was afraid of 
beginning his reign against Bobby Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all for rescheduling, we just didn't want the game  
this year,'' he said. ``I know right now we're taking it and will 
be for a few days, but at least we won't be for a month in 
August.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's decision left Florida State without an opponent for its  
season opener and probably cost the Seminoles a spot in the ESPN 
Thursday night game, network spokesman Dean Diltz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very slim that Florida State can still play on Thursday  
night,'' Diltz said. ``There's not many, if any, formidable teams 
that have an open date. It ends up costing Florida State more than 
anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford agreed and fired off an angry letter to Housel.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the way Auburn University is going to conduct its  
business, I feel it is my obligation as conference commissioner to 
ask all of our member institutions to seriously evaluate whether it 
makes sense to schedule Auburn in any sport,'' Swofford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said Tuesday he ``didn't care to comment'' on Swofford's  
threat of an ACC-boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auburn made an institutional decision,'' Housel said. ``We are  
now moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barron called Swofford's threat ``opposition hogwash. Bobby  
Bowden stated on television he didn't want to play the game and it 
should be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's comment about scraping the game came in the aftermath  
of his son's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn settled with Terry Bowden for $620,000 last week,  
including a mandate that he say nothing bad about Auburn, its 
coaches or trustees. The school also paid $500,000 to Florida State 
to get out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford wants an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league  
will lose if the Seminoles lose the ESPN game. 
</P>
<P>
	The money spending alone has angered many Auburn students.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Weaver, a sophomore on Auburn's club-level wrestling team,  
said the football situation has made it unfair for other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spend money for football, for cleaning up football  
messes, and we can't even get help for new wrestling mats,'' Weaver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon to tell what, if any, repercussions will come from  
Swofford's request. Auburn has replaced Florida State with Division 
I-AA Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have a contract to play Clemson, which is now coached  
by Terry Bowden's brother, Tommy, for four games from 2005 through 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson officials have said they don't foresee the series being  
dropped and Tommy Bowden said Tuesday he never asked to get out of 
the Auburn series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something I haven't done,'' Tommy Bowden said. ``There  
is very little I can comment on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pac-10 since 1983, said he had  
never seen one conference commissioner threaten to boycott another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply don't recall that having happened,'' Hansen said.  
``It does seem like a strong step. But I can understand why there's 
strong feelings, all of us work very hard to get our games to be 
televised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn trustee Jack Venable said he anticipated the situation  
would eventually quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to think any conference would use its influence to  
affect another school,'' Venable said. ``Because at some point the 
shoe might be on the other foot.''

<HEADLINE> EKG Abnormalities Can Mean Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Seemingly minor abnormalities in  
electrocardiogram readings may be an important predictor of death 
from heart disease, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrocardiograms measure the electrical impulses of the heart.  
</P>
<P>
	Men with repeated small abnormalities in a portion of their EKG  
results called the ST-T wave segment were found to have an 
increased risk of dying of heart trouble, researchers reported in 
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have long been unsure what to make of such abnormalities  
in patients with no other signs of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, they didn't consider them important,'' said Dr.  
Youlian Liao, one of the researchers. Liao, a professor of 
preventive medicine at Loyola University in Chicago, said doctors 
should not ignore even small abnormalities on EKGs. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 1,673 men who were 40 to 55 in 1957,  
when they became part of a long-term heart-disease study. 
Abnormalities on three or more EKGs increased their risk of death 
from heart problems 2 1/2 times.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Reports Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Airways PLC posted a rare loss of 75  
million pounds ($123 million) in the third quarter, blaming 
currency fluctuations for a charge of 117 million pounds ($191.4 
million) on aircraft leases financed in Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit, which did not include this one-time accounting  
charge, rose to 92 million pounds ($150.5 million), up 6 percent 
from the same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter loss compared with a profit of 80 million  
pounds ($130.9 million) a year ago. The loss was BA's first 
quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1994, said John Lampl, a 
company spokesman based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	However, BA said Tuesday that cost-cutting efforts are yielding  
good results, as is a switch away from Boeing 747s to smaller, more 
efficient 777s. By 2002, nearly half the airline's longhaul fleet 
will comprise 777s, which have proportionally fewer seats in the 
lower-margin economy class. 
</P>
<P>
	``British Airways will emerge from the current difficult market  
conditions with lower costs and an aircraft fleet focused on the 
most profitable sections of the market,'' Chief Executive Bob 
Ayling said. 
</P>
<P>
	BA's U.S. shares rose 12 1/2 cents on the news, closing at $63.62 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	Increased competition for first-class and business-class  
passengers and overcapacity on many routes caused BA's pretax 
profit to slump to 310 million pounds ($507.2 million) for the nine 
months ending Dec. 31, from 510 million pounds ($834.4 million) in 
the same period of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Reduced demand in Asia, a lingering effect of the financial  
crisis there, has added to pressure on profits, Lampl said. The 
slowdown led BA to cancel its routes from London to the Japanese 
cities of Nagoya and Osaka during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is not likely to improve materially in the  
short-term,'' Lampl said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problem over the yen leases, BA said Japanese leases  
would prove profitable over the long-term. 
</P>
<P>
	The leases have to be revalued in sterling at the end of each  
quarter, and the loss -- an accounting entry -- reflected an 18 
percent appreciation in the yen against the pound, BA said.

<HEADLINE> Witness Recalls Cable Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Carlo Demattio was walking his dogs  
through a valley in the Italian Alps when he heard the roar of a 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and I saw an airplane coming down very, very  
fast,'' Demattio, of Cavalese, Italy, recalled in a courtroom 
Monday. ``There was this loud noise and I looked up and screamed, 
`What, are they crazy to be flying so low over a residential area?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, `The cable, the cable.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later the cable, strung across the valley and the  
lifeline of a gondola carrying 20 skiers, was severed by a wing on 
the EA-6B Prowler jet. The gondola plummeted to the ground, killing 
everyone inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the destruction, I knew there was nothing to do,''  
said Demattio, a former police officer who testified through an 
interpreter. ``In fact, nobody answered me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony came at the court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby,  
31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. Ashby, a Marine pilot, is charged with 
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the incident on Feb. 3, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-man military jury was to be flown today to the Marine  
Corps Air Station at Cherry Point to sit in the pilot's seat of a 
Prowler, then to a flight range to watch a Prowler and another jet 
fly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claim Ashby was negligently flying too low and  
performed an unauthorized barrel roll with the jet just before it 
severed the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say a map issued to Ashby didn't show the  
Mount Cermis ski lift, the jet's radar altimeter wasn't reliable 
and the crew didn't have enough training. They also say Ashby 
doesn't deny hitting the cable and that he regrets the deaths every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``His actions aren't criminal,'' defense lawyer Capt. Jon  
Shelburne told the jury. ``They were just doing their jobs. It was 
just an accident. It was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, whose squadron was based at Cherry Point, was on his  
second tour of duty at Aviano air base in Italy at the time of the 
accident. He faces a maximum of more than 200 years in prison if 
convicted of the manslaughter counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is scheduled to be tried next month for the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Former AP Farm Writer Kendall Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don Kendall, farm writer for The Associated  
Press for 23 years before his retirement in 1991, died Monday after 
suffering a heart attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was stricken while driving near his home in suburban  
Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	His byline was a fixture for more than two decades in newspapers  
across America, especially in the Farm Belt. He produced six 
columns a week while covering the Agriculture Department from 1968 
to his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don had a remarkable career in journalism,'' said Sandy  
Johnson, Washington bureau chief for the AP. ``He was dedicated to 
telling readers about food and farms, and the intersection of the 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and a graduate of Kansas  
State University, Kendall began his journalism career at the 
Hutchinson (Kan.) News, where for 11 years he covered agriculture 
issues and the state Legislature. He was named a Nieman Fellow at 
Harvard University in 1964 and joined the AP in Kansas City, Mo., 
three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Washington in 1967 and the following year was named  
AP farm writer, a job he had coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a farm writer,'' Kendall wrote then-AP President  
Wes Gallagher. ``Agriculture is too vital to be viewed entirely 
from the barnyard, too important to be entrusted entirely to the 
bureaucrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Kendall, who grew up on a small farm near Herington,  
Kan., covered nine secretaries of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall ``knew the subject matter of this department as well as  
anybody who worked here,'' said Bob Bergland, who was President 
Carter's agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his retirement, Kendall's byline file in the AP  
library covered 800 index cards, including some 7,000 farm columns. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hutchinson News, Kendall covered farm news, politics and  
the state Legislature. One of his assignments was to cover the 
Clutter murder trial in western Kansas, which later became the 
subject of Truman Capote's book ``In Cold Blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Kendall won the J.S. Russell Memorial Award, the top  
award of the Newspaper Farm Editors of America. He later was 
president of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Lou, survivors include a son, three  
daughters and six grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Women's AP Poll Ranks Colo. St. 5th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coach Tom Collen knew he had a dynamite women's basketball team  
in the works at Colorado State. Did he know it would become the No. 
5 team in the nation? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our team was vastly underrated at the beginning of the  
year,'' Collen said. ``But I can't sit here and pretend that I 
thought at the beginning of the year we were the fifth-best team in 
the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that's where the Rams sat in The Associated Press women's  
poll Monday, No. 5 in a top six that was unchanged from last week. 
Tennessee remained the overwhelming choice for No. 1 and was 
followed by Purdue, Louisiana Tech, Connecticut, Colorado State and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	That's heady company for a school that had never been ranked  
before this season. The Rams made their debut in the third poll of 
the year, breaking in at No. 16 after winning the preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	They beat Oregon, Florida and Rutgers in that tournament -- all  
of whom have been or still are in the Top 25. At 24-1, Colorado 
State has the best record in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Its loss was by five points at California, a game the Rams  
played without starting center Shannon Randles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this collection of young ladies has been a Top 25 team  
probably the last four years, but no one bothered to notice,'' said 
Collen, who's in his second season at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm most happy for them,'' he said. ``I came into this last  
year, so I inherited them. It didn't take me long last year to 
realize they were a Top 25-type team. I watched them on tape, but 
they were even better in person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are led by guard Becky Hammon, a 5-foot-8 senior who  
averages 20.5 points and shoots 50 percent from the field, 86 
percent from the free-throw line and 39 percent from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	With Colorado State getting little exposure outside the Rocky  
Mountain region, Collen agreed with the notion that Hammon might be 
the best player in the country that no one sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she could play and start for any team in the  
country,'' he said. ``I know people at UConn, Tennessee or 
Louisiana Tech would sit back and say, `How can you say that?' But 
I know if Becky Hammon was with them four years, she'd be starting 
at point guard right now, I really believe that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the No. 1 spot for the fifth straight week,  
receiving 41 of 42 first-place votes and 1,049 points from a 
national media panel. The Lady Vols (22-1) routed Mississippi and 
Mississippi State last week before holding on for a 66-60 victory 
at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (21-1) received the other first-place vote and had 1,004  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	After the top six, everyone moved.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which has won 15 straight and 19 of 20, climbed two places  
to seventh, while Old Dominion was eighth, Rutgers ninth and 
Georgia 10th. Old Dominion and Rutgers both climbed three places. 
Georgia fell two spots after losing to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech advanced three spots to No. 11 to match its  
highest ranking of the season. Then it was UCLA, Texas Tech, North 
Carolina and Penn State, followed by Iowa State, Auburn, Virginia, 
Clemson and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Florida International and  
Alabama held the final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon returned to the Top 25 after making a one-week appearance  
in mid-January. The Ducks got in on the strength of a 106-79 
victory over UCLA, which fell five places to 12th for the biggest 
drop within the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College, which had been 20th, dropped out after losing to  
Notre Dame and Rutgers.

<HEADLINE>  `Shakespeare,' `Ryan' Lead Oscars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Attesting to Hollywood's  
fascination with World War II, three movies set against the war -- 
``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is 
Beautiful'' -- were nominated Tuesday for best-picture Oscars and 
will go up against two Elizabethan-era tales, ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' and ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a tribute to the veterans,'' Steven Spielberg  
said of the 11 nominations for his brutally realistic ``Private 
Ryan.'' ``It's important that before this century is out ample 
recognition is paid to the veterans who saved the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight movies dealing with the war have won the Academy  
Award for best picture, including Spielberg's own ``Schindler's 
List'' in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' a rollicking romance about the Bard  
seeking his muse, emerged with a leading 13 nominations, one shy of 
the record 14 for ``Titanic'' last year and ``All About Eve'' in 
1950. ``Elizabeth,'' about the intrigues behind the throne, tied 
with ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' with seven 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	The most wins for a movie is 11, a record shared by 1959's  
``Ben-Hur'' and last year's ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars will be presented March 21 on ABC, with Whoopi  
Goldberg back for a third time as host. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominations offered the usual snubs and inconsistencies.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Truman Show'' picked up nominations for director Peter  
Weir and screenwriter Andrew Niccol, but missed out on best 
picture. The star, Jim Carrey, also wasn't nominated. ``Elizabeth'' 
got best picture, but director Shekhar Kapur was overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly the nominations spoke to Hollywood's -- and America's  
-- interest in World War II, with three of the five best picture 
nominees set during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the nominated war pictures bore the stamp of the  
directors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Spielberg, who as one of Hollywood's most powerful filmmakers,  
had the resources to create what many called the most realistic 
depiction of battle ever filmed, 30 minutes of bloody, noisy, 
confusing and arbitrary hell on the beaches of Normandy. Its 
nominations included honors for director Spielberg, star Tom Hanks 
and Robert Rodat for original screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrence Malick, in a triumphant return to Hollywood after a  
two-decade absence (his previous film was ``Days of Heaven'' in 
1978), created in ``The Thin Red Line'' a lyrical movie that 
alternated brutal war scenes with stunning nature shots. Malick's 
direction and adapted screenplay were nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roberto Benigni, who is a big star in Italy but not very well  
known in the United States, combined low comedy with tragic 
circumstances in ``Life Is Beautiful'' to tell the story of a 
father trying to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration 
camp. Benigni scored the rare feat of being nominated for lead 
actor, director and screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' also became the first film since 1969's  
``Z'' to be nominated for both best picture and best 
foreign-language film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Academy's interest in World War II was rivaled only by its  
facination with England's Queen Elizabeth, who reigned 400 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two actresses who played the monarch were nominated: Judi Dench,  
for a supporting role in ``Shakespeare,'' and Cate Blanchett, for a 
leading role in ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare'' also brought nominations to director John  
Madden, star Gwyneth Paltrow, supporting actor Geoffrey Rush and 
screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn and Wheat Sink / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices sank to their lowest  
in nearly 12 years Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations 
a new report will provide more unwelcome news about slack demand and 
growing supply. Grains also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Thanks to a bumper fall crop and dismal export demand, the  
report early Wednesday from the U.S. Agriculture Department is expected 
to forecast an even higher estimate for the amount of soybeans that 
will be left over before the next harvest. 
</P>
<P>
        Last month, the government said the surplus likely would stand  
at 390 million bushels. Market participants now expect that figure 
to rise well above 400 million bushels as foreign countries continue 
to lack adequate funds for purchases. 
</P>
<P>
        Further depressing soybeans prices has been ideal growing conditions  
in Brazil, the world's second-largest producer behind the United States. 
</P>
<P>
        Investors also noted there is concern that American farmers  
this spring will devote more acres to soybeans because the price differential 
from corn and other crops still favors growing beans. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures were pressured by reports of more good weather  
in the growing regions of Argentina and the weakness in the soybean 
market. The losses were limited, however, by expectations that the 
USDA will lower its ending inventory estimates thanks to unexpectedly 
strong export demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures retreated amid predictions U.S. inventories will  
continue to grow in the face of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans for March delivery fell 9 cents to $4.99 a bushel;  
March wheat fell 2 cents to $2.64 1/2 a bushel; March corn fell 1 1/4 
cents to $2.16 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.06 1/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Meat and livestock futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange in profit-taking following sharp rallies in previous 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle fell 0.35 cent to 67.42 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 0.45 cent to 74.42 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .68 cent to 47.57 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell the limit 
3 cents to 57.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen  
Tuesday, undercut by falling U.S. stocks. The late drop reversed 
early gains as speculation grew that Japan's central bank would 
halt a rise in interest rates that recently strengthened the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the euro as investors continued to  
expect interest rate cuts in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.39  
Japanese yen, down from 114.43 late Monday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1293, down from $1.1318. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors found little to cheer as the Dow Jones industrial  
average sank 158 points to drop below where it began this year, 
despite fresh evidence of a strong U.S. economy that already has 
posted the longest peacetime expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported a surge in productivity during the  
last three months of 1998, a performance that points to 
improvements in living standards and corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just incredible how strong the productivity numbers are  
at this advanced stage of the business cycle,'' said Douglas 
Porter, a senior economist at the Bank of Montreal's Toronto 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investors ignored those numbers as stocks sank amid a  
steep retreat in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	As money came out of U.S. stocks, the dollar lost support from  
its earlier advance. 
</P>
<P>
	During trading in Asia, before U.S. markets opened, investors  
bought dollars and sold yen as Japanese officials lined up behind a 
stronger dollar, particularly the Finance Ministry's influential 
vice minister for international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his ability to move foreign  
exchange markets, said Monday that an excessively strong yen is 
undesirable and not good for Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that  
Japan's central bank was in charge of monetary policy, which was 
interpreted to mean that central bankers and finance officials were 
working on a joint action to control interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese government bond yields fell Tuesday. Falling interest  
rates in Japan make returns less attractive on yen-denominated 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4211 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4151, and 1.4962 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4811. The British 
pound fell to $1.6364 from $1.6399. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7319 German 
marks, up from 1.7280; 5.8072 French francs, up from 5.7971; and 
1,715.27 Italian lire, up from 1,709.40.

<HEADLINE> Oil-Coated Birds Reported in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Pounding surf has breached fuel tanks on a  
cargo ship that ran aground last week, putting a scenic stretch of 
Oregon coast in danger of being tainted by thousands of gallons of 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil-covered birds were spotted Monday, the first since the fuel  
began leaking from the 639-foot New Carissa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, owned by a Japanese firm, registered in Panama and  
staffed with a crew of 23, ran aground Thursday about 150 yards 
offshore in a prime crab-fishing area. The crew was removed by the 
Coast Guard the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	It has not been determined why the ship washed ashore, though  
local pilots have speculated it had insufficient power to overcome 
strong winds and currents as it waited to enter Coos Bay to pick up 
a cargo of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has closed beaches in the area around Coos Bay,  
215 miles southwest of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also have mustered more than 200 workers to shovel  
up congealed bunker fuel that has washed ashore as far as five 
miles north of where the ship is mired in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard inspection team boarded the ship Monday looking  
for the source of the leak, which apparently is coming from some of 
the ship's five fuel tanks, which hold 359,000 gallons of bunker 
fuel and 37,400 gallons of diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found water inside the tanks, which means there is a  
significant leak,'' said Chief Petty Officer Gene Maestes said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have already recovered at least three oil-covered  
birds. Crews equipped to deal with oiled wildlife were standing by 
in case the slick threatens the habitat of Western snowy plovers, a 
threatened shore bird.

	But mostly the nominations spoke to Hollywood's -- and America's  
-- interest in World War II, with three of the five best picture 
nominees set during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the nominated war pictures bore the stamp of the  
directors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Spielberg, who as one of Hollywood's most powerful filmmakers,  
had the resources to create what many called the most realistic 
depiction of battle ever filmed, 30 minutes of bloody, noisy, 
confusing and arbitrary hell on the beaches of Normandy. Its 
nominations included honors for director Spielberg, star Tom Hanks 
and Robert Rodat for original screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrence Malick, in a triumphant return to Hollywood after a  
two-decade absence (his previous film was ``Days of Heaven'' in 
1978), created in ``The Thin Red Line'' a lyrical movie that 
alternated brutal war scenes with stunning nature shots. Malick's 
direction and adapted screenplay were nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roberto Benigni, who is a big star in Italy but not very well  
known in the United States, combined low comedy with tragic 
circumstances in ``Life Is Beautiful'' to tell the story of a 
father trying to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration 
camp. Benigni scored the rare feat of being nominated for lead 
actor, director and screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' also became the first film since 1969's  
``Z'' to be nominated for both best picture and best 
foreign-language film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really thunderstruck,'' Benigni said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Academy's interest in World War II was rivaled only by its  
facination with England's Queen Elizabeth, who reigned 400 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two actresses who played the monarch were nominated: Judi Dench,  
for a supporting role in ``Shakespeare,'' and Cate Blanchett, for a 
leading role in ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare'' also brought nominations to director John  
Madden, star Gwyneth Paltrow, supporting actor Geoffrey Rush and 
screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Nomination Helps Iran Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Although Iranian films have won awards at  
international festivals for years, Tuesday's Oscar nomination for 
``Children of Heaven' is a first for a movie from the Islamic 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strict government rules for filmmakers, Iranian films  
have won praise for their frank portrayal of social issues in 
Iran's restrictive society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children of Heaven,'' directed by Majid Majidi, is the story  
of a 9-year-old boy named Ali who loses his sister's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	His family is too poor to buy new shoes for his 7-year-old  
sister, so the siblings must share Ali's shoes. The sister, Zahra, 
wears the shoes to school each morning, and Ali wears them in the 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali enters a running contest in hopes of winning third prize -- a  
pair of running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other nominees for best foreign language film were ``Central  
Station'' from Brazil, ``The Grandfather'' from Spain, ``Tango'' 
from Argentina and ``Life Is Beautiful'' from Italy.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Farmers Processing Their Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- Faced with an oversupply at large  
slaughterhouses that kept them struggling to stay in business, hog 
farmers Mike and Terry Strickland decided to take matters into 
their own hands: they began processing their own meat for sale to 
area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, who farm near this west Georgia town, grow about  
6,000 of the state's annual marketable hogs on their 500-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Stricklands continue to produce hogs to be sold for  
processing, they are supplementing their business by going 
door-to-door selling hogs they processed, inspected and readied for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Williams, owner of Pine Mountain's Supervalu grocery,  
responded to their local sales pitch and sells their pork products 
in the town of 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	So did McGuire's Family Restaurant, which boasts of serving pork  
chops, ribs and ham that are truly home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Georgia's hog farmers marketed a million head of hogs  
for $134 million in gross receipts compared with $222 million in 
1987. Ten years ago, the state had 4,000 hog farmers. Now there are 
400. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have too many hogs going to market. A lot of producers  
are going out of business now,'' said Rogers Bernard, executive 
vice president of the Georgia Pork Producers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stricklands are also diversifying by selling mulch, hay and  
wheat to help pay for their feed bill that averages $7,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the brothers are uncertain they will be able to remain in  
the pork-producing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last six months, we've borrowed over $100,000 just to  
stay in business,'' said Mike, 35, the younger of the two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stricklands' breeder herd of 300 hogs is the average size of  
most of the state's hog farms. The largest hog farm operation in 
the state belongs to Goldkist with its combination of farms 
totaling 20,000 breeder hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	While too few slaughtering plants are a major reason, a decline  
in exports to foreign markets has helped to push the supply of hogs 
past demand. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the selling price hit an all-time low of 8 cents  
per 100 pounds of pork sold last year, the lowest since the Great 
Depression. That compares with 47 cents in previous years. The 
current market rate is 27 cents to 30 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Board of Natural Resources added to state hog farmers'  
woes recently with a ban on new permits for hog farm operations 
exceeding 2,500 hogs until rules are established for waste 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to ride it out,'' said hog farmer Chuck Walls of  
Gainesville who has a 700-hog farm near Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost somewhere around $150,000 last year, and it will  
take us about a year and a half to get it back. If our feed 
suppliers had not been good enough to stay with us, we probably 
would be out of business,'' Walls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, a proposal to build a $100 million packing plant  
between Macon and Savannah was put on hold by the packer, said Fred 
Sandrock, head of the Sunbelt Pork Cooperative of producers from 
Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said a Georgia  
slaughterhouse is what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've asked state legislators to look into the possibility of  
getting an authority established that could back a bond issue to 
build a plant here,'' Irvin said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Monk Executed for Double Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- A onetime Buddhist monk who touched  
many with his humble remorse and vivid art produced on death row, 
was executed by injection today for killing two people during a 
1981 robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaturun Siripongs, 43, made no last statement.  
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of killing manager Packovan Wattanaporn and  
clerk Quach Nguyen at a market where he occasionally worked. He was 
caught trying to use Mrs. Wattanaporn's credit card and most of her 
stolen jewelry was traced to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs admitted taking part in the robbery, but claimed an  
accomplice he never named committed the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs did accept responsibility for his role in the crime,  
his lawyers said, offering daily penance ``for his deeds, for the 
shame he has brought his family and ancestors, and for the 
suffering he has brought to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guards described him as unfailingly polite and cooperative and  
former prison Warden Daniel Vasquez, a strong supporter of the 
death penalty, recommended clemency on the grounds that rewarding 
Siripongs' behavior would set a good example for other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, whose U.S. visit prompted the governor of  
Missouri to spare a prisoner last month, joined the pleas for 
clemency hours before the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs also had drawn praise for his art, with supporters  
recently displaying a varied collection in Oakland. An 
autobiographical sketch done in pencil and called 
``Transformation,'' showed a young boy in big square glasses, a 
religious figure among lotus blossoms, a muscular man and, finally, 
a skull. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand had made appeals for clemency to Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright, President Clinton and California Gov. Gray 
Davis, but called the case ``an internal affair'' of the United 
States. Thailand has the death penalty and carries out executions 
by machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said it was time Siripongs was punished.  
</P>
<P>
	``Siripongs has been privileged to live over 16 years since his  
conviction and sentence,'' Orange County prosecutor Jim Tanizaki 
wrote in a response to the clemency petition. ``These are 16 years 
that Quach Nguyen and Pat Wattanaporn, and their respective 
families, have been denied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs, who was born in Thailand, had survived a rough  
childhood, his lawyers said, living for a while without running 
water and electricity in a rat-infested compound. 
</P>
<P>
	His first brush with trouble came in 1975, when he was shot in  
the head while robbing a department store. He was imprisoned but 
was released early for good behavior, going on to train briefly as 
a Buddhist monk. 
</P>
<P>
	He soon left the monastery, getting a job as a cook on a cargo  
ship where he met an acquaintance who proposed a drug-smuggling 
scheme. Instead, Siripongs went to U.S. authorities, participating 
in a sting operation that netted him enough money to buy passage to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A prison spokesman said Siripongs had hoped for a reprieve, but  
failing that, believed he would be reincarnated.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Unveil Championship Banner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael, Scottie and Dennis were all there  
Tuesday night. Not in person, of course, but on videotape as the 
Chicago Bulls briefly celebrated the past by unveiling a sixth NBA 
championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, now in retirement, Pippen, now in Houston, and Rodman,  
still in limbo, were featured prominently in a video tribute on the 
huge scoreboard hanging over the floor of the United Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by Carole King's ``Now and Forever'' and Green Day's  
``Time Of My Life,'' the video closed with Jordan sinking his 
game-winning jumper against Utah last June just before he and 
Pippen embraced for what would be the final time as Bulls 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's jumper brought a loud response from a sellout crowd at  
the United Center, followed moments later by awkward applause as 
the banner was uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls in the video hardly resembled the ones that took the  
floor minutes later, a collection of free agents, rookies and 
assorted veterans. With the team gutted following Jordan's 
retirement, it will be a long time before another championship team 
calls Chicago home. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no ring ceremony, as is usually the custom at the home  
opener the following season, and no chance for the fans to boo 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan got his ring at his retirement news conference and  
holdovers from last year's team, like Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper, 
got theirs before a practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls say they will also deliver, either in Chicago or at  
their new locale, championship rings to Pippen and players like 
Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler and Luc Longley, who played on the last 
three title teams before joining other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	New coach Tim Floyd, who replaced the popular Phil Jackson,  
watched the ceremony from a seat at the end of the bench. When he 
was introduced before the game, firecrackers were going off and 
there was little reaction from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked before the game what type of reception he expected, Floyd  
said: ``I'm not worried about it. I haven't thought about it. I'm 
worried about coaching this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd had been booed at a pre-season scrimmage at the United  
Center. But that was before the Bulls lost two close exhibition 
games and were 1-1 on their first road trip of this 
lockout-shortened season, playing a surprisingly strong game at 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure who we are and we really shouldn't be,'' said  
Floyd, whose family flew in from Iowa for the game. ``We've only 
had four looks (games.)'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of reminders of Jordan and Pippen.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's uniform No. 23, unveiled at his retirement news  
conference, hung behind the sixth championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Life-size cutouts of last year's championship team were still in  
the concourse of the United Center, as were replica lockers for 
both Pippen and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens, victimized by Jordan so many times  
when he coached in Cleveland, added himself to the list of those 
who will miss the superstar. But he warned that his team wouldn't 
overlook these watered-down Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not worried about who's here and who's not. They're  
professional players,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Service Merchandise To Close Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Service Merchandise will close 134 of  
its 347 stores over the next four months as the jewelry and home 
products retailer attempts to revitalize its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from inventory sales at the stores being closed will be  
used to reduce debt, interim chief executive Bettina M. Whyte said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action is an important step in the company's out-of-court  
restructuring,'' said Whyte, a turnaround specialist who joined 
Service Merchandise last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``These sales will ... allow the company to refocus its energies  
on its remaining 213 stores and on refining its niche in fine 
jewelry, gifts and home products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise operates stores in 34 states and has roughly  
25,000 employees. Spokesman Greg Winnett said a list of the stores 
being closed will be released ``shortly.'' He declined to estimate 
how many employees would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Service Merchandise, which was founded in 1934 and opened its  
first catalog showroom in 1960, flourished into the 1980s. The 
company has been hurt by competition from discount chains like 
Wal-Mart and Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 Service Merchandise stores have closed since 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Whyte was brought in after the company missed a $13.5 million  
interest payment on its bonds in December. The company obtained a 
commitment for $750 million in financing from Citibank last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Whyte replaced Gary M. Witkin, who joined Service Merchandise in  
1994 and became CEO in April 1997. Despite his efforts to turn 
around the company -- he got rid of its catalog and 
clipboard-ordering system, brought in new products and cut overhead 
-- sales have continued to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are probably going to have a great deal of trouble  
overcoming the store image that is connected to their name -- the 
showroom format,'' said analyst Gary Wright of the Denver-based 
retail consulting firm G.A. Wright, Inc. ``That's a format that has 
generally been considered outdated for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Kurt Barnard said the outlook for Service Merchandise is  
``dim, at best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have no clear idea of what it is and what it tries  
to do,'' said Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report 
in Upper Montclair, N.J. '' ... If you want a toaster, for example, 
the first company you think of is Wal-Mart or Kmart.''

<HEADLINE> Details of Report on Salt Lake Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key details of Tuesday's ethics panel report into improprieties  
by Salt Lake bid committee in securing the 2002 Winter Olympics: 

</P>
<P>
                 	 *KEY COMMITTEE OFFICIALS INVOLVED   	

</P>
<P>
	-- Salt Lake bid committee president Tom Welch and vice president  
David Johnson took the brunt of the blame for ethical violations in 
secretly giving cash, travel, scholarships and other gifts to 
members of the International Olympic Committee and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	-- To a lesser extent, former administrative officer Craig  
Peterson also was involved in the improper spending. 

</P>
<P>
                        	 *USOC INVOLVEMENT   	

</P>
<P>
	-- The report tied the U.S. Olympic Committee to the scandal  
through a series of November 1995 exchanges among three senior 
staffers referring to an agreement to help train athletes from the 
Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake's campaign. ``A lot 
of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo La Mont, who 
at the time was the USOC's director for international relations. 

</P>
<P>
                    	 *NEW IOC MEMBERS IMPLICATED   	

</P>
<P>
	-- Ten more IOC members not previously implicated in the scandal  
were mentioned in the report. That brings the number of those 
implicated to 24 -- roughly one-fifth of the IOC's total membership. 
The 10 new members implicated are: 

</P>
<P>
	--MAJ. GEN. HENRY EDMUND OLUFEMI ADEFOPE, Nigeria: The U.S.  
Olympic Committee volunteered through the Salt Lake bid committee 
to pay travel costs of Adefope's wife to accompany him to a meeting 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	--PHILLIP COLES, Australia, and  
</P>
<P>
	--WILLI KALTSCHMITT, Guatemala: The families of Coles and  
Kaltschmitt made four visits to the United States, including a trip 
to the Super Bowl, thrown by Welch at a total cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	--ASHWINI KUMAR, India: The bid committee paid $5,099 for an  
unidentified relative of Kumar's to travel to the IOC meeting in 
Budapest in 1995, when Salt Lake was awarded the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--SHAGDARJAV MAGVAN, Mongolia: The bid committee paid $762 for  
his son, Bold, to attend classes at the University of Utah. The son 
also had a year-long internship at First Security Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	--ANANI MATTHIA, Togo: The bid committee paid $2,891 for  
Matthia's wife to travel to the IOC meeting in Budapest in 1995, 
when Salt Lake was awarded the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--RAMPAUL RUHEE, Mauritius: The bid committee paid $3,459 for  
Ruhee's wife to travel to the IOC meeting in Budapest in 1995, when 
Salt Lake was awarded the games. 
</P>
<P>
	--AUSTIN SEALY, Barbados: Bid committee records show $3,000 per  
month passing through a company affiliated with a consultant to 
Sealy. 
</P>
<P>
	--SIULI PAUL WALLWORK, Western Samoa: Welch transferred $30,000  
from his children's trust account to Wallwork's wife, who sought 
the money for a friend in a ``serious situation.'' Welch said the 
money had been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	--MOHAMED ZERGUINI, Algeria: Zerguini's grandson was given  
$14,500 in cash at the suggestion of Toronto consultant Mahmoud El 
Farnawani. 

</P>
<P>
                     	 *PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS   	

</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC should put forth and enforce rules governing  
interactions between bid cities and IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC should require bid cities to file periodic reports  
detailing all expenditures on behalf of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee should prohibit bid  
cities from participating in assisting national Olympic committees 
or Olympic Solidarity programs during the bid process. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The USOC should put forth and enforce rules governing  
interactions between U.S. bid cities, the USOC and the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC should monitor the efforts of the IOC and the USOC to put  
forth rules governing interactions with IOC members, and should 
establish supplementary policies as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC should create an ombudsman so employees can communicate  
their concerns to the Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC should seek Board of Ethics review prior to making  
decisions that raise ethical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC's Executive Committee should conduct twice-annual reviews  
of all significant expenditures by SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SLOC should thoroughly review its policies so that appropriate  
direction is given to management and the Board of Trustees in 
conducting their business. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *INVESTIGATORS   	

</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel was made up of Gordon Hall, retired chief  
justice of the Utah Supreme Court; Barbara Lockhart, a former 
Olympic speedskater and a member of Brigham Young University's 
faculty; former U.S. Attorney David Jordan; Patricia Hanna, dean of 
humanities at the University of Utah; and Merrill Norman, a 
forensic auditor. 

</P>
<P>
                      	 *OTHER INVESTIGATIONS   	

</P>
<P>
	Besides the ethics panel inquiry, other bodies investigating the  
Salt Lake scandal: 
</P>
<P>
	-- IOC: Made a report public last month in which it found that  
$800,000 in cash payments, scholarships, medical care and travel 
expenses was paid to 14 IOC members. So far, nine have been 
expelled or have resigned; three remain under investigation; one 
member was warned; and one has died. Dick Pound, chairman of the 
panel, said it would review Salt Lake's investigation and ``take 
advantage'' of its work. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Investigating any violations of federal  
laws. Subpeonas have been issued through a federal grand jury in 
Salt Lake City, although it is not known if the panel has heard any 
evidence. There is no announced deadline on the investigation, and 
any action is expected to be several months away. 
</P>
<P>
	-- U.S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE: The USOC's ethics oversight board, led  
by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, is looking at 
bid-selection rules and operations, including selecting Salt Lake 
in 1989 to run for the 1998 Winter Games and then again for 2002. 
The inquiry is expected to be finished by Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	-- UTAH ATTORNEY GENERAL: Jan Graham, the state's attorney  
general, said her inquiry would begin after the SLOC and IOC 
reports were released. Graham said her office will examine any 
violations of state criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	-- GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE: Congress' investigative arm is  
moving ahead with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are 
benefiting from what is certain to be millions of dollars in 
federal aid. Bernie Ungar, GAO director of government business 
operations, met with committee staff Monday to plan the inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Misses Lipinski's Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tara Lipinski took her Olympic gold medal  
and skated away, leaving Michelle Kwan in a class by herself, no 
one to stop her from collecting all the titles she wants in the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So guess who's having post-Lipinski withdrawal?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great when the best skaters are out there. That  
is pure competition, that's what I love. So I do miss her,'' Kwan 
said Tuesday at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always like this,'' she said, holding up two fingers  
close together. ``It was great for us. Every time I would go on the 
ice, I would always go out there and say, `I need to work harder 
and harder because she is always there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Kwan has to find a way to motivate herself. Without  
Lipinski, who gave up her eligibility six weeks after the Olympics, 
there may be other skaters on the ice, but there's no competition. 
She arrived this week with a nine-event winning streak. She won her 
second world title and the world professional title since leaving 
Nagano, and barring a freak injury or sudden abduction by aliens, 
she's the overwhelming favorite to win her third U.S. title this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	And unless someone new comes along from the junior or novice  
ranks, that's not going to change over the next three years. Kwan 
and coach Frank Carroll are going to have to come up with new and 
creative ways to keep her interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michelle and I don't think of the nationals as an easy  
competition,'' Carroll said. ``We respect this title very well and 
we plan to go after it with a vengeance. We're not here for casual 
play. We mean to skate well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd really like her to do a bang-up job here to show how much  
she's improved,'' he added. ``I think she's really going to do it 
up right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there's always the obvious motivation of wanting to  
make up for her silver medal at Nagano. After going into the 
Olympics as the favorite, she had to be just devastated when 
Lipinski won the gold and she had to settle for the dreaded silver, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly.  
</P>
<P>
	For anyone who thinks Kwan's sticking around until 2002 just so  
she can exorcise some demons, Kwan's got one thing to say: Get a 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think if I could go back in time, I don't think I'd  
change anything,'' she said, her voice strong and sure. ``It helped 
me grow as a person and as an athlete. So I think it was good. It 
was meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I feel I'm stronger than ever. From the Nagano  
experience, it's helped me mentally and pushed me further.''

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo  
following comments by Japan's officials seen as supportive of the 
greenback. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.70 yen in late trading, up 1.20 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
114.43 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 114.25 yen to 
114.90 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 89.83 points,  
or 0.64 percent, to end at 13,902.66 points. On Monday, the average 
closed up 94.41 points, or 0.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground in Tokyo in line  
with an overnight trend in New York after Eisuke Sakakibara, vice 
minister for international affairs with Japan's Finance Ministry, 
said Monday an excessively strong yen is not good for Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks make yen buyers wary the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to stem the yen further appreciation against the U.S. 
currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said early Tuesday that it is  
up to the Bank of Japan to decide on monetary policy, a remark 
interpreted to mean that the government and the central bank could 
agree on some action to control interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Action by the Bank of Japan to cap rates would help boost the  
dollar because higher interest rates tend to favor the rise of that 
nation's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The view that easier monetary policy will be implemented in  
some form is leading to a weaker yen,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, 
senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was at 129.68 yen, up from 127.66 yen late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, many investors have already held back to  
see what steps the Bank of Japan may take on the recent rise in 
long-term interest rates at its Friday's policy-board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 6.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,083.65 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a  
low 306 million shares, although it was up from 261.2 million 
shares Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 782 to 336, 
while 151 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.010 percent from Monday's finish of 2.160 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.34 yen from 97.19 yen.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Mashburn Out for Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat forward Jamal Mashburn will be sidelined  
at least two weeks with a deep bruise in his left knee, the team 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury depletes a lineup already without guard Voshon  
Lenard, who has decided to undergo surgery to repair a stress 
fracture in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn appeared to be on the verge of a breakthrough season,  
leading the Heat with 42 points in their first two games. He hurt 
his leg Sunday, and an MRI Tuesday disclosed the deep bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing,'' coach Pat Riley said. ``It looked  
like he was headed for a big year. It sets him back. It sets us 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard's surgery later this week is expected to sidelined him  
for at least eight weeks in the 13-week season. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of the two starters leaves Miami without a third  
scoring threat to complement Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning. The 
lack of firepower could make it difficult for the defending 
Atlantic Division champions to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply have to fly by the seat of our pants for a while,''  
Riley said. ``We're going to have to win with great effort and 
great defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn hurt his leg in Sunday's victory against the New York  
Knicks, but he's not sure exactly when. The injury began to bother 
him after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	His knee was placed in a brace, and he'll be re-evaluated in two  
weeks -- which means he'll miss at least seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might not be our best player,'' Riley said. ``But he was  
our best player for the past three weeks.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Lean Against Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans expressed a willingness  
Tuesday to let President Clinton walk away from his impeachment 
ordeal with an acquittal, leaving judgment of his conduct to 
history rather than any Senate-approved rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of censuring Clinton -- either immediately following  
his trial or later -- has strong Republican opposition but remains 
on life support with backing of most Democrats and a handful of GOP 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But to have a such a measure considered in the 100-member  
Senate, supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected 
stalling action by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the leading 
opponent of a censure resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings on a censure are expected to become intense immediately  
after the Senate renders a verdict on the impeachment charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. With 67 votes needed for 
conviction and removal of the president, both parties agree that 
acquittal is virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, has been  
drafting and redrafting censure language with the help of 
Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah. They would not release 
their latest language, which likely would change again anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has threatened to offer innumerable amendments to any such  
resolution, an approach that could amount to a filibuster, 
requiring 60 votes to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Censure to Gramm is a ``covering your fanny approach'' -- letting  
those who want to acquit Clinton on impeachment still express 
disapproval of his behavior. Gramm has said it's not allowed by the 
Constitution and would set a dangerous precedent for the future 
concerning the separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of GOP senators Tuesday morning, worries that  
Democrats would use censure as political cover after acquittal was 
``raised by some of the Republicans,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, 
R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are aware of that thinking. Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,  
said he needs no political cover: ``I just had my election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he could support a censure  
resolution only ``if the language would refer'' to the perjury and 
obstruction language in the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not likely, since Democrats have expressed strong  
opposition to a declaration that Clinton committed impeachable 
offenses -- especially after the Senate fails to reach the 
two-thirds majority to convict the president and remove him from 
office. A censure resolution would only need a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the large procedural hurdles facing a censure  
resolution dim prospects for consideration immediately after the 
impeachment verdict, Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota 
has set in motion a possible procedural vote that could allow 
Democrats to express themselves. He also has talked of trying to 
attach censure language to legislation after senators return from 
next week's week-long recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said it would be extremely difficult to return to  
such an unpleasant subject as Clinton's conduct once the lawmakers 
are concentrating on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets more difficult to pass'' after the recess, said Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It becomes an exercise in futility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a member of the Democratic leadership, Sen. Robert  
Torricelli of New Jersey, said the censure issue is ``not time 
sensitive. I don't even think we should try (this week). We should 
do it when we return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, signed on to censure after winning  
support for language that would declare Clinton could not be 
treated differently than any other citizen after he leaves office 
and that no future Congress could override the censure. A censure 
of President Andrew Jackson in the 1860s was overturned by a 
subsequent Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell acknowledged that many  
in his party ``think it's a bad idea,'' but added: ``I'm open to a 
censure alternative. What you could end up with is having a 
bipartisan acquittal which can lead to a good deal of celebration 
downtown'' at the White House.

<HEADLINE>  Skater Allen Climbing Back to Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The hours of rehab turned into days, weeks  
and months for Damon Allen. There were the usual moments of doubt, 
which he wiped away with more hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Allen has a healthy knee and a realistic shot at a medal at  
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have ruined two of his last three seasons, just when  
Allen was progressing through the strong ranks of American men. 
Those ranks have thinned in this post-Olympic year, and Allen hopes 
he can hold off the next wave of quadruple-jumping kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty down having to take the year off,'' Allen said  
Tuesday, when nationals began with the compulsory ice dance. ``I'd 
done it two years before that with a stress fracture in my knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have learned a lot of lessons, that you've got to keep  
persevering, keep being determined to pull back to the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top spot seems reserved for Michael Weiss, the runner-up the  
last two years to Todd Eldredge. Everything else is wide open, and 
Allen believes a place on the U.S. team for next month's world 
championships in Helsinki, Finland, is attainable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was third in the Finlandia Trophy on the rink they'll use  
for worlds,'' he said. ``When I was there, I bought this set of 
glasses and I already have broken two. So I have to go back and 
finish the set back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even thinking about nationals or worlds was painful a year ago.  
Allen, in the midst of rehabilitation from surgery on his right 
knee, worked for the U.S. Figure Skating Association at the 
Philadelphia nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two guys who made it were really good, but nationals were  
tough for me,'' he said. ``Other than the top two, the others 
really weren't all that wonderful. I thought, `Oh, man, I could be 
on the podium, I could be third.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was trying to get healthy again. Allen needed nearly  
three months after surgery on Oct. 2, 1997 before he could perform 
before an audience, at a show in his native Rockford, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about eight weeks after the surgery, in December, that  
I got back on the ice in Colorado Springs,'' he said. ``That was 
just 10 minutes of steps on the ice, just stroking. It was like, 
`Thank God I'm back on.' It was very sweet to get my blades back on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go really slow and it is really hard for me. I always  
was, `Oh, it felt really good, I'll try one more thing.' They had 
to harness me pretty much, keep me on a very restrictive pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That meant no spins for the first two weeks back on ice, and no  
major footwork. It meant no testing jumps. For a top-level skater 
such as Allen, it meant taking baby steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really didn't come strongly back until April-May, a good  
six months of full recovery,'' he said. ``I had no coordination in 
the air, I kind of lost a lot of that, my quickness and snap in 
jumps and that took the most time in coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first double axel was a sweet reward: I can still do  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How much can he do this week?  
</P>
<P>
	``My main goal is to have a lot of wins through the week. Find  
the good in each practice session and enjoy the week. I won't have 
my mind set on the short program and the long program. A really 
good week would be great practices and stay focused on my job and 
have two strong programs. I am feeling very ready.''

<HEADLINE> Freed Convict Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- A man mistakenly freed from prison by a  
clerical error has pleaded guilty to a shooting and rape he 
committed while on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Testa, 23, was supposed to be serving a five-year sentence  
for an unrelated robbery when he attacked two employees inside a 
real estate office in October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	But Testa had been released from Hartford Correctional Center  
after a clerical error appeared on his paperwork, showing his 
sentence as five days rather than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Testa shot Alfred Malpa and then, at gunpoint, sexually  
assaulted a woman at the Farmington real estate office, prosecutors 
said. The next day, Testa and several friends went on a spending 
spree in New York City with the victims' credit cards, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Testa was arrested 61 days after his mistaken release, he  
was charged in the Farmington attack and an armed robbery at a 
Plainville pizza restaurant the same night. 
</P>
<P>
	Testa pleaded guilty Monday in Superior Court to seven felonies,  
including aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, assault and 
robbery. He pleaded under the Alford doctrine, in which a defendant 
does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state probably has 
enough evidence to obtain a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said that Testa will be sentenced to 22 years in  
prison on March 1.

                          *Thomas Banyacya    	
</P>
<P>
	ORAIB, Ariz. (AP) -- Thomas Banyacya, a Hopi selected by elders  
of his tribe to deliver a message of peace and spirituality to the 
world, died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Banyacya once addressed the United Nations, delivering in part a  
message stemming from ancient Hopi beliefs, sometimes called 
prophecies, that an assembly of world leaders devoted to settling 
disagreements without war would be established in the eastern 
United States. The United Nations was deemed to be that assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
	Banyacya was selected as one of four ``messengers'' by  
traditional Hopi elders in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The message he was to carry was one urging a return to  
traditional peaceful and spiritual beliefs held by the Hopi for 
centuries. The selection grew out of Hopi teachings predicting the 
possibility of momentous global events the elders deemed had begun 
to occur during the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	He traveled worldwide in his effort to relay the message.  
Banyacya's campaign is credited with having helped revive American 
Indian interests in their heritage, traditions, beliefs and 
languages.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Architect John Cordwell, whose Carl Sandburg  
Village urban renewal project helped revitalize Chicago's near 
North Side during the 1960s, died Thursday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force and was in  
a plane that was downed over German-occupied territory. He survived 
a German prisoner of war camp and participated in the failed Great 
Escape from a German stalag in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Cordwell moved to Chicago in 1950 and served from  
1952 to 1956 as a director of planning for the Chicago Plan 
Commission and became one of the city's most influential urban 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordwell championed the incorporation of public transit into the  
expressway projects of the 1950s. He insisted that a rapid transit 
line be built down the middle of what is now the Kennedy Expressway 
to connect downtown with O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordwell later formed his own architectural firm and was one of  
the designers of Carl Sandburg Village, a 2,600-unit middle-class 
urban renewal project that opened in 1963.

<P>
	ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Gwen Guthrie, a singer and songwriter who  
recorded several dance and R&AMP;B hits during the 1980s, died 
Wednesday of uterine cancer. She was 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guthrie got her break in the mid-1970s when she was hired as  
a background vocalist for Aretha Franklin and later worked with 
Roberta Flack and Luther Vandross. She became a popular recording 
session singer, performing on albums by Kenny Loggins and Steely 
Dan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest solo success came in 1986 with ``Ain't Nothin' Goin'  
on But the Rent.'' Words from that song -- ``no romance without 
finance'' -- became a popular catch-phrase. She was also among the 
first recording artists to raise money for the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Guthrie's self-titled debut album was released in 1982,  
featuring the song ``Should Have Been You,'' which helped establish 
her as one of the top club music performers of the period.

	HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) -- Ebba Hoffman, chairwoman of the  
office-supply maker Smead Manufacturing Co. since 1955, died of 
pneumonia Friday. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Under her leadership, the company grew from 350 employees and  
about $4 million in annual revenues in 1955 to about 2,500 
employees and $315 million in sales in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been ranked by business publications as among  
the nation's largest female-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hoffman took control of the company after her husband,  
Harold, died of a heart attack at age 55. She practiced a 
management style that focused on preventing and quickly correcting 
customer complaints.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- John Kolbe, a political columnist and reporter  
for two Phoenix newspapers for 26 years, died Monday of colon 
cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe, the dean of Arizona political writers, spent most of his  
career with The Phoenix Gazette, an afternoon newspaper that shut 
down in 1997. He then joined the Gazette's sister, The Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe's columns generally reflected his strongly held  
conservative beliefs. His brother, Jim Kolbe, is a Republican 
congressman from Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe began his journalism career as a reporter and editor for  
newspapers in Rockford, Ill., then joined the gubernatorial

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Iris Murdoch, whose macabre yet comic  
sensibility made her one of Britain's most admired modern 
novelists, died Monday at Vale House in Oxford. She was 79 and had 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Philosophical speculation, religion, magic and metaphysics run  
through many of Ms. Murdoch's 26 novels. One of her most famous -- 
``A Severed Head,'' published in 1961 -- was a black farce about 
infidelity, incest and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning to teach at Oxford, she spent a year at  
Cambridge studying with disciples of the Austrian philosopher 
Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book was nonfiction -- ``Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''  
in 1953 -- and she wrote on philosophy throughout her career. 
``Existentialists and Mystics,'' a collection of her essays and 
articles, was published in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murdoch's first published novel was ``Under the Net'' in  
1954, and it won immediate praise. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most admired novels was 1973's ``The Black Prince,''  
about a middle-aged would-be writer and his professional rival's 
young daughter. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, ``The Sea, The Sea,'' about a retired film director  
trying to win back his first love, won the Booker Prize, widely 
considered Britain's highest literary honor. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, the equivalent of a knighthood for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, John Bayley, an academic, critic and writer,  
documented her life and the progression of her disease in ``Elegy 
for Iris,'' published last year.

man in Hawaii, died Friday at the age of 112. 
</P>
<P>
	Questas was born Aug. 6, 1886, on the island of Luzon in the  
Philippines. At the time, Grover Cleveland was in the White House 
and King David Kalakaua ruled Hawaii from Iolani Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Questas came to Hawaii after being promised free rent, free  
water and $20 a month in plantation wages. He was a veteran of both 
world wars who lived alone in a plantation shack for a half 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Questas moved to housing for the elderly in Lahaina,  
but left soon after because the other residents were ``too old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Ballard, owner of Ballard Family Mortuary, said Questas was

apartheid opponent who spent 12 years in prison and lost his wife 
and daughter to a police letter bomb, died Sunday of lung cancer. 
He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoon returned to the public eye late last year when the  
ex-police agent who arranged the slayings of his family applied for 
amnesty and Schoon attended the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoon was among a handful of white South Africans who sought to  
tear down a system that assured them privileged positions, and who 
paid a heavy price for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoon, a schoolteacher, was jailed from 1964 to 1976 for  
planting a bomb at a police station. No one was hurt in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Williamson admitted arranging the letter bomb that killed  
Jeanette Schoon, 39, and the couple's 6-year-old daughter Katryn in 
1984. The couple were in Angola teaching at the time. Schoon and 
his son Fritz were not home when the letter bomb arrived.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Armand Schwerner, a poet whose work inspired  
numerous dances and theatrical presentations, died of cancer Feb. 
4. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwerner published about a dozen volumes of poetry. Two works  
will be published this fall -- ``Selected Shorter Poems'' and ``The 
Tablets,'' the complete edition of a work he developed in 27 
sections over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances of Schwerner's nonlinear poetry and recordings of  
his enthusiastic readings attracted big audiences. Schwerner could 
read in numerous voices and was a master of rhythm. In the 1980s, 
the Living Theater presented versions of his ``Tablets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwerner taught English at Long Island University in the 1960s

</P>
<P>
	Troup penned a little ditty in 1946 as he drove across the  
country to California, where he had dreams of making it big in 
music. He chose Route 66, as his song says: ``If you ever plan to 
motor West: Travel my way, the highway that's the best. Get your 
kicks on Route 66!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Route 66,'' Troup also wrote and performed ``Daddy,''  
``The Girl Can't Help It,'' ``Meaning of the Blues,'' ``Baby, All 
the Time,'' and ``Lemon Twist.'' He also wrote songs for Tommy 
Dorsey and played Dorsey in the movie, ``The Gene Krupa Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He landed a role on the 1970s drama ``Emergency'' as Dr. Joe  
Early, a neurosurgeon who was often left in charge of younger 
patients. Troup also was host of ``Stars of Jazz'' in the late 
1950s and had a minor role in the movie ``MASH.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Wins Cummings Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox, using a pair of Harvard  
professors to present their position, on Tuesday won their salary 
arbitration case with outfielder Midre Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings, 27, had asked for a raise from $250,000 to $725,000.  
Instead, he will be paid Boston's proposal of $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was argued Monday in Tampa, Fla., before a three-person  
panel comprised of professional arbitrators Elizabeth Neumeier, Gil 
Vernon and Anthony Sinicropi. Neumeier was the first woman ever to 
handle an arbitration case. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners lead players 2-0 in arbitration decisions this year.  
Earlier in the day, Montreal won its case against third baseman 
Shane Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings hit .283 last year with five homers and 15 RBIs in 120  
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each side made its best presentation,'' Red Sox spokesman  
Kevin Shea said. ``The club had decided on the salary it thought 
was a fair price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings' agent, Craig Fenech, said he was unhappy about the  
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we were very disappointed because we thought we'd  
put together a winning argument,'' Fenech said. ``You just don't 
know why the arbitrators make their decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher John Wasdin, the only other Boston left in arbitration,  
is scheduled to have his hearing Feb. 16.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Agree To Resume Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots union  
agreed to resume negotiations today over how quickly the company 
can integrate pilots from recently purchased Reno Air onto its 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said the company had been contacted by the  
Allied Pilots Association and the parties will begin talks later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The December purchase of Reno Air by American Airlines' parent,  
AMR Corp., has resulted in disgruntled unions representing pilots 
at both carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' pilots have been bickering with AMR, saying  
the company should more quickly add Reno pilots to its roster, 
thereby moving people up on the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno pilots, on the other hand, have their own gripes. They are  
particularly unhappy that American pilots plan to ``staple'' them 
onto the bottom of the seniority list, leaving them with fewer 
scheduling choices. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reno pilots have had no input into negotiations, American  
pilots have made the airline feel their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 flights have been canceled since talks bogged  
down between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association late 
last Friday. Nearly one-third of all of American's 2,250 flights 
were expected to be canceled today, with Miami and New York the 
hardest-hit regions. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR chief executive Donald Carty said at a news conference  
Monday that the airline is considering asking a court for an 
injunction against the pilots' job action, but a decision has not 
yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	APA is urging its members to consider whether emotions from the  
bickering would affect their ability to safely pilot a jet -- 
apparently prompting the unusually large number of cockpit crew 
members who say they are ``unfit to fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have said is we want you to use common sense and your  
best judgment,'' said Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied 
Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, a number of American pilots have refused to take  
on extra flights. While American pilots are barred by federal law 
from striking over the issue, they are allowed to refuse overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	While APA says it wants the airline to immediately upgrade the  
lower-paid Reno pilots to American's pay scales, the union that 
represents Reno Air pilots, the Air Line Pilots Association, 
opposes plans that would cause its members to lose seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been shut out of these talks and have been permitted  
no input whatsoever,'' said Reno pilots spokesman Bob Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said that Reno pilots are left with little recourse and  
are considering a lawsuit of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to do whatever it takes. All we're asking for  
is fair and equitable treatment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said he believes the disagreement between American pilots  
and the company is not truly about the Reno acquisition, but rather 
trying to get language into the contract to set precedent for any 
future deals the airline may make. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots say they see this issue as one of job security.  
They do not want to allow American to buy smaller airlines and use 
those lower-paid pilots in place of American crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The current stalemate is the latest in a series of disputes  
between the company and the pilots, who staged a brief strike over 
their contract two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, more than 450 flights were canceled as pilots  
refused to work overtime to protest a passenger-sharing deal with 
Canadian Airlines Corp. And more than 1,000 flights were canceled 
during a dispute eight years ago in which American sought a court 
injunction against the pilots, whom the airline accused of staging 
an illegal sick-out.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Co-Chief Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don Hodel, a former Reagan administration  
Cabinet secretary who helped run the Christian Coalition on a 
volunteer basis, has left the political powerhouse to spend more 
time with his business interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time to move on,'' Hodel said in a telephone interview  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure leaves former Rep. Randy Tate, R-Wash., in charge  
of day-to-day operations. Founder Pat Robertson, a religious 
broadcaster, will remain as senior adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel and Tate joined the Christian Coalition in 1997, replacing  
strategist Ralph Reed, who helped Robertson build the grass-roots 
organization into a national force. The pair worked to revive a 
sagging donation base and deal with an Internal Revenue Service 
investigation into the group's tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel, 63, served as interior secretary and energy secretary  
under President Reagan. He took no pay for his work at the 
Christian Coalition, and paid his own expenses, Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came to the realization that if I wasn't going the  
duration, and if I wasn't going to be there in 2000, that I should 
leave before it gets too close to the election,'' Hodel said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he joined the coalition to help provide a smooth  
transition from Reed's tenure. ``I realized that I was in a 
maintenance mode rather than a transition mode,'' he said. ``I have 
other things to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel said he is getting caught up on his personal and business  
affairs. He is an energy and natural resources consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was away from home for 16 days over Christmas. I think that  
woke me up to what I was getting into,'' he said. ``I had gone past 
the consulting role, past the interim role, and was beginning to 
settle in and that's a real difficult thing for me to do at this 
stage of my career.''

<HEADLINE> SmithKline To Sell Pharmacy Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham on Tuesday became the second  
drug company in three months to jettison its pharmacy benefits 
business, a move consumer advocates said eliminates a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to refocus on its core drug business and raise cash to  
increase research spending, SmithKline agreed to sell Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services to Express Scripts for $700 million. That's 
just a third of what SmithKline paid to acquire Diversified in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 115 million Americans are enrolled in prescription  
drug plans administered by pharmacy benefit managers. Those 
companies decide what medicines insurance plans will pay for -- 
compiling lists called formularies -- and encourage doctors to 
prescribe only those drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurers consider formularies a valuable weapon in  
controlling costs, but consumer groups worry about the dangers in 
limiting which brands patients can use. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates compain that when a drugmaker owns a drug  
benefits company, the benefits manager tends to promote drugs made 
by its parent company -- regardless of whether competing drugs are 
better or less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously takes away of conflict,'' said Mary Rouleau,  
legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline's sale was expected after Eli Lilly sold its pharmacy  
benefits company in November to drugstore giant Rite Aid for $1.5 
billion. Notably, that price tag also represents just a third of 
what Lilly paid for PCS Health Systems in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck is now the only major drugmaker still owning a pharmacy  
benefit management company. Merck said it has no plans to divest 
Medco. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with two divestitures, consumer advocates maintain that  
pharmacy benefit management companies-- no matter who owns them -- 
hold too much power in controlling consumer access to prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With health insurers trying to combat spiralling drug costs, the  
benefit managers they hire are under pressure to promote cheaper 
drugs to doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, drug manufacturers will still be able to wield influence  
over pharmacy benefit managers by offering huge discounts and 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still influence peddling, so consumers still have to  
watch out,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group 
Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer advocates hope Merck will follow the lead of its  
competitors, analysts say its unlikely because Medco is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's $6.6 billion purchase of Medco in 1993 marked the first  
time a drug company bought a pharmacy management firm. As a result, 
Merck got one of the best firms for a low price, said Alex Zisson, 
an analyst with Hambricht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugmakers bought the pharmacy benefit firms out of a desire to  
control what doctors hear about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move perplexed some industry watchers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unusual decision for an industry, which pursues  
higher drug costs, to invest in a business whose main performance 
requirement is to reduce drug costs,'' said Thomas Moore, a health 
policy fellow at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	But the benefit firms gave drug companies much more than a way  
to get their drugs onto insurers formularies, also providing 
detailed information on the prescription trends among millions of 
doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurers and big business have increasingly come to rely  
on benefit firms as drug costs increase at double digit rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pharmacy benefit industry faces more challenges than  
just controlling drug costs. Last year, the Food and Drug 
Administration issued draft guidelines that regulate how the 
companies can market their drugs and work with pharmaceutical 
firms.

<HEADLINE> Knievel Speaks of Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Daredevil stuntman Evel Knievel, feeling  
tired two weeks after undergoing a liver transplant, has a new 
challenge -- to personally thank the family of the man who saved his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I now have a new best friend and I don't even know him,''  
Knievel said Tuesday. ``He gave me life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Knievel knows is that the man was from the South and was in  
his 20s when he died Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, 60, held a news conference at Tampa General Hospital,  
where he was released Saturday, 10 days after his 5 1/2-hour 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Knievel's day. And, as it was during a career of daring  
motorcycle stunts, it was a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
	He was feeling grateful to have conquered another death-defying  
trial. He was witty and ranged far and wide with his comments, 
offering thoughts on God, world politics, President Clinton and his 
own son, Robbie. He even gave a glimpse of Knievel as author and 
philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel said he spoke to Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton  
and encouraged him to come to Florida for a liver transplant. 
Payton, 44, was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 
which blocks the bile ducts. Without a transplant, his doctor says 
he would live about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Uppermost on Knievel's mind was his new lease on life, organ  
donations and concern for the grieving family of the young man 
whose liver was implanted in him. Knievel contracted 
liver-destroying Hepatitis C years ago during a blood transfusion 
for one of his 14 surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know him but I do love him and I hope to find  
more information about his family and hopefully maybe become a part 
of their family and let them know how wonderful I feel toward their 
son,'' Knievel said of the donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hector Ramos of Tampa-based LifeLink, who performed the  
surgery, said the identity of the donor family is protected to 
allow members to grieve privately, but that contact can be 
established in a step-by-step process later on and likely will be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing remarkably well,'' Ramos said.  
</P>
<P>
	Knievel said he has always been able to fight back from  
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been in rough waters being the captain of my own  
ship. I've always managed to get to shore when I sunk, or grab a 
life raft to ... hang onto,'' Knievel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was absolutely the biggest operation that I ever had in  
my life. When they take your liver out of you, they take your life 
from you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel presented a $1,000 check to Sabrina Wilkins, a  
registered nurse in transplant who found Knievel's expensive 
jewelry and turned it in to hospital security. It was returned to 
him. She said she would donate the money to the hospital's 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave Ramos and LifeLink a California motorcycle, hand painted  
in his traditional stuntman colors of red, white and blue and with 
his name emblazoned in gold lettering. The $25,000 bike can be 
raffled to raise money for organ transplants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his son Robbie Knievel, 36, who jumped a motorcycle last  
week from one building to another in a daring Las Vegas feat, has 
made his reputation and he hopes he won't continue to risk his life 
with dangerous stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel also gave reporters and transplant personnel a piece he  
wrote, which began by saying he was proud of his experiences and 
what he stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thankful to God Almighty for everything I've faced. I've  
always tried to stand against the wind. ... I've had everything in 
this world that it has to offer to a human being. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that I was born an American. God has been good to me  
and I hope and I pray that my spirit will go on and that I'll win 
again.''

</P>
<P>
	ORAIB, Ariz. (AP) -- Thomas Banyacya, a Hopi selected by elders  
of his tribe to deliver a message of peace and spirituality to the 
world, died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	He once addressed the United Nations, delivering a message  
stemming from ancient Hopi beliefs, sometimes called prophecies, 
that an assembly of world leaders devoted to settling disagreements 
without war would be established in the eastern United States. The 
United Nations was deemed to be that assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
	Banyacya was selected as one of four ``messengers'' by  
traditional Hopi elders in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	He traveled worldwide in his effort to relay the message.  
Banyacya's campaign is credited with having helped revive American 
Indian interests in their heritage, traditions, beliefs and 
languages.

	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Richard Boone, an American-born  
trombonist and scat singer who played with Count Basie, Dexter 
Gordon and other jazz giants, died at age 68. The day and cause of 
death was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Boone, who took up the trombone at age 12, moved to Los Angeles  
in 1956 where he played with Gordon, Sonny Criss, and Teddy Edwards 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s, Boone joined Basie's band. He moved to  
Copenhagen in 1970. From 1973 through 1985, he played with the 
Danish Radio Big Band, considered one of the world's best. Last 
year, he issued the album ``Tribute to Love,'' backed by Danish 
musicians.

	DELTA, Colo. (AP) -- Dick Day, a longtime Western Colorado  
newspaper editor, died Monday in a car accident. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Day, managing editor of The Montrose Daily Press for 30 years,  
was trying to pass another vehicle when his car slammed into a

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don Kendall, farm writer for The Associated  
Press for 23 years before his retirement in 1991, died Monday of a 
heart attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	His byline was a fixture for more than two decades in newspapers  
across America, especially in the Farm Belt. He produced six 
columns a week while covering the Agriculture Department from 1968 
to his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don had a remarkable career in journalism,'' said Sandy  
Johnson, Washington bureau chief for the AP. ``He was dedicated to 
telling readers about food and farms, and the intersection of the 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall began his journalism career at The Hutchinson News in  
Kansas, where he covered agriculture issues, politics and the state 
Legislature for 11 years. He was named a Nieman Fellow at Harvard 
University in 1964 and joined the AP in Kansas City, Mo., three 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Washington in 1967 and the following year was named  
AP farm writer, a job he had coveted. He covered nine secretaries 
of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his retirement, Kendall's byline file in the AP  
library covered 800 index cards, including some 7,000 farm columns. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Kendall won the J.S. Russell Memorial Award, the top  
award of the Newspaper Farm Editors of America, now known as the 
National Association of Agricultural Journalists. He was president 
of the group in 1979.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Armand Schwerner, a poet whose work inspired  
numerous dances and theatrical presentations, died Feb. 4 of 
cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwerner published about a dozen volumes of poetry. Two works  
will be published this fall -- ``Selected Shorter Poems'' and ``The 
Tablets,'' the complete edition of a work he developed in 27 
sections over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances of his nonlinear poetry and recordings of his  
enthusiastic readings attracted big audiences. Schwerner could read 
in numerous voices and was a master of rhythm. In the 1980s, the 
Living Theater presented versions of his ``Tablets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwerner taught English at Long Island University in the 1960s

chief who led the deadly 1984 raid on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's 
holiest shrine, died Monday of colon cancer, the Press Trust of 
India said. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundarji's role in the storming of the Golden Temple, which  
according to unofficial estimates left 3,800 people dead in the 
northern town of Amritsar, continued to haunt him after he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the hit list of Sikh separatist who succeeded in  
killing other officers involved in the raid. Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi was slain by her Sikh bodyguards for ordering the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundarji was commissioned in the Indian army in 1946 and served  
as the army chief of staff between 1986 and 1998. Described as a 
``thinking general,'' he pushed for the modernization of the army 
in the 1980s.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bobby Troup, a musician and actor who penned  
the popular song ``Route 66'' and played a neurosurgeon on the 
1970s television drama ``Emergency,'' died Sunday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Troup penned a little ditty in 1946 as he drove across the  
country to California, where he had dreams of making it big in 
music. He chose Route 66, as his song says: ``If you ever plan to 
motor West: Travel my way, the highway that's the best. Get your 
kicks on Route 66!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides ``Route 66,'' Troup also wrote and performed ``Daddy,''  
``The Girl Can't Help It,'' ``Meaning of the Blues,'' ``Baby, All 
the Time,'' and ``Lemon Twist.'' He also wrote songs for Tommy 
Dorsey and played Dorsey in the movie, ``The Gene Krupa Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He landed a role on the 1970s drama ``Emergency'' as Dr. Joe  
Early, a neurosurgeon. Troup also was host of ``Stars of Jazz'' in 
the late 1950s and had a minor role in the movie ``MASH.''

<HEADLINE> ABA: End Independent Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the wake of the Watergate crisis 20 years  
ago, the American Bar Association helped craft an independent 
counsel law to restore public confidence in the investigations of 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	But after watching the statute evolve into what one lawyer  
called ``the pursuit of the hunted,'' the group ended its support 
of the law in an overwhelming vote Monday by its House of 
Delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was designed to remove politics from the investigation of  
public officials,'' said Philip Anderson, who heads the 
400,000-member group. ``The majority of Americans would say that 
politics has not been removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the delegates' 384-49 vote should not be seen as a  
referendum on Kenneth Starr and his investigation into President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe this was reflecting on any one investigation  
or any one prosecutor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But other ABA members seemed to have Starr on their mind when  
expressing their opposition to the law. Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett, 
a speaker at the House of Delegates session, called Starr ``the 
poster boy for the independent counsel statute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not promote confidence in our system of justice when  
the individual chosen to conduct an investigation of the president 
of the United States has never been a prosecutor or tried a 
criminal case,'' Sonnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was part of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act that  
sprang from the Watergate scandal of President Nixon's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the toughest critics speaking against retention of the law  
was Benjamin Civiletti, attorney general under President Carter, 
who said it ``has produced unintended and terrible consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept deteriorated into ``a pursuit of the hunted'' and  
has become ``a Jean Valjean nightmare,'' he said -- a reference to 
the ``Les Miserables'' hero who is pursued relentlessly for a 
trivial crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA resolution recommends that the statute be allowed to  
expire in June. A clause urges drastic changes in the law should 
Congress decide to retain it. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the ABA Government Affairs Office in Washington  
will quickly begin lobbying Congress to allow the independent 
counsel law to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress listened to the ABA 20 years ago,'' he said. ``I have  
every reason to believe they will listen to us now.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Stops Work on Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- A drug once touted for its apparent  
cancer-fighting qualities suffered a major setback Tuesday when it 
lost the backing of drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Princeton-based drug company previously had a co-agreement  
with EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md. to conduct research and 
development on the drug angiostatin. Under a new agreement 
announced Tuesday, the much smaller EntreMed will now take on all 
responsibility for laboratory research into the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, however, whether the company has the financial  
resources to continue the years of research needed to bring 
angiostatin to market. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, EntreMed 
lost $8.8 million on revenues of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach EntreMed officials for additional comment were  
not immediately successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Angiostatin, a naturally occurring protein in humans, received a  
surge of favorable publicity last May when it was featured in a 
front-page New York Times article on its possible cancer-fighting 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	According to research by Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's  
Hospital in Boston, the combination of angiostatin and the drug 
endostatin was able to shrink tumors in mice by cutting off the 
tumor's blood supply. Neither of the drugs have been tested on 
people, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Several laboratories have had difficulties reproducing the  
findings by Folkman, though other researchers said they have had 
some success with endostatin. EntreMed also has the license to 
endostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers, which had $18.2 billion in 1998 sales, will end  
almost all of its laboratory study of the protein, focusing instead 
on other anticancer agents, the company said. It is retaining its 
right to reassume development and marketing rights to a drug based 
on angiostatin if further research shows it to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, angiostatin protein in its present form does not  
meet our criteria for molecules that advance to clinical trials,'' 
said Robert A. Kramer, Ph.D., vice president of Oncology Drug 
Discovery for the Princeton-based Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Children's Hospital said the change in the  
research agreement had no immediate effect on the hospital's 
working arrangement with EntreMed. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the agreement was released after the stock markets had  
closed. EntreMed's stock, which hit a high last year of $85, fell 
18 3/4 cents to $24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Bristol-Myers 
dropped $3.06 1/4 to $122.50.

<HEADLINE> Day Trading Worries NASD Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of Wall Street's self-policing group  
is asking brokerage firms to report on any problems arising from 
day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zarb, the chairman and chief executive the National  
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, said in a letter to NASD members dated last Thursday that 
``investors must be made to understand what they are getting 
into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb noted the ``sometimes frenetic'' electronic stock trading  
in recent weeks and the rising number of amateur day traders -- who 
he said ``may not be able to absorb the risk'' when they are 
extended credit to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless trading firms respond appropriately, Zarb warned, ``we  
increase investor risk, with some losing savings that they cannot 
afford to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading has attracted a small but growing breed of investors  
-- estimated at a few thousand nationwide -- many of whom have 
abandoned their regular jobs for the prospect of quick riches. Day 
traders seek out stocks solely for their sharp price swings, buying 
and selling them quickly to capitalize on the short-term movement 
in price and rarely holding a position overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities regulators have expressed concern that some  
day-trading companies, which sell training courses and specialized 
software and provide computer work space to investors, could be 
misleading them about potential profits and causing them to get in 
over their heads. State regulators have stepped up their scrutiny 
of day-trading firms and a handful, particularly in Massachusetts, 
have filed fraud charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Zarb cited reports that some trading firms may be  
extending credit inappropriately and that a few have set up 
``pools'' in which they combine different day-trading investors' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, some firms are encouraging investors to  
cover each other's trading debts at the end of the day ``so that 
everything looks fine by the time regulators scrutinize their 
books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While certain of this activity may technically be within the  
letter of the law, it is not within the spirit of what should be 
our mutual goal of protecting investors,'' Zarb wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, warned recently that day trading can be ``highly 
risky'' for Main Street investors, who should engage in it only 
``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed dismay at 
stories he had heard of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading companies acknowledge it's not for  
everyone, but they say it can give financial freedom to ordinary 
people who study and learn trading techniques. They maintain the 
regulators are unfairly tarnishing their industry because of a few 
rogue firms that may have misled investors about what kind of money 
they could make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Traders Association, which represents day-trading  
companies, said last week it was concerned that many people may be 
undertaking the practice without ``a clear understanding of the 
effort required to become successful and the potential risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group issued guidelines for people considering day trading  
and a suggested disclosure statement for companies to provide to 
potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guidelines: Only money not needed for living or  
retirement should be used to finance day trading, and only ``highly 
disciplined'' people should get into it.

<HEADLINE> January Sets Tornado Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last month was a record-setter for tornadoes.  
The 163 twisters on record were the most in any January, the 
National Weather Service said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More tornadoes occurred on Jan. 21 -- 87 -- than on any previous  
January day on record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, we consider this to be a significant number of  
tornadoes for a March day -- the height of tornado season. These 
numbers in January are unprecedented,'' said Joe Schaefer, director 
of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in 
Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall 141 tornadoes struck Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee  
in that spate, the agency said. Additional twisters ripped through 
six other states earlier in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The total of 163 is more than three times as many as the  
previous monthly record for January of 52 tornadoes set in 1975, 
Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The January tornadoes were caused by an unusual weather pattern  
for the month, said Harold Brooks, meteorologist with NOAA's 
National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	``The storms were caused by a southerly flow of wind coming from  
the Gulf of Mexico, which brought in moisture at low levels in the 
atmosphere combined with a strong upper air pressure ... which 
causes wind at about 30,000 feet,'' said Brooks of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ``We usually don't see this 
tornado-producing combination until March or April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first tornadoes of 1999 occurred on the first day of the  
year in Texas and Louisiana. The next day, more tornadoes hit 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, with a total of 
18 in just two days. Six days later two more struck Louisiana and 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 17, deadly tornadoes touched down in three states,  
Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee, killing 10 people and injuring 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	Also 104 tornadoes were spotted during a three-day period, with  
most of those occurring on Jan. 21 in Arkansas, Louisiana and 
Tennessee. During the next two days, 17 additional twisters struck 
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The first tornado death this year occurred 40 minutes after  
midnight on Jan. 2, and the total number of deaths rose to 18 by 
the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Slip / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo  
following comments by Japan's officials seen as supportive of the 
greenback. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.70 yen in late trading, up 1.20 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
114.43 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 114.25 yen to 
114.90 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 89.83 points,  
or 0.64 percent, to end at 13,902.66 points. On Monday, the average 
closed up 94.41 points, or 0.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground in Tokyo in line  
with an overnight trend in New York after Eisuke Sakakibara, vice 
minister for international affairs with Japan's Finance Ministry, 
said Monday an excessively strong yen is not good for Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks make yen buyers wary the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to stem the yen further appreciation against the U.S. 
currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said early Tuesday that it is  
up to the Bank of Japan to decide on monetary policy, a remark 
interpreted to mean that the government and the central bank could 
agree on some action to control interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Action by the Bank of Japan to cap rates would help boost the  
dollar because higher interest rates tend to favor the rise of that 
nation's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The view that easier monetary policy will be implemented in  
some form is leading to a weaker yen,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, 
senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was at 129.68 yen, up from 127.66 yen late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, many investors have already held back to  
see what steps the Bank of Japan may take on the recent rise in 
long-term interest rates at its Friday's policy-board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 6.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,083.65 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was a  
low 306 million shares, although it was up from 261.2 million 
shares Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 782 to 336, 
while 151 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.010 percent from Monday's finish of 2.160 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.34 yen from 97.19 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Wins Key Battle in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Gov. Roy Barnes wasted no time today signing into  
law a bill blocking Atlanta's lawsuit against gun manufacturers, 
which was propelled through the Legislature by the lobbying muscle 
of the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes signed the measure within hours after it won final  
passage in the House.	   By a 44-11 vote, the state Senate on Monday had approved the 
legislation that would prohibit local governments from suing gun 
makers. The House had already approved a similar measure last 
month; this morning's final 142-24 vote was to approve minor 
changes made in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes followed an intense lobbying effort by the NRA and the  
Senate's Democratic leadership. The gun industry is lobbying other 
states to pass similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the Georgia bill called the legislation  
anti-Atlanta and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe it is legal for the Georgia General Assembly  
to prohibit cities from filing lawsuits designed to protect the 
public's interests,'' Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said. ``We still 
believe the Senate and the House have sent the wrong message to the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta filed its lawsuit against 17 gun manufacturers last week  
as the city was host of the nation's largest gun show. It joined 
four other municipalities -- Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, 
Conn., and the unified Miami-Dade County government in Florida -- in 
seeking reimbursement for the 
</P>
<P>
	costs of gun-related violence.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suit claims gun makers and dealers purposely flood  
the suburbs with guns, making it easier for criminals in Chicago, 
which has tougher anti-gun laws, to bring one into the city. Other 
suits seek compensation for costs incurred from gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Mike Egan of Atlanta, the only Republican who voted  
against the measure in the Senate, said the bill unfairly singles 
out Atlanta for special action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA comes along and says, `Tell the city it's gone too  
far,' and we seem to be jumping to their signal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA, said some Republicans  
were contacted to support the measure. ``We were trying to convince 
them that we needed to get this thing passed, particularly because 
the mayor of Atlanta decided last week to go ahead and file suit,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Clerks Face Trial in Penthouse Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A judge has found probable cause for two  
book store clerks to stand trial on charges they broke Oklahoma law 
by selling copies of Penthouse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Special District Judge Sarah Smith ruled Monday that Affinity  
News employee William Gregory, 29, and Whittier News Stand clerk 
Darrell Penn, 32, should answer charges alleging the sale of 
obscene material. 
</P>
<P>
	They face up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney John Coyle III called the case a dangerous  
precedent, pointing out that the magazine is sold worldwide but is 
being prosecuted only in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Constitution is in great danger in Tulsa,'' he  
said. ``I think it ought to frighten every person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested at work in November after selling copies  
of Penthouse to undercover police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege the photos in the November and December  
issues of the magazine violate Oklahoma obscenity laws because they 
depict sexual intercourse and oral sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Statutes make it illegal to buy, sell, barter or deliver any  
picture, drawing, video or photographs depicting acts ``of sexual 
intercourse or unnatural copulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Oklahoma City police went door-to-door collecting  
copies of the Oscar-winning German film ``The Tin Drum'' after a 
judge informally said it was obscene because of scenes showing a 
minor engaged in sex. A federal judge last year ruled the movie 
does not violate Oklahoma's obscenity laws.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Dysfunction Survey Stuns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- More than 40 percent of women and 30 percent of  
men regularly have no interest in sex, can't have an orgasm or 
suffer from some other sexual dysfunction, according to what 
researchers say is the most comprehensive U.S. sex survey since the 
1948 Kinsey Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's lead author, University of Chicago sociologist  
Edward Laumann, called the findings stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it gives us a base for explaining why we had this  
enormous response to Viagra,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said problems with sex are often coupled with  
everything from emotional and health problems to lack of time, job 
pressures and money trouble. But they said they aren't sure which 
comes first -- stress or problems with sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers based their findings on the 1992 National Health  
and Social Life Survey, a compilation of interviews with 1,749 
women and 1,410 men. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants, ages 18 to 59, were asked if they had  
experienced sexual dysfunction over several months in the previous 
year. Sexual dysfunction was defined as a regular lack of interest 
in or pain during sex or persistent problems achieving lubrication, 
an erection or orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of interest in sex was the most common problem for women,  
with about a third saying they regularly didn't want sex. 
Twenty-six percent said they regularly didn't have orgasms and 23 
percent said sex wasn't pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of men said they had persistent problems with  
climaxing too early, while 14 percent said they had no interest in 
sex and 8 percent said they consistently derived no pleasure from 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 43 percent of women and 31 percent of men said they had  
one or more persistent problems with sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers had expected the overall numbers to be closer to  
maybe 20 percent for each sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Laumann said the findings could offer hope to millions, many of  
whom think they're the only ones having trouble in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often they don't even admit it to their partners. It's the old  
`I've got a headache' instead of `I don't feel like having sex,''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Domeena Renshaw, a Chicago-area sex therapist, said the  
results are not surprising, considering the long list of couples 
waiting to get into the sexual dysfunction clinic she has run at 
the Loyola University Medical Center since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In that time, she has treated nearly 140 couples who had never  
consummated their marriages, including a couple who had been wed 
for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Study co-author Raymond Rosen, co-director of the Center for  
Sexual and Marital Health at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School 
in New Brunswick, N.J., said the survey provides much-needed 
information about women, who have often been excluded from studies 
about sexual performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the findings are the most reliable since Dr. Alfred  
Kinsey did his landmark studies 50 years ago. Kinsey got similar 
results regarding impotence and failure to achieve orgasm but 
didn't ask about lack of sexual desire. 
</P>
<P>
	Too often, Rosen said, Americans have gotten their information  
about sex from magazines bought at the grocery-store checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a scientist, it makes my hair stand on end,'' Rosen said.  
``It's terrible.''

<HEADLINE> Murdoch's Son Named To Key Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch has put his oldest son, Lachlan,  
in charge of News Corp.'s U.S. publishing businesses, entrusting 
more responsibility to the heir to the media conglomerate's top 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. announced Monday that Lachlan Murdoch, 27, was named  
to the new position of senior executive vice president of the 
company. He will also become a member of the office of the chairman 
alongside his father and other key executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachlan Murdoch will now oversee businesses that include the  
book publisher HarperCollins and the New York Post newspaper. He 
will remain chairman and chief executive of News Ltd., the 
company's Australian division, and is already a member of News 
Corp.'s board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachlan Murdoch will report directly to Peter Chernin, News  
Corp.'s president and chief operating officer, who is also a member 
of the office of the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Murdoch children involved in the company have all  
taken on greater roles in recent years and have decided that 
Lachlan should eventually be the one to succeed his father. Rupert 
Murdoch, 67, has said he has no plans to retire as News Corp.'s 
chairman and CEO.

<HEADLINE> House Restores D.C. Mayor's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As one of the first acts of the new Congress,  
the House voted Tuesday to return to the mayor of the nation's 
capital some of the power it stripped from his predecessor, Marion 
Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	On a unanimous vote, the House decided to give new District of  
Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams authority to hire and fire city 
administrators. The bill also would give the 13-member city council 
the authority to approve mayoral appointees without intervention by 
a federally appointed financial control board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a demonstration of confidence in the new mayor,'' said  
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., who authored the bill. ``This 
body is prepared to build a new relationship with the District of 
Columbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor and the city council had their power diminished in  
1997 as part of the federal government's takeover of D.C. 
government finances after the city accumulated a debt of $332 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the city's former chief financial officer, announced  
Monday that the municipal government recorded a $445 million for 
the 1998 fiscal year ended last Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton said all indications are the Senate will support the  
legislation once it resumes normal business following the 
conclusion of the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been assured no one finds anything in the bill they  
object to, Norton said. ``Only impeachment is keeping the bill from 
moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton got vocal support on the House floor from Rep. Thomas M.  
Davis III, R-Va., who chairs the House Government Oversight 
subcommittee on the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want democracy to succeed, we need to allow elected  
leadership in the city to start making decisions,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Williams was sworn into office in January, the five-member  
control board returned to the mayor's office control of public 
safety, public health and other government agencies that it had 
stripped from Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The control board was established by Congress after Barry was  
re-elected mayor in 1994 and resisted reforms urged by lawmakers. 
Barry had left the mayor's office in 1991 after he was videotaped 
smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel.

<HEADLINE> Home Shopping Net, Lycos To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc. is merging its Home Shopping  
Network and other properties with Lycos Inc., the popular World 
Wide Web destination, in a deal that creates a formidable new 
Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is the latest seeking to combine the strengths of an  
established Internet company with a television network to entice 
more people to visit the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lycos investors didn't appear enamored with the plan which  
gives them a 30 percent stake in the new company that is to be 
called USALycos Interactive Networks. Its shares were off 19 
percent by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will advertise its Web services on USA Networks'  
cable TV shows, and Lycos' Web sites will include ads for TV. USA 
Networks will also merge its Ticketmaster operation with Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing online sales operations of both Ticketmaster and  
Home Shopping Network would be folded into Lycos' broader system 
under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, this creates a major electronic commerce player  
with significant inroads into the local market,'' said Paul 
Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. The new company also 
will have ``ticketing services through Ticketmaster and Citysearch, 
with tremendous reach across the Internet, given Lycos' existing 
stable of properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in USA Networks clearly see the benefits of boosting  
the company's exposure on the Internet. USA Network stock rose 
almost 11 percent, or by $4.06 1/4 to $42 a share on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market at late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lycos investors are clearly having problem with the terms of  
the deal, which gives them 2.25 shares of USA Networks, worth 
$94.50 in today's trading, for each of their shares, plus an option 
to buy preferred shares in the new company. While the deal was 
reported to give Lycos shareholders a premium, it was not 
immediately apparent how the deal tops Lycos' closing price Monday 
of $127.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos shares fell $23.87 1/2 to $103.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market  
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was unusual. In most corporate takeovers, the stock of  
the acquiring company typically rises on the strength of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement follows rampant speculation about the  
future of Lycos, the fourth-most visited destination on the World 
Wide Web and the only remaining independent large Web site after 
Yahoo! Inc.

	Lycos had been talking about a possible deal with several large

<HEADLINE> Home Shopping Net, Lycos To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- USA Networks Inc. is merging its Home Shopping  
Network and other properties with Lycos Inc., the popular World 
Wide Web destination, in a deal that creates a formidable new 
Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is the latest seeking to combine the strengths of an  
established Internet company with a television network to entice 
more people to visit the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will advertise its Web services on USA Networks'  
cable TV shows, and Lycos' Web sites will include ads for TV. USA 
Networks will also merge its Ticketmaster operation with Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	The existing online sales operations of both Ticketmaster and  
Home Shopping Network would be folded into Lycos' broader system 
under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, this creates a major electronic commerce player  
with significant inroads into the local market,'' said Paul 
Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. The new company also 
will have ``ticketing services through Ticketmaster and Citysearch, 
with tremendous reach across the Internet, given Lycos' existing 
stable of properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, were skeptical about the terms of the deal,  
which will give Lycos a 30 percent stake in the new company, USA 
Networks will receive a 61.5 percent interest and Ticketmaster will 
own the remaining 8.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos was down almost 16 percent, or by $20.25 a share, at $107  
in early trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where USA 
Networks was up almost 11 percent, or by $4.12 1/2, at $42.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement follows rampant speculation about the  
future of Lycos, the fourth-most visited destination on the World 
Wide Web and the only remaining independent large Web site after 
Yahoo! Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos had been talking about a possible deal with several large  
media companies, including CBS and NBC. But talks with USA Networks 
intensified in the past two weeks after several of its large rivals 
struck deals, including Yahoo!'s acquisition of GeoCities Inc., 
which helps people set up their own Web sites, and Excite Inc.'s 
acquisition by At Home Corp, a provider of high-speed Internet 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be renamed USALycos Interactive Networks  
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Diller, chief executive of USA Networks and a key figure  
in the development of the Fox broadcast television network, will 
become chairman and Robert Davis, chief executive of Lycos, will be 
chief executive of the new company. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Women's AP Poll Ranks Colo. St. 5th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coach Tom Collen knew he had a dynamite women's basketball team  
in the works at Colorado State. Did he know it would become the No. 
5 team in the nation? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our team was vastly underrated at the beginning of the  
year,'' Collen said. ``But I can't sit here and pretend that I 
thought at the beginning of the year we were the fifth-best team in 
the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet that's where the Rams sat in The Associated Press women's  
poll Monday, No. 5 in a top six that was unchanged from last week. 
Tennessee remained the overwhelming choice for No. 1 and was 
followed by Purdue, Louisiana Tech, Connecticut, Colorado State and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	That's heady company for a school that had never been ranked  
before this season. The Rams made their debut in the third poll of 
the year, breaking in at No. 16 after winning the preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	They beat Oregon, Florida and Rutgers in that tournament -- all  
of whom have been or still are in the Top 25. At 24-1, Colorado 
State has the best record in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Its loss was by five points at California, a game the Rams  
played without starting center Shannon Randles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this collection of young ladies has been a Top 25 team  
probably the last four years, but no one bothered to notice,'' said 
Collen, who's in his second season at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm most happy for them,'' he said. ``I came into this last  
year, so I inherited them. It didn't take me long last year to 
realize they were a Top 25-type team. I watched them on tape, but 
they were even better in person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are led by guard Becky Hammon, a 5-foot-8 senior who  
averages 20.5 points and shoots 50 percent from the field, 86 
percent from the free-throw line and 39 percent from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	With Colorado State getting little exposure outside the Rocky  
Mountain region, Collen agreed with the notion that Hammon might be 
the best player in the country that no one sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she could play and start for any team in the  
country,'' he said. ``I know people at UConn, Tennessee or 
Louisiana Tech would sit back and say, `How can you say that?' But 
I know if Becky Hammon was with them four years, she'd be starting 
at point guard right now, I really believe that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the No. 1 spot for the fifth straight week,  
receiving 41 of 42 first-place votes and 1,049 points from a 
national media panel. The Lady Vols (22-1) routed Mississippi and 
Mississippi State last week before holding on for a 66-60 victory 
at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (21-1) received the other first-place vote and had 1,004  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	After the top six, everyone moved.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which has won 15 straight and 19 of 20, climbed two places  
to seventh, while Old Dominion was eighth, Rutgers ninth and 
Georgia 10th. Old Dominion and Rutgers both climbed three places. 
Georgia fell two spots after losing to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech advanced three spots to No. 11 to match its  
highest ranking of the season. Then it was UCLA, Texas Tech, North 
Carolina and Penn State, followed by Iowa State, Auburn, Virginia, 
Clemson and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Florida International and  
Alabama held the final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon returned to the Top 25 after making a one-week appearance  
in mid-January. The Ducks got in on the strength of a 106-79 
victory over UCLA, which fell five places to 12th for the biggest 
drop within the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College, which had been 20th, dropped out after losing to  
Notre Dame and Rutgers.

<HEADLINE> First AIDS Vaccine Test in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health says the  
first test of a human AIDS vaccine in Africa has begun in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Several attempts at AIDS vaccines have been tested in various  
countries -- particularly the United States, where the most advanced 
study of another possible vaccine candidate is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's announcement by the NIH, which is paying for the  
study in Uganda, was pegged as an important step toward developing 
a vaccine for countries hardest hit by the epidemic. AIDS has 
devastated Africa. In Uganda alone, it has killed nearly a 
half-million people and left 1 million children orphaned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Uganda study tests a vaccine made by Pasteur Merieux  
Connaught that uses a canarypox virus to carry three HIV genes. The 
canarypox cannot cause human disease, and the HIV genes by 
themselves aren't infectious, the NIH said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, known as ALVAC, already has undergone safety  
testing in about 800 people in the United States and France with no 
serious side effects reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The NIH wants to know whether the vaccine's genes -- taken from a  
subtype of HIV found in the United States and Europe -- will trigger 
a protective immune response to the different HIV subtypes found in 
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope  
are giving astronomers a look at what may be the early formative 
stages of planets, NASA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pictures don't actually show planets, they give a look  
at disks of dust that circle young stars. Scientists believe that 
as stars age, this dust condenses to form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on, avoiding the  
glare from the young suns that can overpower the light reflected 
from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and  
below the dust lanes, suggesting that raw material is still falling 
into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> US Opposes Aircraft Engine Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States today objected to new  
aircraft engine rules that the European Union is poised to adopt, 
saying they would harm U.S. air carriers and supersede existing 
international guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposed rule, expected to be adopted during a meeting of  
the European Parliament on Wednesday, would prohibit the 
registration of aircraft with ``hush kits'' in Europe after April 
1. The Europeans complain that the kits, which are installed on 
engines and act as a muffler, quiet aircraft but do not diminish 
their pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another element would ban hush-kitted aircraft registered  
elsewhere from flying in European skies as of April 1, 2002, unless 
they were operating in the European Union before April 1, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``A thorough analysis of the situation shows that hush-kitted  
aircraft perform worse that current production airplanes in terms 
of fuel burn and air pollution,'' the European Union said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials and the country's airlines object for a variety  
of reasons, including the claim that the European Union is 
attempting to spur sales by Airbus Industries, the aircraft maker 
comprised of several members of the European community. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers such as Northwest Airlines and FedEx, which have a  
higher percentage of old planes in their fleets, say the rules 
could inhibit their operations in Europe. They also say the rules 
would sharply devalue older U.S. jets -- which are often retired and 
sold in Europe, Africa and Asia -- because they would no longer be 
operable in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines are buying hundreds of new planes and installing  
hush kits on older models because the federal government has 
required that all jets operating in the country meet more stringent 
noise standards known as Stage 3 as of Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar worldwide requirement goes into effect April 1, 2002.  
That standard was adopted by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, a United Nations-based group that works to bring 
uniformity to global aviation rules. Both the United States and the 
European Union are members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share concerns regarding noise at all airports, and believe  
that the proper approach for addressing those concerns is within 
the ICAO process, not through unilateral adoption of a design 
standard which disregards actual performance,'' said a letter sent 
to the European Union by Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, commerce undersecretary for international trade,  
told reporters that if the Europeans proceed, ``this will not go 
unanswered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States wants more time to discuss the rules,  
including during a meeting with E.U. officials in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to have these consultations while we've got a  
gun pointed at our heads,'' Aaron said.

<HEADLINE>  Comic Book Creator Has McGwire Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd McFarlane knows how fleeting his fame could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after revealing he was the man who spent more than  
$3 million to buy Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball, McFarlane said 
his deal would be a giant mistake if someone hits 71. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the record falls,'' he said, ``I go from being a nut who  
paid $3 million for the crown jewel of sports memorabilia to an 
idiot who spent $3 million on a $5 ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a rambling one-hour news conference Monday in the Baroque  
Room of The Plaza hotel -- the same place baseball launched its 
Jackie Robinson celebration two years ago -- McFarlane sounded like 
anyone who calls all-sports radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn comic books, held an  
offbeat news conference, quickly admitting he was a ``psycho fan'' 
and a ``sports geek'' and saying his purchase ``was a mixture of 
business, charity and self-indulgence to the Nth degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports make you forget death, taxes and politics, and all the  
other garbage that goes on in life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Canadian, who now lives in Tempe, Ariz., is a  
minority investor in the NHL's Edmonton Oilers. With a company that 
makes action figures, he said the timing of his announcement was 
tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 last month for No. 70, did not  
see the ball until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a 
stay at the Baltimore Orioles' fantasy camp in Florida. Behind him 
was a banner with ``Todd McFarlane Productions'' spelled out 103 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The balls were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine  
columns -- white and gray for No. 70, black for the others -- with 
four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five 
men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would like to allow the Hall of Fame to show  
McGwire's 70th home run ball at times, would make it available to 
charities to raise money and would let individual major league 
teams display it. 
</P>
<P>
	The price?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league  
ballpark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig,  
said purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. He 
mentioned the proposed $800 million sale of the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, I'm up 799 million bucks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he isn't worried about someone breaking the record  
McGwire set last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets too close, I saw what Tonya Harding did a few years  
ago, so there are options,'' he said, referring how Harding's 
entourage hired someone to attack rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and  
Sammy Sosa, including McGwire's first, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, 
and Sosa's 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane bought the ball at auction Jan. 12, paying $2.7  
million to Philip Ozersky, a research scientist at Washington 
University who caught the ball Sept. 27 at Busch Stadium in St. 
Louis. Guernsey's auction house got an additional $305,000 as its 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66, cost McFarlane  
$172,500. All the others he bought at the auction cost under 
$20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who rooted for the San Diego Padres growing up  
because he felt sorry for the players in the mustard-colored 
uniforms, is a fan of the Arizona Diamondbacks and went to about a 
dozen games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As an anonymous telephone bidder, he outbid Irwin Sternberg, the  
president of the neckwear firm Stonehenge Ltd., for No. 70. 
Sternberg stopped at $2.6 million; McFarlane said $2.9 million was 
as high as he was willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew my life savings on this,'' McFarlane said. ``I'm not  
Donald Trump. I don't have a lot of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of balls will be called ``The McFarlane Collection.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I'll name  
it after myself,'' he said. ``Better than `The Guy Who Has More 
Money Than Brains Collection.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife understood the reasons for his purchase, but  
wouldn't have gone ahead on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't have these same wants and needs of silliness that  
men have,'' he said. ``What's the equivalent of the 70th home run 
ball to women?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane said that if he owned a team, he would take batting  
practice every day. And he would make some changes to his team's 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make sure the fences were hydraulic,'' he said, ``so when  
I came up they could move in 30 feet.''

	In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and  
Sammy Sosa, including McGwire's first, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, 
and Sosa's 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane bought the ball at auction Jan. 12, paying $2.7  
million to Philip Ozersky, a research scientist at Washington 
University who caught the ball Sept. 27 at Busch Stadium in St. 
Louis. Guernsey's auction house got an additional $305,000 as its 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66, cost McFarlane  
$172,500. All the others he bought at the auction cost under 
$20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who rooted for the San Diego Padres growing up  
because he felt sorry for the players in the mustard-colored 
uniforms, is a fan of the Arizona Diamondbacks and went to about a 
dozen games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As an anonymous telephone bidder, he outbid Irwin Sternberg, the  
president of the neckwear firm Stonehenge Ltd., for No. 70. 
Sternberg stopped at $2.6 million; McFarlane said $2.9 million was 
as high as he was willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew my life savings on this,'' McFarlane said. ``I'm not  
Donald Trump. I don't have a lot of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of balls will be called ``The McFarlane Collection.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I'll name  
it after myself,'' he said. ``Better than `The Guy Who Has More 
Money Than Brains Collection.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife understood the reasons for his purchase, but  
wouldn't have gone ahead on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't have these same wants and needs of silliness that  
men have,'' he said. ``What's the equivalent of the 70th home run 
ball to women?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane said that if he owned a team, he would take batting  
practice every day. And he would make some changes to his team's 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make sure the fences were hydraulic,'' he said, ``so when  
I came up they could move in 30 feet.''

<HEADLINE> Coles absent From Sydney Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC member Phil Coles stayed away from  
a special meeting of Sydney Games organizers Wednesday as news 
broke in Australia that he was linked to the Salt Lake City bribes 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had been scheduled to attend an extraordinary meeting of  
SOCOG called to decide whether bid documents should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to SOCOG board member and Sydney Lord Mayor Frank  
Sartor, Coles failed to attend. No reason was given for his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was named in a report that detailed the extreme and  
unethical means Salt Lake City used to land votes for the Olympic 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Coles and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, with  
their families, as making four visits together to the United 
States, in one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, which 
cost the bid committee $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	Sartor said the report was discussed at Wednesday's SOCOG  
meeting, but only in terms of news reports. The board had not 
received a copy of the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Coles was expected to resign from the SOCOG board,  
Sartor said: ``I think you're barking up the wrong tree, I don't 
expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coles being implicated in the Salt Lake City scandal  
could cause some short-term problems, but there would be no 
long-term damage caused by the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sartor, a member of Sydney's bid team, maintained that Sydney's  
``was an ethical bid and a clean bid.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Bomb Convict Fortier Sorry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Michael Fortier is asking a federal appeals court  
for a new sentencing hearing for his role in the Oklahoma City 
bombing, claiming he worked hard to help prosecutors convict 
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Fortier devoted himself in preparing for the McVeigh and  
Nichols' prosecutions without limitation, and he made an unwavering 
act of contrition at his sentencing,'' his attorney, Michael 
McGuire, said in papers filed Tuesday with the 10th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief said the $200,000 fine and 12-year prison sentence are  
too stiff and should be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier said he rejected offers of a $2 million reward from an  
FBI agent and eventually cooperated with authorities to help solve 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, who served in the Army with McVeigh and Nichols,  
pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities in advance about the 
1995 plot to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building. The blast 
killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents and transporting  
stolen firearms that prosecutors said were sold to help pay for the 
bomb's ingredients and the living expenses of McVeigh and Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney accused prosecutors of ignoring the stipulations  
for his role in the bombing that led to the plea-bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors told the appeals court last month that Fortier  
deserves no additional consideration for a reduced sentence because 
he took an active part in the deadliest terrorist attack ever on 
American soil. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh and Nichols both were convicted of the bombing. McVeigh  
was sentenced to death and Nichols to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Paramedic Puts Dolphin in Ambulance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUNNELL, Fla. (AP) -- A paramedic was suspended for two shifts  
after he used an ambulance to take a beached dolphin to a holding 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials said Roy Longo, a 10-year veteran, violated  
county policy by transporting an animal in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolphin washed ashore last week, and Longo had taken it to a  
1,000-gallon water tank at a nearby fire station until officials 
from Sea World could treat the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I violated the policy and I understand that I have to be  
disciplined,'' Longo said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the alternative to using the ambulance was more  
dangerous -- placing the dolphin in a basket-like stretcher atop a 
fire engine with a firefighter atop the engine holding the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	County Administrator Chris Chinault issued the punishment.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we have anything against these animals, but we  
have a preference for having the ability to transport people,'' he 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea World officials said the 1-year-old dolphin is in guarded  
but stable condition at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nomination of Richard Holbrooke, President  
Clinton's choice for U.N. ambassador, finally appears headed to the 
Senate after an eight-month Justice Department ethics 
investigation. But the veteran diplomat and peacemaker still faces 
hurdles on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, likely will use the nomination as an 
opportunity to press the Clinton administration to support an 
overhaul at the United Nations, congressional sources familiar with 
Helms' thinking said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms appeared in no rush to schedule hearings.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to very closely examine the Justice Department  
report. We're going to have to walk through their investigation 
step by step,'' Helms' spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has not said whether he would support the Holbrooke  
nomination. However, Holbrooke is believed to have wide support in 
the overall Senate, based on interviews with both Democrats and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced on Tuesday that he was ready to send the  
nomination to the Senate after Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to 
settle civil charges that he violated federal ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton selected Holbrooke in June to replace Bill Richardson as  
the top American delegate to the United Nations. The crucial 
diplomatic post has been vacant since Richardson left in 
mid-September to become energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, 57, denied the Justice Department's allegations that  
he improperly contacted a U.S. diplomat on behalf of his current 
employer, Credit Suisse First Boston. Instead, Holbrooke said in a 
legal statement that he was acting as a special government employee 
who was asked to explain U.S. policy to Asian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bars former government officials from contacting  
ex-colleagues about business for one year after leaving government. 
Holbrooke resigned as assistant secretary of state for European and 
Canadian affairs in February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief architect of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord and last  
fall's cease-fire in Kosovo said he settled the ethics suit ``in 
order to allow my nomination to proceed. ... I now look forward to 
appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the 
confirmation hearings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has been known to take his time on nominations.  
</P>
<P>
	His refusal to hold hearings in 1997 blocked the confirmation of  
Clinton's nomination of former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a 
Republican, to be ambassador to Mexico. Helms opposed Weld as being 
too soft on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said  
Helms does not see the Weld and Holbrooke nominations as 
comparable. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the sources suggested, Helms was likely to insist -- as a  
condition of moving forward on the nomination -- that the 
administration back an overhaul in U.N. practices. 
</P>
<P>
	This includes cuts in the U.N. budget, reduction of the U.S.  
assessment from 25 percent to 20 percent, and various other 
internal reforms, said the sources, speaking only on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Such steps were agreed to by the administration last year as  
part of legislation to also pay U.N. dues that are in arrears, but 
the agreement was never enacted. Helms wants an ``iron clad 
commitment'' that the administration will support this overhaul, 
one GOP source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' committee will also scrutinize Holbrooke's dealings with  
the late Larry Lawrence, a Democratic donor and former U.S. 
ambassador to Switzerland, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence gained notoriety after his death when it was discovered  
that he fabricated a heroic World War II record that -- with 
Holbrooke's support -- allowed him to be buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery. His remains were exhumed in 1997 as a result of 
the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke used a room in Lawrence's Washington home in 1994-95  
without listing it as a gift on his financial disclosure form. 
Holbrooke later amended the form to show a rental value of $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms discussed the Holbrooke nomination on Tuesday with Sen.  
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the committee's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Biden doesn't view the Justice Department issue as a  
serious impediment. He is confident that Holbrooke will be 
confirmed expeditiously,'' said Chris Madison, a Biden spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Education Plan Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's idea for cutting federal  
funds for schools that don't set and meet standards for their 
students and teachers is raising charges that he would have 
Washington intrude into state and local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with shoring up Social Security, Clinton's education  
proposals are key to the administration's plans to reassert itself 
when the impeachment process has run its course. But some 
Republicans already are criticizing his approach to school 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said the  
administration was threatening to use education money as ``a 
cudgel'' so Clinton could be ``the superintendent of schools for 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the people who care most about kids are the  
parents of those kids and the teachers who know them, not some 
bureaucrat in Washington who couldn't find that school on a map,'' 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials, sensitive to such attacks, insist that  
they're willing to let the schools themselves decide how to end 
such practices as social promotion and improve teacher 
qualifications. But they say they're eager for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Republican position is money for nothing, then they'll  
have to answer to the taxpayers.'' said presidential adviser Paul 
Begala. ``And the students and the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address, Clinton called for officials  
to fix or close failing schools, and soon afterward he unveiled a 
$200 million proposal to support intervention in troubled 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people argue that even though we spend $15 billion a year  
on public education, the national government has no business 
whatever holding the system accountable for results,'' Clinton said 
at a Boston elementary school last week. ``Can you imagine any 
company spending $15 billion and saying, `Here, take the money, we 
don't care what the results are?''' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways Clinton's proposal to use education funds as  
leverage for reform echoes his effort to set national standardized 
tests for fourth and eighth graders, which was killed by Congress 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This time Clinton is careful to say he doesn't want to  
``micromanage'' the schools, only nudge them to set higher goals 
for themselves. But he's adamant that they be held to some 
standards: ``If you want the money you should do this -- not should, 
you must.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who say that 35 cents out of every federal dollar  
spent on education is eaten up by the paperwork state and local 
officials are required to fill out, say such edicts from the 
presidential bully pulpit are unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is how do we move more decision-making back to  
the states and to local school districts,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education  
and Workforce Committee, stood up and applauded when Clinton, in 
his State of the Union address, talked about not spending on 
education programs that don't work. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goodling, who said he would even accept placing conditions  
on federal funds under Title I, which subsidize some education 
costs for needy students, said he was wary of broader requirements 
that could tie the hands of local school leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The devil is in the implementation,'' Goodling said. ``If he  
tries to make this a national school board, then of course he will 
run into all sorts of problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Begala and other administration officials say they weren't  
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a world of difference between accountability and  
micromanagement,'' Begala said. ``This is simple accountability, 
and rewards for results. I think that's entirely in keeping with 
the national role on education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Karpinski, a spokesman for the Senate Health and Education  
Committee, said, ``The threat of having aid cut off is always a 
high hurdle. Republicans tend to err toward the side of local 
autonomy. Everyone is opposed to social promotion and programs like 
that. The question is how do you get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karpinski also said Clinton has yet to spell out the details of  
its plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very good at soundbites and press releases; there is  
not a substantive piece of information to follow those soundbites 
and press releases so it's hard to be sure exactly what the 
president is talking about,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fake Dentists Multiply in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Working in an old T-shirt in a grimy office in  
Lima's Zarate slum, the surly dentist pulled three of Susana 
Sevillano's teeth -- the wrong ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Then his struggles to fill the gaps with false teeth caused  
bleeding and an infection that left the poor housewife with a 
swollen jaw, barely able to speak, chew or hear. He insulted her 
when she complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevillano says the ragged dental chair had one leg broken,  
forcing her to grab the seat to keep from sliding off. The sink was 
gray with dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	But the treatment was cheap.  
</P>
<P>
	When she reported him to Peru's dental authorities, she was  
staggered to find out that he was not a dentist. He had bought old 
equipment, taught himself some dentistry and started drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental authorities are warning Peruvians to look closely at  
their dentist's credentials because this impoverished Andean nation 
has 10,000 licensed dentists -- and an estimated 10,000 to 18,000 
fake ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking advantage of a lack of regulation, phony dentists have  
proliferated in Peru's huge shantytowns and poor rural areas, where 
they sometimes outnumber real dentists by a 4-to-1 margin, said Dr. 
Hugo Aguayo, president of Peru's Odontological Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the fakes are dental school dropouts or dental  
technicians passing themselves off as dentists, but some don't have 
even that little bit of training, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Often using obsolete equipment, reusing gloves and needles, and  
even working with materials salvaged from the garbage, fake 
dentists charge as little as $5 to fill a tooth, one-tenth what a 
qualified dentist charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They prey on poor people who cannot afford better care and are  
less likely to challenge their authority,'' Aguayo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevillano heard about her ``dentist'' from leaflets distributed  
near her home in Canto Grande, a very poor Lima shantytown. The 
papers advertised ``special rates'' for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	When she arrived at the clinic, she discovered it was a dirty  
second-floor office in a decaying slum building. But she went ahead 
because she knew she couldn't afford better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've ended up going into debt paying the bills for  
another dentist to repair the damage he did,'' Sevillano, 50, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dental association, one of three institutions collecting  
dental malpractice complaints, said it got more than 450 reports in 
1998 of botched work by false dentists in Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints included broken jaws, infections, loss of teeth,  
bloody root canals and a dental plate built over a large, cancerous 
tumor, Aguayo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lima's Health and Social Welfare Commission said it received 350  
complaints about bad dentists from just one shantytown in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Becoming a fake dentist is a breeze thanks to streets in Lima  
where forgers crank out diplomas on an hour's notice. There is an 
entire industry producing fake college degrees for professions 
ranging from engineers to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	So widespread, and accepted, is this culture of falsified  
professionals that it has its own name in Peru -- ``bamba.'' 
``Bamba'' markets are well known and flourish across Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials say people occasionally set up shop as  
phony physicians, too, but that problem is much less widespread 
because medical doctors have a more complex array of skills. 
</P>
<P>
	To attack the problem of fake dentists, the dental association  
is issuing new tougher-to-forge identity cards for its members, and 
it is urging Congress to make the laws harder on people who 
practice dentistry without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime now carries a maximum penalty of two to four years in  
jail, but the dental association says it is rarely enforced and it 
knows of no one who has ever been imprisoned. The group wants the 
penalty increased to six years in prison and says the law should 
require the immediate seizure of a suspect's dental equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it is now, the false dentists walk free a few days after  
being captured and set up shop again in a different district,'' 
said dentist Helmunth Meier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental authorities have even suggested that local toothpaste  
packagers be required to put a message on each tube asking people 
to verify that their dentist is really a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the existence of dozens of fly-by-night dental schools makes  
it difficult to verify qualifications, dentists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lima alone has 17 dental schools with 13 more being built. But  
there are only enough qualified teachers to staff four or five 
schools, Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Pesantes, a 53-year-old housewife, wished she had  
checked first. 
</P>
<P>
	She knew something was wrong when the drill hit a nerve. After  
breaking several teeth, the dentist fitted her with a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bridge was too tight and caused her searing pain and  
swelling. Months later, she still has trouble chewing. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the dentist had dropped out of dental school  
before finishing the second year of the five-year program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never looked at the diplomas of doctors or dentists before.  
I will now,'' Pesantes said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Accused of charging publishers for good reviews,  
the Internet bookseller Amazon.com offered refunds Tuesday for all 
books it has recommended and promised to tell customers when a 
publisher pays for a prominent display on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did get expressions of concern by people who are very  
important to us, namely our customers,'' said Bill Curry, a 
spokesperson for the Seattle-based company, the world's largest 
on-line bookseller. He declined to say how many customers had 
responded, only that it was ``more than one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper reports this week disclosed that Amazon.com was  
offering publishers what Amazon called ``cooperative'' advertising 
packages to publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying up to $10,000, a book publisher could get prominent  
display for a book on Amazon's home page, an author profile or 
interview and ``complete Amazon.com editorial review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bookseller also accepted payments for books placed in its  
``Destined for Greatness'' section and its ``What we're reading'' 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers were not informed of the payments.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the advertised books were Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones''  
and John Grisham's ``The Testament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon steadfastly denies the deals amount to paying for  
reviews, saying its editors -- not the advertisers -- have complete 
control over which books to feature. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff  
Bezos defended the company's editorial integrity. He said that no 
book is praised unless it meets ``our standards,'' and added that 
``there is no amount of money that would cause us to feature it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon has said the cooperative advertising deals are no  
different than others in the industry in which bookstores place 
prominent displays for certain books in the stores and windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, as of March 1, Amazon.com will tell customers which  
displays have been paid for and which have not. In addition, 
effective immediately, the company is offering full refunds for any 
recommended book, no matter its condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how dog-eared or worn it is,'' Bezos said.  
``Even if you ripped out the pages because you thought the book was 
so bad, you can still return the pieces to us for a full refund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the company's returns policy required books to be in  
unread and new condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Barnes &AMP; Noble and others who charge for display  
space, Bezos said his company was being ``held to a higher standard 
than physical stores. And you know? That's the way it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's strongest on-line competitor, Barnesandnoble.com,  
has said it too will be offering ``cooperative'' advertising deals 
for publishers. It has promised to make clear to customers which 
displays have been paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Amazon.com closed down $9.12 1/2 to $100 in trading on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Elderly Couple's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEAWOOD, Kan. (AP) -- A 79-year-old man has been charged with  
murder after he allegedly beat an elderly couple with a baseball 
bat in what authorities described as a love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Patrick Doyle was charged with killing Lawrence Kubik,  
who died Saturday. Marguerite Bacher-Kubik was hospitalized in fair 
condition following the attack last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who were high school sweethearts, married others but  
were widowed within the last few years. They married in November. 
Both are 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle lived near the couple.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of a strange deal, one of those weird  
love-triangle situations,'' prosecutor Paul Morrison said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle was being held on $2 million bond and could face a minimum  
of 25 years in prison. He also is charged with attempted murder and 
burglary. Doyle has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of sneaking into the couple's home and beating  
Kubik with a baseball bat while he slept in his bedroom. Mrs. 
Bacher-Kubik was able to call 911 from a bathroom telephone before 
she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle and Mrs. Bacher-Kubik were friends, said Doyle's lawyer,  
James Anderson. After her first husband died in 1995, it wasn't 
unusual for neighbors to see Doyle picking dandelions from her 
front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Mr. Doyle would never wish any harm to anyone,''  
Anderson said at Doyle's first court appearance Friday. ``I know 
that he is sorry that anything ever happened to Mr. Kubik.''

<HEADLINE>  Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope  
are giving astronomers a look at what may be the early formative 
stages of planets, NASA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pictures don't actually show planets, they give a look  
at disks of dust that circle young stars. Scientists believe that 
as stars age, this dust condenses to form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on, avoiding the  
glare from the young suns that can overpower the light reflected 
from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and  
below the dust lanes, suggesting that raw material is still falling 
into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Lutheran Group Gets S&AMP;L Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a state whose new governor is an  
ex-wrestler and a practicing Lutheran -- Minnesota, of course -- 
Lutherans have won federal permission to get into the banking 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Office of Thrift Supervision announced Tuesday that  
it had given approval to the Lutheran Brotherhood to buy Metro 
Community Bank of Minneapolis and open a new branch of the thrift 
institution in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	The brotherhood is just the latest organization or company to  
get a new federal savings and loan charters in recent months. 
Others include an agribusiness giant, a long-distance phone company 
and a coffin manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutheran Brotherhood describes itself as a fraternal benefit  
society of 1.1 million Lutherans that manages more than $22 billion 
in assets and specializes in selling insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Community, which offers mortgage loans, home equity loans  
and other savings and loan services in the Minneapolis metropolitan 
area, has $24 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to building a stronger community through the  
opportunities that this acquisition presents,'' Rolf F. Bjelland, 
the Lutheran Brotherhood's executive vice president and chief 
investment officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Metro Community will be renamed LB Community  
Bank &AMP; Trust. Its products will be available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	The thrift agency has a backlog of around 50 pending  
applications to establish federally chartered S&AMP;Ls, many of which 
are from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The OTS, part of the Treasury Department, has reviewed and  
approved applications from a number of insurance companies, 
brokerage firms and other businesses outside the banking industry 
seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting the requests, the 
regulators have chipped away at Depression-era laws separating 
banks, securities firms and insurance companies. Legislation to 
lift the barriers died in Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new S&AMP;L charters in recent months include  
agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., long-distance 
telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and coffin manufacturer 
Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others,  
American Express Co., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., GE 
Capital and Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline To Sell Pharmacy Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- SmithKline Beecham on Tuesday became the second  
drug company in three months to jettison its pharmacy benefits 
business, a move consumer advocates said eliminates a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to refocus on its core drug business and raise cash for  
research spending, SmithKline agreed to sell Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services to Express Scripts for $700 million. That's 
just a third of what SmithKline paid to acquire Diversified in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 115 million Americans are enrolled in prescription  
drug plans administered by pharmacy benefit managers. Those 
companies decide what medicines insurance plans will pay for -- 
compiling lists called formularies -- and encourage doctors to 
prescribe only those drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurers consider formularies a valuable weapon in  
controlling costs, but consumer groups worry about the dangers in 
limiting which brands patients can use. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates compain that when a drugmaker owns a drug  
benefits company, the benefits manager tends to promote drugs made 
by its parent company -- regardless of whether competing drugs are 
better or less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline's sale was expected after Eli Lilly sold its pharmacy  
benefits company in November to drugstore giant Rite Aid for $1.5 
billion. Notably, that price tag also represents just a third of 
what Lilly paid for PCS Health Systems in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck is now the only major drugmaker still owning a pharmacy  
benefit management company. Merck said it has no plans to divest 
Medco. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with two divestitures, consumer advocates maintain that  
pharmacy benefit management companies-- no matter who owns them -- 
hold too much power in controlling consumer access to prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With health insurers trying to combat spiralling drug costs, the  
benefit managers they hire are under pressure to promote cheaper 
drugs to doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, drug manufacturers will still be able to wield influence  
over pharmacy benefit managers by offering huge discounts and 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still influence peddling, so consumers still have to  
watch out,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group 
Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer advocates hope Merck will follow the lead of its  
competitors, analysts say its unlikely because Medco is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's $6.6 billion purchase of Medco in 1993 marked the first  
time a drug company bought a pharmacy management firm. As a result, 
Merck got one of the best firms for a low price, said Alex Zisson, 
an analyst with Hambricht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drugmakers initially bought pharmacy benefit firms out  
of a desire to control what doctors hear about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move perplexed some industry watchers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unusual decision for an industry, which pursues  
higher drug costs, to invest in a business whose main performance 
requirement is to reduce drug costs,'' said Thomas Moore, a health 
policy fellow at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	But the benefit firms gave drug companies much more than a way  
to get their drugs onto insurers formularies, also providing 
detailed information on prescription trends among millions of 
doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers and their insurance carriers have increasingly come to  
rely on benefit firms as drug costs increase at double digit rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry faces more challenges than just controlling  
drug costs. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued 
draft guidelines that regulate how the companies can market their 
drugs and work with pharmaceutical firms.

<HEADLINE> Va. Offers $2M to Switched Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The state of Virginia has offered to  
pay $2 million over the next 25 years to each of two young girls 
who were switched at birth at a state-owned hospital, newspapers 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, regulators on Tuesday cited more than three dozen  
deficiencies in the maternity ward and other locations at the 
University of Virginia Medical Center, where the girls were born in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Health Department's investigation failed to  
discover how Rebecca Grace Chittum and Callie Marie Johnson were 
sent home with the wrong mothers. Investigators said the hospital 
was sloppy or inconsistent in following important procedures, 
including those for using newborn ID bands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to head off lawsuits from the girls' families, the state  
made the settlement offers in December, state officials who 
requested anonymity told The Washington Post and the Richmond 
Times-Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
	If accepted, the state would immediately pay $350,000 to the  
families of each girl. When the girls turn 18, they would each get 
$50,000 a year for four years. After that, they would get $100,000 
annually for another three years. Each would get single payments of 
$400,000 at age 25 and $750,000 at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
	W.T. ``Pete'' Robey III, an attorney for one of the two sets of  
grandparents who are raising Rebecca, called the settlement offer 
fair and said an agreement could be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cynthia Johnson, the attorney for Paula Johnson, who is  
raising Callie, criticized the offer. ``The only cash upfront that 
would be available for the parents was that $350,000,'' she said. 
``There should be a separate settlement for the child and ... for 
the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the hospital and the state did not admit to  
any legal liability by making the offers. If a settlement isn't 
reached, they said, the state will defend the hospital in any 
lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Japan Inquiry Clears Nagano Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese investigators found no wrongdoing Tuesday  
in Nagano's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidders treated IOC members ``within the scope of common  
sense,'' Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Olympic Committee has been investigating Nagano's  
bid at the request of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano city hall said it had found four cases in which family  
members of IOC officials visited Nagano by themselves, at the 
expense of the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano bidders also presented IOC officials with soccer balls,  
judo outfits and other sports equipment, but the gifts were 
donations for nations where such items were lacking, the city hall 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Olympic scandal began amid accusations of bribery in  
Salt Lake City, scrutiny has intensified into Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri newspaper reported Tuesday that at least three IOC  
officials will be part of the JOC report. They are suspected of 
accepting free trips to Nagano for their family members in 
violation of IOC rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But the son of former IOC vice president and former head of the  
U.S. Olympic Committee Robert Helmick -- one of the three officials 
-- said he went to Nagano once, between 1989 and 1994, but it was 
for personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's funny how rumors get started,'' the younger  
Robert Helmick said from Denver. ``It had nothing to do with the 
Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helmick's father denied he had anything to do with his son's  
trip to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no knowledge of that,'' he said from Des Moines, Iowa.  
``We have nothing to do with each other's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agustin Arroyo, an IOC member from Ecuador who has been  
suspended and recommended for expulsion, visited Japan in September 
1990, Yomiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was at meetings in Tokyo, his wife and her friend were  
wined and dined by bidders in Nagano, including visits to a hot 
spring, a restaurant specializing in beef dishes and an apple 
orchard, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yomiuri also reported that the JOC suspects Algerian IOC  
official Mohamed Zerguini of receiving free trips to Nagano for 
himself, his son and his son's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo and Zerguini could not be immediately reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano bid officials have acknowledged they went all out to woo  
IOC officials, including entertainment by geisha at fancy 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidders have also said they gave a painting and sword, both  
worth thousands of dollars, to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. The IOC says it has the painting at its headquarters in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, but denies having received the sword. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano artist Eisetsu Shiratori said he gave one original  
painting of a kimono-clad woman to Samaranch but made color Xeroxes 
of the original for 20 IOC officials who visited Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday the original was worth more than $9,000, but the  
copies were worth far less and within the limit of IOC rules under 
the exchange rate at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no limit on the value of gifts for Samaranch because he  
accepts them on behalf of the IOC and does not vote in the 
selection of host-cities. IOC officials are limited to gifts under 
$150.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Reaches Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Finally, the finale.  
</P>
<P>
	After 16 days of trial in the impeachment of President Clinton,  
after more than a year of investigation and sex scandal, there was 
nothing else to be said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, House prosecutors and the White House lawyer said  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us may have a sense that we've gone well beyond Yogi  
Berra land to deja vu all over again and all over again and all 
over again,'' said Charles Ruff, in closing the president's case 
for acquittal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said he'd even thought of resting for the defense without  
the final replay of his arguments. But his lawyerly instincts took 
over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As did the lawyers' and politicians' instincts of the 13  
Republicans prosecuting House impeachment charges against Clinton. 
In turn, and in the frustration of knowing there are not 67 Senate 
votes to heed their urging and convict Clinton, they reargued their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many are saying with a degree of certainty that usually comes  
only from ignorance that there's nothing I or any of us can say 
today, on the eve of your deliberation, to sway your minds,'' said 
Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia. ``I beg to differ with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with nothing different to say. He urged the Senate to  
convict Clinton and oust him for perjury and obstruction of justice 
in the Monica Lewinsky affair, to do ``duty untainted by polls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That frustration with the polls that show overwhelming  
opposition to removing Clinton from office was threaded through the 
final House arguments. The latest survey, conducted Sunday for CBS 
News, indicated that two-thirds of Americans do not believe Clinton 
should be forced from office -- although 55 percent of them think he 
is guilty of the impeachment accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	Those attitudes haven't changed much despite Clinton's admitted  
deceptions, despite the case made to the House by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, despite impeachment itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The polls, the polls, the polls,'' protested Rep. George Gekas  
of Pennsylvania. Then he cited one himself, saying 80 percent of 
the American people believe Clinton lied under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican prosecutors argued, vehemently at times, taking  
turns at the microphone, sandwiching the closing by Ruff, the White 
House counsel, who didn't raise his voice. No sense shouting about 
a winning hand. 
</P>
<P>
	With final votes on the impeachment articles due by the end of  
the work week, every head count points to acquittal for lack of the 
two-thirds vote required to convict and oust a president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, said that to acquit  
would beget the cynicism of a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now let us all take our place in history on the side of  
honor,'' he concluded. ``And, oh yes, let right be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff's closing:  
</P>
<P>
	``And now our last words to you, which are the words I began  
with. William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty. ... He must not be 
removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he almost certainly will not be, he won't be spared,  
either -- Ruff acknowledged the pain Clinton's conduct has caused. 
The House prosecutors said the impeachment trauma didn't happen 
because of them, or because of Starr's accusations, but because of 
Clinton's affair and attempts to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
	With or without the censure Republicans blocked in the House,  
now sought in the Senate, those marks against him are indelible. 
Acquittal won't erase impeachment. It amounts to escape, not 
vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	An end without conviction, which would take the votes of at  
least a dozen Democrats, had been foreseen for months. Indeed, Hyde 
said a year ago that any impeachment would have to gain bipartisan 
support. He said nothing much would happen until the Democrats 
decided it should. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot did anyhow, but not enough to expel a president.  
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors complained repeatedly, to the end, that  
they had been denied a chance to present their full case, kept from 
calling witnesses to the Senate floor -- they got Ms. Lewinsky and 
two others on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a real trial, Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah said,  
the proceeding ``mainly consisted of what the public saw as the 
yammering of lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They saw, and heard, it again as the case closed.

<HEADLINE> USDA Almost Out of Loan Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Feeling the pressure of thousands of farmers  
struggling to recover from a tumultuous year, the Agriculture 
Department will soon run out of money for loans, USDA Secretary Dan 
Glickman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is preparing numbers to formally request additional  
money from Congress, Glickman told a Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our funding will be exhausted in the next few weeks,''  
Glickman said. ``Demand is outrunning our funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency has not decided how much money to request but  
said it may be as much as $100 million for loans, plus additional 
money to assist Puerto Rico, which was hit hard by Hurricane 
Georges last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said they hoped to prepare paperwork to submit  
to the White House in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have been forced to seek more loans to restructure debt  
and jump-start their operations after a year in which prices in 
some sectors dipped to record lows. Hog farmers, for instance, saw 
prices drop as low as $8 a hundredweight in December. Grain farmers 
also had a bad price year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lines. There is a waiting period,'' Glickman said of  
the Farm Service Agency offices in various states that administer 
USDA loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a coalition of farm groups wrote the Clinton  
administration and Congress warning them of the impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuation of low prices for virtually all commodities  
and livestock -- as well as natural disaster which occurred in 1998 
-- has dramatically increased the demand for funding through 
guaranteed loan programs,'' the groups wrote. Many states have 
already depleted their allotment of funds, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand has increased 26 percent for the guaranteed operating  
loan, 160 percent for the interest assistance program and 92 
percent for the guaranteed farm ownership program, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that every farmer and rancher that is  
having financial difficulties has access to the options that the 
guaranteed loan programs offer,'' the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Cruise, Kidman Facing Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former assistant to Tom Cruise and Nicole  
Kidman is suing the couple, claiming they fired her without cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Judita Gomez said she received ``good or excellent'' work  
evaluations during the five years that she worked for the movie 
stars, helping them select clothes and with household chores. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a Superior Court lawsuit filed Monday, Ms. Gomez claims  
she was fired July 31 and ``is now unable to obtain 
employment-related benefits at the same salary she was earning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former assistant said the couple required her to sign a  
contract last July, but Gomez was not told it included a clause 
allowing Cruise and Kidman to ``fire her for any reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gomez is seeking unspecified damages from the couple and two  
of their other employees, said her lawyer, Mervyn H. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Cruise and Kidman did not return a phone call  
seeking comment after business hours Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Reaches Oregon Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Battered by six days of pounding surf,  
cracks widened in the steel hull of a grounded cargo ship Tuesday, 
pouring thousands of gallons of oil and diesel fuel onto 
environmentally sensitive beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Streaks of gooey, tar-like fuel oil streaked the southern Oregon  
coastline for six miles around the 639-foot New Carissa. As many as 
300 workers in yellow slickers and hard hats were called in to mop 
up the mess with shovels, squeegees and absorbent pompoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret very much that we have a very serious incident on our  
hands,'' said William Milwee, the salvage consultant representing 
the Japanese company that owns the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Kitzhaber considered declaring a state of emergency to  
mobilize the National Guard to aid in the cleanup, but his office 
said that wasn't neccessary because the Coast Guard can call in the 
National Guard on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're skating on the edge here, hoping, praying, working hard  
to avoid a disaster,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard said three of the ship's five fuel tanks were  
leaking and one, containing heavy fuel oil, was ``seriously 
breached.'' It was not known how much oil had leaked, but the three 
tanks hold 140,000 gallons of oil and diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several oil-covered birds have been found, and special crews  
were standing by in case the slick threatens the habitat of Western 
snowy plovers, a threatened bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, staffed with a crew of 23, grounded Thursday about 150  
yards offshore as it waited to come into port to pick up a load of 
wood chips. Its crew was removed by the Coast Guard on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil fumes mixed with salt air Tuesday as workers packed  
oil-soaked sand into clear plastic bags, and front-end loaders 
piled up blackened driftwood. 
</P>
<P>
	The thick oil penetrated less than an inch of the sand surface  
and pooled into depressions. Hundreds of bags of oil-soaked sand 
had been collected by Tuesday afternoon, but long stretches of 
beach still remained to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nasty, dirty hard work,'' Milwee said, adding that the  
lighter elements of the fuel oil have evaporated, leaving behind 
only a gooey, gelatinous muck. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard and salvage teams were going over their options  
on how best to remove the New Carissa. The 200-foot tug Salvage 
Chief, a veteran of the 1989 Exxon Valdez recovery, arrived Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the panel overseeing restoration of Alaska's Prince  
William Sound, where the Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil, 
said Tuesday that only two of the nearly two dozen species hurt are 
fully recovered.

<HEADLINE> Coles Absent From Sydney Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International Olympic Committee member  
Phil Coles missed a special anti-corruption meeting of the Sydney 
2000 board Wednesday after he was implicated in the Salt Lake City 
bribes scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president and Olympics Minister Michael Knight distanced  
himself and the board from Coles, making it clear the controversial 
Australian was the IOC's problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC says, as part of the host city contract, that you must  
put the IOC members in your country on the board of the 
organizers,'' Knight said. ``Unless the IOC changes the contract or 
unless the IOC changes their membership, that contract is not 
negotiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had been scheduled to attend the extraordinary meeting of  
SOCOG, which agreed to make public Sydney's bid contract with the 
IOC and sanctioned an independent audit into the bid. The 
investigations could uncover more corruption within the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight urged Coles to explain why he failed to attend the  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was named in a report that detailed the extreme and  
unethical means Salt Lake City used to land votes for the Olympic 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report named Coles and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, with  
their families, as making four visits together to the United 
States, in one instance attending the Super Bowl in Miami, which 
cost the bid committee $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney Lord Mayor Frank Sartor said the report was discussed at  
Wednesday's SOCOG meeting, but only in terms of news reports. The 
board had not received a copy of the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Coles was expected to resign from the SOCOG board,  
Sartor said: ``I think you're barking up the wrong tree, I don't 
expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coles being implicated in the Salt Lake City scandal  
could cause some short-term problems, but there would be no 
long-term damage caused by the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sartor, a member of Sydney's bid team, maintained that Sydney's  
``was an ethical bid and a clean bid.''

<HEADLINE> Wrongly Imprisoned Man Finally Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCE FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- A man who spent seven years in  
prison for a rape and murder he didn't commit was finally freed -- 
15 months after another man was convicted of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a living hell,'' Anthony Gray, 31, said after his  
release on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and first-degree  
rape in the killing of Linda Mae Pellicano, 38, and was sentenced 
in 1991 to two concurrent life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gray's present attorney, Joel Katz, said Gray has a  
below-average IQ and was pressured into the confession, believing 
he would avoid the death penalty if he entered a guilty plea and 
agreed to testify against two other men. One man was found 
innocent, and the other's case was thrown out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to get me the death penalty for something I  
didn't do,'' Gray said Monday. ``Why should I die for something I 
didn't do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Calvert County State's Attorney Robert Riddle urged  
police to reopen their investigation after he reviewed the case and 
began to suspect that Gray wasn't the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, police arrested Anthony Fleming for breaking  
and entering. Trying to plea bargain, Fleming gave details about 
Mrs. Pellicano's killing that made investigators suspect he was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence from the case matched Fleming's. He pleaded guilty  
to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was not released immediately partly because of caution by  
Katz and Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make sure we left no stone unturned before we did  
this extraordinary thing,'' said Riddle, who was on hand to see 
Gray released. ``There was justice today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, a man who confessed to the 1982 killings of two  
teen-agers was ordered held without bail Monday. Alstory Simon's 
admission led authorities to release Anthony Porter, 43, from death 
row last week after nearly 17 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, of Milwaukee, who confessed on videotape under  
questioning by a private investigator, claims he only fired his gun 
in self defense. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Nicholas Ford said the fatal shots were fired from no  
more than a foot away -- casting doubt on the self-defense claim.

<HEADLINE> LSU To Get Chance To Appeal Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- LSU will get one last chance to argue  
that penalties the NCAA imposed on the school in the recruiting of 
Lester Earl were too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials will go before the NCAA's appeals committee on  
Feb. 27 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We submitted our rationale for reducing the penalties and the  
infractions committee submitted their rebuttal. Now we have a last 
chance to make our arguments before the final ruling,'' associate 
athletic director Bo Bahnsen said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school is appealing the ban on postseason play this year,  
the loss of one more scholarship and a limit of two new 
scholarships in each of the next two seasons. Those were among 
eight sanctions from the NCAA Committee on Infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalties were imposed after an investigation found several  
infractions, including that an LSU booster had paid Earl $5,000 to 
induce the former high school All-American to sign with the Tigers. 
Earl later transferred to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's sanctions were added to LSU's self-imposed  
sanctions, which included a loss of five scholarships during the 
next three years, a reduction of six official recruiting visits, 
forfeiture of five games in which Earl played and the 
disassociation of two LSU boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Reason for the appeal include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The school was not found to have a lack of institutional  
control. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The school did not gain a significant competitive advantage.  
</P>
<P>
	-- No sanctions were imposed on then-coach Dale Brown and  
assistant Johnny Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The penalties are inconsistent with those placed on other  
schools with similar violations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There was no systematic violations since only one athlete was  
involved, and the violations were mostly secondary in nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how long it will take them to rule, but we're  
hoping to get at least a verbal decision later in the day because 
the SEC tournament is the next week,'' Bahnsen said.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Defendant Tried in U.K. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The defendant in Britain's first war crimes trial  
murdered four Jews during World War II ``with enthusiasm,'' a 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John Nutting said Anthony Sawoniuk, now 77,  
acknowledges being a senior member of a police force set up by in 
1941 by invading Nazi forces to kill the local Jewish population in 
Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutting said Sawoniuk also admits fleeing his hometown of  
Domachevo with the Nazis as the Soviet army approached in 1944 -- 
but that he denies killing the four Jews cited in the British 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence indicates in our submission that the defendant  
not only was prepared to do the Nazi bidding, but carried out their 
genocide policy with enthusiasm,'' Nutting told the jury at the Old 
Bailey Criminal Court on the second day of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first case to be tried under a British war crimes  
law passed eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	One case against a retired mining engineer living in Scotland  
was abandoned for lack of evidence, and another was dropped because 
the accused was found not to be mentally competent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutting said the Jews of Domachevo were murdered in three  
stages: 40 were shot immediately, 2,900 massacred in the ghetto a 
year later on Sept. 20, 1942, and the rest were rounded up as they 
hid in forests and the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawoniuk played a prominent part in tracking down and murdering  
those in hiding, Nutting said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawoniuk was the illegitimate son of a poor mother who took in  
washing for local Jews, the prosecutor said. When the Nazis 
arrived, Sawoniuk was among the first to volunteer for the police 
force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will travel to Domachevo next week without the  
defendant to view the site. The town was part of the Soviet Union 
at the time of the Nazi invasion and is now in Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1991 War Crimes Act permits prosecution of suspects who were  
not British residents at the time for charges alleging crimes 
committed outside of Britain.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Lean Against Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans expressed a willingness  
Tuesday to let President Clinton walk away from his impeachment 
ordeal with an acquittal, leaving judgment of his conduct to 
history rather than any Senate-approved rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of censuring Clinton -- either immediately following  
his trial or later -- has strong Republican opposition but remains 
on life support with backing of most Democrats and a handful of GOP 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But to have a such a measure considered in the 100-member  
Senate, supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected 
stalling action by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the leading 
opponent of a censure resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings on a censure are expected to become intense immediately  
after the Senate renders a verdict on the impeachment charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. With 67 votes needed for 
conviction and removal of the president, both parties agree that 
acquittal is virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, has been  
drafting and redrafting censure language with the help of 
Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah. They would not release 
their latest language, which likely would change again anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm has threatened to offer innumerable amendments to any such  
resolution, an approach that could amount to a filibuster, 
requiring 60 votes to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Censure to Gramm is a ``covering your fanny approach'' -- letting  
those who want to acquit Clinton on impeachment still express 
disapproval of his behavior. Gramm has said it's not allowed by the 
Constitution and would set a dangerous precedent for the future 
concerning the separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of GOP senators Tuesday morning, worries that  
Democrats would use censure as political cover after acquittal was 
``raised by some of the Republicans,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, 
R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are aware of that thinking. Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,  
said he needs no political cover: ``I just had my election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he could support a censure  
resolution only ``if the language would refer'' to the perjury and 
obstruction language in the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not likely, since Democrats have expressed strong  
opposition to a declaration that Clinton committed impeachable 
offenses -- especially after the Senate fails to reach the 
two-thirds majority to convict the president and remove him from 
office. A censure resolution would only need a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the large procedural hurdles facing a censure  
resolution dim prospects for consideration immediately after the 
impeachment verdict, Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota 
has set in motion a possible procedural vote that could allow 
Democrats to express themselves. He also has talked of trying to 
attach censure language to legislation after senators return from 
next week's week-long recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators said it would be extremely difficult to return to  
such an unpleasant subject as Clinton's conduct once the lawmakers 
are concentrating on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets more difficult to pass'' after the recess, said Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It becomes an exercise in futility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a member of the Democratic leadership, Sen. Robert  
Torricelli of New Jersey, said the censure issue is ``not time 
sensitive. I don't even think we should try (this week). We should 
do it when we return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, signed on to censure after winning  
support for language that would declare Clinton could not be 
treated differently than any other citizen after he leaves office 
and that no future Congress could override the censure. A censure 
of President Andrew Jackson in the 1860s was overturned by a 
subsequent Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell acknowledged that many  
in his party ``think it's a bad idea,'' but added: ``I'm open to a 
censure alternative. What you could end up with is having a 
bipartisan acquittal which can lead to a good deal of celebration 
downtown'' at the White House.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of a blue-ribbon commission that  
investigated Social Security and Congress' chief auditor both 
criticized parts of President Clinton's plan to devote $2.8 
trillion in future government surpluses to shoring up Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	David M. Walker, head of the congressional General Accounting  
Office, called Clinton's proposal ``extremely complex and 
confusing.'' Both he and Edward Gramlich, who headed up a 13-member 
Social Security study commission, questioned Clinton's proposal to 
use for the first time general government revenues to meet 
projected shortfalls between payroll taxes and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramlich, now a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said his  
panel had specifically considered that idea two years ago but 
unanimously rejected it. Since its creation 60 years ago, Social 
Security has relied exclusively on payroll taxes on workers and 
their employers to fund benefits, never tapping the government's 
general revenue money, raised primarily by income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are serious drawbacks to relaxing Social Security's  
long-run budget constraint through general revenue transfers,'' 
Gramlich told the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his commission felt it was a bad idea because it would  
put the needs of retirees in direct competition with other 
government programs and would make it harder for Congress to make 
the tough choices of trimming benefits or raising payroll taxes to 
fix the long-range financing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, Social Security takes in $100 billion more annually  
than it needs to pay current benefits. But starting in 2013, 
payroll tax collections will not be enough to cover the growing 
needs of baby boomer retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramlich said in his view ``some reduction in benefits are  
almost certain to be necessary as the U.S. population ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said that Clinton's proposal to use general revenue money  
to support future Social Security payments marked a ``major change 
in the underlying theoretical design of this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that one ``disconcerting aspect'' of Clinton's proposal  
was that it would establish a claim on general revenue funds even 
if the future surpluses were not realized by stating that the 
amounts to be transferred would be written into law as a percentage 
of taxable payrolls, rather than a percentage of future surpluses 
in any given years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would devote $2.8 trillion, or 62 percent of $4.5  
trillion in projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, to 
paying down the national debt as a way of shoring up Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	He would do this through a complicated process that Republican  
critics have charged amounts to double-counting $2.3 trillion of 
the money. Those funds are already earmarked for the Social 
Security trust fund. Clinton would give Social Security a 
government IOU, just as currently, and then take the money and buy 
back Treasury bonds now held by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	For every dollar he reduces the $5.5 trillion national debt in  
this way, he would give Social Security a second IOU. The 
administration argues this will lock in the surplus reduction for 
Social Security by giving the program an additional claim on 
government resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble is that both IOUs represent internal bookkeeping  
claims on the government and don't have actual assets backing them 
up. When benefit demands outstrip current payroll taxes starting in 
2013, the government will have to face painful choices of cutting 
benefits, raising taxes or borrowing more from the public to make 
up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues that by paying down the national debt  
now and lowering interest payments, the government will be on a 
sounder footing to meet baby boomer retirement needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walker said ``some could view this as double counting.  
Importantly, to the extent it appears that way to the public, it 
could undermine confidence in a system that is already difficult to 
explain.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Keep Final Debate Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After listening quietly for weeks to testimony  
and arguments, a trial-weary Senate today closed the doors of its 
chamber and began to debate for only the second time in history 
whether to remove an American president from office. Senators 
predicted President Clinton would be acquitted by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that we won't just have speeches, that in fact we will  
have deliberations,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott said after 
senators rejected a request that the final debate be opened to the 
public. The Senate voted 59-41 in favor of opening the 
deliberations, eight votes short of the required two-thirds 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first presidential impeachment trial since 1868 on  
course to end this week, senators were given 15 minutes each to 
debate whether to convict Clinton for perjury and obstruction of 
justice in concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, senators searched for an alternate  
punishment, such as a censure or rebuke, that might win bipartisan 
support after the trial ends. Democrats want to move right to the 
issue of censure, but some GOP lawmakers suggested it was possible 
Clinton could escape with no punishment at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the GOP leadership, said  
he believed the censure idea was ``a rose that is beginning to 
wilt'' and that the chances were slim that senators would consider 
such an idea before they go on holiday break next week. Any censure 
resolution would be considered after the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean the Senate won't revisit this issue when  
they come back. I think the likelihood of that lessens, for a lot 
of reasons,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties conceded the final vote, set for  
Thursday or Friday, was expected to fall far short of the 67 
senators needed to convict and oust Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that many senators are eager to end the proceedings,  
Lott made an offhanded plea that his colleagues keep the debate as 
short as possible. ``I remind all senators that Lincoln gave his 
Gettysburg Address in less than three minutes, and (President) 
Kennedy's first inaugural was slightly over seven minutes,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott offered a compromise to those wanting to provide a window  
to the public. On a voice vote, senators approved his idea to allow 
senators to insert into the Congressional Record after the trial 
any statements they made during the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators rejected a request from House prosecutors to call more  
witnesses to resolve a question over whether White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal gave truthful testimony during the impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Blumenthal said he never passed on to  
reporters derogatory information he had received from Clinton in a 
private conversations that Ms. Lewinsky was a ``stalker.'' Two 
journalists have filed affidavits challenging that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked senators for unanimous consent  
to let the House prosecutors determine if Blumenthal had committed 
``possible fraud on the Senate,'' but a senator objected and the 
request was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of openness argued that the debate should be  
available to the public. ``There is no legitimate reason why those 
doors are closed,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said they feared that if the television cameras  
stayed on, senators would use the maximum time allowed under the 
rules -- 15 minutes per senator, or a total of 25 hours -- for debate 
on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Monday, the chief House prosecutor, Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., derided the censure alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really cleanse the office as provided in the  
Constitution or do you use Air Wick of a censure resolution?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel Charles Ruff, summing up for Clinton,  
ridiculed the prosecutors' case, saying it was built on ``shifting 
sand castles of speculation.'' He said prosecutors were ``more 
focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends, 
more uncaring about the future we face together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a bipartisan group of senators was writing and rewriting  
censure language, Democratic leader Tom Daschle moved to force a 
procedural vote designed to get a censure resolution before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedural motion may be the most that pro-censure senators  
can achieve for now, because censure opponents might have the 
muscle to block a resolution from reaching the Senate floor. But 
the test vote would at least give senators a chance to record votes 
to criticize the president's conduct in concealing an extramarital 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also told reporters that Democrats would force the  
Senate to return to the issue later this year if Republicans didn't 
agree to permit a vote on censure. But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
said on Sunday that it was unlikely that senators -- eager to return 
to legislative issues -- would revisit the issue after the Senate 
begins its annual February recess next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle indicated that about five of the Senate's 45 Democrats  
opposed censure and that it would take 20 Republicans to gain the 
60 votes needed to overcome any filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg said he's one of the Democrats  
skeptical about a censure. ``I have been tilting against it,'' he 
said. ``What I've seen of the draft is too assertive in some 
places. I think it's too severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Language in the draft resolution called Clinton's conduct  
``shameless, reckless, and indefensible,'' but there was no 
guarantee the final version would use those words.

<HEADLINE> Brits Get Many Oscar Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oscar has smiled on Queen Elizabeth I and on her  
nation's modern-day film talent, as the English once again fielded 
a hefty share of Academy Award nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those honored Tuesday were three actresses who had been  
nominated within the last two years -- Emily Watson, Brenda Blethyn 
and Dame Judi Dench -- and veteran classical actor Sir Ian McKellen, 
enjoying his first Oscar nomination at the age of 59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't this wonderful?'' McKellen said by telephone from the  
northern English city of Leeds, before his opening night as 
Prospero in Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be excited for the next couple of hours and then I must  
draw a line under it and get on with the play,'' said McKellen, 
nominated as best actor for his portrayal of a tormented, 
homosexual director of 1930s horror movies in ``Gods and 
Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His British co-star, Lynn Redgrave, received a best supporting  
actress nomination, along with two other Britons -- Ms. Blethyn for 
``Little Voice'' and Ms. Dench for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dench, 64, was due on stage in London's West End to continue  
her run as a one-time Neapolitan prostitute in the Italian comedy 
``Filumena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her second Oscar nomination in a row came from playing her  
second screen queen in a row -- Victoria last year in ``Mrs. Brown'' 
and a majestic Elizabeth in ``Shakespeare In Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that two very good films were made about her,'' Ms.  
Dench said of the emphasis this year on the Renaissance royal, who 
was played in the film ``Elizabeth'' by the Australian Cate 
Blanchett -- who won a best actress nomination Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	How did Ms. Dench commandeer a movie with scant screen time, as  
she so joyously manages in ``Shakespeare In Love''? 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make up for it when you've only got eight minutes.  
You have to make the best of it,'' she said, adding, ``First, you 
get a good costume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dench's British director, John Madden, also was nominated,  
along with veteran British playwright Tom Stoppard, who co-wrote 
the script. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Blethyn, 52, confessed to feeling ``a bit of deja vu,'' but  
said her nomination was more surprising than her best actress nod 
two years ago for ``Secrets and Lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't expect to be nominated once, let alone twice. And  
the character was kind of unsympathetic,'' she said. ``I thought 
that might put people off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Watson, 32, said she was stunned by her best actress  
nomination for her portrayal of the classical musician Jacqueline 
du Pre. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I think is brilliant is that `Hilary and Jackie' was the  
only film nominated that was properly British-financed,'' she said. 
``It really is a properly homegrown little British movie, so to get 
this acknowledgment from the American academy is a kind of 
vindication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a longtime outsider to the world of films, McKellen seemed to  
be reveling most in the Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was quick to add that he also found it encouraging to see  
Edward Norton nominated alongside him for ``American History X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said to me I was the reason he became an actor,'' McKellen  
explained. ``I hope I'm the reason he doesn't win an Oscar.''

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Speedway 1st To Sell Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Motor Speedway isn't escaping the  
recent trend of auto racing drivers and their cars resembling 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway, built nearly four decades ago and recognized for  
years as one of the most progressive tracks in stock-car racing, is 
the sport's first track to have its naming rights sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's Companies Inc., the nation's second-largest home  
improvement retailer, agreed Tuesday to pay $35 million to have the 
1.5-mile trioval renamed to Lowe's Motor Speedway for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people first heard about the name change around here,  
there was a certain amount of grief -- not against Lowe's, but just 
because of the change,'' said H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of 
Speedway Motorsports Inc., the company that owns the track. ``But 
when people found out about the dollars, that made a lot of 
difference because they know it's not just the dollars, it's what 
we can do with the dollars for the race fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the money would be used to add seats, roads and  
parking at the track, which annually holds races for NASCAR's Busch 
Grand National and Winston Cup circuits as well as Indy Racing 
League and ARCA events. 
</P>
<P>
	Having its red, white, blue and yellow logo splashed around the  
sprawling facility won't be the sole benefit for Lowe's. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal further strengthens the North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based  
company's position as a major player in helping the fast-growing 
sport of Winston Cup racing diversify its sponsorship base. The 
sport has relied for decades on money from tobacco interests, but 
with that industry coming under increasing fire from the federal 
government, sponsors without tobacco ties are becoming more and 
more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what the federal government is going to do,''  
said Bob Tillman, the president and chief executive officer of 
Lowe's. ``You've got to be prepared to broaden the base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tillman said Lowe's, which already sponsors a Winston Cup team  
and several other racing ventures, spent an estimated $30 million 
in the sport last year and expects that figure to approach $40 
million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a perfect fit for us,'' said Tillman, whose  
company has 487 stores in 27 states and plans to open an additional 
100 stores in the West and Pacific Northwest. ``Our demographics 
show that Lowe's and NASCAR attract virtually the same person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte track was the first facility in Winston Cup racing  
to offer stock publicly and the first to build luxury suites and 
condominiums, but indications are it won't be the last to sell 
naming rights. 
</P>
<P>
	SMI alone operates six tracks that stage races for various  
stock-car and open-wheel circuits, and company officials said they 
expect similar naming rights contracts to be announced in the 
coming months at some of their other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The most likely two SMI candidates are Atlanta Motor Speedway  
and Texas Motor Speedway, both of which hold races for NASCAR's 
Winston Cup and Busch Grand National circuits as well as the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I know that some other NASCAR tracks not owned by us have  
been approached by other companies,'' Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lowe's deal was put together by Marcus G. Smith, SMI's  
manager of new business development. He said that when SMI decided 
to sell Charlotte's naming rights, the company contacted a dozen 
major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only did all express interest,'' he said, ``but there is  
still substantial interest, so we're not letting that go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What many people will find difficult to let go, however, will be  
the track's old name and all the memories associated with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlotte Motor Speedway has been around since 1960, so  
there's definitely going to be a period of adjustment,'' Wheeler 
said. ``But this is the way of sports today.''

<HEADLINE> Ameritrade Suffers Half-Hour Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online broker Ameritrade suffered a half-hour  
outage before stock markets opened Monday, the latest in a series 
of computer glitches to raise questions about the reliability of 
Internet trading systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company took down its system from 8:56 a.m. to 9:24 a.m. EST  
in order to fix the problem, preventing online customers from 
placing orders before the opening of stock trading at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage also affected the accounts of Accutrade, a smaller  
online brokerage also run by the same company, said Paula Ebert, a 
spokeswoman for the Omaha, Neb.-based brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, rival online brokerage ETrade suffered a series of  
shutdowns during trading hours, angering customers and adding fuel 
to an investigation of the booming online brokerage industry by the 
New York attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritrade Holding Corp.'s shares lost $15.50, or 16 percent, to  
close at $80 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritrade and Accutrade had a combined 354,000 accounts as of  
December, and executed an average of 33,500 trades per day for its 
customers. Ebert would not provide a breakdown for the two 
brokerages.

<HEADLINE> Columbus Repeals Health Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The City Council unanimously repealed an  
ordinance offering health benefits to live-in partners of unmarried 
municipal employees, avoiding a referendum on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt sympathy goes out to those employees who came to  
us and asked us to treat them like the majority of other 
citizens,'' Mayor Greg Lashutka said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinace had been unanimously adopted two months earlier  
with support from Lashutka, a Republican. The council said it would 
help the city attract employees, including those in homosexual 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, led by conservative Democratic lawyer Jay Meena, said  
the public should have had more time for comment. Some contended 
the ordinance undermined marriage and promoted immorality, and said 
the cost -- estimated by city officials at $550,000 to $700,000 
annually -- was too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents gathered nearly 8,500 signatures on a petition to put  
the issue on the ballot May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Matt Habash, who introduced the ordinance, decided it  
would be safer to repeal the measure because defeat by the voters 
would mean the council could not reconsider the issue without 
another ballot initiative.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Tank Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIXON, Calif. (AP) -- A tank containing 250,000 gallons of liquid  
fertilizer collapsed at a processing plant, killing one worker and 
injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-foot-diameter tank ruptured at Tremont Supplies Inc. on  
Monday afternoon. James Mullings, 66, a mix plant operator, was 
killed. Two other men were hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men had been working to transfer the contents of the  
half-empty tank after small holes were found on the bottom of it 
Monday morning, said Jennifer Lombardi, a spokeswoman for the 
California Fertilizer Association. 
</P>
<P>
	When it collapsed, a powerful wall of liquid ammonium phosphoric  
acid flooded the workers. TV footage showed the tank demolished, 
its steel walls littered around the plant about 20 miles southwest 
of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a balloon full of water and prick it with a pin and  
you'll know what it was like here,'' Sacramento fire official Jan 
Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The liquid was nontoxic, and no evacuation was needed.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't worry -- Cate Blanchett won't be offended  
if you think she's not beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go ahead. Say it. I've looked ugly. That's O.K. ... I'm not  
opposed to looking what is commonly termed as ugly,'' she says in 
the March issue of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest compliment I think I've ever had was when another  
actor said I had `an actor's face' ... I'm as vain as the next

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Problem Gamblers Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Every person who becomes a problem  
gambler costs society about $3,000 a year, according to a national 
study that found about equal proportions of men and women who 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs include unemployment benefits and money employers must  
spend to recruit and train new workers to replace someone fired 
because of gambling, according to the overview of American gambling 
habits compiled by the University of Chicago's National Opinion 
Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, researchers found that about 4  
million people are problem gamblers who had lost $100 or more in a 
single day or year and had at least three adverse effects from 
gambling, such as job loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that about one in seven adults has never  
gambled. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted for the National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission, which is preparing a report for the president and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done a huge amount of work, and we don't have a  
headline yet,'' said Dean Gerstein, a NORC researcher. ``There 
hasn't been a national study since 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the report highlights problems associated with gambling,  
it also contains information that gambling proponents can use. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, NORC analyzed social and economic changes between  
1980 and 1997 in 100 communities within 50 miles of one or more 
casinos and found that casinos had no statistically significant 
effect on bankruptcy or crime rates. That did not include white 
collar crime, such as embezzlement.

<HEADLINE> Albright Praises New Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she  
has assurances from King Abdullah of Jordan that he will ``carry 
his father's flag'' in pursuing peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising to help the new monarch, Albright in an Associated  
Press interview Monday cautioned Iraq against any intimidation of 
its smaller, pro-Western neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made it clear to Saddam Hussein that were he to  
threaten any of his neighbors it would be a grave mistake, and we 
would be prepared to act,'' Albright said. ``And that goes for 
Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging conversation, Albright also made it clear she  
expects Israel to go ahead with its promised pullback on the West 
Bank despite repeated Israeli charges that the Palestinians are not 
carrying out all the promises they made in the Wye accords in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective,'' Albright said, ``the Israeli  
government and the Israeli Knesset agreed to Wye and whatever else 
is going on we believe the implementation should go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The process is in a slump, though, and Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu has vowed not to give up more than the 2 percent he has 
relinquished unless Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority takes 
tougher action against terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep pressing them,'' Albright said of the Palestinians and  
Arafat, who visited here last week and is due back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In looking at the Middle East, the death of King Hussein and  
prospects for a successful succession in Jordan were mostly on 
Albright's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, she made an unscheduled stop in Amman to size up  
Abdullah, who had just been named the new heir to the throne by his 
dying father, and to offer him financial and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we know quite a lot about him,'' Albright said. ``He  
is somebody who has been really dedicated in terms of fulfilling 
his father's wishes. What I was very impressed with was that he 
made it very clear -- the phrase he used is `I am going to carry my 
father's flag' -- and that was in relationship to continuity in 
foreign policy and his dedication to the peace process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly impressed with the 37-year-old monarch, and the network  
he already is building with Arab leaders of his generation, 
Albright still withheld judgment, at least so far as whether he 
could emulate his father, 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't step into the shoes of a great father and a great  
leader and not realize that there is some space in the toes,'' 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she added, ``He has a good attitude, and he strikes me  
as somebody who has a lot of promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Saturday registered U.S. support for the  
king by promising to accelerate $300 million in aid. State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday about $1 billion in 
assistance was planned over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has suffered a drought and is in poor economic shape. On  
his last stop in Washington, Albright said, Hussein for the first 
time in his long reign specifically asked for financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq, meanwhile, looms on Jordan's northeast border, and even  
Hussein moved carefully, tilting toward President Saddam Hussein, 
for instance, after Iraq annexed Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, whose country depended entirely on Iraq for oil, stood  
apart from other Arab governments that joined with the United 
States in a war that liberated Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the Clinton administration may have to make some  
``further assessments'' of Jordan's strategic situation. In the 
meantime, she warned Baghdad that ``we are very close to Jordan and 
that Jordan plays an important role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. His death has  
raised questions about the future of relations between the two 
countries and peacemaking across a wider Mideast spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	William Quandt, who was a national security adviser to President  
Carter, said he would be very surprised if the peace treaty between 
Israel and Jordan came unglued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The peace will remain, but it may not be so cozy,'' Quandt, a  
government professor at the University of Virginia, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein had a unique credibility with Israelis, but Abdullah is  
unknown and faces a problem of gaining credibility in Jordan and 
the Arab world at large, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the crucial element in the Middle East equation,''  
Quandt said. ``What happens is up to the Israelis, the Palestinians 
and the Americans to work through,'' Quandt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon B. Alterman, an analyst with the U.S. Institute of Peace, a  
federally financed research group, also raised questions about 
Abdullah. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Abdullah may be committed to the peace process, there is  
no way that he can be a trail blazer for the peace process the way 
his father was,'' Alterman said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Election Suit Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a  
lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Ross Perot's Reform 
Party that challenged election laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought damages for alleged illegal funding of  
``issue ads'' by Democrats and Republicans in the 1996 presidential 
race; attacked the Federal Elections Commission's composition of 
three Republicans and three Democrats and claimed discrimination in 
a law that bases campaign funding on a party's share of the 
presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker dismissed the lawsuit last  
February without a trial. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
upheld his ruling by a 3-0 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the lawsuit is ``frivolous,'' said the opinion by Judge  
Mary Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. White, a lawyer for the Reform Party, refused to  
comment. The party's chairman, Russell J. Verney, said last year 
the lawsuit would be taken to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder's opinion said a 1976 Supreme Court ruling upheld the  
federal campaign funding law, which tied parties' federal matching 
funds to their share of the last presidential vote. Parties that 
get more than 25 percent of the vote receive the most money, with 
lesser subsidies to parties winning between 5 percent and 25 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the 1992 presidential election, the Democrats and  
Republicans each got $62 million in federal funds for 1996, and the 
Reform Party, with Perot as its candidate, got $29 million. The 
appeals court said the 1976 Supreme Court decision recognized those 
disparities and found no illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party also challenged the makeup of the Federal  
Elections Commission, which is covered by a law that limits 
appointments from any party to three. The appeals court said 
striking down the law wouldn't affect minority representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the lawsuit accused Democrats and Republicans of  
flouting legal limits on ``soft money,'' contributed by 
corporations and unions, by using it for ads devoted to issues that 
promoted each party's 1996 presidential candidate. Claiming the ads 
cost Perot votes, the Reform Party sought damages for the resulting 
loss of future federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the only legal remedy for an election law  
violation is a complaint to the FEC.

<HEADLINE> Air Force To Spend $54M on TV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Air Force plans to spend millions on  
television ads to try to boost enlistment as the service struggles 
to meet its annual recruiting goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV ads in the current and upcoming fiscal years will push  
the Air Force's overall advertising budget to $76 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the awareness that television can generate right now,  
so it can begin to have an impact this year,'' said Brig. Gen. 
Peter Sutton, commander of the Air Force Recruiting Service, 
headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base near San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is 6 percent short of its recruitment goal of  
33,800 so far this fiscal year. If the annual goal is not met it 
will be the first time that has happened since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the Air Force television spots will air during the  
NCAA's ``March Madness'' basketball tournament this spring and 
consist of former public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads potentially can reach 15 million people in the 18-24 age  
group during basketball broadcasts leading up to the tournaments 
semifinals, said Maj. Jeff Bowles, advertising director for the Air 
Force Recruiting Service. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, recruitment ads will be placed in major local  
markets such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Atlanta and Los 
Angeles, Bowles said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the Air Force has used paid television  
ads in its recruiting efforts. It previously has bought print ads 
and relied on non-paid public service announcements on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But, like other branches of the military, the Air Force is  
struggling to meet enlistment goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is having trouble with recruitment despite the  
introduction in October of new enlistment bonuses of up to $9,000 
for 115 qualifying career specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reasons for the enlistment shortfall include the nation's  
low unemployment and a declining awareness about military life 
because of a smaller force, base closings and a declining veterans 
population, said Maj. Derek Kaufman, spokesman for the recruiting 
service.
