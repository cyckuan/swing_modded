<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. government has
promised a thorough investigation of the EgyptAir Crash which
occurred early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the crash, U.S. President Bill Clinton said here
Sunday there was "no evidence... at this time" of foul play in the
EgyptAir jetliner crash.
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence of that at this time, and I think it's
better if people draw no conclusions until we know something,"
Clinton said after attending church.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what the cause of the accident is. We'll keep
working until we find out," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very saddened by the crash of the EgyptAir
flight off the coast of Massachusetts. "We are working on the
recovery efforts. We know that there has been an extensive loss of
life and we don't yet know what caused the accident," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore promised a thorough
investigation to "learn whatever we can to avert further
tragedies".
</P>
<P>
"The people of our country and people all over the world will
have the families of those who are evidently lost at sea in our
prayers and in our thoughts," Gore said on ABC's "This Week."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States will cooperate with the government of
Egypt "in doing everything we possibly can to find the cause of
this tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Officials will ensure "that all of the families of the victims
are dealt with in the most sensitive and compassionate way
possible and learn whatever we can to avert further tragedies,"
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
All the 214 people on board the EgyptAir plane were feared
dead as the Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed early Sunday off
the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The plane was en route
from New York to Cairo, Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Attack on Red Cross Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Sunday
denied allegations that it made the reported Saturday air strikes
on a Red Cross convoy, killing two staffers of the humanitarian
organization's Chechen mission and dozens of peaceful people.
</P>
<P>
"There was no air strike by federal forces over the Red Cross
convoy," Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Mozdok-based press
center of Russian federal troops as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is another canard made by Chechen information terrorist
Movladi Udugov," said the press center.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, over the past 24 hours the federal
forces indeed made several air raids against truck convoys moving
across Chechnya. For instance air attacks were made overnight on
three convoys of six trucks and one convoy of ten vehicles. All
convoys were partially destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single truck had Red Cross identification marks,"
stressed the press center.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) reported
that the incident was caused by a missile attack during an air
strike on a humanitarian convoy 20 kilometers east of Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic. The convoy, consisting of
several trucks, was driving along the Nazran-Grozny highway when
hit by the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The IRCC noted that at least 25 people died and 70 were wounded
in the tragedy.

AMMAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Raouf Rawabdeh said Sunday his country is keen to accomplish
all procedures and laws to prepare itself for the entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The accession to the WTO will have a positive impact on
the economy of the desert kingdom, Rawabdeh said during his
meeting with U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Steuart Iznstat who
is visiting Amman to promote bilateral economic ties, Jordan`s
official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also stressed the importance of increasing bilateral
trade to improve the economic conditions of the kingdom, which
registered a negative economic growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Middle East affairs, the Jordan prime minister said his
country was keen to keep the peace process going and to
maintain political stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Iznstat said the U.S. had noticed that
Jordan had exerted tremendous efforts in order to join the
WTO, including the privatization of public institutions like
the Jordanian Telecommunications Company and Royal Jordanian, its
national air carrier.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said Jordan has made substantial progress
on the membership of WTO, but he fell short of predicting a
possible timetable for the kingdom to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. and Jordanian officials will hold talks in
November to discuss the establishment of free trade zones in the
kingdom and to work out an agreement avoiding dual taxes between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as an ally in the Arab world and
promised a package of 300 million U.S. dollars in economic,
military and social security assistances to the kingdom for the
year 1999 to award its role in promoting the peace process in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's VIP Land Resettlement Scheme Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Land Acquisition
Committee Chairman Joseph Msika has attacked the government for
its decision to implement its recently introduced commercial
farming resettlement scheme, Zimbabwe News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Msika was quoted as saying that it is unfair for the government
to go ahead with the implementation of the scheme, which caters
for top government officials and other influential people while
the majority of Zimbabweans remain landless.
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised to read in papers that Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai had identified farms and
beneficiaries of the VIP resettlement scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Truly speaking, I do not know anything about this VIP
resettlement scheme and as for Kangai he did it solely without
contacting me as Chairman of the Land Acquisition Committee,"
Msika said.
</P>
<P>
The government should resettle landless peasants first before
embarking on other forms of resettlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The VIP resettlement scheme has been widely attacked throughout
the country with some people accusing the government for being
unfair in allocating land to a few VIPs like cabinet ministers,
high court Judges and business people while the majority of
Zimbabweans are still landless, said the news agency.

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Found in EgyptAir Flight Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Several bodies were found
around the crash site of an Egyptian airliner as searches are
continuing, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
announced here Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir Boeing 767 passenger plane, with 214 passengers
and crew members on board, crashed early Sunday 65 miles southeast
of Nantucket, Massachusetts in the United States, the authority
official announced at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 families of the victims have been notified so far of
the tragedy and the authority vowed to provide any assistance and
updated information to those who lost their beloved, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. Coast Guard had announced that one body, some
seats and life jackets were found in the sea about 60 miles south
of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
The process of identifying the victims is continuing, the
official said, while most of the victims were believed to be
Americans.
</P>
<P>
However, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim Rayan announced earlier
in Cairo that the killed in the crash included 62 Egyptians, two
Sudanese, three Syrians one Chilean, while the nationalities of
131 passengers were unidentified.
</P>
<P>
The flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19
a.m. local time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from
radar screen at 2:00 a.m. (0600 GMT). It originated in Los
Angeles, EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying at 33,000 feet (9,900 meters), said Eliot
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Weather at Kennedy Airport was good with 3 to 4 miles of
visibility and light wind, the National Weather Services said.
</P>
<P>
The FAA contacted the Coast Guard about 2:15 local time (0619
GMT), said Coast Guard Lt. Gary Jones.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a very, very aggressive airborne search at this
moment. Basically, if there is someone out there to be saved,
saving lives at sea is our most important mission and we're doing
that," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Investigation Bureau (FBI) and the Joint Terrorist
Task Force have launched a joint investigation into the flight.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette said that "agents are going over
the flight manifest, identifying everyone who touched the plane,
including those who serviced and gassed the aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Valiquette cautioned that there is "no reason to assume this is
a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The FAA issued an alert a moth ago to airline and airport
security personnel after agencies received an unconfirmed warning
that a bomb would "soon be used" on flight departing from Los
Angeles or Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
But officials said they had no reason to believe the
disappearance of the Egyptian flight on Sunday was caused by
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said "no evidence...at this time"
of foul play in the air crash.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Sunday refuted the alleged federal airstrikes on peaceful
civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Everything that concerns the bombing of peaceful residents is
the ill-intended propaganda of terrorists," Putin said in a live
report of the Echo of Moscow radio station.
</P>
<P>
"That is a new, information front in the confrontation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists are using the channels and infrastructure of some
extremist-minded Islamic leaders for spreading slanderous
anti-Russian information," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he did not rule out that "there could be some
mistakes" by federal forces, even though "no large-scale errors
have been registered so far."
</P>
<P>
"I have reliable evidence that the separatists are using quite
intricate and sophisticated tactics," said Putin, "there are
adequate and potent proofs that the bandits themselves shoot to
death peaceful residents, who are ready and willing to cooperate
with the federal authorities."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that "there have been no special actions to
inflict damage on the peaceful population and no such actions will
be carried out."
</P>
<P>
"We do not aim at forcing the Chechen people down on their
knees. We have other tasks -- to do away with terrorist bases in
the republic and to restore federal constitutional order there,"
stressed the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, October 31 (Xinhua) - Actions to cut the European
Union's historically high unemployment must be left to member
states, which should tailor policies to suit the unique economic
starting-point of each nation.
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of a major report on European
labor market flexibility, released on Sunday by the Confederation
of British Industry at its national conference here.
</P>
<P>
The report - examining the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy
and the Netherlands - shows labor market flexibility is crucial to
job creation. European economic growth has been similar to the US
over the last decade, but job creation has been worse.
</P>
<P>
There are huge variations in unemployment levels with the
Netherlands having a lower rate than the UK but Spain, Italy and
France all having a higher rate, the report also shows.
</P>
<P>
The CBI says the debate about labor market flexibility has been
hampered by "stereotypes and generalizations". Many people see the
British labor market as flexible and all other European labor
markets as inflexible, but the reality is much more complex.
</P>
<P>
CBI Director-General Adair Turner said: "Contrary to
euro-sceptic myth, Europe's unemployment problems have not been
created by European-wide policies. And contrary to euro-federalist
myth, the solutions lie with national not European-wide policies.
</P>
<P>
The report says labor market flexibility has six different
dimensions. These are: working pattern, wage, numerical(rules on
hire and fire), functional skills and geographical flexibilities.
</P>
<P>
A key conclusion of the report is that flexible working
patterns are essential to high employment in economies
increasingly dominated by service industries.
</P>
<P>
Turner said: "The report does not imply that maximum
flexibility and further liberalization on all fronts is always
essential whatever the starting point."
</P>
<P>
"The solutions must reflect the different circumstances in
specific countries. And the same overall result could be achieved
in different countries with different combinations of flexibility.
There is no need for a rigid template and to impose one would be
harmful," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Sunday that the
country's security forces seized about 2.5 tons of narcotic drugs

</P>
<P>
The vehicle was also destroyed in fire, the report said,
adding that the security forces also seized over 40 kilograms of
opium in the past two days.

<HEADLINE> Updated China to Abolish 12 Macao Laws After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua) -- China is to abolish 12 existing
Macao laws from December 20 because they contradict the Basic Law
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
However, most of the existing laws and regulations in Macao
will not change after its return to the motherland, according to
the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Three other existing laws shall continue to be referred to in
practice until new laws are enacted by the Macao SAR, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution was made based on the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR, and it is strictly in line with the principle of China's
exercising sovereignty over Macao since December 20 this year,
while helping to maintain consistency of Macao's legal system,"
said Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, at today's
legislative meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution will be conducive to the smooth transition in
the coming months," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, another 19 articles in the Macao
Laws will also be removed from laws of the Macao SAR for they also
contradict the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines on amending terms involving sovereignty and
government institutions and the re-phrasing of proper names have
been listed in the supplement of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was made after 854 existing laws had been
examined by the Preparatory Committee of the Macao SAR under the
NPC Standing Committee. Another 121 laws remain unchecked for they
have yet no Chinese versions.

<HEADLINE> Reformed British Lords to Enjoy More Power: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The British Royal Commission's
report on reform of the House of Lords will call for a far more
powerful second chamber than expected, the Sunday Telegraphy
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A draft copy of the commission's final conclusions also
proposed the new House of Lords be given an enhanced role in
scrutinizing and criticizing ministers.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the recommendations would come as a surprise
to Prime Minister Tony Blair who wanted a more acquiescent second
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is already in the process of scrapping the rights of
the hereditary aristocracy to sit in the house alongside political
appointees, is believed to favor replacing them with more
appointed representatives.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper said the royal commission tasked with drawing
up plans to reform the centuries-old second chamber envisaged 100
peers being elected out of a total of 500.
</P>
<P>
The remainder would be appointed by an independent commission,
with the role of existing life peers uncertain.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair said the prime minister would respond
when the report, which has a high profile but is not binding, is
officially published later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said the commission wanted peers to get
sweeping powers to act as watchdogs over the European Union.
</P>
<P>
A new Lords committee would be able to summon ministers to
justify agreements made at European Union summits and in regular
meetings in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Ministers would have to explain their plans to negotiate
agreements in advance of European Council ministerial meetings and
listen to advice from the Lords.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the commission also recommended the Church of
England be stripped of more than a third of its historic
representation in the House of Lords -- cutting the number of
bishops allowed to sit in the second chamber to 16 from 26.
</P>
<P>
A church spokesman dismissed the report, which could revive
calls in Britain for a formal split between church and state, as
"speculation". The church has said it wants to keep its bishops in
the upper chamber but would welcome leaders of other faiths.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph quoted the draft report as saying the
reformed House of Lords should have "a high degree of political
authority and independent judgment without threatening the
pre-eminence of the Commons".
</P>
<P>
It said the second chamber must have significant independence
from political parties, adequate powers, continuity of membership
to moderate swings in popular opinion, and procedures that promote
open and reasoned debate.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details 214 Feared Dead in EgyptAir flight Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- All the 214 people on board
are feared dead as the EgyptAir Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed
early Sunday off Nantucket, Massachusetts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard has found a body, airplane seats and
lifejackets in the sea about 60 miles south of Nantucket, Coast
Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said in a news
conference, however, that with water temperatures in the 50s (
about 15 Celsius), there was still a possibility of survivors.
</P>
<P>
"The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small
parts that are not identifiable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Larrabee said the operation was still considered a search and
rescue effort. The debris was found in the "general vicinity of
the last known point of contact" with the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
Flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off from
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19 a.m.
local time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from radar
screen at 2 a.m. (0600 GMT). It originated in Los Angeles,
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying at 33,000 feet (9,900 meters), said Eliot
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration (
FAA) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Weather at Kennedy Airport was good with 3 to 4 miles of
visibility and light wind, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
The FAA contacted the Coast Guard about 2:15 local time (0619
GMT), said Coast Guard Lt. Gary Jones.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a very, very aggressive airborne search at this
moment. Basically, if there is someone out there to be saved,
saving lives at sea is our most important mission and we're doing
that," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials in Washington said the twin-engine plane's
takeoff from Kennedy Airport was delayed by two hours because it
arrived late from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport said 197
passengers together with 17 crew member were on board the flight.
The wide-body Boeing passenger jet went into passenger service in
September 1982.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Cairo, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim
Rayan said there were 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three Syrians
and one Chilean, There was no record of the nationality of 131
others.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Investigation Bureau (FBI) and the Joint Terrorist
Task Force have launched a joint investigation into the flight.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette said that "agents are going over
the flight manifest, identifying everyone who touched the plane,
including those who serviced and gassed the aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Valiquette cautioned that there is "no reason to assume this is
a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The FAA issued an alert a month ago to airline and airport
security personnel after agencies received an unconfirmed warning
that a bomb would "soon be used" on a flight departing from Los
Angeles or Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
But officials said they had no reason to believe the
disappearance of the Egyptian flight on Sunday was caused by
sabotage.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 31 (Xinhua)-- Chinese procurators should play
a more active role in smashing illegal activities committed by
cults such as the Falun Gong, by rigorously executing laws, said
Han Zhubin, Procurator-General of China's Supreme People's
Procuratorate here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held today on implementing the resolution to ban
and punish cults adopted by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress on Saturday, Han said, the resolution offers
powerful legal support for procuratorates to ban cults and crack
down their activities.
</P>
<P>
China's justice minister Gao Changli said in another meeting
with Beijing's lawyers that those practising law should be fully
conscious of the true nature of Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong and
actively fight the crimes committed by the handful of Falun Gong
activitists.
</P>
<P>
Many people from all walks of life said they agree with the
anti-cult decision and will fight cult activities with the help of
the anti-cult resolution.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Feng Ziyi of Beijing University showed his support for
the anti-cult resolution saying that banning cults will also help
protect religious activities that are legal.
</P>
<P>
He Enyu, a former Falun Gong practitioner in Tianjin cited his
own experience of being deceived by the Falun Gong, adding that he
hopes other people will learn from his lesson and never be cheated
by the evil cult.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Reduce Inflation Rate to 4 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) - Tanzania will further
reduce its prevailing 7.5 percent inflation rate to four percent
in 2001, according to a report reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Program objectives over 1998/99 to 2000/01 is to reduce
Tanzania's annual inflation rate to 7.5 percent in 1998/99 and
further to about four percent in 2001," said the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) annual report 1999 for Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Tanzania aims to achieve real gross
domestic product (GDP) of at least four percent in 1998/99 and six
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The country is also set to achieve an external current account
deficit that is sustainable in terms of external assistance and
long-term private flows, the report said, adding the fiscal policy
of Tanzania will focus on increasing health and education
expenditure, improving the physical infrastructure and
maintaining a fiscal stand that would allow adequate growth in the
private sector within the context of a prudent monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Tanzanian government's structural
agenda would give priority to restructuring and privatizing public
utilities, such as telecommunications, water and sewerage.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue with its reforms in the financial
sector in an effort to foster competition and efficiency, narrow
the spread between lending and deposit interest rates, and
strengthen the mobilization and allocation of financial resources,
the document said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Protect Endangered Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Experts have called for
immediate measures to enhance conservation of birds in Tanzania to
protect endangered species from extinction.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who met here over the weekend discussing the
development of a national birds conservation strategy, observed
that Tanzania has more than 1,000 bird species, making it one of
the richest countries in Africa in terms of bird life.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is home to 21 species of birds which are not found
anywhere else. However, these birds are threatened by various
factors including habitat losses and degradation, direct
persecution by man and live capture for trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Charles Mlingwa, one of the experts from the
University of Dar es Salaam, there are 52 globally threatened bird
species living in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
There is, therefore, a great need to identify the species that
need more attention and take appropriate actions to conserve them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that habitat loss is affecting forest birds, water
birds, migratory birds and restricted-distribution and rare birds.
</P>
<P>
The government should ban capture and export for species of
major concern, and carry out population surveys of key species so
as to protect them, Mlingwa suggested.

<HEADLINE> Congo Wants Dialog With Uganda: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) is more interested in peace than in fighting with its
neighbors, a Congolese diplomat said here on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Congo likes peace. It is seeking normalization of relations
with Kampala," Charge d'Affaires of the DRC Embassy in Uganda
Adroba Koti told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Congo and Uganda are neighbors for ever. We must stay together
for political, economic and diplomatic reasons," Koti said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda needs the DRC for economic reasons, he said, explaining
that people in the DRC are suffering from lack of food, hospital,
medicine, school while Uganda's economy is in a better shape. So
the DRC can be a big market for the Ugandan products.
</P>
<P>
"Our minister of justice just presented a message to President
Yoweri Museveni from our President Laurent Kabila," Koti said.
"The Ugandan side would send representatives to Kinshasa for peace
talks as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
However, the diplomat did not reveal when the talks would take
place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni reportedly said on
several occasions that he is now more interested in peace and
would like to work together with the DRC for the normalization of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Koti also said that since the signing of Lusaka peace agreement
on July 10, nearly all the belligerents have observed the
cease-fire and efforts are being made to put the peace process
back on track in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He called for an earlier deployment of the United Nations
peace-keeping force in his country to ensure the implementation of
the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into the DRC soon after the rebellion broke
out in the country in early August last year on the ground of
attacking the rebels who operate from bases in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa has been accusing Kampala of backing the rebels
fighting the Kabila government, a charge denied by Uganda.

<HEADLINE> 30 Injured in Opposition-Enforced Shutdown in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- About 30 people, including three
journalists, were injured in the Bangladeshi capital on Monday in
a countrywide hartal (strike), called by the opposition to protest
the Election Commission's decision to hold city corporation
elections.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown, the 13th of its kind sponsored by the opposition
this year, was also aimed at forcing the Awami League-led
government to resign immediately and holding early general
elections.
</P>
<P>
A major clash occurred between pro-hartal activists and police
in front of the head office of the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), injuring about 30 people, including three
photo journalists, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Some 101 people, mainly workers of the opposition parties, were
arrested by police in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly clashes between police and opposition
workers in the southeastern port city Chittagong. No injuries were
reported from other parts of the country so far.
</P>
<P>
The liaison committee of the opposition alliance, which
includes the BNP, the Jatiya Party, the Islami-e-Jamaat and the
Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front), announced new
programs following the dawn-to-dusk shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would hold a demonstration across the country on
Tuesday to protest the arrest of their activists and police's
firing on party workers during the strike, said BNP Secretary
General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan on behalf of the liaison committee.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance would hold rallies on Thursday in
Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi, the three cities where polls to
city corporations would be held in early December, and stage a
42-hour hartal throughout the country on November 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League and its front organizations, meanwhile,
organized anti-hartal marches here in the capital, chanting
anti-hartal slogans, and about 5,000 members of law-enforcement
agencies were deployed in the streets of the capital city to
maintain law and order during the stoppage.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets GCC Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed here Monday morning that China supports the member
countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in their efforts
to get united and self improved so as to achieve common
development.
</P>
<P>
"China and GCC member countries have enjoyed traditional
friendship and good relationship of cooperation," Jiang said while
meeting with GCC Secretary General Jameel Alhojailan at the state
guesthouse of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, the relationship of friendly
cooperation between China and GCC member countries developed
constantly. As a regional organization, the GCC has played a
positive role in promoting the ties between China and every
country of the GCC.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China attaches great importance to
the development of its relationship with the GCC, and is willing
to continue to seek more exchanges between the two sides, and
wider-ranging and higher-level cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China, the biggest developing country and also
one of the most economically vigorous countries in the world, has
rich human resources and great potential of market, while GCC
countries are rich in resources of energy and fund, and the
consumption capability of their residents is also remarkable.
</P>
<P>
As the economy of the two sides are strongly complementary to
each other, it provides great opportunities for furthering their
economic and trade cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the confidence that through joint efforts of
the two sides, the relationship of friendly cooperation between
China and GCC member countries will certainly be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that it is indispensable to have a peaceful and
stable international environment for economic development and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Peace, stability and development of the Gulf region are the
common wishes of the peoples of all countries in the region and
they are also in the fundamental interests of the regional
countries, and are beneficial to world peace, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal requires the joint efforts of all
countries in the Gulf region, Jiang said, adding that the GCC has
scored great achievements in strengthening solidarity and
promoting regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The GCC has also played a more and more important role in
safeguarding the peace and stability in the Gulf region, pushing
forward the Middle East peace process and dealing with other
regional and international issues," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China, as a member of U.N. Security Council, is willing to
maintain consultation and coordination with the GCC on regional
and international affairs, and continue making unremitting efforts
to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East and the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed gratitude to Alhojailan and the GCC
Secretariat for their unremitting efforts in enhancing the
relationship between China and GCC member countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC and China established regular political and economic
consultation mechanism in 1996, Jiang said, adding that in recent
years, the GCC, as an entirety, has shown great interest in
developing its economic and trade cooperation with China and hopes
to seek more ways and channels for cooperation through this
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is delighted at what the GCC has done and
hopes in the heart to further strengthen this mechanism,
especially in promoting economic and trade cooperation between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jiang invited Alhojailan to visit China as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said the volume of trade between the two
sides is about 5 billion U.S. dollars now, which indicates trade
between the two sides will have bright future.
</P>
<P>
Alhojail also expressed appreciation and respect for China's
foreign policy, especially the one on the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges to Promote Investment for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to conduct
a high- level dialog in promoting trade and investment to
accelerate Africa's development, a senior U.N. official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),
Robert Okello, urged African countries to expand trade and
investment, saying that they are keys to sustaining economic
recovery and growth in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day workshop on trade and investment promotion
in southern Africa, Okello said that the ECA has since 1997
established the sub-regional Development Center for Southern
Africa as part of the reform of the commission to better serve
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that his organization has been mandated to support the
economic and social development of Africa, to foster regional
integration and to promote international cooperation for Africa's
development.
</P>
<P>
The ECA has, over the past few years, collaborated with the
World Bank in promoting investment in Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost domestic savings and investment, attract
substantial private foreign investment, and expand trade, African
countries must promote a positive image of Africa as a safe place
for business and investment, maintain peace, security, political
stability, and good governance, said the U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they should also establish an adequate legal and
regulatory framework, improve information flow on economic
development and strengthen international competitiveness to better
participate in the multilateral trading system, Okello added.
</P>
<P>
He hailed that regional integration has been adopted by Africa
to create larger markets and thereby attract more investment.
</P>
<P>
"This, I believe, is the motivation for the declaration of
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) as both a
common market and a common investment area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are keen to work with partners within the U.N. system as
well as beyond it to advance Africa's development objectives," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, David Mpamba, said despite the positive growth
performance of the recent past, current rates of aggregate
investment, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries, remain
far short of what is required to sustain long- term growth at a
level sufficient to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
In fact, average investment as a share of gross domestic
product (GDP) in these countries has been on a continuous decline
-- from 26 percent in the 1970s, to 20 percent in the 1980s and to
16 percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the investment to GDP ratios has undermined the
ability of many countries to adjust their economies effectively,
he said.

<HEADLINE> No Major Breakthrough Expected in Oslo: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Monday that there may be no "major breakthrough" during the
summit with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you should expect some sort of major
breakthrough here," Clinton said at a news briefing after talks
with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians now "have to move into the final
status talks. This is the hard part -- I mean the really hard part,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We all need to support them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks on such issues as Jerusalem, the border,
refugees and water, are set to start on November 7, and will be
completed in about 10 months, according to the timetable proposed
by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, warned against a rush for the
negotiations to meet a deadline and called for an end to the
expansion of Jewish settlements as a precondition.
</P>
<P>
However, all sides seemed to hope this summit would give the
peace process a nudge. "I believe that we can come out of this
meeting and this solemn occasion with a renewed commitment to the
peace process," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We reached agreement in Oslo" six years ago, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said upon arrival at the Grand hotel; "We are
back here again to push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that he believed the Oslo summit would
bring the two sides a step closer to a final status agreement.
Both Israel and the Palestinians have expressed their desire to
solve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
It is not the time for a major breakthrough, Clinton said, "
What we have got to do is to create a renewed energy to make the
process continuous."
</P>
<P>
Bondevik said he hoped that the Israelis and the Palestinians
could find a "package solution" to the thorny issues on their way
to permanent peace.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Has Irrefutable Cult Features: Chinese Social Sciences Circles (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese social science scholars
today said that Falun Gong has all the features of heretical cults
which endanger all of society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), China's top
think-tank, today organized a special symposium for criticizing
the Falun Gong sect and its founder Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
"Li concocted and disseminated fallacies on doomsday and a so-
called global explosion," said Lu Zhongfeng, researcher from the
Institute of History.
</P>
<P>
"Under the pretext of religion, the cult persuaded its
believers to depart from mainstream society," Lu said, "therefore,
it is a kind of spiritual opium."
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the central government's decision to crack down
on the cult, and urged the whole society to thoroughly combat
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress Standing Committee, China's top
legislature, adopted a decision Sunday on banning and punishing
cults like the Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People'
s Procuratorate made legal explanations on punishing Falun Gong-
related criminals.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zexian, a researcher from the Institute of Law, said that
the unprecedented legislative step to fight against heretical
cults shows the state's policy of the rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Accountability Bureau to Be Set Up in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
Pervaiz Musharraf Monday said that a National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) will be set up to conduct the desired
across-the-board accountability process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference here since the military
takeover on October 12, Musharraf said: "The accountability
process is not meant for civilians alone. The armed forces will
also fall under the jurisdiction of the NAB."
</P>
<P>
Announcing immediate plans of his government, Musharraf said
that "revival of the economy, creating harmony between the
provinces, restoring the esteem of the national institutions are
my three main objectives."
</P>
<P>
However, the chief executive did not give any time frame.
</P>
<P>
"There is no time limits, but objective limits. I will do
according to the needs and requirements of Pakistan," said
Musharraf, adding that "after accomplishing these objectives I
will go home like other Pakistanis."
</P>
<P>
He noted that to revive the economy, "political stability,
continuation of policies, sincerity and credibility" are badly
needed.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf promised to depoliticize institutions and
decentralize powers. "People at the grassroots-level will be
ensured to run their own affairs," said Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear issue, he said that for the security of the
Pakistani nation, Pakistan will have to keep "a minimum nuclear
deterrence."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistan wants to resolve all outstanding
issues with its neighbor India. "For the interests of peace and
security in South Asia, the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir has to
be addressed along with other issues," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua)-- The mainland will offer its
research and experience in dealing with earthquakes in a bid to
help the people in Taiwan rebuild their homes, said Chen Yunlin,
director of Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Chen made this statement while meeting with a delegation from
Taiwan. The delegation was the first of its kind to visit the
mainland after a powerful earthquake devastated parts of Taiwan on
September 21.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between seismographers will hopefully reduce the
impact of such natural disasters in the future, Chen added.

"It will also prevent other cults from emerging in the country,
" Chen said.

<P>
Hao Zhiqing, a researcher also from the Institute of History,
said that the Falun Gong sect idolized its founder, organized
secret congregations, and illegally collected money.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on the cult will not change the existing policy
of religious freedom in China, said Hao, who specializes in
religious history.
</P>
<P>
"While combating Falun Gong, the authorities safeguard the
rights of legitimate religions," Hao noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, more than 1,400 people died
as a result of practicing Falun Gong. Seven medical services in
Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shandong reported over 100 cases of
mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
Li Pengcheng, a researcher with the Institute of Philosophy,
urged everyone to pay great attention to ideological construction
in modern times.
</P>
<P>
He said that society needs to standardize its cultural and
ideological mechanism as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Bars Appointment of Officers From Debtor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has frozen appointments of officers at its
secretariat from member states that are in default in terms of
payment of their dues.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Director of Information Mrs. Diop (only last name given)
 disclosed Sunday in Abuja where the regional organization is
headquartered. She revealed that about 10 posts have been frozen.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Nigeria and Ghana, other member countries are in
default in terms of dues, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this development, she further hinted that a
recommendation by legal experts that appointments into positions
at the secretariat should be based on geographical distribution
was jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, only countries that are current in dues payment
would be allowed to hold appointments.
</P>
<P>
The regional body adopted the measure as a way of compelling
debtor member countries to pay up their arrears, the Vanguard
newspaper Monday quoted Diop as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, a proposed Community International Court approved by
the justice ministers of the organization's member states at a
meeting last week would soon be established to wade into cases of
defaulters as well as complaints by individual member countries on
maltreatment, said Diop.
</P>
<P>
The court would be funded from the dividends of the protocol on
 community level, she said, adding that the protocol, when
ratified, requests member states to give 0.5 percent of their levy
on import from non- member countries.
</P>
<P>
Other decisions taken by the ministers include tender code for
award of contracts at the ECOWAS Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
At last week's meeting, Mauritania's absence from the
community's meeting for over 20 years was discussed.
</P>
<P>
The information head of the ECOWAS said that some members had
been mandated to liaise with the country with a view to finding
out the problem with it.
</P>
<P>
According to Diop, Executive Secretary of the ECOWAS Lansana
Kouyale had a number of trouble-shooting missions to Mauritania.

NEW YORK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Search and rescue has entered
the second day Monday in the Atlantic for more findings following
the tragic crash of the EgyptAir 990 Boeing 767 plane Sunday in
which 217 on board were feared dead.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard has scoured 36 miles in waters some 60
miles south of the resort island of Nantucket, Massachusetts, but
so far they found only one body, some clothing, life rafts, seats
and cushions and passports.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, the Norfolk-based Navy salvage ship USS Grapple,
which participated in the wreckage retrieval of TWA Flight 800 in
1996 and Swissair Flight 111 last year, headed for the debris
area.
</P>
<P>
Searchers hope that the vessel, equipped with side-scan sonars
and heavy equipment will be able to collect debris from under the
ocean and large portions of the aircraft which plunged into the
sea half an hour after leaving New York for Cairo early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plane started its flight in Los Angelos and stopped at New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Most of the 199
passengers are said be Americans and Egyptians while the 18
members of the crew are all Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
A command center for massive investigation and recovery was set
up in Quonset Point, Rhode Island and officials were reviewing
radar tapes tracking a two-minute plunge by the stricken airliner.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that some time Monday the search and rescue
mission aimed at finding survivors would shift to the search and
recovery operation as hopes for any survivors in waters in 58
degrees and 270 feet deep have become more and more slim.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Market Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate market
remained on a downward trend in September as stockpiles rocketed
to a record 71 million square meters and sales growth continued to
fall.
</P>
<P>
According to a real estate market report released today by the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the real estate index will
probably slide into the negative zone in the fourth quarter of
this year for the first time in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the growth rate of completed housing was
2.5 times that of sales over the first nine months this year,
while housing prices lingered around 2,000 yuan per square meter.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the falling real estate market on surging
investment prompted by the housing reform policies adopted by the
government last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the first nine months of the year, investment in real
estate development totaled 222.9 billion yuan, increasing 18.5
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Rapid increase of investment led to larger stockpiles in the
lackluster consumption market, which in turn dragged down the
growth of land development and construction.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts say that the housing market is still
undergoing major adjustments, with foreign investment on the slide.
</P>
<P>
The floor space of new housing construction of which started
from January to September dropped by more than 20 percent over the
same period of last year.

<P>
He said the just-enacted resolution of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee to outlaw evil religious groups and
prevent and punish their illegal activities is the will of the

</P>
<P>
Ma Kechang, a well-known Chinese legal expert and a deputy
secretary general of the China Society on the Study of Criminal
Law, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua on the issue of
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Evil religious groups are a kind of social cancer to cheat,
bully and harm the people, the scholar said, emphasizing that it
can not be tolerated by any government that is responsible to the
people.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that industrial countries like Australia,
Belgium, France, Britain, Japan and the United States have
attached great importance to dealing with the issue and they have
stipulated special laws to restrict the spread of "heretical ideas.
"
</P>
<P>
The United States has even used force to crack down on some
evil religious bodies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the nature of Falun Gong, Ma said it has conducted
a series of activities including personality divinization,
cheating, expanding the illegal organization, depriving others of
their independence, freedom, and life, and profiteering and
sabotaging social order and stability.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong shares many similarities with all evil religious
groups in the world, the expert said. The government ban on Falun
Gong is made in accordance with the international convention, has
safeguarded the basic rights of citizens, and is a righteous
action to protect the life of the people and the safety of their
property, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The scholar, now 73, has studied the law for nearly 50 years
and presided over the revision of the Criminal Law of China.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Aims to Enlarge Broadband User Base Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore aims to increase
the number of users of its broadband Infrastructure, Singapore
ONE, from 30,000 to 100,000 next year, said Yeo Cheow Tong,
Communications and IT Minister on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore ONE wants to set up points of presence in key
overseas markets to facilitate information flows and business
transactions to and from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We must build up the user base because without the user base,
there will be very little incentive for the content providers to
come here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore ONE broadband network was launched in June 1998
to enable Singapore to be connected nation-wide, as well as the
Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
It can be accessed via SingTel Magix, an on-line and on-demand
interactive service launched nation-wide in November 1997.

BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A proper balance between
helping business and protecting consumers is important for the
success of British companies' competing globally, Clive Thompson,
president of the Confederation of the British Industry (CBI), said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual conference of CBI, Clive said unbalanced
relations between business and consumers would produce declining
and unprofitable companies as well as high unemployment in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He warned if too much importance is attached to consumers,
aggressive stimulation of consumerism in the market place will
emerge, while overdue attention to business would lead to high
prices, complacent monopolies and low productivity with companies
protected from international competition.
</P>
<P>
However, Clive said that "if you get it right -- not too cold
and not too hot -- you will have low prices and vigorous
competitive companies that are lean and hungry for success in the
global market."

<HEADLINE> Israel to Accept Palestinian Statehood in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel will accept the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state in a framework
agreement, slated for February, for a permanent peace between
Israel and the Palestinians, a local daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak will offer the statehood to the
Palestinians since he prefers to sign a permanent peace agreement
with a recognized state rather than a temporary authority or an
organization, the Haaretz newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace accord signed in early
September, Israel and the Palestinians should reach a permanent
peace agreement by September next year, which will end decades of
conflicts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As the first step toward this agreement, the two sides are
supposed to reach the outlines of the permanent peace treaty by
February.
</P>
<P>
The permanent peace talks, or so-called final-status talks,
will deal with the thorniest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict such as the final status of the Palestinian entity,
final borders, the fate of Palestinian refugeesssues with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a national liberation
movement which has signed all the interim agreements since 1993
with Israel, the paper quoted the government as arguing.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been aspiring to establish an
independent state in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Taking office in July, Barak has suggested that a Palestinian
state is a reality on the ground and what Israel needs to do is to
turn it into a friend rather than an enemy of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Palestinian statehood will be the first
article mentioned in the framework agreement to be signed in
February, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to repeat its demand in the agreement that
the Palestinian state will be demilitarized and will not enter
any military alliance with states hostile to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Barak will recognize the Palestinian
statehood in the framework accord in exchange for Palestinian
agreement to postpone the discussion on two thorny issues, the
futures of Palestinian refugees and the controversial Jerusalem,
till after the deadline for the permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
He has said that if the two sides fail to agree on the
outlines by February, they might have to forgo a final peace
accord in September and instead negotiate long-term interim
agreements on most issues.
</P>
<P>
"That would also be a major achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks drew criticism from the Palestinians, who urged him
to seize the opportunity to speed up the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will formally begin the final-status talks on
Sunday, almost two months after they held an opening ceremony in
September.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in Oslo, Norway on
Tuesday on the sidelines of ceremonies marking four years since
the assassination of late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the final-status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians will dominate the three-way
summit.

JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel carried out a
successful test on its Arrow missile system on Monday at the
eastern sector of the Mediterranean Sea, said the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The missile system will be deployed and put into operation
sometime next year, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
This was the seventh test of the missile system so far. The
first one was conducted in August 1997, but failed.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, the system successfully hit a target of
"coming missile" during the test off the coast of Ashdod.
</P>
<P>
Arrow is an anti-ballistic missile system consisting of radar,
fire control and early warning components. This is the joint
missile defense program between Israel and the United States,
with a total investment of about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Once the system is deployed, it will greatly enhance Israel's
missile defense capability.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling parties
from southern African countries expressed their apprehensions over
the grave military and humanitarian situation in Angola, according
to an official document available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the ruling parties deplored in a declaration issued
after a two-day meeting in Luanda that various resolutions adopted
by the United Nations and regional organizations have never been
rigorously observed by some countries.
</P>
<P>
In consequence, the rebel National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) sold their illegally extracted diamonds and
bought arms for supporting the civil war, which has caused
regional political and social instability, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The regional political leaders reiterated the prejudice to
regional integration and development caused by the war in Angola,
appealing to all the forces loving peace and liberty to react
immediately in a bid to end the prolonged war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reaffirmed that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi is no
longer a valid interlocutor in the negotiations for a solution to
the Angolan conflict, but a convicted war criminal which
constitutes a "danger" for regional peace and stability, said the
document.
</P>
<P>
It added that the heads of the ruling parties also expressed
their profound worry over the destructed social and economic
infrastructure, the augment of the amount of mines planted by the
rebels, the degradation of the living conditions of the population
and the three million displaced persons in the country.
</P>
<P>
The document also appealed to the international community to
promote their solidarity with the Angolan people and provide them
with more humanitarian assistance for avoiding a humanitarian
catastrophe.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd Baghdad International
Fair opened here on Monday with the participation of some 900
foreign and Arab companies from 36 countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said Iraq holds the annual trade fair in an
effort to strengthen Iraq's economic and trade cooperation with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan condemned the continuation of the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq, calling them the most destructive weapons, which, according
to a survey conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund, have
killed over 1 million Iraqi children in the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
Due to the opposition of the U.S. and Britain against the
lifting of the sanctions on Iraq, the Iraqi people have been
suffering from a severe lack of medicine and food, and the
mortality rates among children have more than doubled, said the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years, Iraq has suffered a loss of 140
billion U.S. dollars in oil revenues due to the sanctions, said
Ramadan, adding that Iraq has received a total of 5.2 billion
dollars of humanitarian goods since the imposition of the
oil-for-food program in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Before the imposition of the sanctions, Iraq's exports reached
an annual average of 30 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan accused the U.S. and British representatives at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of deliberately delaying and suspending
Iraqi contracts with the aim of further harming the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He slammed the U.S. and Britain for their daily violation of
Iraqi airspace and attacks against Iraqi civilian, military and
economic targets, which he said are aimed at infringing upon
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq has fulfilled all its commitments to
relevant U.N. resolutions and it is time for the U.N. to lift its
nine-year-old sanctions on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Thai CPI Drops 0.5 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumer prices
index (CPI) dropped 0.5 percent in October compared to the same
month last year, while wholesale prices fell 6.6 percent, the
Commerce Ministry's Department of Internal Trade announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
In September, the CPI declined 0.8 percent year-on-year, while
wholesale prices dropped 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Month-on-month, the consumer price index was up 0.2 percent to
128.4 points in October, while the wholesale price index was down
0.2 percent, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi remained
upbeat on the country's export growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said early Monday that if the gross domestic product
(GDP) growth this year is up more than five percent, he believed
an export growth of four to five percent or even seven percent is
achievable next year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand set an export target in 1999 at 56.6 billion U.S.
dollars, or a four percent increase from last year's 54.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country's exports have reached 42.34 billion
dollars in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the baht's strength should be a major hurdle for
exports, Supachai vowed to seek other measures in case that the
Thai currency continues to appreciate against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded at 38.57 baht to the dollar Monday instead
of about 41 baht to the dollar in late September, the lowest level
in 13 months.

<HEADLINE> Manila Enhances Anti-Drug Cooperation with Other Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
enhanced cooperation with at least three countries in keeping
watch over the activities of narcotics traffickers and those
engaged in money laundering, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio speech, Police Director Jewel Canson, who is also
the head of the National Drug Law Enforcement Prevention
Coordination Center, said this is now the priority of the
Philippines, the United States, Britain and Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We exchange intelligence information to strengthen our cases
against suspected drug lords. Our coordination is well in place,"
Canson said.
</P>
<P>
According to Canson, the Philippines has been coordinating for
quite some time with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in working
against drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The system has so far been fruitful, with Philippine law
enforcers working on leads provided by their foreign counterparts,
and vice versa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Drugs are deemed to be the root cause of most heinous crimes
and threaten to destroy the future of the Filipino youth.
</P>
<P>
In August, the government launched a multisectoral anti-drug
movement to generate awareness among ordinary citizens on the
ill-effects of illegal drugs and urge their participation in the
campaign to eradicate this menace.
</P>
<P>
To show his seriousness in the combat, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada on October 27 led the burning of 107 kilos of
shabu, or methamphetamine hydrochloride, in the presidential
palace.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Export Diamonds Worth $4 Bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Angola's UNITA rebels have
exported four- billion-U.S.-dollar diamonds to foreign private
enterprises as investments in sophisticated armaments and the
reinforcement of mercenary.
</P>
<P>
The exported diamonds are extracted in the areas under the
control of the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), the official Jornal de Angola newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the embargo imposed by the United Nations, the delivery
of arms to the UNITA continues, which supported the rebels in the
fierce battles against the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA also received support from a certain private
enterprise specialized in military supplies, which has helped the
rebels get their military equipments and train the rebel troops,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted expert Enrique Bernales-Ballesteros as saying:
"It is necessary to control the (illegal) market and reinforce the
mechanism for maintaining peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Southwest African countries have seen a rapid development of
the private enterprises specialized in recruitment of mercenary
and military supplies, which have been directly involved in the
elevated conflicts in Angola, the Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> New Volleyball Rules to Be Introduced at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Some new rules will be introduced
and tested at the Eighth World Cup Volleyball Tournament which
starts in Japan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) -
the governing body of the sport, rally-point system will be
applied to the World Cup competitions for the first time. With
this new system, the team winning a rally scores a point
regardless of which side is serving. When the serving team wins a
rally, it gains a point and the right to serve.
</P>
<P>
The set points are also changed. The coming World Cup format
is the best of five sets to 25 points for sets one to four. In the
fifth set, it is still 15 points.
</P>
<P>
These new score system was used in the World League for men and
World Grand Prix for women competitions earlier this year and this
is the first time to officially implement the system in a world
top-level event.
</P>
<P>
New rules applied in the World Cup for test included serve.
When serving, if a ball touches the net and goes to the opposite
side, the play will continue. FIVB said these changes aims at
decreasing the possibilities for a team to lose a point when
serving even before a rally is played, and making the sport more
exciting and attractive.
</P>
<P>
In the coming World Cup, the three-colored ball and the freedom
of movement for coaches will also apply for the first time.

CANBERRA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Phil Coles, an Australian
member of the International Olympic Committee, said the safest and
cleanest way to stay away from scandal is to take a visit ban of
the bidding cities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Adjust Crops Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's
scrapping of protective prices for farm produce has accelerated
the restructuring of planting patterns among the country's farmers.
</P>
<P>
The results of a nationwide survey released today by the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that the planting area of
winter wheat decreased by 1.5 percent from the same period of last
year, while that of oil seeds and vegetables grew by 12.2 percent
and 8.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Though the total planting area of winter grain crops decreased
slightly from last year, the total planting area of all crops
increased by two percent due to the great increase of industrial
crops.
</P>
<P>
The NBS stated in a report that prices of grain have dropped
continuously as the country reaped bumper harvests for several
consecutive years. The government scrapped the minimum prices for
purchasing grain from farmers last year and adopted a policy of
paying less for lower quality grain.
</P>
<P>
These factors combined to prompt farmers in major grain-growing
areas to continue reducing the planting area of winter grain
because it is now fetching lower prices.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, farmers continued increasing the planting
areas of oil crops and vegetables, products in great demand.
</P>
<P>
This winter, the growing demand for animal farming and
fertilizer has prompted farmers to increase the planting areas of
green fodder and fertilizer crops by five percent and 3.5 percent,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Inject $1.59 Bln in Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Niger delta, a hotbed
of violence in recent years, may get at least about 150 billion
naira (1.59 billion U.S. dollars) from the federal government
during the next four years for its socio-political and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
A bill seeking approval of the allocation under the
newly-founded Niger Delta Development Commission is to be
presented to the Senate this week, the Guardian newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission headed by Senator Fred Brume was proposed by
President Olusegun Obasanjo in the aftermath of the June Warri
crisis in Delta State, which killed several hundred people and
destabilized the whole delta region where the country's oil wealth
has been coming from.
</P>
<P>
Most of the oil dollar flow from the region goes to foreign oil
firms and the Nigerian federal government, which makes the wealth
generating region the most impoverished area in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
This situation, as many believe, contributes to the decades
long violence in the area between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working very hard on the issue of Niger Delta
development. The committee will submit its findings this week to
the Senate," Alhaji Ajadi, member of the Senate Committee on Niger
Delta, said Sunday in Ilorin, a city in the delta area.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, the place is like a wasted land with bad terrain,
despite its huge contributions to the income of the nation," he
said. "We can change the terrible condition if we are serious.
After all, delta regions in other parts of the world are like
tourist centers."
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has reportedly listed the delta issue as a
top priority for his government, along with the tasks of
anti-corruption and economic rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Further Business Reform: Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of
Exchequer Gordon Brown said here Monday that urgent action would
be taken to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start and run
successful business.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Confederation of British Industry's annual
conference, Brown said the pre-budget report to be submitted next
week will include a package of proposed reforms for the capital
and product markets.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also make it a priority to create full
employment.
</P>
<P>
The reform, aimed at encouraging innovation and a more
enterprise oriented culture, is coupled with the intention of
raising labor productivity by improving Britain's skills base.
</P>
<P>
Brown stressed the need to further develop an "enterprise
society" in Britain which was proposed by Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
"I want Britain to be, in every area, a creative, innovative
and enterprising economy," he said, adding, "The new economy will
need more competition, more entrepreneurship, more flexibility and
more long-term investment."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Brown announced a scheme to give tax relief on share
options for executives from small and medium-sized companies with
assets of up to 15 million pounds, which is expected to cost the
Inland Revenue about 40 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the plan will give a further boost to
Britain's economy.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Get Balance Between Business, Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government must
get the right balance between helping business and protecting
consumers if British companies are to be successful in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
Clive Thompson, president of the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) made the remarks in his opening address at the CBI
National Conference in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
"Minimum standards for employees in the workplace, aggressive
stimulation of consumerism in the market place and rapid change
through globalization and new technologies" could lead to a severe
dose of influenza for those of the delegates attending the
conference here, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, most of the delegates said that the
government must get the balance right. Too hot towards business
produces high prices, complacent monopolies and low productivity
with companies protected from international competition. It is
possible to be too pro-business.
</P>
<P>
They also said too hot towards the consumer and too cold
towards business produces declining and unprofitable companies.
The British markets would be progressively dominated by overseas
firms, creating high unemployment in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Clive said, "if you get it right - not too cold and not too hot
- you will have low prices and vigorous competitive companies that
are lean and hungry for success in global markets."

<HEADLINE> World Cup Women's Volleyball Tourney to Start on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Cuba is among
the top favorites to win the title at the coming Eighth World Cup
Women's Volleyball Tournament which starts in Japan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial event which will be held in eight cities
throughout Japan between November 2 and 16, will draw the world
best teams of Argentina, Brazil, China, Croatia, Cuba, Italy,
South Korea, Peru, Russia, Tunisia, the United States and host
Japan to fight for the prestigious Cup.
</P>
<P>
These teams, divided into two groups with the matches being
held in the cities including Tokyo, Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya,
Okayama, Toyama, Kanazawa and Osaka, will play in a single round-
robin system and the winner will be decided by points gained in
the matches. The top three finishers will automatically gain the
right to play in the Sydney Olympic Games next year.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban squad, winner of the previous three editions in 1989 ,
1991 and, will field an impressive line-up with veterans and
newcomers in the coming event. Although they did not manage to win
the Pan-American Games and failed to qualify for the final round
of the World Women's Grand Prix earlier this year, the Cubans
worked hard and showed signs of recovering as they won the North
and Central American Championships against the best teams such as
the United States and Canada recently.
</P>
<P>
Their main opponents will be the Russians, Brazilians and
Chinese. Absent from the last edition of the World Cup, Russia,
champion of this year's World Grand Prix, is back confident with a
successful team to get a ticket to the Olympics. The powerful
attacks, stable blockings and safe receipt are the strength of the
Russian team headed by legendary coach Nikolai Karpol.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians gained the berth in the coming World Cup after
winning their 11th title at the South American Championships last
September. The team, which had a reshuffle after last year's World
Championships, showed good results this year by beating Cuba twice
in the Pan American Games and took the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Asian champion China, winner of the Cup twice in the 80s, is
also a strong contender for the medals. With their excellent
technique, the ability to combine defense and attack, and quick
changes in the tactic of attacking, the re-built Chinese team
will only steel for one of the podium places to obtain a direct
qualification to the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
To make the matches more excited and attractive, the
International Volleyball Federation also introduced new rules --
called rally point system -- in the coming event. The team winning
a rally scores a point regardless of which side is serving. when
the serving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to
serve. Moreover, the three-colored ball and the free movement for
coaches will also apply for the first time in the World Cup event.

<HEADLINE> Congo Denies U.N. Security Assurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) has continued to deny the United
Nations written security assurance, U.N.'s Mission Organization
Nations Unes Congo (MONUC) member Major David Hannah disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Sunday, Hannah said that this is delaying
the deployment of a U.N. technical survey team, The Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hannah, who is based in Kinshasa where the U.N. has 30 military
experts under MONUC, said the technical survey team was supposed
to go specific locations in the DRC to monitor the cease-fire but
can only do so if the DRC government gives written security
assurances.
</P>
<P>
He said all the other signatory countries to the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka earlier this year gave the assurance
three weeks ago during the Joint Military Commission (JMC) meeting
in Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said DRC representatives in the commission could not do
so because they did not have sufficient authority from the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC government seems not to understand the technical
survey team's role," Hannah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the team's role was to provide logistical supplies and
do the ground work before the U.N. peace mission is deployed and
that they do this by going to specific locations identified by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hannah hoped that a JMC meeting in Lusaka would persuade the
DRC to give the security assurance.
</P>
<P>
He said a security assurance is a written statement bloy a peace-keeping
mission in the DRC and had been planning for the mission for the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He said some observer troops have been deployed by the U.N. in
all the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement signatory countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Ban on Foreign Professors Draws Outcry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A ban on non-Jordanian professors
from working in public and private universities in Jordan will
harm the higher education system of the kingdom, the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision would isolate Jordan's universities from the
rest of the world," the paper quoted President of the prestigious
Jordan University Walid Maani as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government decided earlier this month that Jordanian
universities are no longer allowed to hire non-Jordanian
professors unless the position available had been advertised in
local papers.
</P>
<P>
The universities must also explain why they choose a foreign
professor instead of a Jordanian for the post.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently aimed at bringing down the unemployment
rate among postgraduates. Unemployed Ph.D. holders alone have
amounted to 123 in the kingdom so far.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Higher Education said 645 non-Jordanian
professors are working in private and public schools of the
kingdom, most of them are Arab nationals from Egypt, Iraq, Sudan
or India.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, hundreds of prominent Iraqi
professors came to Jordan for jobs after Iraq's economic situation
began to deteriorate due to the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1991
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi professors, most of them from prominent Iraqi
universities, have helped revolutionize the education system of the
desert kingdom. However, the ban "turned things upside down", said
Jordanian education experts.

Most affected by the government decision are universities

<HEADLINE> Republic Won't Enhance Australia in Asia: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia could continue to
play an effective regional role without becoming a republic, Prime
Minister John Howard said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Amid suggestions that a successful "no" vote in Saturday's
referendum on republic would cause international embarrassment,
the anti-republican prime minister said Australia's regional
standing would be unaffected by it remaining a constitutional
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Australia will play a stronger or more effective
role in the region as a republic," Howard told CNBC Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We already play a very strong role in the region with our
present constitution and I'm quite certain that if we continue
with it after Saturday we'll continue to be just as effective and
strong and clear in the region as we are now," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another interview, Howard told ABC Radio that there is no
likelihood of a future referendum on a directly-elected Australian
president.
</P>
<P>
"I think if the currently proposed model gets up, that will be
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian voters will go to the referendum on Saturday to
decide whether the country should be established as a republic
with the queen and governor-general being replaced by a president
appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the
commonwealth parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, the opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley
said that if a "yes" vote is successful on Saturday and he is
elected to government two years from now, he would offer the
Australian people a direct election model.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has so
far assisted a total of 53,038 workers displaced by the Asian

<P>
Under this order, the department moved to speed up approval of
proposed projects costing less than 500,000 pesos (12,500 U.S.
dollars) by its regional coordinating committees.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said 13,986 of the displaced workers were provided
with retraining skills to enable them to get alternative jobs or
pursue livelihood activities.
</P>
<P>
To boost their productivity and competitiveness, the skills of
7,489 industrial workers, along with 3,784 medium enterprise
workers, were also upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, 4,139 rural workers were trained in non-farm skills
to provide them with greater flexibility and enhance their
opportunities to get jobs.

<P>
A total of 10,273 displaced workers were also assisted through
temporary jobs in community-based projects to enable them to meet
their basic needs.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Asian Immigrants Abandoned off Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-three Asians to be
smuggled to Italy on a cargo boat, were found set adrift off the
Lebanese coast, several days after they were abandoned, the Daily
Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Navy found the boat on Friday night during a
routine patrol off Lebanon and towed the boat to Lebanon's
southern-most harbor of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
Security sources quoted the people on board as saying that they
had paid 2,000 U.S. dollars each to the seamen to take them from
Greece to Italy, where they would be smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
After two or three days into the trip, the captain claimed
that he had run into a "technical problem" and needed to return
to Greece to obtain spare parts.
</P>
<P>
He and the crewmen boarded two lifeboats and vanished, the
passengers said, adding that the captain was an Arab but they did
not know his nationality.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli patrol towed the boat to Israel after sending
the passengers to the Lebanese shore.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the passengers were not taken to Israel, one
Lebanese official said "they don't want to cough up money to
accommodate them."
</P>
<P>
On the passenger list were 49 Bangladeshis, 11 Iraqis, six
Egyptians, three Indians, two Sri Lankan women, an Iranian and
an Algerian.

JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The cases against some of the Christians recently expelled
by Israel's Interior Ministry were initiated by the American
police and the British police, rather than the Israel Police,
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel deported twelve Americans and two Britons last week,
saying they belong to two religious groups which might cause
damage to themselves or others in an attempt to hasten the
so-called Second Coming by Jesus in the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The framework agreement to be signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in February will include Israel's acceptance of the
establishment of a Palestinian state in part of the West Bank and
Gaza, according to the results of informal contacts between
Israel, the United States and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The actual establishment of the Palestinian state will occur
on the eve of the signing of the detailed final agreement, which
is slated for the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton flew to Oslo, Norway Sunday in advance of a three-way
summit Tuesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which aims

The results of initial production tests showed gas flowing
from the well at a rate of 21 million cubic feet per day,
equivalent to 4,000 barrels of crude. But the company cautioned
that it is too early to say whether the find is of commercial
value.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Ban on Foreign Professors Draws Outcry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A ban on non-Jordanian professors
from working in public and private universities in Jordan will
harm the higher education system of the kingdom, the semi-official
Jordan Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision would isolate Jordan's universities from the
rest of the world," the paper quoted President of the prestigious
Jordan University Walid Maani as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government decided earlier this month that Jordanian
universities are no longer allowed to hire non-Jordanian
professors unless the position available had been advertised in
local papers.
</P>
<P>
The universities must also explain why they choose a foreign
professor instead of a Jordanian for the post.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently aimed at bringing down the unemployment
rate among postgraduates. Unemployed Ph.D. holders alone have
amounted to 123 in the kingdom so far.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Higher Education said 645 non-Jordanian
professors are working in private and public schools of the
kingdom, most of them are Arab nationals from Egypt, Iraq, Sudan
or India.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, hundreds of prominent Iraqi
professors came to Jordan for jobs after Iraq's economic situation
began to deteriorate due to the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1991
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi professors, most of them from prominent Iraqi
universities, have helped revolutionize the education system of the
desert kingdom. However, the ban "turned things upside down", said
Jordanian education experts.
</P>
<P>
Most affected by the government decision are universities
seeking to recruit non-Jordanian professors specialized in
disciplines non-existent in the kingdom, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adds with background Clinton Arrives in Norway for State Visit, Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here Monday for a one-day state visit to Norway and a
summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the airport that he believed both Barak
and Arafat want to continue the peace process, which was put into
motion by the signing of the Oslo accord, the first and historic
framework for Palestinian autonomy, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and Mideast peace envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian King Harald V hosted a grand welcoming ceremony in
honor of Clinton, the first sitting U.S. president to visit the
Scandinavian countries in history.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will attend a ceremony on Tuesday to commemorate late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was killed by an
extremist Israeli opponent of his peace policies four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president will enter into political discussions with
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. His visit is
scheduled to end Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on
Monday separately and sit together with the two on Tuesday
afternoon in what is called an unofficial summit to give momentum
to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, there have been attempts to lower
expectations for the summit. Many now believe the summit is more
ceremonial than substantial.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Palestinian Council Ahmad Queria, also known as Abu
Ala, said that the Palestinians hoped this summit would "stop the
settlement activities" in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been accused of giving the green light to the
expansion of settlements at a faster pace than his hard-line
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The settlements are "a major obstacle" to a Palestinian-Israeli
agreement, Abu Ala said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has committed to work out outlines of an agreement on
permanent status issues, such as Jerusalem, border, refugee and
water-sharing by mid-February and finish the task by September
2000.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are to take to the arduous journey on November 7,
and the Palestinians resisted a rush to conclude the bargaining in
order to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
However, what is conspicuous is that there is no public agenda
of meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations. But it
is believed that the talks will be held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Neither is there a two-party meeting between Barak, who arrived
here Sunday night, and Arafat, who is arriving here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the summit offers an opportunity for the two sides to sound
each other out over their visions of a final settlement to the
Israeli-Palestinian disputes.

<HEADLINE> Congo Denies U.N. Security Assurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) has continued to deny the United
Nations written security assurance, U.N.'s Mission Organization
Nations Unes Congo (MONUC) member Major David Hannah disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Sunday, Hannah said that this is delaying
the deployment of a U.N. technical survey team, The Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hannah, who is based in Kinshasa where the U.N. has 30 military
experts under MONUC, said the technical survey team was supposed
to go specific locations in the DRC to monitor the cease-fire but
can only do so if the DRC government gives written security
assurances.
</P>
<P>
He said all the other signatory countries to the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka earlier this year gave the assurance
three weeks ago during the Joint Military Commission (JMC) meeting
in Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said DRC representatives in the commission could not do
so because they did not have sufficient authority from the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC government seems not to understand the technical
survey team's role," Hannah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the team's role was to provide logistical supplies and
do the ground work before the U.N. peace mission is deployed and
that they do this by going to specific locations identified by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hannah hoped that a JMC meeting in Lusaka would persuade the
DRC to give the security assurance.
</P>
<P>
He said a security assurance is a written statement by the
belligerents in DRC that they will support the U.N. in the areas
they control.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said the U.N. was ready to deploy a peace-keeping
mission in the DRC and had been planning for the mission for the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He said some observer troops have been deployed by the U.N. in
all the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement signatory countries.

KUNMING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Tourists will see colorful
blossoms and flourishing plants in Yunnan Province even in winter,
says Yan Shuping, the man in charge of gardening affairs at the '
99 World Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee said that all the gardens will remain
unchanged for the next six months, even though the exposition
ended on October 31.
</P>
<P>
The working staff in the botanical garden will cover the stems
of the tropical plants with high-quality plastic, and they will
also maintain the temperature, said Yan.
</P>
<P>
Although Kunming, the provincial capital, is known as the "City
of Spring" in China, it may well see snowfall during the winter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of a warm winter made by the local weather bureau
has put the staff at ease, but, "we have made full preparations
and allocated 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 U.S. dollars) to ensure
the tropical plants will survive the cold days," said Yan.
</P>
<P>
"We will change the plants and flowers every 50 days, and all
the scenery will remain as beautiful as before," added he.
</P>
<P>
"Plants, like human beings, need some time to adapt to a new
environment, and they will be able to live in the city if they
survive the first winter," said Yan.

human growth hormone (HGH) during next year's Olympic Games, said
a drug researcher on Monday.
</P>
<P>
London-based Professor Peter Sonksen said that his HGH2000
project team was in need of another five million U.S. dollars from
the IOC immediately if it was to validate a test for the banned
substance by next year.
</P>
<P>
The IOC and European Union have co-funded the initial stage of
the project with the view of finding a test for synthetic HGH in
time for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We completed our project on time and within budget in January
and here we are on the first of November and we've seen no
movement," Sonksen said when addressing the fifth IOC Sports
Sciences Congress at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We're very enthusiastic to get on with the validation. We've
been sitting and twiddling our thumbs since March -- we haven't
really had any progress since then."
</P>
<P>
The IOC promised in February to spend 16 million U.S. dollars
more on anti-doping research, but had yet to decide which groups
to fund.
</P>
<P>
They have been preoccupied with such major issues like the
bickering about the proposed new International Anti-Doping Agency
and the reform process initiated by the Salt Lake City bribes-for-
votes scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, IOC medical commission president
Prince Alexandre de Merode all but ruled out a HGH test being in
place for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He said the IOC had convened a meeting of legal and medical
experts in March who found that a scientifically and legally
acceptable test was two or three years away.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rubber Output to Post 13 Percent Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rubber output is
estimated to reach 185,000 tons this year, an increase of 13
percent over last year, local business newspaper The Saigon Time
Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rubber is one of Vietnam's important export commodities.
However, the low price of rubber in the world markets turns out a
big concern for the country, as it's rubber stockpiles have
increased by 20 percent to 30 percent to between 15,000 and 20,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Vietnam Rubber Corporation said that the
disbandment of the International Natural Rubber Organization has
badly affected Vietnam's rubber export.
</P>
<P>
"Southeast Asian countries now have to regulate rubber prices
on their own depending on market demands, something that was done
previously by the organization," he said
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Vietnamese official emphasized, Vietnam should
make sure 60 percent of its rubber output were sold to stable
markets, and the remainder to unstable markets.
</P>
<P>
This year rubber exports to stable markets had reached more
than 50,000 tons, he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Vietnam Rubber Corporation manages about 200,000
hectares of rubber, and localities manage an additional 100,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to expand its area under rubber cultivation to
700,000 hectares by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Congo Denies U.N. Security Assurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) has continued to deny the United
Nations written security assurance, U.N.'s Mission Organization
Nations Unes Congo (MONUC) member Major David Hannah disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Sunday, Hannah said that this is delaying
the deployment of a U.N. technical survey team, The Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hannah, who is based in Kinshasa where the U.N. has 30 military
experts under MONUC, said the technical survey team was supposed
to go specific locations in the DRC to monitor the cease-fire but
can only do so if the DRC government gives written security
assurances.
</P>
<P>
He said all the other signatory countries to the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka earlier this year gave the assurance
three weeks ago during the Joint Military Commission (JMC) meeting
in Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said DRC representatives in the commission could not do
so because they did not have sufficient authority from the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC government seems not to understand the technical
survey team's role," Hannah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the team's role was to provide logistical supplies and
do the ground work before the U.N. peace mission is deployed and
that they do this by going to specific locations identified by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hannah hoped that a JMC meeting in Lusaka would persuade the
DRC to give the security assurance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Pulverizing Crop Stalks to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in north China's
Hebei province now pay to have crop stalks pulverized instead of
burning them to reduce pollution, local officials report.
</P>
<P>
The back-to-the-earth method will help enrich farmland and will
cause no air pollution, says Ma Yanjun, a farmer who bought a 6,
000 yuan (720 U.S. dollars) machine for this purpose. Some farmers
around the cities of Beijing and Tianjin are also using the new
eco-friendly method.
</P>
<P>
The over 600 million tons of crop stalks left in China every
year used to be used for cattle and horse fodder and for fuel by
farmers. And, when coal and liquefied gas began to take their
place, farmers just burned the stubble. In September of 1997, the
large-scale burning of stubble kept three airplanes from landing
at Shijiazhuang Airport because of low visibility, and the
proportion of carbon monoxide was four to five time higher than
normal at that time.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenjun, head of the Hebei Agricultural Machinery
Administration, says that to solve the problem they have allocated
10 million yuan this year to help farmers buy pulverizing machines
at a cost of 2,000 yuan each in the city of Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Finance Ministries have increased
allocations for research on the use of stalks and have implemented
restrictions on burning in the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and
Shanghai and in Jiangsu and Hebei provinces.

<HEADLINE> University Aids Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The University of Science and
Technology in China's Anhui province recently provided financial
assistance for 179 undergraduates by cutting tuition and fees by a
total of 350,000 yuan (42,300 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The school reduces tuition and fees of 3 percent of the
undergraduates, who have difficulty in paying for their studies,
every year, and freshmen from poor families are allowed to delay
paying tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established a
100,000-yuan fund for the University of Science and Technology to
help some very poor students from remote underdeveloped areas. The
students can qualify for 2,000 to 5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The school provides poor students with additional food
subsidies. Students also have a chance to do part time work as
teaching or research assistants.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 33 percent of the poor students qualify for a
scholarship of 500 to 3,000 yuan from 24 funds at the school.
Since 1986, it has provided interest-free loans of 200,000 to 300,
000 yuan annually and excellent students can postpone repayment or
do not have to repay the loans. The school has a low tuition
policy and attracts a large number of excellent students from poor
families, and no one has had to stop his or her study because of
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Energy Output Up 39.6 Percent in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines on Monday posted
a total energy output of 16.8 million barrels of fuel oil
equivalent during the first half of the year, or a 39.6 percent
increase from last year's 12 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) said
the government was able to save at least 220 million U.S. dollars
during the period in terms of displaced importations, or an
increase of 48 percent compared to last year's record of 149
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The computation was based on the average crude import price
from January to June 1999 at 13.1 dollars per barrel as against
12.3 dollars per barrel in 1998, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Of the indigenous energy sources the country has, geothermal
power accounted for 51.6 percent of the total production in the
first half of the year. Hydropower resources contributed 35.1
percent; coal, 24.4 percent; and oil and gas, 0.8 percent, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
The PNOC attributed this improvement to the commissioning of
the Mindanao II grid which contributed an additional capacity of
48 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The projected indigenous energy demand of the country for this
year is expected to reach 103 million barrels of fuel oil as
against imported energy of 142 million barrels, or a total of 245
million barrels, the report added.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has reiterated his determination in fighting corruption,
saying that corrupt officials will be hunted down like rats.
</P>
<P>
The crusade against corruption will be intensified and that no
stone will be left unturned, Moi said at the weekend after
returning here from a seven-day official visit to Belgium,
Luxembourg and Germany.
</P>
<P>
It is wrong for the government to be blamed for evils
perpetrated by individuals, the Kenya Times newspaper Monday
quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moi also warned commercial banks against misuse of the funds
channelled by foreign donors meant to aid Kenya's flagging
economy.
</P>
<P>
The head of state disclosed that the European Union has granted
3.2 billion shillings (about 42.6 million U.S. dollars) to a
power-generating plant in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Anti-corruption is the precondition left to be fulfilled by
Kenya in oder to win the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
restart the talks on a 205-million-dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the loan in July 1997, which undermined
foreign investors' confidence in Kenya's economy.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Capable of Holding Top World Conferences (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The success of the '99 World
Horticulture Expo, which ended yesterday in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, has demonstrated China's
competence for hosting top world conferences, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
The expo, participated in by 95 countries and international
organizations, has received nearly 10 million visitors since it
opened on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the six-month expo has shown the country's high
efficiency in organization and administration.
</P>
<P>
Actually, China has accumulated experience by hosting a series
of international meetings over the past decade, including the
Fourth World Conference on Women, the 96th Congress of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union, and the 22nd Meeting of the Universal Postal
Union.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of this event, both the central
government and the Yunnan provincial people's government attached
great importance to organizing the exposition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 billion yuan was used to improve infrastructure
facilities in the province, and investment in the expo gardens
alone amounted to two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to invest in world meetings like this expo
because they may help us gain recognition and develop the local
economy," said Yunnan Provincial Governor Li Jiating.

<HEADLINE> A Slow Process (RPT)  By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia has made considerable
progress in addressing the problems in its ailing banking system
over the past two years, but the reform has turned out to be a
very slow, painful and difficult process.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies started to consolidate their vulnerable banking
systems soon after a financial storm hit the region in July 1997.
Since then, Asian economies have adopted new regulations of
lending and supervision, enforced bank re-capitalization, and
encouraged bank mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
However, the real progress is uneven on different fronts of the
banking sector. Malaysia has made a great deal of progress in
getting bad debts off its bank's books and encouraging
consolidation in the financial sector. And Singapore has got even
higher remarks. Negotiations for sales of local banks to foreign
partners have wound up successfully in Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, non-performing loans remain too high in
most of East Asian countries, around 10 to 60 percent of their
total banking loans. The problem is very serious in Indonesia,
South Korea and Thailand, directly threatening to derail their
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank Study released in September, by the
end of June, 64 percent of Indonesian companies were unable to
produce enough cash from day-to-day operations to cover their
interest obligations to banks; 27 percent of South Korean
companies, 26 percent of Malaysian companies, and 28 percent of
Thai companies were in the same dangerous boat.
</P>
<P>
Because of the massive non-performing loans, the cost of
restructuring and consolidation of the banking system is very high
in Asian countries. In Thailand, where the non-performing loan
ratio is put at 50-60 percent by some economists, the cost of
restructuring banks could cost 20 percent to 30 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
"After a banking crisis it takes on average three years for an
emerging market to return to pre-crisis growth. But given the
magnitude of financial claims to be restructured and the scale of
corporate distress, the recovery of East Asia could take even
longer," said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Asian countries have realized the
importance of banking reform and tried to speed up the process.
But in practice, the reforms proved to be hard enough.
</P>
<P>
In late October, Malaysia abandoned its controversial
bank-consolidation plan and replaced it with one that allows the
country's banks to choose their own merger partners. The new plan
also extends the deadline for consolidation by nine months to the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government move means that local banks are no longer bound
by a central bank plan to consolidate them into six large banks
selected by authorities. It also means large banking groups that
would have been absorbed under their original plan can now emerge
as so-called anchor banks.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, despite the difficulties, the process of banking
reform, although slow, is continuing in the region. In Thailand,
the central bank recently set rules on cross-holding between
commercial banks and other companies to foster transparency and to
prevent any conflict of interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, if board members or senior executives of a
commercial bank also sit on a company's board, the bank cannot
lend the company more than 50 percent of the company's
shareholders' equity, and not more than 25 percent of the
company's loan outstanding.
</P>
<P>
"Board members or senior executives of commercial banks should
devote their knowledge, ability and time to the commercial bank
fully," said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, banking consolidation has speed up with
mergers. Last month, Bank of the Philippine Island and Far East
Bank and Trust Co. agreed to merge, creating the country's largest
bank. The latest move is expected to push local banks to step up
their mergers and acquisition to enhance their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
But economists urge Asian governments to make even greater
efforts to push through the banking reforms and let the sector
play its key role in the economic recovery.

decades, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
All the other provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
of the country have contributed to the expo as well, and analysts
say such joint efforts are impossible in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time China has held a major international
event in accordance with market economic operations, demonstrating
that the country is now familiar with the procedures of
international conferences, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most attractive markets in the world, a major
reason many international organizations have chosen China for
their meetings, the country will play an even larger role in the
world economy, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Shao Qiwei, secretary general of the expo's organizing
committee, said that China's rising international status and its
growing political, economic and diplomatic influence are also
favorable conditions for the country to hold international
conferences.
</P>
<P>
"All participants will benefit from international conferences
which meet in China," Shao said.

<P>
Beijing Vice Mayor Liu Aimin said now that Yunnan, an
underdeveloped area in China, has managed to make an international
conference a success, relatively developed areas like Beijing and
Shanghai can do even better.

<HEADLINE> China's Earliest Capital Site in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Recent archaeological
findings reveal that Dengfeng in Central China's Henan Province is
very likely to be the earliest capital site in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
An Jinhuai, a 78-year-old archeologist in charge of excavation
projects in Dengfeng for the past 50 years, said what
archaeologists have unearthed might shed lights on the hypothesis
that Dengfeng was the earliest capital of China's first dynasty--
Xia.
</P>
<P>
Two castles have been excavated to date as well as a number of
articles made of clay, stone and bone.The discovery could push the
beginning of Xia, believed to exist between 21st Century B.C. to
16th Century B.C. further back to as early as 23th Century B.C.
And his team of researchers will employ chemical tests on the
unearthed samples as well as philogy and astronomy to establish
the exact dating of these items.
</P>
<P>
Henan is an important place for the study of Xia culture and
customs and the Xia was the first dynasty in Chinese history.

<HEADLINE> Congo Denies U.N. Security Assurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) has continued to deny the United
Nations written security assurance, U.N.'s Mission Organization
Nations Unes Congo (MONUC) member Major David Hannah disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Sunday, Hannah said that this is delaying
the deployment of a U.N. technical survey team, The Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hannah, who is based in Kinshasa where the U.N. has 30 military
experts under MONUC, said the technical survey team was supposed
to go specific locations in the DRC to monitor the cease-fire but
can only do so if the DRC government gives written security
assurances.
</P>
<P>
He said all the other signatory countries to the cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka earlier this year gave the assurance
three weeks ago during the Joint Military Commission (JMC) meeting
in Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said DRC representatives in the commission could not do
so because they did not have sufficient authority from the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC government seems not to understand the technical
survey team's role," Hannah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the team's role was to provide logistical supplies and
do the ground work before the U.N. peace mission is deployed and
that they do this by going to specific locations identified by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Hannah hoped that a JMC meeting in Lusaka would persuade the
DRC to give the security assurance.
</P>
<P>
He said a security assurance is a written statement by the
belligerents in DRC that they will support the U.N. in the areas
they control.
</P>
<P>
Hannah said the U.N. was ready to deploy a peace-keeping
mission in the DRC and had been planning for the mission for the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He said some observer troops have been deployed by the U.N. in
all the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement signatory countries.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The good quality, timely
delivery, rational prices and good customer service have helped to
sell port machinery made by a Shanghai firm to American and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Company has seen an annual
30 percent rise in output value since it was set up seven years
ago. Its output value topped 100 million US dollars in 1997, rose
to 130 million US dollars in 1998 and is expected to hit 170
million US dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, Shanghai Zhenhua has received
orders from Oman, Sudan, the US, Canada, Germany, and Amsterdam.
According to statistics cited in Cargo System, a leading
international magazine on the port machinery industry, Shanghai
Zhenhua tops the world in its total exports per overseas orders.
</P>
<P>
The US port of Oakerland recently ordered six super panamex
container cranes, the world's largest container crane, from
Shanghai Zhenhua. So far, this port has ordered a total of ten
container cranes of the kind, valued at 60 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
About three months ago, Shanghai Zhenhua took orders for eight
container cranes from Germany, the first time a Chinese and also
an Asian port machinery maker has exported to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Old China-hand Refutes Taiwan Security Enhancement Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An outstanding American
expert on Chinese affairs has warned that the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act now pending a debate and vote in the Congress will
inevitably reduce security of the Taiwan island of China and risk
drawing the United States into a bloody showdown with China.
</P>
<P>
David M. Lampton, director of China Studies at the Nitze School
of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University and
the Nixon Center in Washington, made the warning in an article
published in the Washington Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"If enacted, the legislation would diminish Taiwan's security,
alarm friends and allies, and greatly increase the chances of
armed conflict between America and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. president to veto the bill, which was
introduced in the Senate by Jesse Helms and Robert Torricelli and
in the House by Rep. Tom Delay.
</P>
<P>
If the legislation passes into law, Lampton stressed, "the
American people can expect renewed military tension in the Taiwan
strait" and "Taiwan citizens will risk falling markets, fleeing
capital and diminished security."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the introduction of the bill in part to the
Taiwanese lobbying effort "fueled by money given to politicians,
Washington think tanks and law and public relations firms."
</P>
<P>
"If Washington makes it clear that it will support Taipei
militarily no matter what it does, we inadvertently encourage
unnecessarily provocative behavior by Taiwan that might draw the
United States into bloody conflict with Beijing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lampton said that from 1994 to 1996, Taipei was the fourth
largest recipient of U.S. arms, with the pace of deliveries
jumping dramatically in 1997, largely because of the sale of F-16s.
In 1997, he added, the United States sold 8.5 times the value of
weapons (in constant dollars) to Taiwan than it did in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He called the U.S. legislation "doubly provocative" since it
not only stirs up Chinese nationalism but also reinforces those in
Taiwan who believe "they can manipulate the U.S. political system
at will."
</P>
<P>
He said that the legislation, which directs the executive
branch to establish direct military relationship with the Taiwan
armed forces, amounts to "a functional re-establishment of the
1955 Mutual Defense Treaty with the island."
</P>
<P>
"This would run counter to the terms on which diplomatic
relations between Washington and Beijing were established in 1979,
" he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Lampton also accused the bill of encouraging the transfer of
upper-tier antimissile defenses to Taiwan that do not yet exist
and which the United States may eventually wish to keep under its
own control. "Such a declaration would fuel a PRC (the People's
Republic of China) missile buildup now," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act was passed last week with a
32-6 vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of
Representatives. The House and Senate will cast a vote on the bill,
which has been strongly opposed by the Clinton administration from
the outset.

as much as 20 percent of their incomes on education.
</P>
<P>
Parents are quite generous in paying for their children's
education, resulting in a boom in various kinds of schools and
training courses in the city. Some well-equipped kindergartens
charge 500 yuan per month, but many parents still try to get their
kids enrolled.
</P>
<P>
One music training class sponsored by the city's children's
palace is always full of students, whose parents don't hesitate to
buy expensive instruments.
</P>
<P>
The Gangxuan Sparetime Language School, which was set up in
1988, was the first of its kind in Lhasa and it gets 300 new
students every year.
</P>
<P>
Local bookstores are also crowded with parents and their
children, most of them Tibetans, who are a majority in the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Even hiring a family teacher is not easy, but many parents like
to get a better education for their children, according to one
Tibetan woman who works at a government institution.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Trade Deficit Soars in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's deficit in goods
and services trade soared over 600 million Australian dollars (396
million U.S. dollars) to 1.94 billion Australian dollars (1.28
billion U.S. dollars) in September, the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) said on Monday
</P>
<P>
The deficit was caused by a seven percent surge in imports,
which hit a new record of 11.67 billion Australian dollars (7.70
billion U.S. dollars) in September, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
This offset a two percent recovery in exports to 9.73 billion
Australian dollars (6.55 billion U.S. dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
Imports of all goods rose, with imports of consumer goods up
138 million Australian dollars (91.08 million U.S. dollars) to
2.54 billion Australian dollars (1.68 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot was services, where imports fell slightly
to 2.3 billion Australian dollars (1.52 billion U.S. dollars), the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in exports was due to a 250-million-Australian dollar
(165 million U.S. dollars) rise in exports of non-rural goods to
5.5 billion Australian dollars (3.63 billion U.S. dollars),
seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
However, exports of rural goods fell slightly to 1.93 billion
Australian dollars (1.27 billion U.S. dollars) and exports of
services were down slightly to just under 1.3 billion Australian
dollars (858 million U.S. dollars), it said.

<HEADLINE> India Reported to Seek Putting Off SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- India has proposed the
postponement of the 11th SAARC Summit scheduled for late November,
the Kathmandu Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador to Nepal K.V. Rajan met Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat Saturday and expressed India's desire to postpone the
summit to a later date due to the recent developments in Pakistan,
the paper quoted a foreign ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The civilian government of Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan was toppled
by the military in a bloodless coup on October 11.
</P>
<P>
"This has created confusion for us. We would be clear if they
stated their position formally," said the source. "We gave a
written invitation to all. We expect the same in return."
</P>
<P>
According to the source who was not identified by the paper,
the preparation for the summit will go ahead if India does not
give a written notice to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Invitations for SAARC Summit has already been extended to five
member states -- Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka, and  Foreign Minister Ram Mahat's trip to Bhutan on
November 4 to extend invitation of the Summit is on schedule, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Charter stipulates that the summit can be postponed
if any of the seven member state proposes to.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time in 15 years of SAARC history if it
were to postpone the summit due to the objection of member states
to the political developments in another member country.
</P>
<P>
The former postponements of the SAARC Summit were due to
inability of leaders of the concerned countries to attend the
summit.
</P>
<P>
However, former SAARC Secretary General Yadav Silwal said the
summit should not be postponed due to the internal problems of a
member country.
</P>
<P>
"We are new democracies. Such problems will continue to emerge
in any of the seven countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to postpone the summit for this reason, SAARC
Summit will never take place. Besides, the agenda for SAARC is not
political," he added.
</P>
<P>
No authoritative sources have been available so far to confirm
the report by the Kathmandu Post.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition to Hold No-confidence Debate Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition said it has
enough information to prove mismanagement by certain cabinet
members, particularly Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, at an upcoming
censure debate, The Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
New Aspiration Party (NAP) executive member Kuthep Saikrachang
was quoted as saying that following the no-confidence debate,
which is likely to take place in December, the opposition expected
a political "impasse" that would be the catalyst for political
changes.
</P>
<P>
He said the best solution for the government would be to call
an early election after the debate.
</P>
<P>
"It's no use for the government to go on like this. Let voters
decide who is right or wrong. After the censure debate, questions
will arise about the prime minister's integrity, " Kuthep said.
</P>
<P>
The debate would center around "six to seven issues," including
the recent seizure of pirated CDs from the prime minister's
official residence, the Krung Thai Bank controversy, the siege of
the Myanmar Embassy in early October and Chuan's attempts to avoid
responsibilities over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
The NAP, the largest opposition party, did not expect the Chat
Thai and Chat Pattana parties, the two major coalition partners of
the ruling Democrat Party, to vote against the government at the
censure debate, Kuthep said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not the NAP's intention to bring down the
Democrats, but if the coalition government breaks apart after the
censure debate, the NAP would be ready to support Chat Thai and
Chat Pattana in forming the next administration.

Gansu has no outlet to the sea and has had many difficulties
transporting goods and competing on the market because of the

But the new Lanzhou land port has simplified customs procedures

<HEADLINE> Worsening Ecology Near Yellow River Source Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts warn that the
environment near the source of the Yellow River in northwest China
is in deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-sq.km. water source area is located in the west of
Maduo County in China's Qinghai Province, over 4,200 meters above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
The Hydrology Bureau of the Yellow River Water Resources
Committee recently organized a study tour of the area and found
that droughts have occurred every year for the last several years
because of global warming, causing swamps to dry up, water levels
to drop, more frequent winds, and serious sand erosion.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the construction of small hydro-electric power
plants, dams, and highways in recent years has led to a reduction
in water resources and ecological degradation.
</P>
<P>
Experts are studying the area further to figure out how to deal
with the problem and are suggesting that more trees and grass be
planted in the area as a short-term measure to prevent the further
worsening of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River starts on the northern slope of the Bayanhar
Mountains in Qinghai and runs through nine provinces, where more
than 100 million people live.

<HEADLINE> Thai Minister Rules out Tapioca Farmers' Price Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said that the government
will not subsidize the tapioca price at 1.2 baht (3.08 U.S. cents)
per kilogram as the farmers demanded, Channel 9, the official
television station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that if the government subsidizes the prices of
tapioca, it may have to subsidize all farm product prices, which
is not what the government can afford.
</P>
<P>
He added that subsidy is not an appropriate solution to the
depreciation of farm product prices.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Commerce Ministry needs to encourage
the restructuring of the tapioca farming and increase quality of
tapioca grown by Thai planters, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tapioca farmers staging protests in front of the
Government House have moved their vigil to the headquarters of the
Chart Pattana Party, the second largest member of the ruling
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana Party is believed to put pressure on the leader
of the coalition, the Democrat Party, pending a likely early
general election.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tapioca prices have dropped to 0.5 baht (1.28 cents)
per kilogram. The government has offered to guarantee the price at
0.85 baht (2.18 cents) per kilogram while the farmers have
demanded a guaranteed price of 1.2 baht.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, the government has agreed to increase
the stock of tapioca pellet by 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives agreed to increase a special loan
portfolio of 3.2 billion baht (82 million dollars) for tapioca
farmers in order to give 1,400 baht (35.9 dollars) per rai (0.16
hectare) of plantation.
</P>
<P>
The financial scheme is designed to delay the harvest by three
months in order to boost prices.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said many parties agreed with the government's
measures. However, the representatives of the farmers still
insisted on a guaranteed price of 1.2 baht per kilogram, saying
the production cost was at 0.95 baht per kilogram.

<P>
LHASA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- An archive of cultural relics is
being set up at the Potala Palace in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Jampa Gesan, director of the Potala Palace management office,
said that there had been no systematic recording of numerous
historical cultural relics in the Palace.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts begun in the mid 1960s, more than 60,000
cultural relics have been photographed and put on file. All the
articles in the Archive will be kept in ten storerooms. Four
catalogues on the cultural relics in the palace have already been
published.
</P>
<P>
Potala Palace was built during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and
expanded during the early Qing dynasty (1616-1911). The building
combines Han and Tibetan styles, and is the largest and most
splendid example of ancient architecture in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's GDP Down Sharply in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's national gross
domestic product (GDP) was valued at 45.1314 billion Kyats (7.521
billion U.S. dollars) in fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March, down
by 39.28 percent from the previous year's 74.329 billion Kyats
(12.38 billion dollars), according to official statistics
available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall is seen mainly due to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis which started in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that Myanmar received only 29.45 million
dollars of foreign investment in the 1998-99, accounting for only
3.78 percent and 1.04 percent of those drawn in 1997-98 and
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has admitted that due to the effect of the Asian
financial crisis, foreign investment from member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as impacted by the financial crisis, a lot of foreign

companies have withdrawn from Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop of GDP is also seen to be linked with the
economic sanctions imposed on the country by the United-States-led
western countries since May 1997 as well as by some international
financial organizations including the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as far as Myanmar's domestic political situation is
concerned, contradiction between the government and the opposition
National League for Democracy (NLD) has deepened as there is no
feasible settlement on major issues such as the drawing of the
state constitution and the setting up of the people's parliament.
</P>
<P>
This has also a negative effect to the country's economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Green Peacock Returning To Southern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 1 (Xinhua)-- A number of green peacocks were
discovered in the northern part of China's Yunnan Province
recently.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen peachicks were found living in the forest
near the village of Qinghua on the northern edge of a subtropical
zone, where they had disappeared for years, says Yang Lan, of the
Chinese Academy of Science's Kunming Zoology Institute.
</P>
<P>
Because of severe deforestation and poaching, the green
peacocks gradually disappeared from the area until the late 1980s,
when the government passed strict measures to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Qinghua made the peacocks' habitat a provincial
natural protection area and many plants that serve as food have
been planted there under the guidance of specialists.
</P>
<P>
Yang says that it is gratifying to see the young peacocks and
that this proves that their efforts have been successful and that
this is a suitable place for the peacocks, which are on China's
top protection list.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Sees Land Mines Casualties Drop in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 41 casualties were reported in September, compared to the
90 casualties reported in September 1998. The total number of
casualties recorded this year has dropped to 819 from 1,306
recorded in the first nine months last year.
</P>
<P>
A possible reason for the decline is the lack of fighting in
the country and the relatively small number of people moving from
place to place, according to a Cambodian Mine Action Center
official.
</P>
<P>
Land mines have already killed more than 13,000 people and
disabled 100,000 in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than two decades of civil war and lingering unrest have
turned Cambodia into one of the most heavily mined countries in
the world. There are an estimated 4-6 million land mines littered
in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the government and the help of the
international community, the number of accidents relating to land
mines has dropped to 50 from 150 per month in the last two years,
well down from 600 a month in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Pet owners in Beijing now have
approximately 40 hospitals to choose from instead of relying on
themselves to heal their beloved pets, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 80 pets come here for medical treatment or shots every
day," Ling Fengjun, vice-director of the Beijing Pet Hospital, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with imported facilities, the hospital has a
laboratory, an X-ray examination room, an ultrasonic detector room
and an operating room especially for pets.
</P>
<P>
All veterinarians and nurses at the pet hospital have been
professionally trained, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
In meeting the needs of pet enthusiasts, the hospital plans to
add more services, including a pet beauty parlor, health
consulting and a training program.
</P>
<P>
Currently, urban pet owners do not just spend money to make
sure their pets are healthy, but they also buy special clothes and
toys for them.
</P>
<P>
The craze was evident during the Third Beijing International
Pet Show, which took place early last month. The popular event
strengthened the confidence of participating enterprises regarding
the future development of the pet industry in China, says the
report.
</P>
<P>
Some famous companies, such as Doggyman from Japan and Eight-in-
one from the United States, expressed their desire to look for
agents in China in the near future.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Ethnic Group Aspire to Greater Publicity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- In China's Sichuan Province the
Qiang people were in old times forced deep into the mountains
because of warfare, calamities, and other factors.
</P>
<P>
They led a reclusive life, hunting, farming, and trading in
opium for centuries, until 1949, when the People's Republic was
founded. They now mostly live in the Aba Tibet and Qiang
Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan, with about 200,000 people,
compared with fewer than 40,000 five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The Qiang are one of the oldest ethnic groups in China and are
an important part of the Chinese Nation, Chinese historians say.
But, they were conservative and had little contacts with the
outside world so few outsiders knew about them, according to a
government official in Aba's Maoxian County.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese call themselves the offspring of Huangdi and Yandi,
the chieftains of two ancient tribes, the one living in the Yellow
River area being the Hua, led by Huangdi, and the other in the
Yangtze River Basin being the Xia, headed by Yandi. Hua Xia is
often used as a name for China.
</P>
<P>
Many people know that the Han people, the majority of Chinese,
come from the Hua, but few perhaps know that the Xia became the
Qiang. Other ethnic groups like the Tibetans and Lisu say that
they come from the Qiang. According to historical records, the
Qiang were one of the most powerful and militant ethnic groups and
had many large kingdoms and dynasties.
</P>
<P>
These days, they are mostly unambitious farmers who speak their
own language, wear their own traditional clothing, and grow crops
on hillsides. But the rapidly-developing market economy has
brought changes to their lives and they now have an ambitious goal
of getting in touch with the outside world by building roads to
get technology, goods, and personnel.
</P>
<P>
They also want more outside visitors to get a glimpse of their
unique life-style. Some stone fortifications that were used by
Qiang villagers to defend their homes in time of war have become a
major tourist attraction.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A team leader on the Harbin-
Yimianpo Railway in China's Helongjiang Province has become the
first person in China to manage a passenger train by beating out
two rivals in public bidding.
</P>
<P>
Tang Qiuye signed a 15-month contract with the Harbin Railway
Bureau on September 30 and has been managing the train safely for
a month, training staff members and paying salaries.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of China's effort to improve its railways
which for decades have been a State monopoly and which, because of
the rapid development of aviation and highways, have lost an
increasing number of customers.
</P>
<P>
The situation called for reforms and many provinces have begun
considering ways to improve railway management to sharpen their
competitive edge. According to Tang's contract, he has to pay the
bureau 1.4 million yuan (172,000 U.S. dollars) in 15 months
starting October 1 this year, a 10 percent increase for the
railway.
</P>
<P>
He says he's under great pressure. The contract allows him to
hire or fire logistical staff, and for the last 22 days, the train
has earned more than the expected amount and passengers say that
the service has greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Tang's success has promoted the Harbin Railways Bureau to
consider contracts on two other trains, officials here told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Loses 4b U.S. Dollars to Illegal Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Illegal foreign fishing in
Indonesian waters costs the country an estimated 4 billion U.S.
dollars in lost revenue every year, Minister of Maritime
Exploration Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed minister said that foreigners were getting
more out of Indonesia's maritime resources than Indonesians
themselves. Indonesia was only earning some 2.2 billion dollars
from its fishing sector annually.
</P>
<P>
"It is our water and our fish but we're actually losing," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has identified the exploitation of
marine resources as one specific sector in which his government
will focus more attention on.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said one of the primary tasks for the new office was to
ensure that Indonesians, particularly those living in coastal
areas, fully enjoy the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
One of the most immediate solutions to stop illegal fishing is
by strengthening the navy to deter intrusions of foreign vessels
fishing in Indonesian waters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another concern was the drastic rate of marine devastation due
to pollution and other irresponsible actions which damage the
environment and marine ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
On the work of the new ministry, Sarwono said he would
establish research teams in the near future to analyze the
problems facing the ocean's environment which would in turn help
structure how the ministry could help resolve them.

Should Vazquez win the second round, he would be Uruguay's
first president not affiliated with the ruling Colorado or center-
right National Party, which have run the country since its
independence from Spain in 1828.

Outgoing Colorado President Julio Sanguinetti is scheduled to

Uruguay's jobless rate has jumped to 10.5 percent so far this

QINGDAO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao has launched a project
to replace coal burning, a heavy air polluter, with oil and gas in
urban areas for the approaching winter.
</P>
<P>
Min Xiangchao, the city's vice mayor, said that the project
will help resolve environmental problems, especially during winter
when families rely heavily on coal for indoor heating.
</P>
<P>
Coal is the main cause of the city's air pollution. To reduce
levels of sulfur dioxide in the air, Min said that Qingdao must
complete the fuel alternation process by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Diexi Amazes Tourists with Landscape Shaped after Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Diexi Haizi, some 200
kilometers west of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, has
what appear to be carved stones scattered about the hillside and a
grass-covered hollow, all created by nature.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, 1933, a massive earthquake hit the area, pushing
the stones three kilometers down the hill to the present site and
regrouping nearby mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P>
The mighty shock measured more than 7 on the Richter Scale and
killed 6,865 people. It covered the whole town of Diexi, which was
a commercial center in the predominantly Tibetan and Qiang ethnic
group area.
</P>
<P>
"Immediately after the shaking, I lost consciousness," recalls
Yue Changde, a 78-year old villager who was one of only four
survivors in the town. "When I opened my eyes, I was horrified to
see a completely different landscape. All the bustling streets and
people were gone and there were huge, deep pits everywhere."
</P>
<P>
For several weeks after the quake, the sky was ashen and there
were numerous aftershocks. Yue, who was 12 at the time, lived the
life of a vagrant for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
For decades, few people have paid any attention to the lost
town, even though it is at the midway point on a famous tourist
route to the Jiuzhaigou Tourism Zone and the Wolong Reserve, one
of the best-known homes of the Great Panda.
</P>
<P>
But, in recent years, Chinese scientists and tourists have been
increasingly attracted to the lost town, which local people call "
China's Pompeii", comparing it to the Italian town that was
covered with vocanic ash.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over 250,000 Jiuzhaigou-bound tourists stopped at
Diexi Haizi to see the stones and the lakes and the fortifications,
unique stone frames built by the Qiang villagers to protect their
homes.

<P>
CHENGDU, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Seven officials allegedly
responsible for two bridge collapse accidents in Sichuan Province

<HEADLINE> A Slow Process  By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia has made considerable
progress in addressing the problems in its ailing banking system
over the past two years, but the reform has turned out to be a
very slow, painful and difficult process.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies started to consolidate their vulnerable banking
systems soon after a financial storm hit the region in July 1997.
Since then, Asian economies have adopted new regulations of
lending and supervision, enforced bank re-capitalization, and
encouraged bank mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
However, the real progress is uneven on different fronts of the
banking sector. Malaysia has made a great deal of progress in
getting bad debts off its bank's books and encouraging
consolidation in the financial sector. And Singapore has got even
higher remarks. Negotiations for sales of local banks to foreign
partners have wound up successfully in Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, non-performing loans remain too high in
most of East Asian countries, around 10 to 60 percent of their
total banking loans. The problem is very serious in Indonesia,
South Korea and Thailand, directly threatening to derail their
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank Study released in September, by the
end of June, 64 percent of Indonesian companies were unable to
produce enough cash from day-to-day operations to cover their
interest obligations to banks; 27 percent of South Korean
companies, 26 percent of Malaysian companies, and 28 percent of
Thai companies were in the same dangerous boat.
</P>
<P>
Because of the massive non-performing loans, the cost of
restructuring and consolidation of the banking system is very high
in Asian countries. In Thailand, where the non-performing loan
ratio is put at 50-60 percent by some economists, the cost of
restructuring banks could cost 20 percent to 30 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
"After a banking crisis it takes on average three years for an
emerging market to return to pre-crisis growth. But given the
magnitude of financial claims to be restructured and the scale of
corporate distress, the recovery of East Asia could take even
longer," said the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Asian countries have realized the
importance of banking reform and tried to speed up the process.
But in practice, the reforms proved to be hard enough.
</P>
<P>
In late October, Malaysia abandoned its controversial
bank-consolidation plan and replaced it with one that allows the
country's banks to choose their own merger partners. The new plan
also extends the deadline for consolidation by nine months to the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government move means that local banks are no longer bound
by a central bank plan to consolidate them into six large banks
selected by authorities. It also means large banking groups that
would have been absorbed under their original plan can now emerge
as so-called anchor banks.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, despite the difficulties, the process of banking
reform, although slow, is continuing in the region. In Thailand,
the central bank recently set rules on cross-holding between
commercial banks and other companies to foster transparency and to
prevent any conflict of interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, if board members or senior executives of a
commercial bank also sit on a company's board, the bank cannot
lend the company more than 50 percent of the company's
shareholders' equity, and not more than 25 percent of the
company's loan outstanding.
</P>
<P>
"Board members or senior executives of commercial banks should
devote their knowledge, ability and time to the commercial bank
fully," said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, banking consolidation has speed up with
mergers. Last month, Bank of the Philippine Island and Far East
Bank and Trust Co. agreed to merge, creating the country's largest
bank. The latest move is expected to push local banks to step up
their mergers and acquisition to enhance their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
But economists urge Asian governments to make even greater
efforts to push through the banking reforms and let the sector
play its key role in the economic recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Canadian driver Greg Moore
was killed in a crash at Sunday's Championship Auto Racing Teams (
CART) Marlboro 500 at Fontana, California.
</P>
<P>
Moore, 24, suffered massive head and internal injuries in the
high-speed accident and was declared dead about an hour later at
California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
Moore was the second driver in the CART FedEx Series to die
this year. Rookie Gonzalo Rodriguez of Uruguay, preparing for
only his second race, was killed in a crash September 11 during
practice at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Rodriguez was the first driver fatality in the
CART series since Jeff Krosnoff was killed in a crash during a
race in Toronto in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on the tenth lap when Moore lost control of
his Reynard-Honda at a speed of more than 230 miles per hour
before the car slammed head-on into the inside retaining wall on
the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
The car shattered into many pieces as the driver's tub
containing Moore went into several barrel-rolling flips before
coming to a stop.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 1 (Xinhua)-- Representatives from several
Beijing law offices said Sunday that they support the ban on Falun
Gong, that the State has branded as a cult, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
They have the consensus that the decision on banning and
punishing cults, passed by the Standing Committee of the People's
Congress on Saturday, has provided a powerful legal basis for
striking at Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yongzhong, a partner of the Tianda Law Office said that the
decision has ensured the lawfulness of the combat against the cult,
indicating the progress in the country's legal system.
</P>
<P>
The decision is conducive to maintaining social stability and
protecting people's rights, said the spokesmen for the law offices.
</P>
<P>
They added that the public's understanding of the rule of law
should be expanded, as well as an understanding of science.
</P>
<P>
"Some people's inadequate understanding of the law has given
the senior members of Falun Gong opportunities to commit crimes
and steal money from its practitioners," said Guo Yang, director
of the Hualian Law office

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hope Summit to Stop Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Palestinian Council
Ahmad Qureia, known as Abu Ala, said here Sunday that he hoped the
coming summit in Oslo would "at least stop settlement activities"
in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks upon arriving here together with the
Palestinian delegation. Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat is to be here Monday for an unofficial summit with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Abu Ala led in the first part of Oslo secret talks which
resulted in the signing on September 13, 1993 of the first
framework for Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that negotiations between Israel and
Palestinians would proceed "without veto power, and without
deadlines."
</P>
<P>
Barak, since ousting former hardline Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the May general elections, has committed to work out
outlines of a final status agreement by February next year, and
complete the entire task by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians do not believe bargaining in a rush would do
anything good to a permanent settlement of the thorny issues
between the two sides, such as Jerusalem, border, refugee and
water-sharing.
</P>
<P>
Among the Palestinian delegates here were Arafat's deputy,
Mohmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazan, and Information Minister Yasser
Abed Raboo, the head of the Palestinian team for final-status
negotiations set to start on November 7.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ila Khatib, who arrived at the
Grand Hotel here together with the Palestinians, also told
reporters that he hoped the coming summit would "score new
success" on the Israeli-Palestinian truck.
</P>
<P>
But "we need a comprehensive peace," he said, "a comprehensive
peace can only be reached if there's peace with Syria and
Lebanon."

<HEADLINE> 217 Feared Dead in EgyptAir Crash, CNN Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- An EgyptAir plane with 217
people on board crashed at sea early Sunday off the island of
Nantuchket, Massachusetts, en route from New York to Cairo, capital
of Egypt, Cable News Network (CNN) reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest CNN report adds three more to the total number of
victims in the air crash. Initial reports said a total of 214
people were on board the missing plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying 199 passengers, 15 crew members and
three employees who were not working on the flight, according to
EgyptAir officials.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two passengers stayed on the flight from Los Angeles.
But an employee whose name was not released got off the plane in
New York, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
The search for survivors is under way in the wake of the
EgyptAir crash, but hopes are not very high, Rear Admiral Richard
Larrabee of the U.S. Coastal Guard said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The search for survivors is under way, but the hope is not
very high," he told a press conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
"We have searched in an area of 78 square miles today," he
said. "We'll have better information tonight."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we are doing a surface search," he said. "We
don't have proper capability for sub-surface search" at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barry Mawn of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) said that there is no quick confirmation of any involvement
of criminal activity in the air crash.
</P>
<P>
"We'll proceed with the evidence to see whether criminal
activities were involved," he said. "At the moment, we can not
conclude, and we'll follow the rule of evidence."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton ruled out any possibility
of sabotage in the air crash, saying that "no evidence... at this
time" of foul play in the air crash.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coastal Guard searches have found one body and numerous
pieces of wreckage from the missing EgyptAir flight that went down
60 miles (96 kilometers) off Massachusetts, Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
The flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19
a.m. East Time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from
radar screen at 2:00 a.m. (0600 GMT). It originated in Los
Angeles, EgyptAir officials at Cairo and the International Airport
said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying at the latitude of 33,000 feet (9,900
meters), and weather was good at time when the missing plane took
off in New York, Eliot Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), said.
</P>
<P>
The plane lost contact some 50 minutes after its takeoff, and
crashed about 65 miles southeast of Nantuchket Island,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has a fleet of 38 planes and flies to some 85 airports
around the world.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Arrives in Oslo for Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
0SLO, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
on Sunday vowed to continue the legacy of late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin to make peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the pledge upon his arrival here for a summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
We are looking forward to the ceremony to commemorate Rabin and
the top-level meetings in the coming few days, Barak told
reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
This was Barak's first visit to this Scandinavian country since
he ousted Benjamin Netanyahu, the hardline former prime minister,
in the general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to attend Rabin's commemoration ceremony on Tuesday.
Rabin was shot and killed by an ultra-right Israeli opponent of
his peace policies four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Barak will then enter into talks with both Arafat and Clinton,
an unofficial summit as it was called, in an effort to inject
vitality into the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be the first such since Barak took office, and
was called by Rabin's widow, Leah, who arrived here together with
Barak, as a "manifestation of the commitment to the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
But parties concerned have been trying to lower expectations
for the tripartite meeting, saying it may be more ceremonial than
substantial.
</P>
<P>
Barak has committed to work out the outlines of a final status
agreement with the Palestinians by February and complete the
entire task by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek told reporters
earlier on Sunday that he hoped the concerned sides would "dig
into substance" in their talks in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Norway facilitated the secret talks between Israel and
Palestinians in early 1993, which produced the first, and historic
framework for Palestinian autonomy, known as the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out," Vollebaek said. The interim period for
Palestinian autonomy stipulated in Oslo ended on May 4 this year,
because of the freeze of the peace process during the three-year
rein of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see all parties coming together" to give a
push to the peace process, Vollebaek added.
</P>
<P>
For Clinton, who is to be here in a few hours, the task is to
get the Congress to approve the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars he
promised to finance Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak has revived talks with the Palestinians and agreed to
follow through the signed agreements, but he urged for financial
assistance to deliver.
</P>
<P>
The summit is not liked by all. On Saturday, assailants opened
fire on a bus traveling through the West Bank, injuring five
Israelis. This was believed to be part of the effort to derail the
coming summit.

</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coastal Guard is conducting a massive search of the
area where the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lost contact
with the airliner. The plane disappeared about 2:00 a.m. East
Time, some 65 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of the Island of
Nantucket, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Larrabee said emergency crews had located a field of debris and
recovered one body.
</P>
<P>
He said that clothing, passports, life rafts, airplane seats
were among debris found near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barry Mawn of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) said that there is no quick confirmation of any involvement
of criminal activity in the air crash.

three employees who were not working on the flight, according to
EgyptAir officials.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two stayed on the flight from Los Angeles, company
officials said. But an employee whose name was not released got
off the plane at New York, they said.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim Rayan told a news conference in
Cairo that 62 Egyptians, two Sudanese, three Syrians, and one
Chilean were aboard the plane as passengers.

from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19
a.m. East Time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from
radar screen at 2:00 a.m. (0600 GMT). It originated in Los
Angeles, EgyptAir officials at Cairo and the International Airport
said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying at the latitude of 33,000 feet (9,900
meters), and the weather was good at the time when the missing
plane took off in New York, Eliot Brenner, chief spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said.
</P>
<P>
The plane lost contact some 50 minutes after its takeoff, and
crashed about 65 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Nantucket
Island, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
The airliner identified the pilot as Hakim Rushdi, who had more
than 10,000 hours of flight experience. Colleagues described him
as a "very experienced pilot." The airline said he had been in
contact with his son, also an EgyptAir pilot, hours before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir has a fleet of 38 planes and flies to some 85 airports
around the world.

<HEADLINE> Two World War II Bombs Detonated Safely in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 7,000 people living in
Italy's north city of Milan and nearby were evacuated Sunday to
allow bomb-squad experts to move and detonate two World War II
bombs discovered in the area last week.
</P>
<P>
The US-made bombs, containing a total of 360 kilograms of TNT,
were shifted from their locations to a deserted area where, buried
in a purpose-built hole dug to the depth of eight meters, they
were detonated.
</P>
<P>
Photographers and camera crews on hand for the show filmed the
operation and the mushroom of earth the explosion raised over the
detonation site to a height of a few dozen meters.
</P>
<P>
Before beginning the operation, Colonel Mario Morelli, the
chief of the eight-man team, reported, "on a scale of zero to ten,
the difficulty of this job is five. Last month, on the other hand,
it was nine because of a defective fuse," he said of a similar
case in September.

had begun a dramatic dive towards the Atlantic Ocean, the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The information provided by Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB,
indicated the plane plummeted from its cruise altitude of 9,900
meters down to 5,730 meters in 36 seconds, and then at least some
part of it remained visible on radar for a much longer period of
time.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know at this point what caused the crash," Hall said
at a press conference. "We are beginning what may be a long
investigation."
</P>
<P>
All the 217 people on board are feared dead as the EgyptAir
Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed early Sunday off Nantucket,
Massachusetts State in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of survivors
from the crash.

<HEADLINE> Hope Is Slim in Searches for Survivors in EgyptAir Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 31 (Xinhua) -- The search for survivors is
under way in the wake of the EgyptAir crash, but hopes are not
very high, Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee of the U.S. Coastal Guard
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The search for survivors is under way, but the hope is not
very high," he told a press conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
"We have searched in an area of 78 square miles today," he
said. "We'll have better information tonight."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we are doing a surface search," he said. "We
don't have proper capability for sub-surface search" at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barry Mawn of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) said that there is no quick confirmation of any involvement
of criminal activity in the air crash.
</P>
<P>
"We'll proceed with the evidence to see whether criminal
activities were involved," he said. "At the moment, we can not
conclude, and we'll follow the rule of evidence."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton ruled out any possibility
of sabotage in the air crash, saying that "no evidence... at this
time" of foul play in the air crash.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coastal Guard searches have found one body and numerous
pieces of wreckage from the missing EgyptAir flight that went down
60 miles (96 kilometers) off Massachusettes, Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 214 were feared dead in the air
crash, but the latest information said that 217 were on board of
the missing plane, CNN said.

<P>
The flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off

by an ultra-right Israeli opponent of his peace policies four

He will then enter into talks with both Arafat and Clinton, an
unofficial summit as it was called, in an effort to inject
vitality into the Middle East peace process.

The summit will be the first such since Barak took office. But
parties concerned have been trying to lower expectations for the

<HEADLINE> No Survivors in EgpytAir Flight Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- All the 214 people on board
are feared dead as the EgyptAir Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed
early Sunday off Nantucket, Massachussets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of survivors
from the crash.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no reports of survivors," the Coast Guard said
in a statement released in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said earlier in a news
conference, that with water temperatures in the 50s, there was
still a possibility of survivors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard has found a body, airplane seats and
life-jackets and passports in the sea about 100 kilometers south of
Nantucket, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The initial report was we had found seats, seat cushions, the
flotation devices on the aircraft, life rafts and some other small
parts that are not identifiable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The debris was found in the "general vicinity of the last known
point of contact" with the plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bodies and debris from the plane will be taken to Newport,
Rhode Island, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
Flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off from
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19 a.m.
local time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from radar
screen at 2 a.m. (0600 GMT). It originated in Los Angeles,
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport said.
</P>
<P>
The plane was flying at 33,000 feet (9,900 meters), said Eliot
Brenner, chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard had six ships, three airplanes and two
helicopters combing the waters looking for survivors in what it
termed a "massive and immediate" effort in waters that range from
a depth of 200 to 250 feet (60-75 meters).
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a very, very aggressive airborne search at this
moment. Basically, if there is someone out there to be saved,
saving lives at sea is our most important mission and we're doing
that," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials in Washington said the twin-engine plane's
takeoff from Kennedy Airport was delayed by two hours because it
arrived late from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir officials at Cairo International Airport said 197
passengers together with 17 crew member were on board the
flight. The wide-body Boeing passenger jet went into passenger
service in September 1982.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Cairo, EgyptAir head Mohammed Fahim
Rayan said there were 62 Egpytians, two Sudanese, three Syrians
and one Chilean, There was no record of the nationality of other
passengers. Dozens of U.S. citizens were reportedly on board the
ill-fated plane.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Investigation Bureau (FBI) and the Joint Terrorist
Task Force have launched investigation into the flight.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette said that "agents are going over
the flight manifest, identifying everyone who touched the plane,
including those who serviced and gassed the aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Valiquette cautioned that there is "no reason to assume this is
a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
The FAA issued an alert a month ago to airline and airport
security personnel after agencies received an unconfirmed warning
that a bomb would "soon be used" on a flight departing from Los
Angeles or Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
But officials aid they had no reason to believe the
disappearance of the Egyptian flight on Sunday was caused by
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said there was "no evidence... at
this time" of foul play in the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence of that at this time. And I think it's
better if people draw no conclusions," said Clinton, who called
Egpytian President Hosni Mubarak to express his condolences.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore has promised a thorough investigation
into the crash, saying that the U.S. government would cooperate
with the Egyptian government "in doing everything possible we can
to find the cause of this tragedy".

Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek told reporters on
Sunday that he hoped the concerned sides would "dig into
substance" in their talks in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Norway facilitated the secret talks between Israel and
Palestinians in early 1993, which produced the first, and historic
framework for Palestinian autonomy, known as the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out," Vollebaek said. The interim period for
Palestinian autonomy stipulated in Oslo ended on May 4 this year,
because of the freeze of the peace process during the three-year
rein of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see all parties coming together" to give a
push to the peace process, Vollebaek added.
</P>
<P>
For Clinton, who is to be here in a few hours, the task is to
get the Congress to approve the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars he
promised to finance Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak has revived talks with the Palestinians and agreed to
follow through the signed agreements, but he urged for financial
assistance to deliver.
</P>
<P>
The summit is not liked by all. On Saturday, assailants opened
fire on a bus traveling through the West Bank, injuring five
Israelis. This was believed to be part of the effort to derail the
coming summit.
