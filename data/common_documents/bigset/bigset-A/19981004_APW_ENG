Australian government claims mandate despite narrow re-election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After a narrow re-election victory,
conservative Prime Minister John Howard's government on Sunday
claimed a mandate for its key economic plans of tax reform and sale
of the national telephone company.
	   But Howard's ability to push through the reforms remained in
doubt as minor and opposition parties _ who may have a majority in
Parliament's upper house _ claimed the huge loss of support for the
government showed people did not want his plans implemented.
	   With close to 80 percent of the vote counted, Howard's
conservatives came in with what the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
predicted will be a majority of seven seats in the lower house, a
loss of at least 20 of their previous 41-seat majority.
	   Lynton Crosby, director of Howard's Liberal party, said even the
slimmest majority gave Howard a mandate.
	   ``We will have a majority of representatives in the Parliament,
that's what counts. That gives us the authority and the opportunity
to pursue our plans,'' Crosby said.
	   But the main opposition Labor Party said the huge erosion of
support for the government denied Howard a mandate to introduce his
planned tax on all goods and services or sell the government's
remaining stake in telecommunications company Telstra Corp.
	   The minority Democrats party said it was on track to win five
additional seats in the Senate, enough to win the balance of power.
Leader Meg Lees has said the party would block the sale of Telstra
and will change Howard's tax package to exempt food.
	   Howard claimed victory late Saturday at a rally of cheering
supporters in Sydney.
	   ``I want first and foremost to thank the Australian people for
returning the government. I want to thank the Australian people for
embracing a bold economic reform that is in the long-term interest
of the Australian community,'' Howard said.
	   The win will see Howard in office to preside over the Sydney
2000 Olympics, the centenary of Australia's federation as a nation
in 2001, and the country's entry into the new millennium.
	   Needing to win 27 extra electorates to win government, the Labor
Party led by Kim Beazley cut deep into Howard's parliamentary
majority, but not enough to win.
	   ``I'm proud to say the Labor Party is back in town. We approach
the next three years with great confidence,'' said Beazley in
conceding.
	   The conservatives also held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's
viability.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots Saturday
at thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the
nation's desert Outback to its tropical north and in its bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on reforms to simplify an
antiquated tax structure that has been built up since the
Depression era of the 1930s, with the goods and services tax as the
centerpiece. Voters rejected a similar plan outright at an election
in 1993.
	   Howard offered income tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13
billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) to soften the blow of the new tax.
	   According to ABC, the new House of Representatives lineup is
likely to be: the conservative coalition with 71 seats, the Labor
Party 64 seats, one independent and about 12 undecided.

One Nation's only victim may be Asian-Australian politician

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's sole member of Parliament
of Asian heritage may be the only politician to be ousted by the
right-wing One Nation party, which is critical of Asian immigration
levels, a member of the government said Sunday.
	   Hopes were fading that Bill O'Chee, a member of the junior
ruling coalition partner the National Party in Queensland state,
would hold his seat in the upper house Senate, colleague Ron
Boswell said.
	   One Nation's Heather Hill appeared likely to take a place as a
Senator for Queensland, pushing out O'Chee, according to the latest
computer analysis of voting trends by the Australian Broadcasting
Corp.
	   Hill is the only One Nation candidate to still have any chance
of election in Saturday's national poll. All other candidates were
unsuccessful, including party leader Pauline Hanson.
	   ``It appears that he (O'Chee) may be the only victim of One
Nation,'' Boswell told ABC radio.
	   ``The only Asian person in Parliament and it will be a great
loss to the Asian community and be a great loss to us,'' Boswell
said.
	   O'Chee was born in Australia to a Chinese-born father and
Irish-born mother.
	   Hanson has been a controversial force in Australian politics for
the past two years after claiming Australia was in danger of being
``swamped by Asians'' and claiming Aborigines are a privileged
minority.

Reports: Malaysia's Anwar admitted to hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was admitted to a hospital for a medical
check-up over alleged beatings while in police custody, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Anwar, 51, entered the government-owned Universiti Hospital
under tight security Saturday. Police sealed off the first floor
where he was to be treated, barring visitors, including his wife
and children, the Star newspaper reported.
	   Hospital officials could not be immediately contacted Sunday.
Anwar's lawyers said they did not know how long he would remain in
the hospital but that he was expected to appear Monday in High
Court when a trial date will be set.
	   The former heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
appeared twice in court last week, pleading innocent to 5 counts of
corruption and 5 of illegal homosexual acts.
	   Anwar sported a black eye and bruises on his neck and arm, which
he alleged came from police punches and slaps that left him bloody
and unconscious the night of his arrest, Sept. 20.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
dissident politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had
not caused permanent eye damage. The court granted Anwar's request
for further medical attention after he complained of neck and back
pain.
	   At the hospital, Anwar was expected to undergo a series of
X-rays on his backbone and his bruised left eye, among other
checks. He was admitted to the orthopedic department upon arrival.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said doctors would submit a report
of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   Anwar was arrested under the draconian Internal Security Act,
which allows jail without trial, after leading thousands in a
protest against Mahathir.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, initially suggested that
his former protege had inflicted the bruises on himself to win
public sympathy. But as global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered
an independent investigation.
	   The United States, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, among others, have voiced
concern over Anwar's case and allegations of police brutality.
	   Deputy Inspector General of Police Norian Mai was quoted in
Sunday papers as saying he expected the investigation to be
completed soon.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had clashed over economic policy as Malaysia sank
into recession.

Former test player charged in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Police have laid five careless and
dangerous driving charges against former New Zealand test and
sevens rugby union player Eric Rush following a fatal car crash.
	   Brendon Malcolm, a 23-year-old kiwifruit worker, died, his wife
Claire broke her collarbone and hand, and their friend Bryce Casey
received head injuries after their car and the car Rush was driving
collided at Mangatawhiri, south of Auckland, on Aug. 10.
	   Sgt. Bruce Pryor of Pukekohe police said Rush had been charged
with careless use of a motor vehicle causing the death of Malcolm
and two charges of careless driving causing injury to Mrs. Malcolm
and Casey. He also faces two charges of driving in a dangerous
manner.
	   Rush broke his hand and received rib and sternum injuries. He
had been training with the national sevens squad in Rotorua and was
driving alone to Auckland in a car allocated to fellow squad member
Glen Osborne.
	   The first New Zealand sevens player to receive a Commonwealth
Games gold medal, Rush, 33, last month dedicated his gold medal to
Malcolm.
	   While in Kuala Lumpur, he said he had pulled out of a lucrative
contract to play rugby in France next year for a variety of
reasons, including ``some legal stuff.''
	   Rush, a solicitor, will appear in Pukekohe District Court on
Tuesday. (djp)

Indians 2, Red Sox 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Boston manager Jimy Williams' first questionable
pitching decision kept the Red Sox in the game. His last one helped
the Cleveland Indians reach the AL championship series.
	   After being shut out on two hits by starter Pete Schourek for 5
1-3 innings, the Indians rallied to win Game 4 Saturday when David
Justice hit a two-run double off Tom Gordon in the eighth for a 2-1
victory.
	   Gordon, who finished the season with a major league-record 43
consecutive saves, had not been brought in to start the eighth all
season.
	   The defending league champion Indians won the series 3-1 and
moved into the ALCS for the third time in four years. The opponent:
the seemingly invincible Yankees starting Tuesday night in New
York. Last year, Cleveland beat New York in the first round of the
playoffs.
	   Reliever Steve Reed was the winner and Mike Jackson got his
third save of the series.
	   Gordon, who led the AL with 46 saves, took the loss.
	   Schourek has been with the Red Sox less than two months since
being obtained from Houston. But Williams, standing firm amid
growing criticism, started him rather than his ace, Pedro Martinez,
who would have pitched on three days' rest for the first time this
season.
	   The move worked as Schourek left with a 1-0 lead thanks to Nomar
Garciaparra's third homer of the series in the fourth. Schourek had
to be sharp considering how well Bartolo Colon pitched in his first
postseason game. The winner of this year's All-Star game left
trailing 1-0 after allowing five hits in 5 1-3 innings.
	   It stayed that way after seven innings as Derek Lowe, who
replaced Schourek, retired all five batters he faced.
	   Then Williams handed the ball to Gordon and the reliever who may
have been the team's most valuable player threw the game away.
	   Joey Cora, pinch-hitting for Enrique Wilson, flied to left.
Kenny Lofton then singled and took second on a single by Omar
Vizquel, who was hitless in all 14 of his previous at-bats in the
series.
	   Lofton then stole third and both runners scored on Justice's
double to center field.
	   That magnified Boston third-base coach Wendell Kim's decision in
the sixth to test left fielder Justice's arm.
	   John Valentin led off the sixth with a double. One out later,
Mike Stanley singled sharply to left. Kim waved Valentin home and
Justice, who already had made several strong throws in the series,
easily threw Valentin out at the plate.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Jim Leyritz has become Mr. October Jr.
	   Leyritz's latest clutch postseason homer gave San Diego a 2-1
win over the Houston Astros Saturday night, moving the Padres
within one victory of their first NL championship series since
1984.
	   Leyritz hit a low fastball out over the plate from Scott Elarton
an estimated 402 feet (122 meters) into the left-field seats with
one out in the seventh. Fielder Moises Alou didn't even move.
	   Leyritz's fifth postseason homer came a half-inning after Padres
ace Kevin Brown walked Craig Biggio with two outs and the bases
loaded, tying the game at 1. Brown was brought back on three days'
rest after his 16-strikeout masterpiece in Game 1 on Tuesday.
	   Leyritz, acquired from Boston on June 21, had a pinch-hit,
two-run homer off Billy Wagner with two outs in the ninth inning to
tie Thursday's game at 4. The Astros came back to win 5-4 in the
bottom of the inning.
	   While with the New York Yankees in 1996, Leyritz hit a dramatic
three-run, eighth-inning homer against Atlanta's Mark Wohlers to
tie Game 4 of the World Series at 6. The Yankees went on to win in
10 innings and defeated the Braves in six games.
	   The previous year, his 15th-inning home run off Tim Belcher won
Game 2 of the Yankees' first-round series against Seattle.
	   With the Padres facing left-hander Mike Hampton, Leyritz got the
start at first base over left-handed hitting Wally Joyner.
	   He'll also start Game 4 Sunday because he's been the personal
catcher for left-hander Sterling Hitchcock going back to their
Yankees' days.
	   San Diego, held hitless for five innings by Hampton, must beat
Randy Johnson in Game 4 Sunday in order to clinch the best-of-5
series and avoid having to go back to Houston for a Game 5 Monday
night at the Astrodome.

<TEXT>
	   In Chicago, Greg Maddux, it seems, will torment the Chicago Cubs
forever.
	   Six years after leaving town, the four-time Cy Young Award
winner bounced his former team out of the playoffs. He pitched
Atlanta to a 6-2 victory Saturday night that completed a three-game
sweep and put the Braves in their seventh straight NL championship
series.
	   Atlanta advanced to meet the Houston-San Diego winner, starting
Wednesday night at Turner Field. The Astros and Padres, tied at one
game each, played Game 3 later Saturday.
	   Maddux, who left the Cubs as a free agent after winning the
first of his Cy Young Awards in 1992, also scored the Braves' first
run while winning a rematch with Chicago rookie Kerry Wood.
	   The Braves added five more in the eighth off Chicago's bullpen,
capped by a grand slam from Eddie Perez off Rod Beck for a 6-0
lead.
	   The Cubs loaded the bases in the eighth on straight singles by
Jose Hernandez, Sandy Martinez and Lance Johnson, finishing Maddux.
Mickey Morandini hit a sacrifice fly off Kerry Ligtenberg to make
it 6-1.
	   Sammy Sosa then struck out, finishing 2-for-11 with no homers in
his first postseason experience, before Mark Grace hit an RBI
single. Henry Rodriguez lined to center to end the threat.
	   The Cubs scored only four runs in the three games.

Cambodian newspaper says government to shut down foreign press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's government plans to shut
down two English-language newspapers and temporarily expel British
and American journalists from the country, a pro-government
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, widely seen as the
country's only independent newspapers, have committed ``serious
professional mistakes'' and will be temporarily shut down, the
Cambodian-language Rasmei Kampuchea (Light of Cambodia) reported,
citing government spokesman Khieu Kanharith.
	   The correspondent for a German press agency was also heavily
criticized in the front-page article. Khieu Kanharith accused
Deutsche Presse-Agentur and The Cambodia Daily of biased coverage
of an alleged assassination attempt against the country's leader
Hun Sen.
	   The bimonthly Phnom Penh Post was described as ``a publication
that has always been against the Royal Government.''
	   Rasmei Kampuchea also quoted the government spokesman as saying
all American and British journalists will be temporarily expelled
from Cambodia because their personal security could not be
guaranteed if the U.S. House of Representatives passes a resolution
condemning Hun Sen.
	   Khieu Kanharith could not be reached for comment Sunday, but the
information ministry confirmed it was seeking action against the
foreign press.
	   The newspaper report comes as Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian
People's Party and the two-party opposition are negotiating to form
a government following July 26 national elections.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in the vote, claiming 64
of 122 seats in the National Assembly, but not the two-thirds
necessary to form a government alone.
	   A remote-launched rocket-propelled grenade exploded near Hun
Sen's convoy on his way to the opening of parliament on Sept. 24.
He escaped injury, but a 12-year-old boy who was sitting on the
side of the road was killed.
	   Hun Sen _ who has on at least four occasions claimed to be the
victim of an assassination attempt _ immediately accused the
opposition of being behind the failed plot.
	   Hun Sen has faced severe criticism by a U.S. congressman from a
district in California with a large ethnic Cambodian community.
	   Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) has urged the House
to pass a resolution calling for Hun Sen to be tried for genocide
and war crimes in an international court.
	   Rohrabacher's office said Friday that the House International
Relations Committee unanimously passed a Rohrabacher resolution
calling for an investigation of Hun Sen for ``possible criminal
culpability for conceiving, directing and sustaining a variety of
actions in violation of international humanitarian law.''
	   Khieu Kanharith was quoted in Sunday's Rasmei Kampuchea as
saying the news from Washington could put American and British
journalists in danger and that they should be forced to leave the
country for their own safety.
	   Hun Sen was a young field commander in the army of the Khmer
Rouge during the brutal communist guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of
Cambodia.
	   More than 1 million people died from starvation, disease and
execution when the Khmer Rouge were in power. However, historians
and researchers say there is no evidence that Hun Sen was
responsible for any mass killings.
	   Hun Sen defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1977 and fled to
Vietnam. There he became part of the nucleus of Cambodian
communists installed in Phnom Penh after the Vietnamese expelled
the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians have approved controversial
measures to ease citizenship requirements for ethnic Russians in a
referendum that was close, but that many see as signalling a change
of attitude in the country.
	   With votes counted from 99 percent of the country's precincts,
the changes were approved by a 53-45 margin in a Saturday
referendum. The remaining ballots apparently were blank or spoiled.
	   The referendum, which was held in conjunction with voting for
the country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, ends years of delays for
many citizenship applicants.
	   It also means that children born of stateless parents since
independence in 1991 will be granted citizenship.
	   With the results, Latvia heads off a confrontation with the
West. But whether the results will mollify Russia, which has
denounced Latvia for its treatment of ethnic Russians, is in doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   ``This is a turning point for Latvia. It will help us solve our
problems with Russia because our friends in the West will stand
behind us,'' Andris Skele, leader of the People's Party that led
the parliamentary polling, said early Sunday.
	   The amendments were first passed in June after a tense spring in
which Russia threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive
neighbor.
	   But after the measures passed, a drive to overturn them began,
spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claimed Latvian national
identity was imperiled. Their campaign led to Saturday's
referendum, which asks voters if they want to reject the
amendments.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there before the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule and their children, even if
born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling station in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning against the citizenship amendments.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The new center-right Peoples Party was at the top with 20.9
percent. The conservative Latvia's Way had 18 percent, followed by
the National Harmony Party, Fatherland and Freedom, the Union of
Social Democrats and the New Party.

Ohio State's defense leads top-ranked Buckeyes over Penn State
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last graf with late games. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Linebackers Jerry Rudzinski and Joe Cooper
recovered fumbles in the end zone for touchdowns Saturday as
top-ranked Ohio State beat No. 7 Penn State 28-9.
	   Last year, Penn State gained the No. 1 ranking with a win over
Ohio State at State College, Pa. In the rainy rematch at Columbus,
Ohio, the Buckeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) backed up their No. 1 ranking
with a dominating defensive performance against the Nittany Lions
(3-1, 0-1).
	   ``We wanted to redeem ourselves from that embarrassment last
year,'' Rudzinski said. ``We had the same players back and wanted
to step up and show the country.''
	   Rudzinski recovered a fumble by Penn State quarterback Kevin
Thompson for a TD with 3:51 left in the first half. In the third
quarter, Percy King blocked a Penn State punt and Cooper recovered
to put Ohio State up 21-3.
	   The Buckeyes' offensive touchdowns came on a 20-yard (18-meter)
TD pass from Joe Germaine to Michael Wiley just before halftime and
Joe Montgomery's 1-yard (meter) run with 3:08 left in the third
quarter.
	   Ohio State quarterbacks coach Tim Salem got so excited by
Wiley's TD that he punched his hand through a window and sent glass
shattering into the press box. He suffered small cuts on his right
index finger and forearm.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 2 Nebraska 24, Oklahoma State
17; No. 3 Tennessee 17, Auburn 9; No. 4 UCLA 49, Washington State
17; No. 12 Georgia 28, No. 6 LSU 27; No. 8 Florida 16, Alabama 10;
No. 9 Florida State 24, Maryland 10; No. 10 Virginia 52, San Jose

Virginia 45, Navy 24; No. 18 Texas A&AMP;M 24, Kansas 21; No. 21

September a turning point in Malaysian politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos KL106 &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It was a difficult September in
tropical Malaysia. The deputy prime minister was fired over sordid
sex allegations, arrested and then turned up in court with a black
eye.
	   Battered and bruised, Anwar Ibrahim has struck a chord, making
ordinary Malaysians defy state power and question political
authority for the first time.
	   In a nation where even the main opposition party had stopped
short of calling for the top man's dismissal, people began to
publicly criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule
and shout in the streets for him to resign.
	   ``I think it is a generational thing. Younger Malaysians are
saying that they are not prepared to accept someone's word just
because he has been in power so long,'' said Rustam Sani, a social
critic.
	   Since Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar on Sept. 2, it has been four
weeks of fiery speeches, mammoth crowds, posters, leaflets,
underground videotapes, tear gas and water cannons in a country
where political protest is virtually banned.
	   Never has a dissident gone around the country declaiming that
Mahathir is corrupt and never have so many responded to such
dissent.
	   ``It is not a blip on the screen,'' says Abdul Razak Baginda,
executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a
private think tank.
	   ``We have this thing toward the government. Respect or fear of
the state apparatus. But now a lot of us are angered by what has
happened,'' said Baginda.
	   The law requires police permits for public gatherings of more
than four people. Anwar just showed up. The throngs gathered,
feeling the exhilaration of shouting out their feelings while
police did nothing to stop them.
	   There were 35,000 in Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka Square on Sept. 20,
chanting ``Reform,'' and carrying Anwar on their shoulders a few
hours before his arrest.
	   Some got carried away, marched toward the prime minister's
residence, trashed the lobby of the ruling party headquarters. Then
the police acted.
	   Day after day they charged protesters, soaking them with
stinging jets of water, beating and arresting them as government
opponents were scooped up into detention. At least 300 people were
arrested.
	   Yet many who remained free spoke out more strongly than ever.
	   Lim Kit Siang, head of the opposition Democratic Action Party,
for the first time said Mahathir had been in power too long and
took him on face-to-face in a Parliament debate over Anwar's
detention.
	   ``It's not that people are pro-Anwar, but the people are
concerned with what the government is doing. It has full control,''
said Zainal Rohizan, a university employee who rushed to court last
week for a glimpse of Anwar after reading about his injuries.
	   Anwar, 51, said he was handcuffed and blindfolded, then
clobbered by policemen on the night of his arrest on Sept. 20.
During his arraignment on 10 counts of sodomy and corruption nine
days later, the man who had been in line for the past five years to
step into the prime minister's seat said police stopped beating him
only when he fell unconscious.
	   The last time Malaysians came out on the streets to protest
against Mahathir was in 1987 when he sacked Supreme Court judges.
More than 100 people were detained under the Internal Security Act,
which allows imprisonment without trial.
	   ``But this time the main actor is a politician with a much
greater national presence, second only to Mahathir's,'' said
Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of politics at University of Malaya.
	   ``It has stirred the grass roots the way 1987 had not,'' said
Chandra. ``The issue has captured national imagination cutting
across ethnic divides.''
	   It was just not majority Malays angry over the treatment of a
politician of their race and religion, but Chinese and Indians who
joined protests, he said. Malays comprise nearly 60 percent of the
country's 22 million people. Chinese are 30 percent and ethnic
Indians 10 percent.
	   The political crisis could not have come at a worse time. Months
of wrangling between Mahathir and Anwar over policy had left
investors confused and the economy directionless. Just before Anwar
was booted he announced that Malaysia had sunk into its first
recession in 10 years. Thousands will lose their jobs, the
government has said.
	   Yet many Malays are grateful for the modern cities and factories
Mahathir has built in a country that until a decade ago was an
Asian backwater exporting rubber and tin.
	   ``Malaysians being Malaysians, once they find their pockets full
will start wondering why they are wasting time with politics,''
said Chandra.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Former deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim left a hospital Sunday after overnight medical check-ups of
injuries he received during police custody.
	   A police motorcade whisked Anwar, seated in the back of a jeep
with tinted windows, away from the government-owned University
Hospital, where he had been admitted late Saturday.
	   Anwar's lawyers said they did not know where he was being taken.
They had been denied access to their client since his last court
appearance Wednesday. Hospital officials refused to comment on
Anwar's condition.
	   The former heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
appeared twice in Sessions Court last week, pleading innocent to
five counts of corruption and five of illegal homosexual acts.
	   He alleged that his black eye and bruises on his neck and arm
came from police punches and slaps that left him bloody and
unconscious the night of his arrest, Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was scheduled to be rearraigned Monday in High Court. Then
a trial date will be set.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage. The court granted Anwar's request for
further medical attention after he complained of neck and back
pain.
	   At the hospital, Anwar was believed to have undergone checks
including X-rays on his backbone and his bruised left eye. He was
admitted to the orthopedic department upon arrival.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   Police stood guard within and outside the hospital, using a
wooden barricade to seal off entry to the first floor where Anwar
was being treated. Police blocked stairwell entrances and barred
visitors, including Anwar's wife and children.
	   After leading thousands in protests against Mahathir's 17-year
rule, Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite detention without charge.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.
	   The United States, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, World Bank
President James Wolfensohn and the United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan, among others, have voiced concern over Anwar's case and
allegations of police brutality.
	   Deputy Inspector General of Police Norian Mai was quoted in
Sunday papers as saying he expected the investigation to be
completed soon.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had clashed over economic policy as Malaysia sank
into recession.

Georgian president calls for resolution to Russia's economic
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze
called for Russia to stay on the track of ``democratic
development'' and find a resolution to its economic crisis, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Shevardnaze, who met Saturday with Gennady Seleznyov, the
speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, is eager for
``political and economic stability of (Georgia's) great neighbor
Russia, as well as its democratic development,'' according to the
reports.
	   Georgia, still embroiled in political and economic instability
after the fall of the Soviet Union, has been hit hard by
aftershocks from Russia's latest financial trouble.
	   Shevardnaze and Seleznyov also discussed the conflict in
Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, as well as the Russian
parliament's continuing refusal to ratify a friendship treaty
signed by Shevardnadze and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1993.
	   Seleznyov said ``not everything is all right in the ratification
issue,'' but did not go into details.
	   Despite tensions over the treaty, there are ``no unresolved
issues in Georgian-Russian relations,'' Seleznyov said.

Russia marks 41st anniversary of first satellite in space
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia marked the 41st anniversary Sunday of the
launch of the Sputnik satellite - the first manmade object sent
into Earth's orbit.
	   Sputnik, launched on Oct. 4, 1957, was a crude satellite. The
size of a beach ball, it went around and around the earth, sending
``beep, beep'' signals by radio.
	   But the little satellite, the first manmade object to orbit the
Earth, profoundly changed human history. Then, at the height of the
Cold War, the space race was on, and the Soviet Union and the
United States were committed to spending whatever it took to gain
dominance in space.
	   The anniversary, marked by meetings at space and scientific
institutes, is also a reminder of Russia's present space troubles.
	   Russia's Mir space station will be ditched sometime next year
because of funding shortages, and an international space station
has been delayed because of Russia's inability to fund a key
component.

Family still waits for word on detained Chinese journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly a month after China's secret police hauled
away a leading Chinese journalist, his family still has no word on
his whereabouts or condition, a rights group reported Sunday.
	   Shi Binhai will pass his 30th day in detention Monday. Police
are required by law to either file formal detention orders or
release suspects after 30 days in custody, although the deadline is
often ignored.
	   As of Saturday night, Shi's family had neither received a
detention notice nor been told where he is being held, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   Shi's wife, Zhang Hong, last saw him being taken away on Sept. 5
by agents from the Ministry of State Security.
	   An editor with the China Economic Times, a reformist newspaper
with loose connections to China's State Council, or Cabinet, the
36-year-old Shi also helped compile the popular book ``Political
China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New Structure.''
	   Although the book examines the need for political reform, media
and dissident circles believe other activities got Shi in trouble
with authorities.
	   The Information Center speculated that Shi was preparing to
interview Zhao Ziyang and had been in contact with the former
Communist Party leader who was purged for refusing to back a
crackdown on student democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in
1989.
	   For many intellectuals and dissidents, Zhao has become a symbol
of a more tolerant era and for political change. Last seen in
public visiting students in Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989, Zhao
has since lived under house arrest in a walled compound in Beijing.
	   Shi Binhai's 30th day in detention, Monday, is also the day
China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, the U.N. rights treaty that guarantees freedom of
expression.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center called Shi's case a test
of whether Chinese leaders intend to respect the covenant. Even
after signing, the treaty will not come into force until ratified
by China's legislature, which may choose to attach reservations,
effectively nullifying some provisions.

Eleven die in bus plunge off south China road

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A bus packed with holiday travelers has veered
off a bridge in south China, killing 11 people and injuring 30, the
state-run Beijing Evening News reported Sunday.
	   Only one person, a small child, on the bus escaped injury when
it plunged about 80 meters (yards) in Hunan province's Cili county
on Thursday, the newspaper said.
	   Among those injured, some were in critical condition, it said.
	   The bus was one of three in a convoy taking travelers from
Wuhan, provincial capital of Hubei, to Zhangjiajie city in Hunan
for the four-day National Day weekend, which started Thursday.
	   The Beijing Evening News said the buses had been traveling all
night when the accident occurred early in the morning.

More West Bank clashes Sunday on eve of Jewish holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes broke out Sunday
at an Israeli checkpoint outside the tense West Bank town of
Hebron, but no injuries were immediately reported.
	   It marked the fifth straight day of skirmishes in and around
Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000
Palestinians and a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Sunday's fighting broke out at the Halhul checkpoint outside
Hebron, where Israeli troops were refusing to let anyone pass. A
crowd of about 100 Palestinians gathered, and some began throwing
stones and bottles at the soldiers.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas, but
witnesses said no one was hurt.
	   The closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with some easings,
has been in effect since just before the Sept. 20 New Year holiday.
	   Army radio said it was expected to continue through the weeklong
Jewish festival of Sukkot, which was beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   Palestinians complain bitterly about closures, which prevent
tens of thousands of workers from getting to jobs in Israel and
cost the Palestinian economy millions in lost wages and commercial
trade.
	   In sealing off the Palestinian lands, Israel cited threats from
the Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994. Hamas vowed to carry out
attacks after Israeli soldiers killed two wanted fugitives from the
group last month.
	   Israel radio quoted defense officials as saying potential terror
targets include airports, border crossings, beaches, and sites
abroad associated with Israel or Judaism.
	   Also Sunday, the two sides were working to lay groundwork for a
visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is due to
arrive Tuesday. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was holding
talks with Israel's Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh.
	   Albright's visit is meant to prepare for an Israeli-Palestinian
summit in Washington on Oct. 15-19. The Clinton administration has
been trying to get the two sides to agree to terms for an Israeli
pullback in the West Bank.
	   Erekat has said the United States was trying to coax a pledge
from Israel to ease settlement activity in exchange for assurances
from the Palestinians that they will not encourage illegal
construction.
	   Israel has repeatedly accused the Palestinians of not doing
enough to crack down on Hamas and other militants.

Australian government claims mandate despite narrow re-election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Howard, adds photo numbers. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos SYD101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After a narrow re-election victory,
conservative Prime Minister John Howard on Sunday claimed a mandate
for his key economic plans of tax reform and sale of the national
telephone company.
	   But Howard's ability to push through the reforms remained in
doubt as minor and opposition parties _ who may have a majority in
Parliament's upper house _ claimed the huge loss of support for the
government showed people did not want his plans implemented.
	   With close to 80 percent of the vote counted, Howard's
conservatives came in with what the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
predicted will be a majority of seven seats in the lower house, a
loss of at least 20 of their previous 41-seat majority.
	   Lynton Crosby, director of Howard's Liberal party, said he
expected the government to end up with a majority of up to a dozen
seats, but even the slimmest majority gave Howard a mandate.
	   ``We will have a majority of representatives in the Parliament,
that's what counts. That gives us the authority and the opportunity
to pursue our plans,'' Crosby said.
	   But the main opposition Labor Party said the huge erosion of
support for the government denied Howard a mandate to introduce his
planned tax on all goods and services or sell the government's
remaining stake in telecommunications company Telstra Corp.
	   The minority Democrats party said it was on track to win five
additional seats in the Senate, enough to win the balance of power.
Leader Meg Lees has said the party would block the sale of Telstra
and will change Howard's tax package to exempt food.
	   Howard told reporters his victory was an endorsement of his
reform plans, which he would ask both houses of Parliament to
endorse at the at the first opportunity.
	   Howard claimed victory late Saturday at a rally of cheering
supporters in Sydney.
	   ``I want first and foremost to thank the Australian people for
returning the government. I want to thank the Australian people for
embracing a bold economic reform that is in the long-term interest
of the Australian community,'' Howard said.
	   The win will see Howard in office to preside over the Sydney
2000 Olympics, the centenary of Australia's federation as a nation
in 2001, and the country's entry into the new millennium.
	   Needing to win 27 extra electorates to win government, the Labor
Party led by Kim Beazley cut deep into Howard's parliamentary
majority, but not enough to win.
	   ``I'm proud to say the Labor Party is back in town. We approach
the next three years with great confidence,'' said Beazley in
conceding.
	   The conservatives also held off a strong challenge from the far
right-wing One Nation party, which attracted about 8 percent of the
national vote.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who exploded onto the
political scene about 18 months ago with proposals to freeze Asian
immigration and cut welfare programs for Aborigines, appeared not
to have been re-elected, calling into question the party's
viability.
	   About 12 million registered voters cast their ballots Saturday
at thousands of polling booths in public buildings, from the
nation's desert Outback to its tropical north and in its bustling
cities in the southeast.
	   Howard staked his government's fate on reforms to simplify an
antiquated tax structure that has been built up since the
Depression era of the 1930s, with the goods and services tax as the
centerpiece. Voters rejected a similar plan at a 1993 election.
	   Howard offered income tax cuts worth Australian dollars 13
billion (U.S. dlrs 7.6 billion) to soften the blow of the new tax.

Victory very close for Australia

	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan lost three wickets in just
seven deliveries by lunch on Sunday as Australia moved closer
toward winning the first Test against Pakistan.
	   Pakistan which conceded a heavy 244-run first innings lead, were
reeling at 55 for four with Salim Malik (9 not out) and Moin Khan
(12 not out) fighting a grim battle.
	   Australia amassed a massive 513 in its first innings in reply to
Pakistan's 269 runs before its innings folded in the last over of
Saturday.
	   Skipper Aamir Sohail and Saeed Anwar were off to a cautious
start under overcast conditions, adding 24 runs in the first hour.
However, once McGrath changed his ends and bowled into the strong
breeze, Sohail played on to his stumps after scoring 13 runs.
	   Damien Fleming in his fourth over of the day ignited Pakistan's
collapse. He trapped Muhammad Wasim and Inzamamul Haq leg before
and both batsmen were out for a duck. From 32 for three, Pakistan
was further reduced to 32 for four when Colin Miller got a lucky
decision off Saeed Anwar from English umpire Peter Willey as the
batsmen struck on the front pad while stretching long way forward.
	   Fleming had taken two for 26 while McGrath and Miller had one
wicket each for 14 and 12 runs respectively.

More West Bank clashes Sunday on eve of Jewish holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Stone-throwing clashes broke out Sunday
at an Israeli checkpoint outside the tense West Bank town of
Hebron, but no injuries were immediately reported.
	   It marked the fifth straight day of skirmishes in and around
Hebron, which is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000
Palestinians and a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   Sunday's fighting broke out at the Halhul checkpoint outside
Hebron, where Israeli troops were refusing to let anyone pass. A
crowd of about 100 Palestinians gathered, and some began throwing
stones and bottles at the soldiers.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas, but
witnesses said no one was hurt.
	   The closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with some easings,
has been in effect since just before the Sept. 20 New Year holiday.
	   Army radio said it was expected to continue through the weeklong
Jewish festival of Sukkot, which was beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   Palestinians complain bitterly about closures, which prevent
tens of thousands of workers from getting to jobs in Israel and
cost the Palestinian economy millions in lost wages and commercial
trade.
	   In sealing off the Palestinian lands, Israel cited threats from
the Islamic militant group Hamas, which has killed scores of
Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994. Hamas vowed to carry out
attacks after Israeli soldiers killed two wanted fugitives from the
group last month.

Pakistan-India expel diplomats ahead of talks on disputed Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan and India expelled each
others' diplomats on espionage charges just two weeks before
``confidence-building talks,'' a private news agency reported
Sunday.
	   The expulsions also were reported in Pakistani newspapers but no
official confirmation was available from either country.
	   The News Network International, quoting unnamed diplomatic
sources, said India expelled a Pakistani diplomat on Tuesday for
spying. The name of the Pakistani official was not available.
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf neither
confirmed nor denied the report saying ``I will check the report
... (but) such things do happen in view of the state of relations
between the two countries.''
	   In India, foreign ministry spokesman K.C. Singh also refused to
either confirm or deny the expulsions.
	   The foreign secretaries of the two countries are scheduled to
meet in Islamabad on Oct. 15 to resume stalled talks on the
disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over the province since independence in 1947.
	   Both countries hold parts of Kashmir and lay claim on the rest.
Kashmir is the only Muslim majority state in the Hindu-dominated
India.
	   Tensions in South Asia have escalated after India conducted a
series of nuclear tests in May, which was matched with similar
series of tests by Pakistan the same month.

Citing Turkey-Syria dispute, Israel curtails border exercises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Signaling it does not want to be
involved in any potential military confrontation between Syria and
Turkey, Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border
with Syria.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army Sunday to
limit such maneuvers to underscore Israel's hands-off approach to
the escalating dispute between Damascus and Ankara.
	   ``Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but
rather in finding ways to renew talks,'' Mordechai's office quoted
him as saying.
	   Turkey amassed troops on its border with Syria after accusing
Damascus of supporting anti-Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies
that, and accuses Israel of plotting with Turkey _ an accusation
Israel has sought to deflect.
	   Mordechai said Israel's military cooperation agreements with
Turkey are not directed against Syria or any other country. Under
accords signed in 1996, the two countries have held joint
maneuvers, and Israel is also allowed to use Turkish air space.
	   Israeli officials and experts said they doubted Israel would
defend Turkey on the ground in the event that hostilities did erupt
with Syria.
	   ``It is not true that one side or the other (Israel or Turkey)
will come to the aid of the other in the case of military
confrontation,'' Zvi Elpeleg, former ambassador to Turkey, told
Israel radio.
	   However, one Israeli politician influential in military matters
_ Uzi Landau, head of the parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee _ said Israel should not rule out sending troops to the
Syrian border as a deterrent if war did break out between Syria and
Turkey.
	   ``There are a few things that we could do without entering a
war,'' Landau told army radio.
	   Mordechai called on Syria to reopen peace talks with Israel,
which broke off in 1996. As a condition for the renewal of peace
talks, Syria has demanded that Israel agree in principle to return
the Golan Heights, which it captured in 1967.
	   The current Israeli government has refused, a change in policy
from the previous Labor government, which was negotiating a
withdrawal from the strategic plateau with Syria when talks broke
off.

Paper: 4 Afghans accused of spying arrested in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has arrested four Afghan men who
allegedly were spying for the Taliban militia in the southeastern
province of Sistan-Baluchestan, the Asr-e-Azadegan newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   The men were sent to Iran ``to carry out acts of sabotage,'' the
independent Farsi-language paper said, quoting unnamed Iranian
officials.
	   It gave no other details.
	   An estimated 200,000 Iranian troops currently are carrying out
ground and air maneuvers over a 50,000-square-kilometer
(20,000-square-mile) area along Iran's border with Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
	   The maneuvers in the Sistan-Baluchestan and Khorasan provinces
mark the deepening tension between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Taliban fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian
journalist after the Aug. 8 capture of the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban, which rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
renegade fighters killed the Iranians. But Taliban leaders have
refused Iranian demands that the killers be handed over.
	   The Taliban, in turn, have accused Iran of backing Afghanistan's
northern-based opposition alliance.
	   Taliban leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border
in response to Iran's war games.

Police to be separated from armed forces beginning April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's police force will be
gradually separated from the military and placed under civilian
control beginning next year, armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto
announced Sunday.
	   Now, the police are part of the military, known as ABRI, along
with the army, navy and air force.
	   Since the resignation of autocratic President Suharto last May
that followed riots and protests, calls have been growing for their
separation.
	   The change will be a basic reform for the armed forces.
Indonesia's military has been accused of human rights abuses during
Suharto's 32-year rule.
	   The change will come into effect ahead of general elections set
for May next year. The government says the poll will be conducted
freely and democratically after decades of tightly controlled
politics under Suharto.
	   The police are expected to play a major role in crowd control
and other security matters during the campaign and balloting.
	   News reports on Sunday said supervision of the police would be
transferred initially from the military to the defense ministry.
Wiranto as armed forces chief and defense minister heads both.
	   The Jakarta Post said an evaluation would be conducted within
six months to assess whether the police should eventually be placed
under the control of the home affairs ministry or directly under
the president.
	   Wiranto told reporters that the duties and functions of the
police should be tied to a civilian government rather than the
armed forces.
	   On another matter, Wiranto said Indonesia's economic crisis has
forced the military to scale down its annual celebrations for
national armed forces day Monday.
	   He said the traditional parade had been canceled.
	   Instead, President B.J. President is scheduled to attend a
ceremony that for the first time will be held at the military's
headquarters at Cilangkap in Jakarta's eastern outskirts.
	   Normally the ceremony, which commemorates the founding of the
military in the fight against Dutch colonizers after World War II,
is staged in the center of Jakarta.

Chechen gunmen take four British hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS kidnapping Saturday not Sunday, ADDS locator in 2nd
graf, details in 4th graf.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unknown gunmen took four British hostages in
Russia's breakaway Chechnya region after a shootout with their
bodyguards, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   The four British citizens, who were in Chechnya to install a
cellular phone system, were taken hostage Saturday after 20 men in
camouflage attacked the house where they lived in the Chechen
capital of Grozny, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded in
the firefight, Interfax said. Police are searching regional
hospitals for anyone coming in with gunshot wounds.
	   The kidnapping took place only 500 meters (550 yards) from the
regional government's department to fight kidnapping, Interfax
said. Policemen heard the shots, but didn't react because gunfire
is frequent in the evening in Grozny, the report said.
	   The British embassy in Moscow would not comment on the report.
	   The kidnapping comes just weeks after Chechen warlords released
two British charity workers, ending 14 months of captivity in the
turbulent republic in Russia's northern Caucasus region.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.
	   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been
unable to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for
some criminal gangs.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago. Moscow says
that Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over its
affairs.

Thai police arrest Malawi man with 21 kilograms of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have seized 21 kilograms (46.2
pounds) of heroin from a man from Malawi as he was preparing to
board a flight to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Thai newspapers reported
Sunday.
	   Police quoted the man, identified as Yenri Suen Onabanjo, 32,
who was arrested Saturday, as saying was trying to smuggle the
drug, the Bangkok Post reported. It said the heroin had been
concealed inside audio loudspeakers.
	   Customs Department inspector general Somjainuek Engtrakul was
quoted as saying the suspect was part of a Nigerian-run
drug-smuggling ring.
	   The Customs Department has confiscated 80 kilograms (176 pounds)
of heroin in the past three months, the newspaper reported. Its
estimated cost in Thailand would be about 25 million baht (dlrs
633,000), but it would sell abroad for many times that value.

Top aide to Taipei mayor resigns over hostess bar visits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Taipei mayor's top aide stepped down
Sunday from his re-election campaign after he was found to have
frequented hostess bars.
	   The resignation of Ma Yung-cheng, formerly the city government's
spokesman, deprives mayor Chen Shui-bian of a key adviser in a
difficult campaign.
	   Chen is trying to defend the opposition stronghold against
popular former justice minister Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
	   The bar visits, which were disclosed by a defector from the city
government, were particularly damaging because Chen has made
hostess clubs a key target of his campaign to rein in Taipei's
flamboyant night life and crack down on gangs.
	   Ma, the adviser, acknowledged he was a customer of two Taipei
hostess clubs, where young women accompany clients in drinking and
singing, but he described the visits as a ``personal defect.''
	   ``My visits over two years ago had nothing to do with city
government business, though I'm not trying to rationalize my
behavior,'' Ma told a news conference and bowed in apology.
	   But Ma said at least one visit to a club was made at the
invitation of city council deputies and accused them of being
hypocrites.
	   ``Here we see those who used to invite me to clubs, who might be
called frequent customers of clubs, suddenly turning themselves
into paragons of morality and accusing me,'' Ma said.
	   The council members demanded he produce evidence.
	   Ma was one of two young advisers who helped engineer Chen's
ground-breaking victory in 1994 elections that snatched the
mayorship of Taiwan's capital away from the Nationalists.
	   His reputation as a sharp-tongued playboy forced him into less
public roles in Chen's administration, though he had recently
resigned from the city government to work for the campaign full
time.
	   Chen's other adviser, Luo Wen-jia, was forced to resign from the
city government after several people were injured during a
promotional tug of war he organized.
	   Luo recently returned from study in the United States to serve
as executive director of Chen's campaign.
	   Chen's opponent Ma is known for his incorruptibility and
efficiency, and the two are running neck and neck despite the
mayor's high approval ratings.
	   The election, coinciding with polls for the legislature and
mayor of Taipei's second largest city, Kaohsiung, is set for Dec.
5.

 &UR; Doohan wins fifth consecutive title &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: updates with quotes, new material throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILLIP ISLAND, Australia (AP) _ Michael Doohan conquered his
home course Sunday to win the Australian Grand Prix and clinch his
fifth consecutive 500 c.c. world motorcycle championship.
	   Tens of thousands of fans swamped the Australian after he
flashed past the checkered flag. Holding high an Australian flag
with the figure `5' on it, Doohan weaved through a sea of bodies
forming a guard of honor the entire length of the circuit.
	   ``To actually win the championship here is something I could
never have dreamed of,'' Doohan said.
	   ``To have an Australian crowned world champion in Australia is
fantastic _ I hope everyone else is enjoying it.''
	   As soon as he appeared at his post-race press conference, Doohan
confirmed that he and Honda had agreed to try for a sixth world
title next year.
	   Roaring away from pole position Sunday _ his 57th career pole _
Doohan relegated his rivals to a race amongst themselves for the
minor placings.
	   This time there would be no mistake as he zeroed in on win No.
53 ahead of New Zealander Simon Crafar and Honda teammate Alex
Criville of Spain.
	   Doohan said that despite breaking out to a five-second lead over
the pack, he had to stare down a mental hurdle approaching lap 17.
	   It was on that lap last year that the Australian lost
concentration for a split second and slid out of the race.
	   ``The big thing here for me was lap 17, so when I got past lap
17 it was pretty much maintenance control after that,'' Doohan
said.
	   ``When there were four or five laps to go and I had a
five-second lead I thought `Just bring the thing home'.''
	   Only minutes before the start of the race, there were nervous
thoughts that he might have to pull out as his crew struggled with
a mechanical problem.
	   ``When I left pit lane for my sighting lap things weren't all
that good, it was missing and running on only three of the four
cylinders,'' Doohan said.
	   ``But the team did a great job to get it running again.''
	   Doohan opened up a lead of 1.9 seconds after just one lap,
surprising even himself with an uncharacteristically fast start.
	   Tire wear remained a concern and despite maintaining a healthy
break he said if he had forced the pace further his tires would not
have lasted the distance.
	   Doohan won the 27-lap race in a time of 42 minutes, 42.511
seconds, slowing to beat Crafar by .8 seconds. Crafar set the
fastest lap time and a circuit record of 1:33.868. (djp)

 &UR; Pope John Paul II holds Mass in Split after beatifying WW II

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ A huge throng of people waved flowers and
small Vatican flags Sunday to welcome Pope John Paul II to this
centuries-old southern coastal town on the last day of his visit to
Croatia.
	   The city was draped in the Vatican's traditional yellow and
white in preparation for an outdoor Mass that the pope was to hold
later. Hundreds of thousands of people arrived from across the
country as well as from neighboring Bosnia and Montenegro, which
together with Serbia comprises Yugoslavia.
	   On Saturday evening, the border crossing between Croatia and
Montenegro was opened for the first time since the 1991 Serbo-Croat
war, allowing Croats from Montenegro to attend the Mass.
	   The Mass was to be held on a broad plateau overlooking the
Adriatic Sea, and many pilgrims were headed to the Mass from their
boats, anchored along the coast.
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   John Paul also was to visit St. Dujam Cathedral and spend time
with the youth in the town, which is celebrating 1,700 years of
existence.
	   But for most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit
was Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   As Zagreb's archbishop, Stepinac supported Croatia's
German-backed fascist puppet state in its early days. By 1942,
however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal policies, which
led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and
Croat opponents.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaborating with the
Nazis. He died in 1960 while under house arrest, the basis of the
Vatican's finding that he died for his faith.
	   Honoring Stepinac before half a million people in the Marian
shrine of Marija Bistrica on Saturday, the pope said Stepinac,
``having endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities
of the communist system, is now entrusted to the memory of his
fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of martyrdom.''
	   He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the whole tragedy which
befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course of this century
marked by the three great evils of fascism, national socialism and
communism.''
	   John Paul also addressed Croatia's emergence from the 1991 war
with its minority Serbs, appealing to a country ``to forgive and
reconcile and to purify one's memory of hatred'' and ``the desire
for revenge.''
	   When the pope first visited Croatia in 1994, rebel Serbs still
controlled the third of the country which they seized with
Yugoslavia's backing. Croatia retook these territories in 1995, but
many Serbs fled the offensive, and the government is reluctant to
see them come back.

Ethnic Hungarians to remain in Romanian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TARGU MURES, Romania (AP) _ The Hungarian minority party has
decided to remain in the Romanian government, saying it does not
want to be blamed for the failure of Romania's limping reforms,
radio reported Sunday.
	   Last month, the party which represents the interests of the 1.7
million Hungarian minority said it would withdraw from the Romanian
government over the failure to establish a Hungarian state
university that the government promised but was later blocked by
Parliament.
	   The government on Wednesday said it was prepared to set up a
Hungarian-German university called Petofi-Schiller, which appeased
some Hungarians and was widely attacked by Romanian politicians.
	   After a stormy 12-hour debate in this Transylvanian city, ethnic
Hungarians voted by 59-37 late Saturday to stay in the cabinet and
four-party ruling coalition, regional radio reported Sunday in the
city some 250 kilometers (156 miles) northwest of the capital.
	   ``We cannot allow ourselves to let them (Romanians) blame us for
the failure of reforms,'' said Bela Marko, head of the Democratic
Union of Hungarians in Romania, after the vote.
	   Romania is struggling to implement market and democratic
reforms, but the process is slowed by political bickering in the
coalition. Investors say bureaucracy and corruption discourage
business and have contributed to a recession.
	   Romanians are opposed to a state Hungarian university, citing
bitter historical disputes between Romania and Hungary. They claim
European norms do not require the Hungarians to have their own
state university.
	   The few thousand Germans who live in Romania said they do not
need a state university and some Romanian politicians say the
university is bound to become a Hungarian one
	   Most ethnic Hungarians live in the northwestern region of
Transylvania, which was under the Austro-Hungarian empire until
1918 and has changed hands several times over the centuries.
	   Relations between the two countries improved in 1996 when they
signed a bilateral treaty. Hungarians joined the coalition
government when reformist parties were elected in November 1996.

<TEXT>
	   BATHURST, Australia (AP) _ Australian-based New Zealander Jim
Richards won his sixth Bathurst 1,000-kilometer touring car race
Sunday, teaming with Swedish driver Rickard Rydell to give Volvo
its first win at Mt. Panorama.
	   Richards shared a Volvo S40 with British touring car champion
Rydell in a race-long duel with the Nissan Primera of Richards' son
Steven and Englishman Matt Neal.
	   The Nissan finished two seconds behind while third place went to
the Audi of Australian two-liter touring car champion Brad Jones
and Cameron McConville.
	   Jim Richards started from pole position but Steven grabbed the
lead on the first run up Mt. Panorama and stayed in front until the
first fuel stop, then for a brief time before the last stop.
	   Five pace-car periods, two in the last hour, kept the top three
in touch.
	   The Vectra of Greg Murphy and Russel Ingall led briefly and was
third for much of the time before crashing on lap 84, one of three
victims of oil and debris from a crashed car.
	   Sunday's race was the second staged for two-liter cars since the
split between race organizers and the more popular V8 Holdens and
Fords.
	   The crowd was again sparse compared with those attracted by the
larger cars which will have their own 1,000-kilometer Bathurst race
in November. (djp)

Tanaka wins his first Japan Open crown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIGASHI-IBARAKI, Japan (AP) _ Hidemichi Tanaka shot a
3-under-par 69 Sunday and won the Japan Open crown by one stroke
over Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, a regular on the U.S. tour.
	   The 5-foot-7 (1.65-meter) Tanaka, renowned as a miniature John
Daly with a 300-yard (270-meter) drive, surged ahead of overnight
leader Ozaki with a round of five birdies and two bogeys for a
total of 5-under 283.
	   Joe, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the Japan tour,
shot a 1-over-par 73 with a sole birdie against two bogeys en route
to a 4-under 284 total over the par-72 Oarai Golf Club course. He
had led Tanaka by three strokes overnight.
	   Only two others finished with under-par totals over the windy
7,160-yard (6,516-meter) course, also known for its narrow fairways
studded with pine trees and punitive rough.
	   It wasn't an easy victory for Tanaka, whose most scary moments
came on the par-4, 435-yard (396-meter) final hole. After hitting
his drive right and deep into the trees, the 27-year-old in his
seventh year of career needed two shots to come out of the woods
with the first hitting a tree trunk and recoiling backward.
	   However, Tanaka avoided disaster with his sensational second
shot, clearing through a gap in the trees half the size of a coffee
table and flying 180 yards (165 meters) to the green. He then
two-putted from 35 feet (10 meters) for bogey and for the victory.
	   ``When I bogeyed the 16th after hitting my approach too short, I
knew I was under the pressure of the Japan Open crown,'' said
Tanaka who has been in a slump due to a back trouble since winning
his second career tournament in 1996.
	   ``When I drove into the trees at the final hole, I again
realized that I was off a little because of the tournament being
the Japan Open,'' Tanaka added. ``For me, this victory is
dreamlike, so is the fact that I could manage to get away with the
bogey on the final hole.''
	   Joe Ozaki, the top money-winner of the 1991 season, said his
final round ended before being able to pick up momentum.
	   ``I had a few birdie chances today, but the way I was putting
made it a very long day,'' he said.
	   Ozaki, who has played mostly on the U.S. PGA Tour since 1993,
was seeking his 26th title on the Japan tour. He has yet to win in
the United States.
	   Tanaka's first Japan Open title was worth 24 million yen (dlrs
176,000) from a purse of 120 million yen (dlrs 882,000).
	   Satoshi Higashi shot a 69 for 2-under 286, followed by Toru
Taniguchi, who turned in a 73 for 1-under 287.
	   Defending champion Craig Parry of Australia went around in 72
and shared sixth at 2-over 290 with Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who
shot a 74, and four others.
	   Jumbo, the eldest of the Ozaki brothers, is the leading
money-winner this season so far with two victories. He was seeking
his 109th career victory.

Auto component workers end South African strike

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The National Union of
Metalworkers ended a five-week long strike on Sunday by spare-part
makers in the auto industry after agreeing on wage hikes.
	   The strike was called off after union members endorsed the
latest set of wage proposals, details of which weren't immediately
available.
	   The country's seven auto manufacturers had been nearly shut down
because of a shortage of components caused by the strike.

Sharon: I won't shake Arafat's hand

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped
to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview
published Sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians,
is being considered for the government's No. 2 post. In it, he
would be a pivotal figure in reaching a final peace settlement with
the Palestinians.
	   ``Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run the
negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand,'' Sharon was
quoted as saying in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
	   The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to
making a decision on the appointment. Netanyahu himself has been
acting foreign minister since the post was vacated in January by
David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating
strategy with the Palestinians.
	   Sharon's appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's
positions and could further strain relations with Arab neighbors.
	   Sharon is the general who led Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,
and a former housing minister who strengthened Jewish settlement in
territories Israel captured from Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Mideast war.
	   Sharon told the Haaretz newspaper he would accept the foreign
minister's job if he were allowed to ``act to strengthen the
country.''

EU parliament to vote on lifting of Le Pen's immunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Parliament votes Tuesday
on whether to lift the immunity of France's National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen, so a German court can try him for calling the
Holocaust ``a detail'' of history.
	   The request for a waiver of Le Pen's parliamentary immunity came
from prosecutors in Munich last April, after the far-right leader
told a press conference ``the gas chambers were a detail in the
history of the Second World War.''
	   The Front National refused to comment on the vote. ``We'll wait
for Tuesday's result,'' a spokesman at the party's headquarters
near Paris said. The vote will be held during the parliament's
regular monthly meeting in Strasbourg, France.
	   Munich's judicial authorities say they want to charge Le Pen
under an article of the German criminal code which makes it an
offense to belittle the Holocaust. If tried and convicted, Le Pen
faces up to five years in prison.
	   Under German law, members of the European Parliament cannot be
prosecuted, unless the 626-seat European Union assembly votes to
lift their immunity.
	   French legislation gives European Parliament members less
protection, and Le Pen has already been convicted in his homeland
for assaulting a Socialist politician last year.
	   The French court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, in effect banning him from holding office, running for
office, or voting. He also was fined dlrs 3,300.
	   Le Pen has appealed the French verdict. If upheld, the
conviction could make Le Pen ineligible to run in the June 1999
European Parliament elections. He has said that in that case his
wife, Jany, would run in his place.
	   Last week, the European Parliament's 20-member procedures
committee voted 16 to four to lift Le Pen's immunity. Le Pen is one
of 12 National Front members in the European parliament.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Pet owners brought a swarm of
animals, including iguanas, pythons and a donkey, to be blessed at
a Roman Catholic church in Manila Sunday.
	   Our Lady of Remedios Church and an animal welfare group invited
people to bring in their pets to mark the feast day of St. Francis
of Assisi. But they were overwhelmed by the animals that turned up.
	   The rite, offered for the first time at the church, was intended
to draw public attention to St. Francis' cause of caring for
animals and the environment, said the Rev. Francis Carey, the
priest who led the animals' blessing.
	   ``I didn't realize there would be so many,'' he said.
	   He counted at least 100 animals, including sheep, rabbits,
parrots and a hedgehog. A group of men dragged in a donkey, and a
small boy brought a fish in a glass bowl.
	   Church-goers who attended mass stayed on to gawk at the animals,
as the picturesque stone church began to smell and sound like a
zoo.
	   The blessing proceeded smoothly, except for some cats that
squirmed when doused with holy water.
	   ``I think the cats didn't like the water very much,'' Carey
said.

 &UR; Reports: Shooting spree follows arrests of bombing suspects

	   MACAU (AP) _ Police found an AK-47 assault rifle and seven
bullet shells outside a court building Sunday, a day after police
arrested four people believed to be involved in bomb attacks in
this Portuguese enclave.
	   The rifle was found after police said they received a report of
a shooting by a man from a car which was carrying four people. The
car was later found abandoned nearby.
	   No one was injured in the shooting.
	   On Saturday, police rounded up nine people following raids on a
hotel and a bar.
	   Four of them, including two former police officers, were
detained on suspicion of involvement in a bomb attack in May in
which the car of Macau's police director, Marquest Baptista, was
destroyed.
	   They were also suspected of a car bombing last month that
injured five police officers and 10 journalists, police said.
	   A district court on Sunday ordered the four to jail custody on
charges of plotting bomb attacks and of being members of gangs.
	   A spate of gangland-style killings, arson and other attacks_
many targeting government officials _ have plagued the enclave,
famous for its gambling and tourism industries.
	   Police say they believe the recent violence is linked to gang
wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking because of
Asia's economic crisis.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Macau, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to
Chinese rule next year.
	   Earlier this month, China said it would send an elite detachment
of soldiers to the territory to keep social order after it returns
to Chinese sovereignty.

Ohio State's defense leads top-ranked Buckeyes over Penn State
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. No pick up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Ohio State did it with defense.
	   Linebackers Jerry Rudzinski and Joe Cooper recovered fumbles in
the end zone for touchdowns as the top-ranked Buckeyes beat No. 7
Penn State 28-9 Saturday.
	   Last year, Penn State gained the No. 1 ranking with a win over
Ohio State at State College, Pa. In the rainy rematch at Columbus,
Ohio, the Buckeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) backed up their No. 1 ranking
with a dominating defensive performance against the Nittany Lions
(3-1, 0-1).
	   Ohio State held Penn State to 181 yards, including 79 on the
ground.
	   ``We wanted to redeem ourselves from that embarrassment last
year,'' Rudzinski said. ``We had the same players back and wanted
to step up and show the country.''
	   Rudzinski recovered a fumble by Penn State quarterback Kevin
Thompson for a TD with 3:51 left in the first half. In the third
quarter, Percy King blocked a Penn State punt and Cooper recovered
to put Ohio State up 21-3.
	   The Buckeyes' offensive touchdowns came on a 20-yard TD pass
from Joe Germaine to Michael Wiley just before halftime and Joe
Montgomery's 1-yard run with 3:08 left in the third quarter.
	   Ohio State quarterbacks coach Tim Salem got so excited by
Wiley's TD that he punched his hand through a window and sent glass
shattering into the press box. He suffered small cuts on his right
index finger and forearm.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 2 Nebraska 24, Oklahoma State
17; No. 3 Tennessee 17, Auburn 9; No. 4 UCLA 49, Washington State

 &UR; No. 2 Nebraska 24, Oklahoma State 17 &QC; 
	   At Kansas City, Mo., Nebraska's defense stopped Nathan Simmons
on the 1-yard line as time ran out to extend the nation's longest
major-college winning streak to 19 games.
	   Oklahoma State, seeking its first victory over Nebraska since
1961, faced a fourth-and-4 at the Huskers' 12 with 14 seconds left.
But Tony Lindsay kept the drive alive, hitting Sean Love with an
11-yard pass.
	   Lindsay then spiked the ball to stop the clock with five seconds
left. On the final play, Simmons ran up the middle but was stopped
by Mike Rucker and a swarm of defenders.
	   Nebraska (5-0, 1-0 Big 12), which took the lead on Joe Walker's
73-yard punt return with 7:29 left, stretched its unbeaten streak
against Oklahoma State (2-2, 1-1) to 35 games.
 &UR; No. 3 Tennessee 17, Auburn 9 &QC; 
	   At Auburn, Ala., Shaun Ellis returned an interception 90 yards
for a touchdown and Tennessee capitalized on three Auburn turnovers
to win the rematch of last year's SEC championship game.

almost squandered it as Auburn (1-3, 1-2) shut down the Vols the
rest of the way.

fourth-and-1 to give Alabama a last chance with 45 seconds left
from its own 26-yard line. Tide freshman Andrew Zow hit Calvin Hall
on a 45-yard pass to the Florida 34 with 19 seconds remaining, but

end the threat.
 &UR; No. 9 Florida St. 24, Maryland 10 &QC; 
	   At College Park, Md., Sebastian Janikowski kicked five field

	   Carter quieted the huge Tiger Stadium crowd by leading Georgia
to touchdowns on its first three possessions.
 &UR; No. 13 Wisconsin 24, Indiana 20 &QC; 
	   At Bloomington, Ind., Ron Dayne became the sixth player in
major-college history to rush for 4,000 career yards as a junior.
	   Dayne carried 28 times for 130 yards, giving him 4,083 for his
career. He also scored on a 2-yard TD run that put Wisconsin (5-0,
2-0 Big Ten) ahead 24-20 with 10:54 remaining.
 &UR; No. 14 Arizona 31, No. 20 Washington 28 &QC; 
	   At Seattle, Ortege Jenkins scored on a 9-yard run _

scores as West Virginia (3-1) rallied to beat Navy (1-3).

	   At Lawrence, Kan., Dante Hall ran for 177 yards and three

	   At Los Angeles, Ifeanyi Ohalete returned a blocked punt 14 yards

Report: Mass detention, torture of Christians in death case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police detained _ and sometimes
tortured _ dozens of Christians in a town in southern Egypt in
their investigation into the deaths of two local Christians, a
human rights group said Sunday.
	   The report from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights
accused security forces of ``mass punishment'' of residents of the
town of Al-Kushh in Sohag province, which is about 400 kilometers
(240 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Some of those detained described being hung up by their hands,
tortured with electric shocks and beaten. Men said the police
threatened to rape their wives and daughters if they did not
provide information about the killings.
	   Interior Ministry officials denied the reports of mass arrests
and said only a few people were questioned after the killings. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Coptic Christians are a minority in Egypt, representing about
one-sixth of the country's 60 million people. The government is
sensitive about the Christians because of repeated allegations that
they are treated as second-class citizens.
	   Trouble in Al-Kushh _ where about three-quarters of the 40,000
residents are Christians _ began on Aug. 14, when the bodies of
Samir Oweida, 25, and Karam Tamer, 27, were found in front of a
school.
	   The human rights group said that in the quest by police to find
a suspect, some 1,200 people were detained over a period of three
weeks for questioning.
	   It said that most of the detainees were Christian and that the
police avoided interrogating Muslim residents of the town to avoid
raising Christian-Muslim tensions.
	   In the end a Christian, Sheiboub William Artouri, was arrested
and charged in the case, the human rights report said.
	   Police said Artouri was with the victims on the night of the
crime and that after they had gambled and gotten drunk, he
allegedly shot them with a pistol, the report said.
	   The human rights group alleged that in its quest for a suspect,
the police rounded up whole families _ including women and
children.
	   Among those quoted in the report was Boktor Abul-Yamin Michael,
who was detained along with his wife and four children. He was
singled out because of allegations that one of the victims had had
an affair with his 15-year-old daughter.
	   Michael told the human rights group he was beaten and tortured
with electric shocks to ``sensitive parts'' of his body over 20
days of questioning by police, who tried to get him to admit to the
murders. He said police threatened to rape his wife and daughters
if he did not identify the killer.
	   It said that relatives of the victims also were detained and
tortured during the investigation, including William Saad, a cousin
of one of the victims, his wife and three children.
	   The report listed the names of a half-dozen families that
accused the police of misconduct during the investigation. And it
said that police extorted money from other families trying to avoid
having loved-ones arrested.
	   Similar allegations of police abuse in Al-Kushh were reported in
the current edition of the biweekly Cairo Times.
	   The newspaper interviewed more than 50 residents of the town,
who described police seizing residents at a rate of 50 or 60 a day
for questioning.
	   ``Most of the interviewees had scars on their backs (allegedly
from whips and electrodes), hands and toes (from electrodes) or
wrists (from manacles),'' the paper said.
	   It said 14 people were seriously enough injured during
interrogations to require hospitalization.
	   In the past, the Copts have been targeted by al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, the Muslim extremist group that has waged a campaign
of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police
and extremists.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish government, which sent about
10,000 soldiers into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, has
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, according to news reports.
	   Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two
days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily
Hurriyet said Saturday.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge
Damascus denies.
	   Turkey warned the Syrian government Friday that its ``patience
was running out,'' and Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the
general staff, has described the mounting tension with Syria as
``an undeclared war.''
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu on
Saturday denied his country was involved ``in any way'' in the
looming Turkey-Syria confrontation.
	   In an effort to head off a military conflict, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak flew to Damascus on Sunday for talks with Syrian
President Hafez Assad and was expected to visit Turkey on Monday.
On Saturday, he traveled with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to Riyadh
for talks with Saudi officials.

Malaysian police kill 11 in two days of shootouts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police killed 11 people, including
a pregnant woman, in two weekend shootouts with groups of alleged
criminals, Malaysian reports said Sunday.
	   No police officers were injured in either of the firefights.
	   Police said they killed six men in a van who refused to stop
when intercepted late Saturday night and started to shoot at
officers.
	   The Kelantan state police chief said police had not identified
the bodies, but that all the dead men were wanted on charges of
armed robbery, firearms smuggling and drug trafficking.
	   Five people were killed Friday night when police stormed a house
in the capital to arrest the alleged kidnappers of a politician's
son, The Sunday newspaper reported.
	   The report said one of those killed was eight months pregnant,
quoting her relatives. The woman and her husband were both killed,
leaving daughters ages 5 and 8, the paper said.
	   Two other men and a 19-year-old-woman who worked in a hair salon
were also killed after police opened fire on the house.
	   Police said those inside fired first and that the 3 million
ringgit (dlrs 790,000) ransom was recovered in the house.
	   The raid took place two hours after the ransom had been paid and
the 11-year-old son of former Selangor state Gov. Muhammad Taib had
been left uninjured by a roadside near the capital, according to
news reports.
	   Police said the kidnappers had threatened to kill the boy, but
accepted half the ransom they had originally demanded. The boy was
abducted while being driven to school on Sept. 28.

Police raid Taipei discos for drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Police seized more than 2,000 tablets of
the designer drug Ecstasy in raids Sunday on pharmacies and discos
and arrested nine people on drug possession charges.
	   Police accompanied by reporters and camera crews raided nine
pharmacies before descending on the downtown Taipei Texound and
Edge discos where they have staged lengthy undercover
investigations seeking to identify drug suppliers.
	   An American man, whose name was not disclosed, was also charged
with working illegally as a disc jockey.
	   Newspapers said 200 people ranging from ages 17 to 56 were taken
away for questioning. For many, it was the second or third time
they had been caught in police raids, the papers reported.
	   Police have stepped up efforts to stem the popularity among
Taipei nightclubbers of Ecstacy, also known as MDMA, which induces
a feeling of relaxation and euphoria.
	   Users of the drug claim it adds to the appreciation of
beat-heavy techno music played in clubs.
	   Police send more than 30 stylishly dressed young male and female
officers into Taipei clubs each weekend night to gain information
on drug suppliers, the United Evening News reported.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian police detained _ and sometimes
tortured _ dozens of Christians in a town in southern Egypt in
their investigation into the deaths of two local Christians, a
human rights group said Sunday.
	   The report, from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights,
accused security forces of ``mass punishment'' of residents of the
town of Al-Kushh in Sohag province, which is about 400 kilometers
(240 miles) south of Cairo.
	   Some of those detained described being hung up by their hands,

threatened to rape their wives and daughters if they did not
provide information about the killings.
	   Interior Ministry officials denied the reports of mass arrests
and said only a few people were questioned after the killings. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Coptic Christians are a minority in Egypt, representing about
one-sixth of the country's 60 million people. The government is
sensitive about the Christians because of repeated allegations that
they are treated as second-class citizens.
	   Trouble in Al-Kushh _ where about three-quarters of the 40,000
residents are Christians _ began on Aug. 14, when the bodies of
Samir Oweida, 25, and Karam Tamer, 27, were found in front of a
school.
	   The human rights group said police detained about 1,200 people
over a period of three weeks for questioning. It said that most of
the detainees were Christian and that the police avoided
interrogating Muslim residents of the town to avoid raising
Christian-Muslim tensions.
	   A Christian, Sheiboub William Artouri, was arrested and charged
in the case, the human rights report said.
	   Police said Artouri was with the victims on the night of the
crime and that after they had gambled and gotten drunk. He
allegedly shot them with a pistol, the report said.
	   Among those quoted in the report was Boktor Abul-Yamin Michael,
who was detained along with his wife and four children. He was
singled out because of allegations that one of the victims had had
an affair with his 15-year-old daughter.
	   Michael told the human rights group he was beaten and tortured
with electric shocks to ``sensitive parts'' of his body over 20
days of questioning by police, who tried to get him to admit to the
murders. He said police threatened to rape his wife and daughters
if he did not identify the killer.
	   It said that relatives of the victims also were detained and
tortured during the investigation, including William Saad, a cousin
of one of the victims, his wife and three children.
	   The report listed the names of a half-dozen families that
accused the police of misconduct during the investigation. And it
said that police extorted money from other families trying to avoid
having loved-ones arrested.
	   In the past, the Copts have been targeted by al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, the Muslim extremist group that has waged a campaign
of violence since the spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt's
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police
and extremists.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's villagers may watch video
e-mails in local post offices, but outside the special booths,
thousands of children still die each year from preventable
diseases.
	   Even with one of the world's largest pools of scientists and
engineers, India finds itself on both extremes of the information
revolution. The disparity, as outlined in this years World
Development Report, can be striking.
	   In rural northern India, a conglomerate of computer software
companies last week set up the first public video e-mail booth. In
an experimental launch, illiterate village women who had never seen
a computer before received video messages by e-mail from their
husbands working in faraway Bombay.
	   ``The remotest village has the possibility of tapping a global
store of knowledge beyond the dreams of anyone living a century
ago, and more quickly and cheaply than anyone imagined only a few
decades ago,'' wrote World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn in
the forward of his agency's report.
	   But among the 4 billion inhabitants of the underdeveloped world,
huge gaps exist in access to education and technology, said the
report released Sunday. India's problems are typical.
	   In thousands of villages across India _ the World Bank's largest
single borrower and the largest overall recipient of developments
credits _ millions of people live with hunger, disease and misery.
	   Preventable diseases like leprosy, tuberculosis, cataract
blindness and malaria account for nearly 50 percent of all reported
illnesses, leading to 470 deaths per 10,000 people, the report
said. The HIV virus already has afflicted an estimated 3 million
people, spreading largely because of lack of awareness about its
prevention.
	   India is riding a boom in cable television, telephony and
Internet connectivity that promises a gradual change. But it is
slow to absorb knowledge because it remains among the least
educated countries in the world _ roughly one out of three
school-age children is not enrolled in school, especially girls.
	   ``For the poor, the promise of the new information age _
knowledge for all _ can seem as remote as a distant star.''
Wolfensohn said in the report.

Madikizela-Mandela in fear following break-ins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the
controversial ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela, feels threatened
after a series of break-ins at her home, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   In the third and most recent break-in, which occurred last week,
one or more intruders ransacked her bedroom but took nothing, the
Sunday Times reported.
	   ``I think they are giving me a message that they will return for
me very soon,'' Madikizela-Mandela was quoted as saying by the
Johannesburg weekly.
	   Police detective Inspector Mandla Hlakula said the intruder
appeared to be ``a highly trained person,'' the newspaper said. No
suspects were named.
	   Madikizela-Mandela, who was divorced from Mandela in 1996, is
the president of the ANC Women's League and a heroine of the
anti-apartheid struggle.
	   She was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping four young men and
taking part in assaults on them. Initially sentenced to six years
in jail, Madikizela-Mandela eventually paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on
appeal.
	   She has alienated many in the ANC by her criticism of the
government's slow progress in solving social issues and her call
for reintroduction of the death penalty to address soaring crime
rates.

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a sun-basked seaside packed with
pilgrims, Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left
by war and totalitarian rule, urging a renewal of values in
Croatian society.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outside
this Adriatic coastal city for John Paul's final Mass of the
three-day trip to Croatia. Scores of fishing and pleasure boats
anchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived from
Zagreb.
	   Adding to the numbers were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, who
streamed in when the border crossing was opened Saturday night for
the first time since civil war ended in 1995, state-run Croatian
television reported.
	   ``Croats are today called to give a new face to their country,
above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of the
ethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and by
the recent violence of war,'' John Paul said.
	   ``It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no true
freedom or democracy.''
	   The need for reconciliation and a renewal of values has been
high on the pope's agenda during his stay. The breakup of
Yugoslavia sparked a civil war in 1991 that left over 10,000 dead
and thousands missing before the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the
fighting.
	   Split was untouched by the fighting, but Zadar, Sibenik and
Dubrovnik along the Dalmatian Coast were both heavily damaged.
Dubrovnik suffered damage to some of its art and cultural
treasures.
	   The pope mentioned this in his homily. ``The eye of man can no
longer rejoice in them,'' he said of losses to architectural
masterpieces. ``How can we not feel regret for this?''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
	   For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was
Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.

Police protect Mongolian politician after assassination

	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Police placed a leading democratic
politician under protection Sunday following the murder of a
popular government minister seen as a compromise candidate to end
Mongolia's protracted political crisis.
	   Friday's slaying of Infrastructure Minister Sanjaasuregiin Zorig
shocked the capital, Ulan Bator, which has been locked in a
four-month standoff between the governing Democratic Coalition and
a resurgent opposition comprised largely of former communists.
	   About 3,500 people turned out in near-freezing temperatures
Saturday night to place lit candles in Zorig's memory on a wall
outside Government House. More were expected to take part in
candlelight vigils Sunday and Monday nights.
	   Although police have not released a motive for Zorig's death,
people at the vigil called it a political murder.
	   Police released new details Sunday about the slaying. Zorig's
assailants stole dlrs 300, gold earrings and bottles of vinegar and
soy sauce from his apartment. Two men who claimed to have seen the
killers as they left Zorig's home were being questioned.
	   The slaying appeared to be planned. Police say the killers tied
Zorig's wife up in the bathroom and then waited for him to come
home. He was then stabbed with a knife and hacked with an axe.
	   Zorig, a leader in the 1990 democratic revolution that ended
seven decades of Soviet-sponsored Stalinism in Mongolia, was widely
expected to be nominated next week as prime minister. He was
supposed to meet an opposition leader on Saturday to try to win
support.
	   A colleague in the Democratic Coalition E. Bat Uul was placed
under police protection Sunday, politicians said. President N.
Bagabandi had rejected Bat Uul's nomination as prime minister last
week, the fifth politician rejected in the standoff between the
coalition and the opposition.
	   The opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party began a
boycott of parliament in June after it accused the Democratic
Coalition of trying to reap financial benefit for its members in a
planned merger of a state bank and private bank.
	   Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj then lost a vote of
confidence and resigned with his Cabinet on July 24, although he
and his ministers have stayed on as caretakers.
	   The confrontation has further soured popular support for the
fledgling democracy and distracted government attention from
mounting problems.
	   More than a third of the landlocked country's 2 million people
live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and inflation last
year topped 30 percent.
	   But Zorig's death and the popular sympathy it has evoked may
help end the standoff. Opposition MPRP leader N. Enkhbayar said
Sunday he was considering shelving a motion to dissolve parliament.
	   ``Without compromise we cannot reach our common goal. We will
fall victim to extreme nationalism,'' Enkhbayar said. ``This death
can bring the three parties together and resolve the political
deadlock.''

Mubarak in Syria over rising tension with Turkey

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew
here on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and
Turkey.
	   Mubarak was met at the airport by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
and the two leaders drove straight to Assad's palace for talks.
	   The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with
Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the
neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in
Ankara, possibly on Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi
Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday
with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser
Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. A government
statement Saturday confirmed Syria's ``keenness for good,
neighborly relations with Turkey'' as well as readiness to resolve
disputes ``in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.

Forty-eight people sentenced to death in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine courts sentenced 48 people
to death mostly on rape convictions last month, bringing to 748 the
number of death row convicts since capital punishment was restored
in 1994, an anti-crime group said Sunday.
	   The Citizen's Drugwatch Foundation said that of the 48 death
sentences, 45 were convicted on rape charges, two on murder charges
and one parricide.
	   Among those convicted of rape were 35 fathers accused of abusing
their daughters, said the foundation, which includes as members
many lawmakers crusading against crime and illegal drugs.
	   Leo Echegaray, an impoverished house painter convicted of raping
his 10-year-old stepdaughter, is expected to soon become the first
to be put to death by lethal injection.
	   The Supreme Court has upheld at least 16 of the death sentences
but has not yet given its final approval for the first to be
carried out.
	   A new Philippine constitution abolished the death penalty in
1987 but gave Congress the option of restoring it for crimes such
as murder, kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking. A law
restoring the penalty took effect in 1994.
	   Philippine Roman Catholic Church leaders and other civilian
groups oppose the death penalty, arguing there is no concrete proof
that it could deter crime. The poor would be disadvantaged because
they couldn't afford good lawyers for their defense, opponents say.
	   Proponents say the death penalty has not caused a sharp drop in
crimes because nobody has been executed to send a chilling example
to would-be criminals.
	   President Joseph Estrada has said he would not pardon Echegeray.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Signaling it does not want to be involved in
any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey,
Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with
Syria.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's
hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and
Ankara.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Netanyahu told reporters in
Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.''
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army to limit
military maneuvers along Israel's border with Syria to avoid giving
any impression Israel is poised to act.
	   ``Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but
rather in finding ways to renew talks,'' Mordechai's office quoted
him Sunday as saying.

New Zealand upsets Australia in final

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Mark Burton scored in the 24th minute
Sunday to give New Zealand an upset 1-0 win over Australia in the
final of the Oceania Nations Cup soccer tournament at Suncorp
Stadium.
	   The win gives New Zealand a spot in January's Confederations Cup
tournament in Mexico City. Last December, Brazil beat Australia 6-0
in the Confederations Cup final at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
	   New Zealand's winner came after striker Vaughan Coveny beat two
diving tackles from Socceroo skipper Alex Tobin and Kasey Wehrman.
	   Coveny darted around a poor diving tackle by Tobin before laying
off for midfielder Burton who also beat a sliding tackle from
Wehrman before slotting home.
	   Australia's defeat was its first loss to New Zealand in nine
previous clashes since the Kiwis downed Australia 2-0 in a World
Cup qualifier in Auckland in 1989.
	   Burton's goal also was the first time Australia had conceded a
goal to New Zealand in eight matches.
	   Earlier, Fiji survived a late comeback attempt by Tahiti to win
4-2 to finish in third place in the six-team tournament that also
involved the Cook Islands and Vanuata.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ As new stone-throwing clashes broke out
Sunday in the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinians both said it
was up to the other side whether any accord could be reached on an
Israeli troop pullback.
	   Meanwhile, security was tight in advance of a Jewish holiday
beginning at sundown Sunday, and the Palestinian lands remained
sealed off.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to arrive
Tuesday for talks in advance of a hoped-for summit in Washington
later this month, and both sides have been busy staking out
positions in advance of her visit.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly accused
the Palestinians of not doing enough to crack down on Islamic
militants, said Israel's security was his paramount concern.
	   ``Israel has shown its willingness to go the distance,'' he told
reporters at a ceremony to usher in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
``Now it's up to the Palestinians to show their willingness to
carry out their part.''
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said it is working to
contain militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts
cannot provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks.
	   Two days before Albright's scheduled arrival, Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes for a speedy accord _ but
said any movement must come from the Israeli side.
	   ``She has one yes in her pocket; that is Arafat's yes,'' Erekat
said of Albright. ``In order to reach an agreement she needs a
second yes, and that is Mr. Netanyahu's.''
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored initiative on an Israeli troop pullback, but
Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns.
	   Erekat spoke to reporters during a break in talks with Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh. The two were mainly discussing
secondary issues, including the so-called safe passsage that would
permit Palestinian travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
the status of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Sunday's West Bank clashes occurred near Hebron, marking the
fifth straight day of skirmishing in or near the divided town.
Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and
a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   In the latest fighting, a crowd of about 100 Palestinians
gathered at the Israeli military checkpoint at the Halhul
checkpoint outside Hebron, and some began throwing stones and
bottles at the soldiers.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas, but
witnesses said no one was hurt during the two-hour disturbance.
	   Later, at the village of Bani Naim outside Hebron, about 100
Palestinians, mainly teen-agers and elderly people, marched to
protest what they said was illegal land confiscation by Jewish
settlers.
	   They marched to within 100 meters (yards) of a settlement and
and Israeli troops took up protective positions, but the protest
remained peaceful.
	   Palestinians are angry about the closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which with some brief easings has been in effect since
Sept. 20, just before the Jewish New Year holiday. Army radio said
the closure was expected to continue through the weeklong Jewish
festival of Sukkot.
	   Palestinians complain bitterly about closures, which prevent
tens of thousands of workers from getting to jobs in Israel and
cost the Palestinian economy millions in lost wages and commercial
trade.
	   In sealing off the Palestinian lands, Israel cited threats from
Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings
since 1994. The group vowed to carry out attacks after Israeli
soldiers killed two wanted fugitives from the group last month.

Mubarak in Syria over rising tension with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Kurdish Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Damascus on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria
and Turkey.
	   Mubarak was met at the airport by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
and the two leaders drove straight to Assad's palace for talks.
	   The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with
Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the
neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in
Ankara, possibly on Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi
Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday
with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser
Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. A government
statement Saturday confirmed Syria's ``keenness for good,
neighborly relations with Turkey'' as well as readiness to resolve
disputes ``in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.

Share price set for Swiss phone company sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The price of shares in Switzerland's
telephone company Swisscom has been set at 340 Swiss francs (dlrs
250) each, the company said Sunday.
	   The issue was three-times oversubscribed, Swisscom said in a
statement. Overall demand amounted to around 65 million shares, it
added.
	   The 22,065 million shares, around 30 percent of the company's
share capital, will raise around 7.5 billion francs (dlrs 5.5
billion), making it the largest European share offer so far this
year.
	   Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications arm of the Swiss
government's postal service, confirmed in June its intention to
float on the stock market.
	   The Swiss government decided to go ahead with the sale, the
country's biggest privatization yet, despite turmoil in global
markets.
	   Last month Ulrich Gygi, director at the Swiss Finance Ministry,
said that ``given extreme movements on the stock exchange, we are
free to postpone the transaction.''
	   Also in September, officials said the initial price per share
would be between 330 francs (dlrs 243) and 410 francs (dlrs 301).
	   The sale comprises 14.515 million shares of the government's
holding in Swisscom plus 7.55 million new shares to be issued and
sold by Swisscom.
	   Trading of the shares starts Monday on the Swiss Exchange and
the New York Stock Exchange.

Germany's Social Democrats and Greens plan for new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new Social Democratic-led
government will repeal cuts in pensions passed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl before they take effect Jan. 1, a party leader said Sunday.
	   In an interview with German radio, parliamentary faction leader
Rudolf Scharping said his party will also ``immediately'' implement
another campaign promise: repealing a 1996 law allowing employers
to cut sick pay by 20 percent.
	   Both measures were part of the modest economic reforms pushed
through parliament by Kohl, who lost his bid for a fifth term last
month to the Social Democrats, led by Gerhard Schroeder.
	   The new chancellor-elect opened coalition talks Friday with the
ecology-minded Greens party, setting combating unemployment,
particularly in eastern Germany, as their top priority.
	   While no talks were held over the weekend, all sides continued
staking out their positions in interviews.
	   Industry leaders warned they would leave Schroeder's proposed
roundtable talks on job creation if union leaders insist on a
shorter work week or too-high wages.
	   Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the German Chamber of Industry and
Commerce, also told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that some
proposals being being considered by the center-left government
would actually lead to ``a renewed climb in unemployment.''
	   Those include raising energy taxes, canceling a high-speed train
link between Berlin and Hamburg, and shutting down the country's
nuclear power reactors, he said.
	   In an interview with the same newspaper, Schroeder ruled out a
significant rise in gasoline taxes, saying it would be unfair to
commuters.
	   Schroeder said he would accept an increase of no more than 6
pfennig (4 cents) per liter, not the 30 pfennig (18 cents) some
Greens have demanded.
	   Greens leader Juergen Trittin refused to comment Sunday on the
gas tax question. ``We won't hold any negotiations in the
newspapers,'' he said.
	   Car-crazy Germans got additional bad news from the Greens'
transport expert, Gila Altmann.
	   The Koelner Zeitung quoted her as saying that the new
center-left government may support setting a speed limit of 120-130
kph (75-80 mph) on Germany's autobahns.
	   The Greens met Sunday to confirm their party's 12-person team
for coalition negotiations. The party's women's council called for
at least half the Cabinet seats to go to women.
	   The sides hope to complete talks by Oct. 17 so that Schroeder
can be sworn in as chancellor by the end of the month.
	   Schroeder, who made his first post-election trip to Paris on
Wednesday, plans to visit Washington at the end of this week.
	   Greens leader Joschka Fischer, considered the front-runner to
become foreign minister in Schroeder's yet-to-be-formed Cabinet,
will accompany him, Scharping said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's reformer politician
Anwar Ibrahim left a hospital Sunday after medical check-ups for
injuries he says he sustained in police beatings.
	   Anwar, due for arraignment Monday on five counts of corruption
and five of illegal homosexual acts, was admitted to the
government-owned University Hospital late Saturday, after a court
gave permission.
	   His overnight checkup over, a police motorcade whisked Anwar,
seated in the back of a jeep with tinted windows.
	   His lawyers said they did not know where he was taken. They have
been denied access to their client since his last court appearance
Wednesday.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was once the heir
apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But as Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of the longruling
Mahathir, he fell out of favor and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   In two court appearances last week, Anwar pleaded innocent to
the charges and said his black eye and bruises on his neck and arm
came from a police beating the night he was arrested.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement and they forced a group of 300 women, with their children
and some husbands, to disperse Sunday when they gathered across a
highway from the king's palace.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said a Muslim woman in a head
scarf who, like others, said she was afraid to give her name.
	   ``They call this a democracy but they won't even let us gather
and sit on a hillside.''
	   The women left after two hours when riot police trucks and a
water cannon arrived. They did not mention Anwar but sang patriotic
songs.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.
	   The court granted Anwar's request for further medical attention
after he complained of neck and back pain.
	   University Hospital officials refused Sunday to comment on
Anwar's condition. He was to have undergone checks in the
orthopedic department, including X-rays of his backbone and his
bruised left eye.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   Police stood guard within and outside the hospital, using a
wooden barricade to seal off entry to the first floor where Anwar
was being treated. Police blocked stairwell entrances and barred
visitors, including Anwar's wife and children.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, Anwar led thousands of people in two weeks of peaceful
protests against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir has also accused
Anwar of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he
was ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.

Share price set for Swiss phone company sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The price of shares in Switzerland's
telephone company Swisscom has been set at 340 Swiss francs (dlrs
250) each, the company said Sunday.
	   The issue was three-times oversubscribed, Swisscom said in a
statement. Overall demand amounted to around 65 million shares, it
added.
	   The 22,065 million shares, around 30 percent of the company's
share capital, will raise around 7.5 billion francs (dlrs 5.5
billion), making it the largest European share offer so far this
year.
	   Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications arm of the Swiss
government's postal service, confirmed in June its intention to
float on the stock market.
	   The Swiss government decided to go ahead with the sale, the
country's biggest privatization yet, despite turmoil in global
markets.
	   Last month Ulrich Gygi, director at the Swiss Finance Ministry,
said that ``given extreme movements on the stock exchange, we are
free to postpone the transaction.''
	   Also in September, officials said the initial price per share
would be between 330 francs (dlrs 243) and 410 francs (dlrs 301).
	   The sale comprises 14.515 million shares of the government's
holding in Swisscom plus 7.55 million new shares to be issued and
sold by Swisscom.
	   Trading of the shares starts Monday on the Swiss Exchange and
the New York Stock Exchange.

Family still waits for word on detained Chinese journalist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS two grafs after 8th graf pvs to UPDATE with dissident
released; edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly a month after China's secret police hauled
away a leading Chinese journalist, his family still has no word on
his whereabouts or condition, a rights group reported Sunday.
	   Shi Binhai will pass his 30th day in detention Monday. Police
are required by law to either file formal detention orders or
release suspects after 30 days in custody, although the deadline is
often ignored.
	   As of Saturday night, Shi's family had neither received a
detention notice nor been told where he is being held, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   Shi's wife, Zhang Hong, last saw him being taken away on Sept. 5
by agents from the Ministry of State Security.
	   An editor with the China Economic Times, a reformist newspaper
with loose connections to China's State Council, or Cabinet, the
36-year-old Shi also helped compile the popular book ``Political
China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New Structure.''
	   Although the book examines the need for political reform, media
and dissident circles believe other activities got Shi in trouble
with authorities.
	   The Information Center speculated that Shi was preparing to
interview Zhao Ziyang and had been in contact with the former
Communist Party leader who was purged for refusing to back a
crackdown on student democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in
1989.
	   For many intellectuals and dissidents, Zhao has become a symbol
of a more tolerant era and for political change. Last seen in
public visiting students in Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989, Zhao
has since lived under house arrest in a walled compound in Beijing.
	   Shi Binhai was detained amid a concerted police sweep against
democracy campaigners trying to set up a political opposition
party.
	   Police in northeastern Changchun city on Sunday released Tang
Yuanjuan, one of at least a dozen dissidents rounded up in the
clampdown. Tang had been held for a little more than two weeks.
	   Shi's 30th day in custody, Monday, is also the day China plans
to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
the U.N. rights treaty that guarantees freedom of expression.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center called Shi's case a test
of whether Chinese leaders intend to respect the covenant. Even
after signing, the treaty will not come into force until ratified
by China's legislature, which may choose to attach reservations,
effectively nullifying some provisions.

Murai wins Kosaido Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ICHIHARA, Japan (AP) _ Mayumi Murai birdied the final four holes
en route to a 1-under-par 71 Sunday that gave her a
come-from-behind victory by one stroke in the 60 million yen (dlrs
441,000) Kosaido Ladies.
	   Murai, an overnight co-leader, made some errors and plunged
three shots off the pace midway through with three bogeys.
	   On the back nine Murai regained the touch as she kept the
fairway, hit the ball close and sank the four straight birdies,
surging past Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen, veteran Nayoko Yoshikawa and
South Korean Ku Ok-hee, the other overnight co-leader.
	   The victory, at 3-under 213, was Murai's first in two years and
seventh overall. She took home the winner's prize of 10.8 million
yen (dlrs 80,000).
	   Huang shot a 69 for 214 and Yoshikawa a 71 to share third at 215
with Ku, who turned in a 73.

Mubarak in Syria over rising tension with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES starting 14th graf with editorials in Iraq and Egypt,
comments from Israeli prime minister. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Kurdish Rebels

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew
here on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and
Turkey.
	   Mubarak was met at the airport by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
and the two leaders drove straight to Assad's palace for talks.
	   The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with
Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the
neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in
Ankara, possibly on Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi
Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday
with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser
Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. A government
statement Saturday confirmed Syria's ``keenness for good,
neighborly relations with Turkey'' as well as readiness to resolve
disputes ``in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
	   Editorials in the Arab world called on both sides to show
restraint.
	   In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, published by Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the Turkish incursion into
Iraq.
	   ``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the
present tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. ``The Turkish
buildup does not serve anybody as much as it will harm Turkey and
Syria and other parties in the region.''
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette said in an editorial on
Sunday that ``the Syrians, understandably, harbor the belief that
Turkey is being manipulated by its new-found ally, Israel, to
pounce,'' with the dispute over Kurdish rebels being a pretext.
	   Israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved
in any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have
taken steps to reassure Syria.''

Head of ailing business group to announce bailout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Apologizing for the negative impact his
company's problems have had on the nation, the head of U-Land
business group said on Sunday that a bailout would be announced in
two days.
	   Chief Executive Officer Chou Chi-jui did not provide details but
predicted U-Land would survive its cash flow problems.
	   ``I know we're going to be fine, because U-Land's core structure
is still excellent,'' Chou told reporters. ``I deeply apologize for
allowing this matter to have such a large impact on the nation.''
	   The Taiwan stock market's main index plunged nearly 4 percent
Friday after U-Land announced its construction and textile
businesses had bounced checks of 140 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 4 million).
	   The group also operates an air carrier, U-Land Air Lines.
	   While Taiwan has weathered Asia's economic crisis admirably,
many investors saw U-Land's problems as just the tip of the iceberg
for the economy as businesses suffer from an economic slowdown and
loss of markets.
	   The group, which has accumulated debt of almost 10 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 289 million), had asked for a week to put
together a bailout package from banks and investors.
	   Newspaper reports said some of U-Land's construction projects in
central Taiwan would be transferred to other companies in exchange
for cash, and listed King Textile would take on additional
investors, although U-Land intends to keep management rights.
	   Set up by brothers Chou Chi-jui and Chou Chi-chang 10 years ago,
the company grew into a small regional group with investments in
the Philippines and Vietnam.
	   They launched U-Land Air Lines in 1995 with a flamboyant 1
Taiwan dollar (2 U.S. cents) fare offer that quickly put them on
the airline map but left them with a pile of debt that has
continued to grow.
	   The airline may sell some planes in favor of leasing but will
continue with a plan to to buy 40 percent of Air Philippines, the
China Times Express reported.
	   Company representatives were unavailable for further comment
Sunday.

Philippine Airlines publicly announces reopening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with domestic airline saying it will acquire four more
aircraft to fill shortage in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines announced Sunday
it was reopening after forging a no-strike deal with its largest
union, although militant workers vowed to continue opposing the
deal.
	   In several paid newspaper advertisements, the airline said it
would offer 14 round-trip domestic flights from Manila starting on
Wednesday and apologized to the public for problems caused by its
shutdown last month.
	   ``Your national flag carrier is back,'' Philippine Airlines
said.
	   PAL officials have said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled
to handle domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600
workers will be recalled once international flights resume in a few
weeks.
	   The debt-ridden airline, Asia's oldest, closed on Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade its ground crew union to accept a
management-proposed recovery plan that would suspend its workers'
right to strike and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for
10 years.
	   Its closure left much of the Philippine archipelago without air
service, prompting President Joseph Estrada to enlist Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific to fly PAL's domestic routes to avoid serious damage
to the economy.
	   He also urged smaller domestic carriers to expand their fleet to
fill the void in air service left by PAL's closure. One of them,
Air Philippines, said on Sunday it would acquire four additional
aircraft in two weeks to help ease a shortage in flights.
	   In a second government-supervised referendum held Friday, about
61 percent of the 6,700 members of PAL's largest union accepted the
proposal to suspend collective bargaining in exchange for 20
percent of the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   Militant members of the union, however, said they would seek
court action on Monday to declare the agreement illegal and would
continue protests against it.
	   ``This agreement would set a precedent and lead to the downfall
not only of PAL workers,'' said Renato Reyes, a union board member
opposed to the proposal.
	   He said the PAL recovery plan violates the Philippine
constitution, which guarantees the right of workers to form unions
and bargain collectively for labor benefits.
	   Estrada assured the workers that he will defend their rights
during the proposed 10-year collective bargaining suspension,
adding it is only a temporary measure to help PAL and the Manila
government cope with the Asian crisis.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit last year shortly after PAL launched
a dlrs 4 billion modernization program, greatly inflating the
amount of money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It was a difficult September in
tropical Malaysia. The deputy prime minister was fired over sordid
sex allegations, arrested and then turned up in court with a black
eye.
	   Battered and bruised, Anwar Ibrahim has struck a chord, making
ordinary Malaysians defy state power and question political
authority for the first time.
	   In a nation where even the main opposition party had stopped
short of calling for the top man's dismissal, people began to
publicly criticize Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule
and shout in the streets for him to resign.
	   ``I think it is a generational thing. Younger Malaysians are
saying that they are not prepared to accept someone's word just
because he has been in power so long,'' said Rustam Sani, a social
critic.
	   Since Mahathir, 72, fired Anwar on Sept. 2, it has been four
weeks of fiery speeches, mammoth crowds, posters, leaflets,
underground videotapes, tear gas and water cannons in a country
where political protest is virtually banned.
	   Never has a dissident gone around the country declaiming that
Mahathir is corrupt and never have so many responded to such
dissent.
	   ``It is not a blip on the screen,'' says Abdul Razak Baginda,
executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a
private think tank.
	   ``We have this thing toward the government. Respect or fear of
the state apparatus. But now a lot of us are angered by what has
happened,'' said Baginda.
	   The law requires police permits for public gatherings of more
than four people. Anwar just showed up. The throngs gathered,
feeling the exhilaration of shouting out their feelings while
police did nothing to stop them.
	   ``Our movement has aroused something very latent in the minds of
Malaysians,'' Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, told a news conference
Sunday. She said ordinary folks had begun fighting a ``corrupt and
debilitating system that acts on the whims of one power-hungry
man.''
	   There were 35,000 in Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka Square on Sept. 20,
chanting ``Reform,'' and carrying Anwar on their shoulders a few
hours before his arrest.
	   Some got carried away, marched toward the prime minister's
residence, trashed the lobby of the ruling party headquarters. Then
the police acted.
	   Day after day they charged protesters, soaking them with
stinging jets of water, beating and arresting them as government
opponents were scooped up into detention. At least 300 people were
arrested.
	   Yet many who remained free spoke out more strongly than ever.
	   Lim Kit Siang, head of the opposition Democratic Action Party,
for the first time said Mahathir had been in power too long and
took him on face-to-face in a Parliament debate over Anwar's
detention.
	   ``It's not that people are pro-Anwar, but the people are
concerned with what the government is doing. It has full control,''
said Zainal Rohizan, a university employee who rushed to court last
week for a glimpse of Anwar after reading about his injuries.
	   Anwar, 51, said he was handcuffed and blindfolded, then
clobbered by policemen on the night of his arrest on Sept. 20.
During his arraignment on 10 counts of sodomy and corruption nine
days later, the man who had been in line for the past five years to
step into the prime minister's seat said police stopped beating him
only when he fell unconscious.
	   The last time Malaysians came out on the streets to protest
against Mahathir was in 1987 when he sacked Supreme Court judges.
More than 100 people were detained under the Internal Security Act,
which allows imprisonment without trial.
	   ``But this time the main actor is a politician with a much
greater national presence, second only to Mahathir's,'' said
Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of politics at University of Malaya.
	   ``It has stirred the grass roots the way 1987 had not,'' said
Chandra. ``The issue has captured national imagination cutting
across ethnic divides.''
	   It was not just majority Malays angry over the treatment of a
politician of their race and religion, but Chinese and Indians who
joined protests, he said. Malays comprise nearly 60 percent of the
country's 22 million people. Chinese are 30 percent and ethnic
Indians 10 percent.
	   The political crisis could not have come at a worse time. Months
of wrangling between Mahathir and Anwar over policy had left
investors confused and the economy directionless. Just before Anwar
was booted he announced that Malaysia had sunk into its first
recession in 10 years. Thousands will lose their jobs, the
government has said.
	   Yet many Malays are grateful for the modern cities and factories
Mahathir has built in a country that until a decade ago was an
Asian backwater exporting rubber and tin.
	   ``Malaysians being Malaysians, once they find their pockets full
will start wondering why they are wasting time with politics,''
said Chandra.

Siemens chief who led expansion in 1980s dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Former Siemens chief Karlheinz Kaske, who
oversaw the electronics company's vigorous expansion into a
worldwide concern during the 1980s, has died at age 70.
	   Kaske died on Sept. 27, the company said. No cause of death was
given.
	   Born in Essen, Kaske studied physics before joining Siemens and
Halske in 1950. He left to work as a teacher and consultant, but
returned in 1969 after helping plan the consolidation of Siemens
companies into today's Siemens AG conglomerate.
	   He was appointed to the managing board in 1975 and became
president and chief executive officer in 1981, an office he held
until 1992.
	   During his tenure, Kaske led Siemens into overseas markets,
including the United States and China. He also helped strengthen
Siemens' position in Europe with the takeover of Plessey together
with Britain's GEC.
	   His strong interest in research and development and
microelectronics showed in the company's expansion into automotive
systems and its purchase of Nixdorf AG.
	   By the time he stepped down, Siemens worldwide sales had more
than doubled and income had nearly quadrupled to almost 2 billion
marks (dlrs 1.2 billion at current exchange rates).
	   Kaske continued to hold various positions, including chairman of
MAN AG's supervisory board and member of the board of Eastman
Kodak, and worked for many philanthropic and educational causes.
	   Siemens released no information about survivors or funeral
services.

Malaysia's Anwar leaves hospital, women protest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's reformer politician
Anwar Ibrahim left a hospital Sunday after medical check-ups for
injuries he says he sustained in police beatings.
	   Anwar, due for arraignment Monday on five counts of corruption
and five of illegal homosexual acts, was admitted to the
government-owned University Hospital late Saturday, after a court
gave permission.
	   His overnight checkup over, a police motorcade whisked Anwar,
seated in the back of a jeep with tinted windows.
	   His lawyers said they did not know where he was taken. Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, called it a ``breach of human rights'' that
the lawyers had been denied access to their client since his last
court appearance Wednesday.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was once the heir
apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But as Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of the longruling
Mahathir, he fell out of favor and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   In two court appearances last week, Anwar pleaded innocent to
the charges and said his black eye and bruises on his neck and arm
came from a police beating the night he was arrested.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement and they forced a group of 300 women, with their children
and some husbands, to disperse Sunday when they gathered across a
highway from the king's palace.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said a Muslim woman in a head
scarf who, like others, said she was afraid to give her name.
	   ``They call this a democracy but they won't even let us gather
and sit on a hillside.''
	   The women left after two hours when riot police trucks and a
water cannon arrived. They did not mention Anwar but sang patriotic
songs.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.
	   The court granted Anwar's request for further medical attention
after he complained of neck and back pain.
	   Anwar's wife, a retired eye surgeon, said she had been refused a
copy of her husband's medical report as it is considered secret
under the Internal Security Act.
	   ``My priority is to get justice done,'' she said. ``If this
country is democratic then this will be the test.''
	   University Hospital officials refused Sunday to comment on
Anwar's condition. He was to have undergone checks in the
orthopedic department, including X-rays of his backbone and his
bruised left eye.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   Police stood guard within and outside the hospital, using a
wooden barricade to seal off entry to the first floor where Anwar
was being treated. Police blocked stairwell entrances and barred
visitors, including Anwar's wife and children.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, Anwar led thousands of people in two weeks of peaceful
protests against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir has also accused
Anwar of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he
was ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.

Head of ailing business group to announce bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to three days sted two in lead; ADDS 4th graf to
clarify

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Apologizing for the negative impact his
company's problems have had on Taiwan's economy, the head of the
U-Land business group said on Sunday that a bailout would be
announced in three days.
	   Chief Executive Officer Chou Chi-jui did not provide details but
predicted U-Land would survive its cash flow problems.
	   ``I know we're going to be fine, because U-Land's core structure
is still excellent,'' Chou told reporters. ``I deeply apologize for
allowing this matter to have such a large impact on the nation.''
	   Chou said a full bailout plan would be announced Wednesday.
	   The Taiwan stock market's main index plunged nearly 4 percent
Friday after U-Land announced its construction and textile
businesses had bounced checks of 140 million Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 4 million).
	   The group also operates an air carrier, U-Land Air Lines.
	   While Taiwan has weathered Asia's economic crisis admirably,
many investors saw U-Land's problems as just the tip of the iceberg
for the economy as businesses suffer from an economic slowdown and
loss of markets.
	   The group, which has accumulated debt of almost 10 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 289 million), had asked for a week to put
together a bailout package from banks and investors.
	   Newspaper reports said some of U-Land's construction projects in
central Taiwan would be transferred to other companies in exchange
for cash, and listed King Textile would take on additional
investors, although U-Land intends to keep management rights.
	   Set up by brothers Chou Chi-jui and Chou Chi-chang 10 years ago,
the company grew into a small regional group with investments in
the Philippines and Vietnam.
	   They launched U-Land Air Lines in 1995 with a flamboyant 1
Taiwan dollar (2 U.S. cents) fare offer that quickly put them on
the airline map but left them with a pile of debt that has
continued to grow.
	   The airline may sell some planes in favor of leasing but will
continue with a plan to to buy 40 percent of Air Philippines, the
China Times Express reported.
	   Company representatives were unavailable for further comment
Sunday.

Report: Britain to deploy ground troops in Kosovo after NATO
</HEADLINE>
strikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is planning to deploy several thousand
ground troops and tank unites in Kosovo following a NATO
bombardment of the Yugoslav province in reprisal for killings of
ethnic Albanians, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson refused to confirm or deny
the report. He reiterated Britain is ready to take part in a NATO
attack, saying ``cat and mouse tactics'' by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic are unacceptable.
	   ``Our plans are not going to be disclosed to Slobodan Milosevic
on any program,'' Robertson said Sunday, asked about the news
report in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview. ``But
I think you can take it that a whole series of options have been
worked through and that we are ready to move on them.''
	   The Sunday Telegraph said a Royal Marines rapid reaction force
is undergoing specialist training to operate in Kosovo, where Serb
forces are blamed for brutality against the ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   The marines' role after air strikes would be peacekeeping,
similar to that of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia, but the
British soldiers would be prepared to engage Serb troops directly
if necessary, The Sunday Telegraph said.
	   Britain has already announced it will on Monday send four more
groud-attack aircraft to a NATO base in southern Italy, doubling
the number of Royal Air Force planes there in readiness for an
attack on Kosovo.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet meets Monday to approve
formally the use of force unless Milosevic halts the attacks on
ethnic Albanians and seeks a political settlement.
	   ``But it still remains to be seen by how much he is responding
and how long he is going to do it ... This time he can't get off
the hook with just cosmetics,'' said Robertson.
	   He added that sending a peacekeeping force to Kosovo after a
genuine cease-fire ``is part of the options that are available.''
	   ``What is clear is that Milosevic now recognizes that we mean
business and that's why he's moving with such speed at the
moment,'' he added.

Politicians, ethnic leaders welcome failure of Hanson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing politician Pauline Hanson's
One Nation Party should not be written off, despite its failure at
Australia's national election, political opponents and ethnic
community leaders said Sunday.
	   Hanson's hopes of leading her party to a role of national
influence were dashed Saturday when One Nation failed to secure a
single seat in Parliament's lower house.
	   With almost 80 percent of the vote counted, Hanson even appeared
to have lost her own seat, depriving One Nation's its namesake on
the national political stage.
	   One Nation's sole success was in the upper house Senate, where
candidate Heather Hill is poised to take the place of government
coalition member Bill O'Chee. But another minority party, the
Democrats, looks likely to control the balance of power in the
Senate, denying One Nation influence.
	   Just hours after predicting One Nation would win up to 15
electorates, a subdued Hanson said on Saturday night that she would
continue to try to run her party.
	   ``I'm still the president of One Nation and I hope I will be
there to work behind the scenes,'' Hanson told reporters.
	   One Nation strategist and failed candidate David Oldfield denied
the party was finished.
	   ``We're in a position now where, while we haven't had as many
people elected as we would've liked, we've still got a strong
contingent in the Queensland parliament,'' he told the Nine
television network.
	   One Nation's high water mark now appears to have been the June
election in Queensland state, where the party won 23 percent of the
vote amnd 11 seats in the state's parliament.
	   Hanson has dominated Australian politics since she was elected
to national parliament as an independent in 1996. She warned that
Australia was in danger of being ``swamped by Asians'' and opposed
land rights and special welfare benefits for Aborigines.
	   On Sunday, ethnic leaders said the major parties should still
concentrate on issues which Hanson opposed to appeal to voters.
	   Diane Shteinman, president of the Executive Council of
Australian Jewry said the major parties could not ignore the
worries of people who had voted for her party.
	   ``It wasn't as if she was rejected by the electorate ... there
were a lot of votes out there for the One Nation party,'' Shteinman
said.
	   Politicians from all major parties were quick to welcome One
Nation's poor performance.
	   ``Rumours of One Nation's demise are very premature,'' said Mike
Kaiser, the opposition Labor Party's secretary in Queensland.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said One Nation would struggle
without Hanson in parliament.
	   ``I hope that One Nation just dissolves. It probably won't in
the short term _ it might take some time,'' he said.

U.N. envoy in Iran to discuss problems with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi arrived
here Sunday to discuss the deepening conflict between Tehran and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia, which has seen both sides move
troops to the border.
	   During his five-day visit, Brahimi will hold talks with Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his deputy, Mohsen Aminzadeh, who is
responsible for Afghan affairs.
	   Brahimi told reporters at the airport that he also hopes to meet
with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   He was to fly to Pakistan on Thursday. So far, Afghanistan is
not on his agenda, he said.
	   ``I will not be going to Afghanistan because U.N personnel are
not allowed to travel there for security reasons,'' Brahimi said.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the Taliban's main backer, and
Iran has been accused of supporting the Afghan opposition in the
north.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia admitted that its forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and
a journalist after taking the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Two diplomats escaped and made their way
home.
	   The Taliban, which rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
renegade fighters killed the Iranians. But Taliban leaders have
refused Iranian demands that the killers be handed over.
	   Iran's response was to deploy more than 200,000 Iranian troops
on the border with Afghanistan for military maneuvers. Taliban
leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border in response
to the war games.
	   The Taliban on Friday accused Iran of violating its air space
during the maneuvers. Iran denied the allegation.
	   On Saturday, the Taliban militia warned of the possibility of
``a devastating war'' and urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to intervene.
	   The Taliban continues to hold some 50 Iranian nationals. Tehran
says most were working as drivers delivering aid to Afghans
hard-hit by the war.

Russian government condemns possible NATO attack on Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government condemned Sunday any
unsanctioned NATO attack on Yugoslavia as a ``rude violation'' of
the United Nations charter, and urged the conflict be solved
diplomatically.
	   ``The Russian government thinks it necessary to emphasize again
that using force against a sovereign state without the sanction of
the Security Council would be a rude violation of the UN charter,''
according to a government statement.
	   ``We are convinced that complicated ethnic conflicts, which the
Kosovo conflict undoubtedly is, cannot be settled militarily.''
	   The statement echoed earlier comments by Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and other Russian leaders, who sharply opposed any
NATO attacks.
	   Western governments have warned that NATO might take military
action after accusations that Serbian forces committed atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Russia's parliament last week declared that any NATO military
action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be considered
an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a unanimous resolution passed Friday, the State Duma said it
would review all agreements between NATO and Russia if the Western
alliance were to opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch air strikes,
and a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until later this month.

Taiwan to include independence supporters in China visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a move likely to upset Beijing,
supporters of Taiwanese independence will be part of the delegation
that will visit the Chinese mainland.
	   Beijing, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, has been
hopeful that the visit set to begin Oct. 14 will lead to progress
in reunification talks.
	   But Koo Chen-fu, a senior statesman who is Taiwan's top envoy to
China, has agreed to allow members of the Democratic Progressive
Party to accompany him on his breakthrough visit, Chiu Yi-jen, the
party's secretary-general, told reporters Sunday.
	   Chiu said the party is concerned only that ``the voice of all
the Taiwanese people'' is heard during the meetings, and would
leave selection of individuals and designation of their official
capacities to Koo.
	   The Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, advocates Taiwan's
permanent and formal independence from China, arguing that Taiwan
has developed its own political and social culture after being
separated from China for all but four of the last 100 years.
	   China rejects that view and threatens to invade the island if it
declares independence.
	   The DPP has asked to join Koo's delegation because it says China
will likely use the meeting to push for concessions on political
talks between the sides.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, of which Koo is a ranking
member, officially supports reunification, but only gradually and
not on China's terms.
	   China broke off negotiations in 1995, two years after they
started, over a series of moves by Taiwan to assert itself
internationally.
	   China demands that Taiwan agree to discuss an agenda for
political talks before restarting their dialogue.
	   Taiwan hopes Koo's visit will help pave the way for a
restoration of talks on practical issues like resolution of fishing
disputes.
	   The government says it doesn't rule out talking about an agenda
for political negotiations but argues that agreements on
substantive issues should come first.

Philippines considering multi-billion peso plan to revive sugar
</HEADLINE>
industry

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government and private
firms are considering a 40 billion peso (dlrs 930 million)
investment to revive the country's ailing sugar industry.
	   The money will be used to modernize sugar mills and refineries,
irrigate cane plantations and buy farm equipment under a five-year
plan, a government statement said Sunday.
	   The plan also calls for investment in research to develop
high-yielding and disease-resistant cane varieties.
	   The plan was drawn up by sugar industry leaders and submitted to
President Joseph Estrada when he visited sugar-producing provinces
on central Negros island on Friday.
	   If the plan is not carried out, the Philippines may have to
import sugar in the next few years as demand, which grows by 3.4
percent annually, would far exceed production, the statement said.
	   Enrique Roxas, president of the National Federation of Sugar
Planters, said declining cane production, aggravated by poor cane
quality, has sharply reduced sugar production in the last few
years.
	   Until the early 1990s, the Philippines had met domestic sugar
demands and was one of the largest suppliers of sugar to the United
States under a quota arrangement.

Hundreds of police pour into Naples after mob violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of police reinforcements poured
into the city Sunday after a car bombing and a bazooka attack
raised fears of escalating warfare among feuding crime clans.
	   No one was injured when a bazooka was fired Saturday at the gate
of a villa on the outskirts of Naples of a suspected boss of the
Camorra crime syndicate. On Friday a car bomb blew up in a crowded
quarter of the city, injuring 13 people.
	   The bomb went off outside a game room frequented by a crime
clan.
	   On Saturday night, Italy's state police chief Fernando Masone
ordered 365 officers from the state police and from the parmilitary
Carabiniere unit to take up posts in Naples.
	   Masone arrived in Naples Sunday to map out strategy with local
police chiefs.
	   For years now, the Camorra's clans have been waging turf wars
for control of illegal betting rackets, extortion rings, drug and
arms smuggling and prostitution.
	   Last year, the government ordered about 500 soldiers to the
Naples area to help quell growing violence between rival mob
groups. The troops replaced police officers protecting public
buildings, freeing them up for patrol and investigations.
	   Earlier this decade, soldiers were sent into Sicily to beef up
the fight there against the Mafia.

 &UR; Rights group documents atrocities in Kosovo
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Both the government of President
Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo's Albanian rebels have committed
atrocities in seven months of conflict, but government abuses have
been on a far greater scale, Human Rights Watch said in a report
issued Sunday.
	   The New York-based human rights organization blamed the
international community for failing to take any serious action to
stop the killing of mostly Albanian civilians in the
ethnic-Albanian majority Serbian province.
	   ``The tentative international response has been driven by fear
of either endorsing Kosovo independence or being drawn into a
long-term commitment of forces to maintain a peaceful settlement
within former Yugoslavia'' it said.
	   The report came just one day before U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan was to deliver his own assessment to the Security Council on
whether Belgrade is complying with U.N. demands to halt its assault
on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air
attacks will come within two weeks.
	   Human Rights Watch said Serbian police and military ``committed
extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings,
systematically destroyed civilian property and attacked
humanitarian aid workers, all of which are violations of the rules
of war.''
	   ``The Albanian insurgency, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army,
has also violated the laws of war by such actions as the taking of
civilian hostages and by summary executions,'' the report said.
``Although on a lesser scale than the government abuses, these too
are violations of international standards and should be
condemned.''
	   The report leaves no doubt that it feels Milosevic bears ``the
primary responsibility for gross government abuses.'' It says at
least 250,000 thousand people have been displaced, many of them
women and children now living without shelter in the mountains and
forests.
	   ``Despite the seriousness of these abuses, the international
community has failed to take any serious action to stop the
killing,'' the report said, adding that ``Milosevic continues to be
viewed by many as a legitimate and trustworthy negotiating
partner.''
	   To deal with the many reports of massacres, summary executions
and mass graves, Human Rights Watch says the international
community must insist on immediate access for international
forensic experts to investigate the allegations and support the
International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.
	   ``We feel the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague
should be involved,'' said Peter Bouckhaert, a Human Rights Watch
investigator here.
	   ``If independent forensic experts would be allowed to all the
sites, it would be a lot easier to find out who is responsible.''
	   That is particularly true, he said, in cases where the Serbian
police themselves are implicated.
	   ``It is important that the government doesn't pick and choose
who will investigate them,'' Bouckaert said.
	   The report details and documents serious breaches of
international law, condemns the government for restricting the
ability of humanitarian aid workers to treat people who have fled
their homes. It also criticizes government restrictions on the
press seeking to report atrocities.
	   ``Some ethnic Albanian journalists have been threatened,
detained or beaten by the police, and independent Serb media have
been labeled `traitors' or threatened with legal action for
objective reporting on Kosovo.''

Spanish authorities seize 500 kilos of cocaine from French boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CADIZ, Spain (AP) _ Customs authorities intercepted a French
boat carrying 500 kilos (1,100 pounds) of cocaine near the southern
Spanish coast and arrested the two-person French crew, a spokesman
said Sunday.
	   Coast guards found the cocaine hidden in a false bottom of the
16-meter (yard) boat named Crisclo, a spokesman for the customs'
authorities in this southern Spanish city said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Crisclo was taken to the nearby port of Barbate, the
spokesman said.
	   He refused to identify the detained Frenchmen who were placed
under police custody in Cadiz and can be held for up to 72 hours
before being charged or released.
	   No further information was available on the interception that
took place early Saturday in the Strait of Gibraltar _ a narrow
stretch of the Mediterranean that separates North Africa from
Europe.

Fact-finding team found 760 killed or missing in Aceh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A fact-finding team sent by the
provincial government has found about 760 soldiers and rebels
missing or killed in a military operation against Islamic
separatist rebels in the northernmost province of Aceh.
	   The death toll, reported Sunday by the official Antara news
agency, was similar to what has already been announced by the
Indonesian Armed Forces.
	   Antara quoted Yusuf Ismail Pase, team vice chairman, as saying
they found some 600 women who had been widowed, along with 1,960
orphans and 10 women who had been raped.
	   Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province, is one of three
Indonesian provinces where separatist rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Sunday's findings were slightly different from those disclosed
in August by the National Commission on Human Rights, a
government-sponsored watchdog, which uncovered mass graves of
alleged victims in the military.
	   That group found 781 deaths. It also reported as missing at
least 160 people and said 368 people had been tortured.
	   Pase said his team has also found various cases of violence and
extortion of properties like cars, motorcycles and jewelry.
	   He noted the operation has left a deep traumatic impact on the
villagers, especially between 1989-1992, the early years of the
operation.
	   In August, Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto decided to end
the military operation and withdrew troops from the tip of Sumatra
region, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

events in nearby Kosovo, the latest conflict brewing in the
Balkans.
	   ``May understanding, mutual respect, forgiveness and
reconciliation at last take the place of violence and
destruction,'' said the pope.
	   He called on the international community to provide ``timely
help,'' but did not mention the threat of airstrikes by NATO unless

	   During his five-day visit, Lakhdar Brahimi will hold talks with
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his deputy, Mohsen Aminzadeh,
who is responsible for Afghan affairs.
	   Brahimi told reporters at the airport that he also hopes to meet
with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   He was to fly to Pakistan on Thursday.
	   ``I will not be going to Afghanistan because U.N personnel are
not allowed to travel there for security reasons,'' Brahimi said.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the Taliban's main backer, and
Iran has been accused of supporting the Afghan opposition in the
north.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia admitted that its forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and
a journalist after taking the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Two diplomats escaped and made their way
home.
	   The Taliban, which rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
renegade fighters killed the Iranians. But Taliban leaders have
refused Iranian demands that the killers be handed over.
	   Iran's response was to deploy more than 200,000 Iranian troops
on the border with Afghanistan for military maneuvers. Taliban
leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border in response
to the war games.
	   The Taliban on Friday accused Iran of violating its air space
during the maneuvers. Iran denied the allegation.
	   On Saturday, the Taliban militia warned of the possibility of
``a devastating war'' and urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to intervene.
	   The Taliban continues to hold some 50 Iranian nationals. Tehran
says most were working as drivers delivering aid to Afghans
hard-hit by the war.

Report: Malaysian customs will seize travelers' extra cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Customs officers were ordered
Sunday to begin seizing any Malaysian currency that travelers
carried above the limit of 1,000 ringgit (dlrs 263), a newspaper
reported.
	   State Customs Director Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid was quoted by
the Sunday Star as saying the seizures were to begin at Johor
Bahru, the border crossing between Malaysia and Singapore.
	   Currency restrictions went into effect Oct. 1, limiting the
amount of local and foreign currency travelers can carry out of the
country and the amount of ringgit they can bring in.
	   Abdul Rahman said during the three-day grace period, more than
100 travelers had been found carrying ringgit above the limit. From
now on the extra cash will be confiscated and a receipt given, he
said. Travelers can appeal to the central bank to get their money
back.
	   Non-Malaysians are allowed to carry out of the country no more
foreign currency than they bring in, but Abdul Rahman did not
specify whether there had been any violations of that rule.
	   He said that on Saturday the central bank had raised the limit
on the amount of foreign currency citizens can take out of Malaysia
to 50,000 ringgit (dlrs 13,157).
	   Senior customs officers will be able to clear up to that amount
so that travelers can pay for medical or school expenses abroad, he
was quoted as saying. Previously the limit had been announced as
10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,631).

Cardoso is overwhelming favorite as Brazilians head to the polls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls open; polls close at 2000 GMT, final
results expected Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil may be facing its worst
economic crisis since the country went broke in 1982, but President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso remained the clear favorite as voters
prepared to vote Sunday in national elections.
	   Cardoso, who led Brazil into a time of stagnation and record
unemployment, has promised spending cuts and more taxes if
re-elected.
	   And all polls have indicated the 67-year-old sociologist has
enough support to win another four-year term on Sunday, when
Brazilians also will choose 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies,
a third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,045 state legislators.
	   A survey conducted last week by the prestigious Ibope polling
institute gave Cardoso 47 percent of the vote to 24 percent for
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party. The survey
of 3,000 people nationwide had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
	   Polls opened at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and close at 5 p.m. (2000
GMT), but anyone waiting in line at closing time will be allowed to
vote.
	   Lula voted early in Sao bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb
of Sao Paulo where he worked for years in an auto plant. Cardoso
was to vote later in Sao Paulo.
	   In Rio, the sun came out after days of rain and lines formed
early outside voting stations. As usual, a ban on last-minute
campaigning near polls was widely ignored, and campaign workers
waved party flags and handed out leaflets.
	   Voting is compulsory for Brazilians between 18 and 70.
	   Although elections were expected to be peaceful, army troops
were stationed in nine states, in districts with high Indian
populations or a history of land conlicts. A ban on liquor sales
was in effect in most states.

Malaysia's Anwar leaves hospital, women protest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's reformer politician
Anwar Ibrahim left a hospital Sunday after medical check-ups for
injuries he says he sustained in police beatings.
	   Anwar, due for arraignment Monday on five counts of corruption
and five of illegal homosexual acts, was admitted to the
government-owned University Hospital late Saturday, after a court
gave permission.
	   His overnight checkup over, a police motorcade whisked away
Anwar, seated in the back of a jeep with tinted windows.
	   His lawyers said they did not know where he was taken. Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, called it a ``breach of human rights'' that
the lawyers had been denied access to their client since his last
court appearance Wednesday.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was once the heir
apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But as Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of the longruling
Mahathir, he fell out of favor and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   In two court appearances last week, Anwar pleaded innocent to
the charges and said his black eye and bruises on his neck and arm
came from a police beating the night he was arrested.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement and they forced a group of 300 women, with their children
and some husbands, to disperse Sunday when they gathered across a
highway from the king's palace.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said a Muslim woman in a head
scarf who, like others, said she was afraid to give her name.
	   ``They call this a democracy but they won't even let us gather
and sit on a hillside.''
	   The women left after two hours when riot police trucks and a
water cannon arrived. They did not mention Anwar but sang patriotic
songs.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.
	   The court granted Anwar's request for further medical attention
after he complained of neck and back pain.
	   Anwar's wife, a retired eye surgeon, said she had been refused a
copy of her husband's medical report as it is considered secret
under the Internal Security Act.
	   ``My priority is to get justice done,'' she said. ``If this
country is democratic then this will be the test.''
	   University Hospital officials refused Sunday to comment on
Anwar's condition. He was to have undergone checks in the
orthopedic department, including X-rays of his backbone and his
bruised left eye.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   Police stood guard within and outside the hospital, using a
wooden barricade to seal off entry to the first floor where Anwar
was being treated. Police blocked stairwell entrances and barred
visitors, including Anwar's wife and children.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, Anwar led thousands of people in two weeks of peaceful
protests against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir has also accused
Anwar of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he
was ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.

Attendance up, beer consumption down at this year's Oktoberfest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ More visitors drank less beer at this
year's Oktoberfest, Munich's world-famous beer festival that ended
Sunday.
	   About 6.5 million people visited the 16-day annual event, 1.5
percent more than in 1997, said Munich tourist office chief Gabi
Weishaeupl.
	   Yet beer consumption dropped to its lowest level in years _ down
4 percent to 5 million liters (10.6 million pints). Weishaeupl
attributed the conflicting trends to more families coming to the
festival with their children.
	   Less beer consumed meant by the Bavarian Red Cross had less to
do. It said the number of intoxicated people it took care of
dropped from 345 in 1997 to 276 this year.
	   And police reported the number of people stealing beer steins
was down 15 percent.

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a sun-basked seaside packed with
pilgrims, Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left
by war and totalitarian rule and expressed ``anxious concern'' over
events in nearby Kosovo, the latest conflict brewing in the
Balkans.
	   ``May understanding, mutual respect, forgiveness and
reconciliation at last take the place of violence and
destruction,'' said the pope.
	   He called on the international community to provide ``timely
help,'' but did not mention the threat of airstrikes by NATO unless
Yugoslavia halts its assault on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli F-16 fighters have been equipped to carry
chemical and biological weapons manufactured at a secret biological
institute in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   The newspaper also said the institute supplied poison for an
attempt last year to kill Khaled Meshal, a leader of the Islamic
fundamentalist group Hamas.
	   Israeli agents sprayed the poison into Meshal's ear, but Israel
was forced to supply an antidote after Jordan threatened to put the
agents on trial, the report said.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office
acknowledged that an El Al cargo plane that crashed in an Amsterdam
residential area in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can be used
in making the nerve gas sarin,.
	   Some 50 gallons (190 liters) of dimethyl methylphosphonate
(DMMP), a key component of sarin, was destined for the institute,
and was replaced, the Israeli government confirmed. It said,
however, the chemical has various industrial uses and the shipment
was approved by Washington.
	   The Israeli government has merely called ``inaccurate'' reports
that the institute makes chemical and biological weapons _ and
according to The Sunday Times more unusual poisons too.
	   The Sunday Times said Israeli air force crews are now trained to
fit active chemical or biological weapons to F-16s within minutes
of receiving a command to attack.
	   The institute was founded in 1952 as a single building hidden in
an orange grove and now sprawls over several acres surrounded by a
6-foot (1.8 meter) wall equipped with sensors, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Police placed a leading democratic
politician under protection Sunday following the slaying of a
popular government minister seen as a compromise candidate to end
Mongolia's protracted political crisis.
	   Friday's slaying of Infrastructure Minister Sanjaasuregiin Zorig
shocked the capital, Ulan Bator, which has been locked in a
four-month standoff between the governing Democratic Coalition and
a resurgent opposition comprised largely of former communists.
	   About 3,500 people turned out in near-freezing temperatures
Saturday night to place lit candles in Zorig's memory on a wall
outside Government House. More were expected to take part in
candlelight vigils Sunday and Monday nights.
	   Although police have not released a motive for Zorig's death,
people at the vigil called it a political killing.
	   Police released new details Sunday about the slaying. Zorig's
assailants stole dlrs 300, gold earrings and bottles of vinegar and
soy sauce from his apartment. Two men who claimed to have seen the
killers as they left Zorig's home were being questioned.
	   The slaying appeared to be planned. Police say the killers tied
Zorig's wife up in the bathroom and then waited for him to come
home. He was then stabbed with a knife and hacked with an axe.
	   Zorig, a leader in the 1990 democratic revolution that ended
seven decades of Soviet-sponsored Stalinism in Mongolia, was widely
expected to be nominated next week as prime minister. He was
supposed to meet an opposition leader on Saturday to try to win
support.
	   A colleague in the Democratic Coalition E. Bat Uul was placed
under police protection Sunday, politicians said. President N.
Bagabandi had rejected Bat Uul's nomination as prime minister last
week, the fifth politician rejected in the standoff between the
coalition and the opposition.
	   The opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party began a
boycott of parliament in June after it accused the Democratic
Coalition of trying to reap financial benefit for its members in a
planned merger of a state bank and private bank.
	   Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj then lost a vote of
confidence and resigned with his Cabinet on July 24, although he
and his ministers have stayed on as caretakers.
	   The confrontation has further soured popular support for the
fledgling democracy and distracted government attention from
mounting problems.
	   More than a third of the landlocked country's 2 million people
live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and inflation last
year topped 30 percent.
	   But Zorig's death and the popular sympathy it has evoked may
help end the standoff. Opposition MPRP leader N. Enkhbayar said
Sunday he was considering shelving a motion to dissolve parliament.
	   ``Without compromise we cannot reach our common goal. We will
fall victim to extreme nationalism,'' Enkhbayar said. ``This death
can bring the three parties together and resolve the political
deadlock.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communist leader on Sunday insisted on
withdrawing support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old
coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the
country's longest-lived governments.
	   Bitterly divided, leaders of the Communist Refoundation party,
which gives Prodi a majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, were
scheduled to vote later in the day on the proposal to yank support
for the center-left coalition.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists
decide to yank support. The coalition has a majority without the
Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of
key legislation in the Chamber.
	   Defying other top Communist officials, Fausto Bertinotti, party
secretary, defended his strategy to vote against the government's
proposed 1999 budget and to refuse to back the government in a
confidence vote. Bertinotti said he is betting that a new
government would be more leftist.
	   While Prodi could theoretically win votes from centrists now in
the opposition as well as from Bertinotti dissenters to pass the
budget as well as in a confidence vote, he has stressed that his
electoral platform included a pledge to work with the Communists in
major policy issues. Thus he is likely to resign if the Communists
won't back him.
	   The Communists' No. 2, Armando Cossutta, has argued against
Bertinotti's plan, insisting it would be better to work with he
government for a budget that would devote more funds to job
creation.
	   A split left, argued Oliviero Diliberto, the Communist Chamber
whip, would help the center-right opposition, led by ex-premier
Silvio Berlusconi, who has been pressing for early elections.
	   The Communists contend the budget doesn't contain enough funds
to creat jobs, especially in the south, where unemployment runs as
high as 20 percent.
	   Prodi's coalition has outlived all but two of Italy's other 54
postwar governments.

Minister says U.N. agency to help with food for Iraqi poor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed an agreement with the World
Food Program, a U.N. agency, to expand its special feeding program
for the poor, an Iraqi minister was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   The labor and social affairs minister, Lt. Gen. Saadi Tu'ma,
told Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly that ``the ministry has signed a
deal with the World Food Program, which Iraq has supported
financially in the past, to increase food items for poor Iraqis.''
	   He said that the number eligible for the monthly food aid would
increase to 943,000 from the current 240,000, starting in November,
the paper said.
	   Tu'ma did not make clear who would pay for expanding the
program, which in the past was underwritten by the Iraqi
government.
	   The food aid is over and above the monthly food ration that all
Iraqis receive under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   The special feeding program makes available to the poor 5
kilograms (11 pounds) of flour, 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds) of sugar,
2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of lentils and 2 kilograms of cooking oil.
	   The monthly ration for all Iraqis includes flour, rice, sugar,
tea, lentils, salt, cooking oil, soap and detergent. There's also a
special ration of milk for babies.
	   The United Nations hopes to add protein in the form of whole
milk for adults to the November ration.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from U.N. trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its 22 million people.

Fearing war, regional leaders appeal for peace in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Fearing the conflict in Kosovo has reached
a crucial point, the leaders of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania Sunday
made an ``urgent appeal'' for an immediate cease-fire in the
Albanian-dominated Yugoslav province.
	   ``The three leaders make an urgent and dramatic appeal to all
sides involved and in particular the Yugoslav authorities, to work
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Kosovo,'' they said
in a joint statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting.
	   Greek Premier Costas Simitis, Presidents Petar Stoyanov of
Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of Romania all agreed that NATO
military action in Kosovo could lead to an escalation and possible
spread of the conflict.
	   ``We who neighbor these countries can't be indifferent. That is
why we decided to take a stand on this issue,'' Constantinescu
said.
	   Stoyanov added that ``any conflict could create a chain reaction
elsewhere.''
	   Their meeting in Delphi, home of the ancient oracle, came as
U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan prepared to submit a report on
Yugoslav compliance with a Security Council resolution which
demands an end to the offensive in Kosovo.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, which all
three leaders hoped would not mean military intervention by NATO.
	   ``We believe that implementing this decision will lead to the
avoidance of other measures, which we hope will not occur,''
Simitis said.
	   But of the three countries, NATO and European Union-member
Greece may be called on to provide assistance and support for a
military strike.
	   All three leaders said other countries seeking to play a role in
the Balkans should consult with them before taking any action,
pointing out that the European Union's weakness in forging a common
foreign policy led to an escalation of the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``Neighboring states should be heard first. By resolving one
conflict we should not create burdens for neighboring states. It
should not impact negatively,'' Stoyanov said.
	   One of their greatest fears, they said, would be a repetition of
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ensuing sanctions on
Yugoslavia. All three countries lost billions of dollars when
sanctions cut off a major European trade route through Yugoslavia.
	   ``Because our countries are the closest they have the best
knowledge on this and are the most affected, as we were affected by
the conflict in Bosnia,'' Constantinescu said.
	   Although all three leaders agreed with the need for greater
autonomy for Kosovo's Albanians, they stressed their disagreement
with their demand for full independence in Kosovo, the Serbian
province which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Serbia is the
dominant republic in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   ``A cease-fire should be put immediately into effect, parties
should come to the negotiating table without preconditions, aiming
at achieving a peaceful solution for a large autonomy for Kosovo
within the internationally recognized borders of Yugoslavia ... so
that another course of action be avoided,'' they said in their
joint statement.
	   Simitis added the meeting was a good opportunity for a
discussion of the Oct. 12-13 Balkan summit in Antalya, Turkey.
During last year's summit in Crete, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic spoke with Albania's prime minister, the first such
high-level meeting in 49 years.
	   ``Next Monday we will meet Milosevic and the Albanian prime
minister in Antalya and we have said we will discuss it (Kosovo)
there and try to find a specific solution to this specific
problem,'' Simitis said.

Latvians approve easing citizenship for Russians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with preliminary count of all precincts, observer

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvians have narrowly approved their
parliament's controversial measures to ease citizenship
requirements for the country's hundreds of thousands of stateless
Russians in a referendum.
	   The preliminary count of votes from all the country's precincts
showed the changes approved by a 53-45 margin in a Saturday
referendum. The remaining ballots were blank marked incorrectly, in
what elections commission chairman Andris Cinmars said may have
been protest votes.
	   Many voters had complained they were confused by the phrasing of
the referendum question. The confusion was noted by a team of more
than 100 international election observers, but ``nevertheless, the
vote reflects the will of the Latvian people,'' said team head
Mikko Elo of Finland.
	   The referendum, which was held in conjunction with voting for
the country's 100-seat Saeima parliament, ends years of delays for
many citizenship applicants.
	   It also means that children born of stateless parents since
independence in 1991 will be granted citizenship.
	   With the results, Latvia heads off a confrontation with the
West. But whether the results will mollify Russia, which has
denounced Latvia for its treatment of ethnic Russians, is in doubt.
	   Although the changes remove years of waiting for citizenship
applicants, the laws still require adults to have competence in
Latvian, which many who grew up in all-Russian communities within
Latvia regard as unreasonable.
	   ``This is a turning point for Latvia. It will help us solve our
problems with Russia because our friends in the West will stand
behind us,'' Andris Skele, leader of the People's Party that led
the parliamentary polling, said early Sunday.
	   The amendments were first passed in June after a tense spring in
which Russia threatened trade sanctions against its diminutive
neighbor.
	   But after the measures passed, a drive to overturn them began,
spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claimed Latvian national
identity was imperiled. Their campaign led to Saturday's
referendum, which asks voters if they want to reject the
amendments.
	   After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there before the Soviet annexation in 1940.
	   That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule and their children, even if
born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
	   Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling station in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
	   Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning against the citizenship amendments.
	   On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
	   Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
	   The new center-right Peoples Party was at the top with 20.9
percent. The conservative Latvia's Way had 18 percent, followed by
the National Harmony Party, Fatherland and Freedom, the Union of
Social Democrats and the New Party.

Report: Indonesia president finds Anwar's arrest unfair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds
attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of
his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in
Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada said he was considering not going to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's
arrest.
	   ``I'm very concerned over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been
treated,'' Habibie was quoted as saying by the English-language
newspaper The Nation.
	   ``I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar
Ibrahim had contributed a lot for the benefit of his country.''
	   Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the
successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But he was suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the
two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against
Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Anwar has been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal
under Malaysia law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext
for his political persecution.
	   In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he
said he had been beaten by police, heightening international
attention to his case.
	   ``Because of human rights involved _ and I think it is universal
_ people should be given the chance to defend themselves,'' Habibie
was quoted as saying in the interview conducted Saturday. ``People
should not be tortured.''
	   Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based ``on
things which had not been proven.''
	   On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult for
me.''
	   But he said he would consult parliament, adding, ``I'm not
coming personally but as the president of 211 million people of
Indonesia.''
	   Like Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president
when Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on
the international affairs circuit.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The National Union of
Metalworkers ended a five-week long strike on Sunday by spare-part
makers in the auto industry after agreeing on wage hikes.
	   The strike was called off after union members endorsed the
latest wage proposals, which include raises of up to 10 percent.
	   The country's seven auto manufacturers had been nearly shut down
because of a shortage of components caused by the strike.

Bulgaria, Romania still at odds over Balkan crossing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; WITH BC-Greece-Balkan Leaders &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Romania and Bulgaria are still at odds
over where to build a second bridge spanning the Danube river
separating them, despite repeated discussions on the issue over the
past three years, Bulgaria said Saturday.
	   ``I won't hide that our positions continue to differ,''
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said after a two-day summit with
leaders of Romania and Greece, but added that the disagreement is
not ``at the core of a serious argument'' between the two
countries.
	   ``Two neighboring countries with a common border of 300
kilometers (187 miles) should not have just one or two bridges
connecting them but more,'' Stoyanov said.
	   The bridge would be part of a trans-European highway currently
under consideration which would originate in St. Petersburg,
Russia, cross through Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria and end in the
northern Greek port town of Alexandroupolis.
	   But the dispute, which has been around since Greece, Bulgaria
and Romania held their first trilateral meeting in northern Greece
in 1995, should no longer be seen in a purely political context,
Stoyanov said.
	   ``The conflict in Kosovo is bringing this issue to the fore
because the bridge will make the shortest route circumventing
Yugoslavia,'' he noted.
	   The only bridge linking the two countries, from Bulgaria's
Danube port of Ruse with Romania's Giurgiu, was unable to convey
sufficient traffic because of economic sanctions levied on
Yugoslavia as a consequence of the Bosnian conflict.
	   Bulgaria says it incurred more than dlrs 3 billion in trade
losses because of the sanctions.
	   Three ferry routes also span the Danube to link the two
countries.
	   Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said Bulgaria and Romania
agreed to set up a committee of experts which will ``analyse all
possible solutions and phases concerned with such ties between
Romania and Bulgaria.''
	   During a previous trilateral meeting held in April on the Greek
island of Santorini, the three countries had agreed to set up a
working group to study the problems with the bridge.

Security fears shadow otherwise festive Jewish holiday

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis built makeshift huts and shopped for
special fruits Sunday as they prepared to mark Sukkot, a festive
Jewish holiday commemorating the desert wanderings of their
ancestors.
	   But this holiday, like a recent string of others _ including
last month's Jewish New Year and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement _
was shadowed by security fears.
	   Israel sealed off the Palestinian lands and imposed tight
security in Israel proper, citing warnings of attacks by the
radical Islamic group Hamas.
	   The seven-day Sukkot festival, also known as the Feast of the
Tabernacles, was beginning at sundown on Sunday. Most shops,
businesses and offices were to be shut Monday, and some will have
shortened hours all week.
	   Many Israelis use their yards or balconies to build a
traditional sukkah, meant to remind them of huts used by the
ancient Israelites during their 40-year trek across the Sinai
desert after fleeing Egypt.
	   Some religious Jews sleep in the huts, made of wood and palm
branches _ or, in a more modern version, of plastic and canvas _
and decorated with hanging fruit. Sukkot celebrates the fall
harvest as well.
	   Yonah Berman, 17, of Teaneck, New Jersey, who is in Israel to
study at a Jewish seminary, said he had celebrated the holiday in
the United States but ``it's obviously a lot nicer here because
everyone is doing it.''
	   At Jerusalem's covered Mahane Yehuda market, whole rows of
tables sold only Sukkot-related items, including a prime symbol,
inedible lemon-like citrus fruits called etrogs. Orthodox Jews
scrutinized them carefully to make sure they were suitable.
	   On the security front, police said a heightened alert would
continue through the entire holiday. Measures included a total ban
on parking in the walled Old City, and extra soldiers and police
were patrolling busy public places.
	   Sukkot has strong associations with nature, and Israelis escaped
in droves to the country's national parks for camping or hiking.
About 25,000 Israelis were expected to cross the border for trips
to the Sinai peninsula.
	   Not everyone was leaving the city, though _ Sukkot is one of
three holidays of pilgrimage, when Israelis from all over the
country come to Jerusalem. In biblical times, Jews journeyed here
to take part in ritual sacrifices at the Holy Temple.
	   Modern-day Sukkot commemorations include a ceremony involving
hundreds of ``cohanim,'' or descendants of the priestly caste of
biblical times, who converge at the Western Wall in the Old City.
	   With white prayer shawls over their head, they recite a verse
from Numbers _ ``May the Lord bless thee and guard thee.''
	   That blessing was invoked daily in the temple in ancient
Jerusalem by the cohanim, who trace their heritage to Aaron, Moses'
brother and the first biblical high priest.
	   The Western Wall is believed to be the outer wall of the temple
rebuilt by King Herod in Roman times to replace the mammoth temple
King Solomon built around 1000 B.C.
	   Secular politics played a role in holiday observances, too. At a
ceremony to usher in Sukkot, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
lightheartedly told an audience that its symbols also symbolized
the strength of his ruling coalition.

Mubarak in Syria over rising tension with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Mubarak leaving, comments from
Egyptian and Syrian foreign ministers. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Kurdish Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here
Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing
tension between Syria and Turkey.
	   Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to
reporters.
	   But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on
the trip, said before their departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue
for solving disputes and not military power and threats.''
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that
Arab support for Syria should not be read in Ankara as animosity
toward Turkey.
	   The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the
situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not
through confrontation or threats.''
	   Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey would achieve
results.
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak was expected in Ankara,
possibly on Monday.
	   The talks in Damascus came as Turkey has massed forces near the
border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel
bases in the neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Moussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with
Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey. Syria denies sheltering Kurdish
fighters.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
	   Editorials in the Arab world called on both sides to show
restraint.
	   In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, published by Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the Turkish incursion into
Iraq.
	   ``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the
present tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. ``The Turkish
buildup does not serve anybody as much as it will harm Turkey and
Syria and other parties in the region.''
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette said in an editorial on
Sunday that ``the Syrians, understandably, harbor the belief that
Turkey is being manipulated by its new-found ally, Israel, to
pounce,'' with the dispute over Kurdish rebels being a pretext.
	   Israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved
in any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have
taken steps to reassure Syria.''

Special anti terrorist police unit will investigate recent bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An anti-terrorist police unit
will be moved to Mostar to investigate recent ``terrorist'' acts
against Muslims trying to go return to the region they were driven
out of during Bosnia's war, the Croat-Muslim Interior Ministry said
Sunday.
	   The police announcement was accompanied by a report of another
anti-Muslim attack Sunday _ two bombs thrown at a house recently
reclaimed by a Muslim refugee in a village near Stolac, in southern
Bosnia.
	   Stolac, 120 kilometers (about 70 miles) south of Sarajevo, is a
disputed town in the south of the country, run by Bosnian Croats.
All Muslims from the region fled their homes during Muslim-Croat
fighting in 1993, part of the larger conflict against the Serbs.
	   An agreement between local Muslim and Croat politicians was
reached beginning 1998 to allow all refugees to return to their
homes in the area.
	   But more than 40 incidents _ most of them anti Muslim _ have
been recorded since the refugees started returning in March. None
of the perpetrators have been questioned or detained.
	   One Muslim was killed and three others injured Friday in a
series of explosions outside Muslim homes in nearby Tasovcici
village, where Muslims returned three days ago.
	   The area official responsible for police, Valentin Coric, a
Bosnian Croat, resigned Saturday, presumably reacting to the latest
incidents.
	   Although formally linked in a federation, Bosnian Croats and
Muslims remain suspicious of each other. Hard-line Bosnian Croat
officials opposed to coexistence with Muslims are blamed for most
of the tensions.

Lions shutout Dragons 5-0, reducing magic to three
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domingo Martinez and Ken Suzuki connected for
back-to-back solo homers in the eighth Sunday as the Pacific
League's winningest Seibu Lions shut out the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks
5-0 at home.
	   Seeking their second league pennant in a row, the Lions now have
reduced their magic number to three with nine games left.
	   Martinez, formerly with Triple-A Rochester, has 29 home runs and
ranks fourth in the league.
	   Lions' reliever Yukihiro Nishizaki gave up one hit, while
fanning two in two innings and collected his first victory since he
joined the Lions from the Fighters earlier this year.
	   The Hawks wrapped up their season Sunday with their fifth loss
in a row.
	   No other Pacific League games were scheduled Sunday.
	   In the Central League, Tetsuya Iida tripled home three runs in
the top of the first inning as the Yakult Swallows trounced the
front-running Yokohama BayStars 8-4, delaying their league victory.
	   The BayStars lost their second game in a row, with their magic
for the league pennant still at three with eight games left.
Takahiro Ikeyama hit a two run homer in the second.
	   Swallows starter Kenjiro Kawasaki (16-10) gave up seven hits,
struck out three and walked two in seven innings. He is tied with
the Yomiuri Giants' Masumi Kuwata for the league lead in wins.
	   Robert Rose, formerly with the California Angels, batted in a
run on a double in the bottom of the eighth. But that came too late
for the BayStars.
	   The Swallows, the league's defending champions, have been
already eliminated for this year's pennant.
	   At Koshien, Nathan Minchey threw a four-hitter and allowed no
runners beyond first base after the third inning as the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp edged the Hanshin Tigers 3-1.
	   Minchey (15-11), formerly of the Boston Red Sox, struck out four
and walked none and completed the game with 120 pitches, chalking
up his fifth win this season against the last-place Tigers.

Turkish police intercept 500 would-be refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANAKKALE, Turkey (AP) _ Police detained 500 illegal immigrants
in the Dardanelles strait region early Sunday as they attempted to
board a ship headed for Italy, news reports said.
	   In the largest operation this year, police detained a group of
Syrians, Afghanis, Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, including an
unspecified number of women and children, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
	   Officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Thousands of foreigners have been rounded up since the beginning
of the year after European nations put pressure on Turkey to impose
stricter control on its coasts and borders to prevent an exodus of
Kurds and other foreigners to Europe.

1 million visitors storm Berlin's new center on opening weekend
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ On a weekend meant to celebrate German unity, an
estimated 1 million Berliners stormed a brand new shopping and
entertainment complex on what used to be the no-man's land of the
Berlin Wall.
	   In scenes reminiscent of the exuberant days that followed the
Wall's collapse in 1989, the 10 new streets through Potsdamer Platz
were full of shoppers and strollers admiring the brightly lit
complex built by Daimler-Benz at a cost of 4 billion marks (dlrs
2.4 billion).
	   ``It's like 1989, when they tore the Wall down,'' said one
excited visitor. ``It's unbelievable here,'' said an elderly man,
almost in tears.
	   Most stores in Germany closed for Saturday's German Unification
Day holiday. But those at Potsdamer Platz were open until midnight
_ and were packed till the end.
	   ``I've been waiting since 8 o'clock to go home,'' one flustered
salesclerk said shortly before midnight. ``But with this chaos you
can't even think of it.''
	   The newly opened Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park subway station was
so jammed at times trains couldn't load or unload passengers, and

	   Before World War II, the square in the center of Berlin was one
of Europe's busiest intersections _ site of the first traffic
signal on the continent.

though, was torn down when the area became part of the ``death
strip'' between the Wall's two sections.

the centerpiece, a 20-story, terra cotta office tower for the

Minister says U.N. agency to help with food for Iraqi poor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed an agreement with the World
Food Program, a U.N. agency, to expand its special feeding program
for the poor, an Iraqi minister was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   The labor and social affairs minister, Lt. Gen. Saadi Tu'ma,
told the Al-Musawir Al-Arabi weekly that ``the ministry has signed
a deal with the World Food Program, which Iraq has supported
financially in the past, to increase food items for poor Iraqis.''
	   He said that the number eligible for the monthly food aid would
increase to 943,000 from the current 240,000, starting in November,
the paper said.
	   Tu'ma did not make clear who would pay for expanding the
program, which in the past was underwritten by the Iraqi
government.
	   The food aid is over and above the monthly food ration that all
Iraqis receive under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   The special feeding program makes available to the poor 5
kilograms (11 pounds) of flour, 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds) of sugar,
2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of lentils and 2 kilograms of cooking oil.
	   The monthly ration for all Iraqis includes flour, rice, sugar,
tea, lentils, salt, cooking oil, soap and detergent. There's also a
special ration of milk for babies.
	   The United Nations hopes to add protein in the form of whole
milk for adults to the November ration.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from U.N. trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its 22 million people.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw
support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move
expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's
longest-lived postwar governments.
	   Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists
yanked support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists
in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key
legislation in the Chamber.

Mubarak in Syria over rising tension with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Mubarak leaving, comments from
Egyptian and Syrian foreign ministers, editorials; further
background, . &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Turkey-Kurdish Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here
Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing
tension between Syria and Turkey.
	   Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to
reporters. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said before their
departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and
not military power and threats.''
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that
Arab support for Syria should not be read in Ankara as animosity
toward Turkey.
	   The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the
situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not
through confrontation or threats.''
	   Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey would achieve
results.
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak was expected in Ankara,
possibly on Monday.
	   The talks in Damascus came as Turkey has massed forces near the
border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel
bases in the neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Moussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with
Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey. Syria denies sheltering Kurdish
fighters.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
	   Editorials in the Arab world called on both sides to show
restraint.
	   In Baghdad, the newspaper Babil, published by Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein's son Odai, reported the Turkish incursion into
Iraq.
	   ``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the
present tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial. ``The Turkish
buildup does not serve anybody as much as it will harm Turkey and
Syria and other parties in the region.''
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette said in an editorial on
Sunday that ``the Syrians, understandably, harbor the belief that
Turkey is being manipulated by its new-found ally, Israel, to
pounce,'' with the dispute over Kurdish rebels being a pretext.
	   Israel, for its part, said it does not want to become involved
in any military confrontation between Syria and Turkey.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. ``We have
taken steps to reassure Syria.''

 &UR; With BC-US-World Bank-Knowledge Gap, HFR &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's villagers may watch video
e-mails in local post offices, but outside the special booths,
thousands of children still die each year from preventable
diseases.
	   Even with one of the world's largest pools of scientists and
engineers, India finds itself on both extremes of the information
revolution. The disparity, as outlined in this years World
Development Report, can be striking.
	   In rural northern India, a conglomerate of computer software
companies last week set up the first public video e-mail booth. In
an experimental launch, illiterate village women who had never seen
a computer before received video messages by e-mail from their
husbands working in faraway Bombay.
	   ``The remotest village has the possibility of tapping a global
store of knowledge beyond the dreams of anyone living a century
ago, and more quickly and cheaply than anyone imagined only a few
decades ago,'' wrote World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn in
the forward of his agency's report.
	   But among the 4 billion inhabitants of the underdeveloped world,
huge gaps exist in access to education and technology, said the
report released Sunday. India's problems are typical.
	   In thousands of villages across India _ the World Bank's largest
single borrower and the largest overall recipient of developments
credits _ millions of people live with hunger, disease and misery.
	   Preventable diseases like leprosy, tuberculosis, cataract
blindness and malaria account for nearly 50 percent of all reported
illnesses, leading to 470 deaths per 10,000 people, the report
said. The HIV virus already has afflicted an estimated 3 million
people, spreading largely because of lack of awareness about its
prevention.
	   India is riding a boom in cable television, telephony and
Internet connectivity that promises a gradual change. But it is
slow to absorb knowledge because it remains among the least
educated countries in the world _ roughly one out of three
school-age children is not enrolled in school, especially girls.
	   ``For the poor, the promise of the new information age _
knowledge for all _ can seem as remote as a distant star.''
Wolfensohn said in the report.

	   There was no immediate reaction from the government.
	   A confidence vote could be scheduled in the next few days. If
Prodi fails to muster a majority in the chamber he would be forced
to resign and new elections might be called.
	   Bitterly divided, the Communist Refoundation's national
political committee voted 188 to 112 in favor of refusing to vote
for the government's proposed 1999 budget as well as to stop
backing the center-left coalition.
	   Defying other top Communist officials, Fausto Bertinotti, party
secretary, defended his strategy to vote against the government,
betting that a new government would be more leftist.
	   The Communists' No. 2, Armando Cossutta, had argued against
Bertinotti's plan, insisting it would be better to work with he
government for a budget that would devote more funds to job
creation.
	   A split left, argued Oliviero Diliberto, the Communist Chamber
whip, would only help the center-right opposition, led by
ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has been pressing for early

Fearing war, regional leaders appeal for peace in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DELPHI, Greece (AP) _ Fearing the conflict in Kosovo has reached
a crucial point, the leaders of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania Sunday
made an ``urgent appeal'' for an immediate cease-fire in the
Albanian-dominated Yugoslav province and warned that any NATO
action could lead to escalation.
	   ``The three leaders make an urgent and dramatic appeal to all
sides involved and in particular the Yugoslav authorities, to work
for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Kosovo,'' they said
in a joint statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting.
	   Greek Premier Costas Simitis, Presidents Petar Stoyanov of
Bulgaria and Emil Constantinescu of Romania all agreed that NATO
military action in Kosovo could lead to an escalation and possible
spread of the conflict.
	   ``We who neighbor these countries can't be indifferent. That is
why we decided to take a stand on this issue,'' Constantinescu
said.
	   Stoyanov added that ``any conflict could create a chain reaction
elsewhere.''
	   Their meeting in Delphi came as U.N. secretary-general Kofi
Annan prepared to submit a report on Yugoslav compliance with a
Security Council resolution which demands an end to the offensive
in Kosovo.
	   The resolution threatens unspecified further action, which all
three leaders hoped would not mean military intervention by NATO.
	   ``We believe that implementing this decision will lead to the
avoidance of other measures, which we hope will not occur,''
Simitis said.
	   Of the three countries, NATO and European Union-member Greece
may be called upon to provide assistance and support for a military
strike.
	   All three leaders said other countries seeking to play a role in
the Balkans should consult with them before taking any action.
	   One of their greatest fears, they said, would be a repetition of
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ensuing sanctions on
Yugoslavia. All three countries lost billions of dollars when
sanctions cut off a major European trade route through Yugoslavia.
	   ``Because our countries are the closest they have the best
knowledge on this and are the most affected, as we were affected by
the conflict in Bosnia,'' Constantinescu said.
	   Although all three leaders agreed with the need for greater
autonomy for Kosovo's Albanians, they rejected the demand for full
independence in Kosovo, the Serbian province which is 90 percent
ethnic Albanian. Serbia is the dominant republic in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
	   ``A cease-fire should be put immediately into effect, parties
should come to the negotiating table without preconditions, aiming
at achieving a peaceful solution for a large autonomy for Kosovo
within the internationally recognized borders of Yugoslavia ... so
that another course of action be avoided,'' they said in their
joint statement.
	   Simitis added that the Oct. 12-13 Balkan summit in Antalya,
Turkey may also present opportunities for working out a solution.
The leaders of Yugoslavia and Albania will attend the summit.

 &UR; Russian delegation meets Milosevic as NATO threatens strikes

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his generals prepared
to defend the country against attack.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia the
dominant Yugoslav republic that controls Kosovo.
	   Despite Russia's opposition NATO is preparing for possible
intervention in Serbia's southern province to end seven months of
bloodshed. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have killed
hundreds of people and left upward of 275,000 others homeless in
their seven-month crackdown on Albanian separatists in the
Albanian-majority province.
	   There was no official confirmation of the surprise meeting. But
news photographers captured it on film.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, the Itar-Tass news agency carried a government
statement again expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in
Kosovo without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which
Russia is a veto-carrying member.
	   ``Military interference ... would aggravate many times the
confrontation in Kosovo and undermine diplomatic efforts'' to
reestablish peace and dialogue, said the statement.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities indicated they
were ready for compromise by installing an interim government in
the rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that
up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   But the West apparently remained unmoved.
	   Speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said Friday that the NATO intervention clock ``is at one

and the Yugoslav army has routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels
in a seven-month crackdown that has killed hundreds _ most of them
Albanian civilians _ and left upward of 275,000 villagers refugees.

on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air
strikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for international leaders to step in has increased in
the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian
civilians in the forests of Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, Serb police took reporters to the site of what they
thought was a mass grave on a mountain top near the village of
Volujak, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Dogs, they said, had unearthed human bones in an
area formerly held by the Albanian separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   With reporters looking on, police dug up parts of four skeletons
and said from the smell that they suspected there were more, but
there was no way to identify the remains or determine their
ethnicity and cause of death without closer forensic investigation.
	   The Serbian media reported that Chinese-made bullet casings were
found and also empty casings of hunting rifles at the site where
the bodies were found, both characteristic for ammunition used by
the KLA.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his generals prepared
to defend the country against attack.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia the
dominant Yugoslav republic that controls Kosovo.
	   Despite Russia's opposition NATO is preparing for possible
intervention in Serbia's southern province to end seven months of
bloodshed. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have killed
hundreds of people and left upward of 275,000 others homeless in
their seven-month crackdown on Albanian separatists in the
Albanian-majority province.
	   There was no official confirmation of the surprise meeting. But
news photographers captured it on film.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, the Itar-Tass news agency carried a government
statement again expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in
Kosovo without the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which
Russia is a veto-carrying member.
	   ``Military interference ... would aggravate many times the
confrontation in Kosovo and undermine diplomatic efforts'' to
reestablish peace and dialogue, said the statement.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities indicated they
were ready for compromise by installing an interim government in
the rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that
up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   But the West apparently remained unmoved.
	   Speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said Friday that the NATO intervention clock ``is at one
minute to 12.'' He stressed that ``no ultimatum, no date has been

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has received dlrs 336 million from the
United States to finance development projects, it was announced
Sunday.
	   Washington has also pledged to give another dlrs 826.6 million
to finance other projects, including agriculture and water, health
and population and environment.
	   Egypt will also receive dlrs 86 million in cash transfers by the
end of the year.
	   Sunday's announcement was made in Cairo by Egypt's Minister of
State for Planning Zafer el-Bishry and U.S. Ambassador Daniel
Kurtzer.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Iraq are discussing ways to
facilitate business with each other, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported Sunday.
	   It said talks were held between the head of the Iraqi Chamber of
Commerce Zahir Abdul-Ghafur Younus and his Iranian counterpart
Ali-Naqi Khamoushi. Younus is in Iran to attend the 24th Tehran
International Trade Fair, the agency reported.
	   It said the two men discussed how to facilitate issuing entry
visas and the possibility of exporting Iranian goods to Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, Iran's Trade Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari met with
his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Mehdi Saleh in Tehran Saturday, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported. The two ministers agreed to
expand economic and trade ties and to export Iranian food and
medicine to Iraq.
	   This is the second consecutive year that Iraq attends the Tehran
trade fair.
	   The two countries fought an eight-year war that began in Sept.
1980.
	   Iraq is suffering from crippling U.N trade sanctions imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   For humanitarian reasons, Iraq was allowed to buy food and
medicine under a U.N-approved agreement in 1996 which permits it to
sell a limited amount of oil.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan plans to give financial and
administrative independence to its only news agency, Petra, which
is virtually a government mouthpiece.
	   The move is part of a privatization bid aimed at ridding the
government of costs of various public offices. Petra's
semi-independence will save the government more than 1.2 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 1.7 million), allocated annually to the news
agency.
	   Last year, the government followed a similar approach with the
Jordan Radio and Television Corp.
	   Under the new plan _ which is still under study _ Petra will
generate income through subscription of its news and photo
services, the agency's director-general Abdullah Etoum said Sunday.
	   But the editorial bulletin and photo distribution will remain
under the supervision of the Ministry of Information, Etoum said.
	   He said the plan also envisages expanding Petra's operations by
launching 28 new offices worldwide from the current 16 _ which are
mostly in Arab countries and the United States.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh was quoted in Jordanian
newspapers as saying Petra will soon be allowed to operate on
``commercial basis'' for the first time since it was founded in
1969.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Cabinet approved Sunday the building of a new
city in Subiya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Iraqi
border, a mega project that would reportedly cost around 1.8
billion dinars (dlrs 5.9 billion).
	   A statement by the Cabinet said the government has decided to
expand the country's populated areas ``toward the north.'' The new
city will be connected with the capital, Kuwait City, by a bridge
across Kuwait bay. It said Subiya would house around 250,000 people
in the coming 30 years. Kuwait's population is estimated at 2.2
million, less than 800,000 of them are Kuwaiti nationals.
	   Subiya City will have an industrial area, a university,
technical colleges, ports and its own power station, the statement
said. It will be built by the private sector in association with
international companies, the government said.
	   The cabinet did not say what would be the cost of the city, but
a government report published by Al-Qabas daily in August, put it
at 1.8 billion dinars (dlrs 5.9 billion).
	   Iraq invaded this small oil-rich state eight years ago and
occupied it for seven months before a U.S.-led coalition drove
Iraqi troops out in February 1991.

Family still waits for word on detained Chinese journalist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS final graf to UPDATE with dissidents urging signing of
treaty. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly a month after China's secret police hauled
away a leading Chinese journalist, his family still has no word on
his whereabouts or condition, a rights group reported Sunday.
	   Shi Binhai will pass his 30th day in detention Monday. Police
are required by law to either file formal detention orders or
release suspects after 30 days in custody, although the deadline is
often ignored.
	   As of Saturday night, Shi's family had neither received a
detention notice nor been told where he is being held, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   Shi's wife, Zhang Hong, last saw him being taken away on Sept. 5
by agents from the Ministry of State Security.
	   An editor with the China Economic Times, a reformist newspaper
with loose connections to China's State Council, or Cabinet, the
36-year-old Shi also helped compile the popular book ``Political
China: Facing the Era of Choosing a New Structure.''
	   Although the book examines the need for political reform, media
and dissident circles believe other activities got Shi in trouble
with authorities.
	   The Information Center speculated that Shi was preparing to
interview Zhao Ziyang and had been in contact with the former
Communist Party leader who was purged for refusing to back a
crackdown on student democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in
1989.
	   For many intellectuals and dissidents, Zhao has become a symbol
of a more tolerant era and for political change. Last seen in
public visiting students in Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989, Zhao
has since lived under house arrest in a walled compound in Beijing.
	   Shi Binhai was detained amid a concerted police sweep against
democracy campaigners trying to set up a political opposition
party.
	   Police in northeastern Changchun city on Sunday released Tang
Yuanjuan, one of at least a dozen dissidents rounded up in the
clampdown. Tang had been held for a little more than two weeks.
	   Shi's 30th day in custody, Monday, is also the day China plans
to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
the U.N. rights treaty that guarantees freedom of expression.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center called Shi's case a test
of whether Chinese leaders intend to respect the covenant. Even
after signing, the treaty will not come into force until ratified
by China's legislature, which may choose to attach reservations,
effectively nullifying some provisions.
	   In an open letter to President Jiang Zemin, six dissidents urged
early ratification of the treaty and called on the government to
release political prisoners and end restrictions on free speech,
the media and forming political parties, the Information Center
said.

Italian Communists vote to yank support for Prodi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES previous; ADDs possible scenarios &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw
support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move
that could trigger the collapse of one of the country's
longest-lived postwar governments.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government, but Prodi
has said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked
support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the
Senate, but counts on them for a majority in the Chamber.
	   A confidence vote could be scheduled in the next few days.
	   If Prodi fails to muster a majority in the chamber, he would be
forced to resign and new elections could be called.
	   Or President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try to
muster a coalition majority, possibly from centrists now in the
opposition and from Communists unhappy with their party leader's
decision.
	   Defying other top Communist Refoundation officials, Fausto
Bertinotti, party secretary, defended his strategy to break away,
saying he was betting that a new government would be more leftist.
	   The Communists' No. 2, Armando Cossutta, had argued against
Bertinotti's plan, insisting it would be better to work with he
government for a 1999 budget that would devote more funds to job
creation and to continue backing the government.
	   A split left, Oliviero Diliberto, the Communist Chamber whip
feared, would only help the center-right opposition, led by
ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has been pressing for early
elections. However, despite his dissent with Bertinotti, Diliberto
said he follow his party leader's decision.
	   Bertinotti's motion garnered 188 votes from the party's national
political committee to 112 for Cossutta's.
	   Prodi's coalition has outlived all but two of Italy's other 54
postwar governments.
	   In the past, political crises in a country known for ``revolving
door'' governments have sometimes taken weeks or months to resolve.
	   But any call for new elections, with their 60-day campaign
period, would have to come almost immediately soon.
	   Elections are avoided in what is known as the ``white semester''
-- the last six months of a presidential term, which would begin
for Scalfaro in January -- because the president is elected by
parliament and any vote for a new head of state would likely be
affected by campaigning for parliamentary seats.

Australia inch closer to first win in Pakistan in four decades
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy
celebrated his world record in style against Pakistan Sunday but
his team will have to wait a day for its near-certain win _ their
first in this country in 39 years.
	   As stumps were drawn on the fourth day of the first cricket Test
at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, Pakistan _ which needed 244 runs to
make Australia bat again _ was hopelessly placed at 137 for nine
with Salim Malik waging a lone battle at 48 and last man Saqlain
Mushtaq unbeaten on 3.
	   The 34-year-old Healy, playing in his 104th Test, broke his
ideal Rodney Marsh's 355-victims record in the second session of
play when he caught Wasim Akram for 15.
	   A brief spell of heavy showers delayed play for nearly two hours
after tea with Pakistan reeling at 111 for seven. But groundsmen
dried up the square quickly and play was extended for an hour.
	   Australia had piled up 513 in its first innings in reply to
Pakistan's 269 runs.
	   Three dismissals in seven deliveries in the first session put
Australia firmly on the road to victory after Pakistan collapsed
dramatically after beginning its second innings Sunday morning.
	   Pakistani skipper Aamir Sohail and Saeed Anwar were off to a
cautious start and put on a watchful 24 runs in the first hour
under the overcast conditions. But once McGrath changed ends and
bowled into the strong breeze, Sohail played on to his stumps after
scoring 13 runs.
	   Damien Fleming then prodded the collapse in his fourth over of
the day, trapping Muhammad Wasim and Inzamamul Haq leg before both
batsmen could begin to score.
	   From 32 for three, Pakistan was further reduced to 32 for four
when Colin Miller got a lucky decision of Saeed Anwar from English
umpire Peter Willey. The left-handed Pakistan opener, who made 145
in the first innings, was struck on the front pad while stretching
a long way forward.
	   Malik got a life shortly before lunch when Mark Waugh dropped
the right-hander in the second slip off McGrath.
	   Pakistan lost five wickets in the second session, when Healy
completed his world record.
	   ``It's the moment I will cherish all through my life,'' he told
reporters later. ``I was on the moon.''
	   The Australian wicketkeeper, who equaled Marsh's record on the
first day of the Test claiming the first two catches, had to wait
for two more days before reaching the milestone.
	   ``It was something like a batsman was on 99 and he had to wait
for 150 odd overs to complete his century,'' Healy said of his two
days waiting for the world mark.
	   Pakistan's has only twice before been beaten by an innings on
home soil, losing by an innings and 156 runs to West Indies in
1958-59 and by an innings and 10 runs to the same team in 1986-87.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO

	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev

	   There was no official confirmation of the surprise meeting and

had learned from ``confidential sources'' that the two ministers
were in Belgrade.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and

	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement again

minute to 12.'' He stressed that ``no ultimatum, no date has been

	   London's Sunday Times reported Britain preparing ground troops
and armored units for Kosovo. The defense ministry refused to
confirm or deny the report but repeated Britain was ready to
participate in a NATO attack.
	   The Yugoslav government said Friday the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels. Serbia is the
larger of two republics that comprise Yugoslavia. Serbian police
and the Yugoslav army has routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels
in a seven-month crackdown. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most
of them Albanian civilians _ and left upward of 275,000 villagers
refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the interim council,

Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a

U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans report Monday to the Security Council
on whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault
on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air
strikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, Serb police took reporters to the site of what they
thought was a mass grave on a mountain top near the village of
Volujak, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Dogs, they said, had unearthed human bones in an
area formerly held by the Albanian separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   With reporters looking on, police dug up parts of four skeletons
and said from the smell that they suspected there were more, but
there was no way to identify the remains or determine their
ethnicity and cause of death without closer forensic investigation.
	   The Serbian media reported that Chinese-made bullet casings were
found and also empty casings of hunting rifles at the site where
the bodies were found, both characteristic for ammunition used by
the KLA.

Oil to flow again from Far Eastern refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Oil will soon begin flowing again from a Russian
refinery that had been idled for 10 days after the railways
insisted on pre-payment for shipping, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Sunday.
	   The East Siberian Railway had refused to ship oil without a cash
payment in advance. However, the refinery in Khabarovsk, about 6100
kilometers (3,800 miles) southeast of Moscow, did not have enough
cash on hand to pay 30-35 million rubles (dlrs 1.8-2.2 million) a
month for the shipments, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Sidanko company, which owns the refinery, has agreed to pay
a 322 million ruble (dlrs 20.7 million) debt to the railway, said
refinery manager Nikolai Shalvin. He said this would be considered
a ``preliminary payment'' for oil shipments and guarantee shipment
of 150,000 metric tons of crude oil to the refinery every month,
ITAR-Tass said.

Police detain 4 suspected Muslim Brotherhood activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police detained four men suspected of
belonging to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood on Sunday and accused
them of attempting to promote the movement.
	   The detentions occurred in the Imbaba neighborhood of Cairo,
police said. Those detained included an engineer, a teacher, a
banker and a university student, they said.
	   The police said the men were not immediately charged.
	   Although officially banned, the Brotherhood was long tolerated
by the government. But the government began a sweeping crackdown in
1995 after accusing the group of supporting Islamic militants.
	   Muslim extremists have waged a campaign of violence since the
spring of 1992 to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government and
install strict Islamic rule.
	   The Brotherhood advocates an Islamic state, but says violence is
not the way to realize it.

Malaysia's Anwar leaves hospital, women protest

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's reformer politician
Anwar Ibrahim left a hospital Sunday after medical check-ups for
injuries he says he sustained in police beatings.
	   Anwar, due for arraignment Monday on five counts of corruption
and five of illegal homosexual acts, was admitted to the
government-owned University Hospital late Saturday, after a court
gave permission.
	   His overnight checkup over, a police motorcade whisked away
Anwar, seated in the back of a jeep with tinted windows.
	   His lawyers said they did not know where he was taken. Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, called it a ``breach of human rights'' that
the lawyers had been denied access to their client.
	   Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was once the heir
apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But as Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of the longruling
Mahathir, he fell out of favor and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge and gives police the power to
prohibit prisoners from seeing their lawyers or families.
	   In two court appearances last week, Anwar pleaded innocent to
the charges and said his black eye and bruises on his neck and arm
came from a police beating the night he was arrested.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. And they forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.
	   Twenty officers shadowed a line of 100 people, walking in a
circle around the capital's central Merdeka Square with Chinese
lanterns.
	   Protest organizer Tian Chua, who had been arrested last week on
allegations of participating in illegal rallies and then released,
stood on an upturned concrete trash bin and briefly addressed the
multiracial crowd while police watched.
	   ``For the past few weeks, there have been too many arrests''
under the Internal Security Act, he said. ``We want justice.''
	   When a police superintendent with a loudspeaker ordered the
group to leave, they broke into two groups and headed to a nearby
outdoor market.
	   Earlier, police forced the dispersal of 300 women, with their
children and some husbands, who had gathered across a highway from
the king's palace singing patriotic songs.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said a Muslim woman in a head
scarf who, like others, said she was afraid to give her name.
	   ``They call this a democracy but they won't even let us gather
and sit on a hillside.''
	   The women left after two hours when riot police trucks and a
water cannon arrived.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.
	   The court granted Anwar's request for further medical attention
after he complained of neck and back pain.
	   Anwar's wife, a retired eye surgeon, said she had been refused a
copy of her husband's medical report.
	   ``My priority is to get justice done,'' she said. ``If this
country is democratic then this will be the test.''
	   University Hospital officials refused Sunday to comment on
Anwar's condition.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court. No deadline has been set.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and finance
minister, Anwar led thousands of people in peaceful protests
against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir has also accused
Anwar of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he
was ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.

Treasury chief hints he wants Britain to lower interest rate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Financial Crisis

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Saying recession is now a bigger threat than
inflation, Britain's Treasury chief, Gordon Brown, hinted Sunday
that British interest rates should come down, but stressed he will
leave the decision to the Bank of England.
	   ``A few days ago the Federal Reserve lowered their interest
rates, Canada lowered their interest rates, the Bank of England
itself has said that the balance of risk has shifted,'' Chancellor
of the Exchequer Brown said.
	   Brown spoke in a British Broadcasting Corp. interview from
Washington where finance ministers and central bank governors from
the world's richest nations, the Group of Seven, discussed the
global financial crisis.
	   They are considering a U.S. proposal to allow the International
Monetary Fund to provide extra money quickly to countries
threatened with a flight of investors.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government yielded authority
to set interest rates to the Bank of England soon after its
election victory in May 1997. The bank has tightened monetary
policy, leading to protests from manufacturers about the high value
of the British pound making exports expensive and too high interest
rates.
	   The Bank of England is due to announce Thursday its latest
decision on interest rates. There is speculation it will cut the
rate from 7.50 percent rate to 7.25 percent.
	   Earlier, in an interview with Britain's GMTV channel, Brown
said, ``But of course the balance of risk has shifted. We've got
low inflation round the world and the Bank of England will make
their decisions in the light of these facts.''

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, while Yugoslav generals
prepared to defend the country.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic controlling Kosovo.
	   Despite Russia's opposition, NATO is preparing for possible
intervention in Serbia's southern province to end seven months of
bloodshed. Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of
religion, and joint Slavic roots.
	   There was no official confirmation of the surprise meeting and
no word of its substance, but news photographers captured the
meeting on film.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement again
expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in Kosovo without
the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a
veto-carrying member.
	   ``Military interference ... would aggravate many times the
confrontation in Kosovo and undermine diplomatic efforts'' to
reestablish peace and dialogue, said the statement.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities indicated they
were ready for compromise by installing an interim government in
the rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that
up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   The West apparently remained unmoved.
	   Speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said Friday that the NATO intervention clock ``is at one
minute to 12.'' He stressed that ``no ultimatum, no date has been
set,'' but added: ``Mr. Milosevic must know that we are serious.''
	   London's Sunday Times reported that Britain was preparing ground
troops and armored units for Kosovo. The defense ministry refused
to confirm or deny the report but repeated Britain was ready to
participate in a NATO attack.
	   The Yugoslav government said Friday the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels. Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian
rebels in a seven-month crackdown. The conflict has killed hundreds
_ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left upward of 275,000
villagers refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the interim council,
drawn up without their consultation with them, and made up of seven
Serbs, five ethnic Albanians, and other minorities.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict.
U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans to report Monday to the Security
Council on whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its
assault on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that
NATO air strikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.

Talks on southern Sudan war canceled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The latest round of talks to seek ways of
ending southern Sudan civil war were canceled because the Sudanese
government declined to send representatives, a rebel official said
Sunday.
	   ``As far as we know, there are not talks tomorrow because
Khartoum is not sending anybody,'' said Justin Atop Yaac, a
spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
	   The talks were scheduled to begin in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi, Monday under the auspices of the regional
Intergovernmental Authority on Development.
	   Arop said the rebels had been informed of the cancellation by
authorities in Kenya, which was to host the talks. Officials in the
foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
	   It was impossible to get a comment from Khartoum, but government
troops and the rebels have been fighting since Sept. 14 in the
southern province of East Eduatoria.
	   Khartoum accuses the rebels of launching an offensive to try and
capture the provincial town of Juba, about 1,200 kilometers (744
miles) south of Khartoum. Rebels say they attacked government
positions because the Sudanese air force was bombing civilian
targets in rebel-held areas.
	   Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan still in government
control.
	   The cancellation of the talks have dashed hopes among aid
agencies and donors that a three-month cease-fire to facilitate aid
program would be extended. The cease-fire expires Oct. 15.
	   Last month, the European Union said it hoped the cease-fire
would not only be extended but also expanded to cover other
provinces where aid, mostly food, is needed.
	   The government says the cease-fire applies to all of the south,
while the rebels insist it is restricted only to Bahr al-Ghazal, a
southwestern province where famine is concentrated.
	   Hunger is a persistent problem in southern Sudan, where the
15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militia burn or steal crops that their enemy or
civilians rely on. About 1.5 million people have died in the
fighting and famines.

Germany's Social Democrats and Greens plan for new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES reference to gas tax, Washington trip; tightens &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new Social Democratic-led
government will repeal cuts in pensions passed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl before they take effect Jan. 1, a party leader said Sunday.
	   In an interview with German radio, parliamentary faction leader
Rudolf Scharping said his party will also ``immediately'' implement
another campaign promise: repealing a 1996 law allowing employers
to cut sick pay by 20 percent.
	   But Germans may still not end up with more money in their
pockets.
	   In a separate interview, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said
he would support a rise in the gasoline tax _ although not as much
as his likely coalition partners, the Greens, would like.
	   Meanwhile, in a sign that Schroeder may have settled on a
foreign minister, Greens party leader Joschka Fischer is to
accompany Schroeder when he visits President Bill Clinton in
Washington on Thursday.
	   In his interview with Bild am Sonntag, Schroeder declined to
comment on personnel questions, other than to repeat that he wanted
union leader Walter Riester as Labor Minister.
	   But he said everything would be wrapped up in time so that he
can be sworn in as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   Cuts in retirement benefits and sick pay were part of the modest
economic reforms pushed through parliament by Kohl, who lost his
bid for a fifth term last month to the Social Democrats.
	   Germany's double-digit unemployment was the main campaign issue,
and in coalition talks that opened Friday, Schroeder and the
ecology-minded Greens party set combating it as their top priority.
	   While no talks were held over the weekend, all sides continued
staking out positions.
	   Industry leaders warned they would leave Schroeder's proposed
roundtable on job creation if unions insist on a shorter work week
or too-high wages.
	   Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the German Chamber of Industry and
Commerce, told Bild am Sonntag that some proposals being considered
by the future center-left government would actually lead to ``a
renewed climb in unemployment.''
	   Those include raising energy taxes, canceling a high-speed train
link between Berlin and Hamburg, and shutting down the country's
nuclear power reactors, he said.
	   Schroeder warned against setting conditions ahead of talks.
	   But asked about Green proposals for a higher gasoline tax,
Schroeder said he would accept an increase of no more than 6
pfennig (4 cents) per liter, not the 30 pfennig (18 cents) some
Greens have demanded.
	   Greens leader Juergen Trittin refused to comment on specifics at
a mini party convention Sunday.
	   But Fischer, considered more of a pragmatist than Trittin, said
it was time to move from old ideals to ``professional
negotiating.''
	   Noting that the Greens actually lost votes this year compared
with the 1994 election, Fischer blamed ``exaggerated'' proposals
like raising the price of gas long-term to 5 marks a liter (dlrs 12
a gallon).
	   ``We almost pushed ourselves over the precipice,'' he said,
calling for party unity as coalition talks progress.
	   Car-crazy Germans also got bad news from the Greens' transport
expert, Gila Altmann. The Koelner Zeitung quoted her as saying that
the new center-left government may support setting a speed limit of
120-130 kph (75-80 mph) on Germany's autobahns.

Dissidents say Clinton administration pledges anti-Saddam funds

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi dissidents said Sunday that Clinton
administration officials have promised to agree to financial aid to
groups trying to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   The dissidents, who had talks with senior U.S. officials in
Washington recently, said the officials informed them the
administration would not oppose a Republican proposal to fund
opposition groups. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The White House in the past has opposed direct aid to the Iraqi
opposition on the grounds it could lead to further U.S.
obligations. The groups themselves also prefer covert assistance
that would not openly identify them as U.S.-backed.
	   Republican congressmen introduced legislation last month to
authorize President Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
opposition groups and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq.
	   The bill has some Democratic support. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, who introduced the Iraq
Liberation Act, said he consulted with the administration in
drawing up the measure.
	   Kurdistan Niwe, published by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
guerrilla group, reported in its Monday edition that the
administration has promised to approve the legislation. A copy of
the paper was sent Sunday to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The paper said the administration informed Massoud Barazani,
leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Patriotic Union
leader Jalal Talabani about its plans on funding opposition groups.
They spoke on condition their names not be used.
	   The two Kurdish leaders, frequent rivals, signed a
reconciliation accord in Washington last month after holding talks
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   The CIA aided Iraqi resistance groups after the 1991 Gulf War,
and Congress earlier approved some humanitarian and political
support for Kurdish and other opposition groups operating outside
Iraq.
	   Iraq condemned the legislation last Wednesday, saying that
Washington will be wasting money and effort if it tried to oust
regime.

 &UR; Pope seeks to heal wounds of war
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a seaside beach packed with pilgrims,
Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left by war and
totalitarian rule and urged the international community to provide
``timely help'' to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outside
this Adriatic coastal city for the final Mass of John Paul's
three-day trip to Croatia. Scores of fishing and pleasure boats
anchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived from
Zagreb.
	   Adding to the numbers _ put at more than 500,000 by Croatia's
HINA news agency _ were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, the smaller
remaining Yugoslav republic. They streamed in when the border
crossing was opened Saturday night for the first time since war
ended in 1995, state-run Croatian television reported.
	   ``Croats are today called to give a new face to their country,
above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of the
ethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and by
the recent violence of war,'' John Paul said.
	   ``It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no true
freedom or democracy.''
	   The frail 78-year-old pope appeared in generally good form, but
his voice was weak by the end of the nearly 3-hour-long Mass. An
aide held up a white umbrella to shield him from the bright sun as
he sat on an altar facing the sea.
	   Reconciliation and the renewal of values were high on the pope's
agenda during his stay. The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a civil
war in 1991 that left over 10,000 dead and thousands missing before
the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the fighting.
	   John Paul said he was following with ``anxious concern the
continuing tragedy'' in the region of Yugoslavia, about 400
kilometers (240 miles) southeast of Croatia.
	   He said, ``mutual respect, forgiveness and reconciliation'' were
needed to stop the violence, and said he hoped the international
community would ``provide its timely help'' to achieve those goals.
	   The pope made no mention of threats by NATO to stage air strikes
if the Serbs continue their aggressio against Albanians.
	   John Paul also spoke of the damage inflicted during the civil
war to several years along Croatia's Dalmatian coast. Dubrovnik,
especially, suffered damage to some of its art and cultural
treasures.
	   ``The eye of man can no longer rejoice in them,'' the pope said
of losses to architectural masterpieces. ``How can we not feel
regret for this?''
	   The big crowd was quiet as the pope delivered his homily, but
applauded when he spoke of Kosovo.
	   ``It is important to look beyond the trauma of the war and the
pope is here to express his wish that we draw strength from our
religion,'' said Anita Bosnic, a university student.
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
	   Orthodox clergymen and a Muslim delegation attended Sunday's
Mass, and the pope greeted them.
	   For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was
Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.

Half million people sing of Arab unity in politicized concert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In the Arab world's biggest sing-along,
at least half a million people joined in chorus with 23 top singers
in a concert more about politics than Arab pop music's usual fare
of love and romance.
	   The show Saturday night in Beirut's main square was a live
version of a video cassette called ``The Arab Dream,'' fittingly so
since its theme _ unity of the Arabs _ is belied by the persistent
ruptures among their leaders.
	   In the video, the plea for Arab unity is accompanied by
emotional old newsreels from the Arabs' long battle with Israel _
Palestinians fleeing their homes at the founding of the Jewish
state in 1948 and Lebanese pulling bodies from wreckage left by
Israeli artillery.
	   Some Gulf satellite outlets say they're getting dozens of
requests to show ``The Arab Dream,'' since the video has been
distributed only to TV stations and many viewers want to tape it.
It's shown several times a day on Beirut stations.
	   Despite its political theme, Saturday's concert had its pop
aspects. Performers from 16 Arab countries included such
heartthrobs as Tunisia's Latifa, Egypt's Anoushka and Kadhem
al-Saher of Iraq.
	   But the show's climax was ``The Arab Dream,'' with each of the
singers doing one stanza, and audience and performers joining in
the refrain about Arab unity.
	   ``The darkness of the night may have separated us. A beam of
light can carry us to the farthest skies. This has always been our
dream, one nation to embrace us all,'' goes the song.
	   ``The Arab Dream'' was written to ``gently prod Arab leaders
through art to ... convene a summit meeting,'' said Rabeh Ayyoub,
spokesman for the organizers of Saturday's concert. The last Arab
summit was in 1990 when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait split the Arab
world into pro- and anti-Iraq camps.
	   Ayyoub said the ``darkness'' in the lyrics refers to ``the
current Arab state of affairs ... the failure to take collective
action after 50 years since the establishment of Israel.''
	   At the concert, there were no old film clips but plenty of
emotion. Beirut radio stations estimated 500,000 to one million
people crowded into or around Martyr's Square. The show started two
hours late after scuffles broke out as police held back the vast
crowds pushing toward the stage.
	   Some in the audience carried placards of late Egyptian president
Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was a symbol of Arab unity. Others shouted
slogans and waved the flags of various Arab nations and the
Palestinians.
	   ``The Arab Dream,'' written by poets Midhat el-Adl of Egypt and
Salem Seif al-Khaledi of the United Arab Emirates, was made into a
video last August. The video and Beirut concert were organized by
Ahmed el-Aryan, an Egyptian-Palestinian who lives in the Emirates.
	   Despite the song's theme of unity, divisions showed up at the
concert.
	   Iraqi singer al-Saher does not appear in the cassette, and some
sources say that's because of fears the popular Kuwait singer Nabil
Shuail would refuse to join in if al-Saher was included.
	   The Iraqi sang Saturday night. Just before the concert, it was
announced the Kuwaiti would not appear.

Peslier, on Sagamix, wins third successive Arc de Triomphe
</HEADLINE>
EDS: ADDS details, updates and quotes throughout &HT;    PARIS (AP) _ French jockey Olivier Peslier, riding Sagamix, won
his third successive Arc de Triomphe on Sunday, after holding off a
persistent challenge by Leggera.

<TEXT>
	   Sagamix, at 2/1, took the lead going in to the final straight
after Happy Valentine had held the lead in the early stages.
	   The colt won by a neck from 11/1-shot Leggera, ridden by Richard
Quinn, which briefly was in first place before Sagamix strode
powerfully to the front 200 meters (yards) from the finish.
	   In the 14-horse race, run over a 2,400-meter (1 1/2 mile) course
at Longchamps, Tiger Hill, at 8/1, came in third.
	   Sagamix, now unbeaten in four races, finished in an unofficial
time of 2 minutes, 34 seconds.
	   It started as favorite after winning the Prix Niel, the main Arc
de Triomphe trial, three weeks ago.
	   Peslier, who tasted glory at the Arc de Triomphe on Helissio
(1996) and Peintre Celebre (1997), has now recorded three straight
wins at Europe's most prestigious race - equalling Pat Eddery's
record hattrick between 1985 and 1987.
	   ``The race started slowly and then my horse accelerated well,''
Peslier said after the race.
	   The win also gives trainer Andre Fabre his fifth win at the Arc.
	   ``The horse was well-prepared for the race by the whole team,''
said Sagamix's owner Jean-Luc Lagardere. ``He showed an absolutely
extraordinary heart. A horse runs with his legs...but can only win
with his heart.''
	   Sagamix's victory rounds off a fine season for Peslier.
	   In June, Peslier won the English Derby, Europe's other showpiece
horse race, on High-Rise, which never challenged strongly in
Sunday's race.

Drugs, Tour de France still Plague World Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - The World Cycling Championships
begin this week with repercussions from the Tour de France still
plaguing the sport both on and off the road.
	   The Tour de France may have ended more than two months ago, yet
the aftermath of the drug scandal still is present with revelations
still coming out. Even this past week, the Festina masseur that
started the scandal when he was picked up with drugs in a team car,
added more details of the team procedures that led to the Festina
team being kicked out of the Tour.
	   The International Cycling Union will hold a congress before the
road events begin on Tuesday. The UCI will have its hands full
dealing with the aftermath of the drug scandal and will look to
implement new procedures to curb doping in its sport.
	   There will be 10 races through Sunday. The top races are the
ones with the elite men and women with the men's road race
finishing the championships Sunday.
	   Yet the Tour de France has taken its toll on the participants in
various ways.
	   Laurent Jalabert of France, last year's time trial champion,
pulled out of the championship citing physical and psychological
fatigue.
	   Jalabert was a leader of a protest of the Tour de France in the
initial days of the drug scandal when the riders refused to start a
stage over the handling of the riders by the media and
organization.
	   The Frenchman was one of the first riders to drop out of the
Tour. He has since described the International Cycling Union as a
``dictatorship'' and its commissioners as ``half Dracula and half
neo-Nazi.'' The UCI threatened to ban Jalabert unless he
apologized.
	   Yet Jalabert said his decision to withdraw had nothing to do
with the ultimatum of UCI president Hein Verbruggen.
	   Last year's road champion, Laurent Brochard of France and the
1996 time trial champion, Alex Zuelle of Switzerland are not
competing after they admitted taking banned substances as members
of the Festina team.
	   The UCI must also deal with the relatively light sentences
handed down by the Swiss Federation.
	   Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier were banned eight months
and fined 3,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 2,164). With the suspensions
effective immediately, the racers will miss only a few of the
important races and could be back racing in the Tour de France next
year.
	   Although the riders confessed to taking drugs, which can be
viewed as a positive drug test in other federations and a longer
ban, UCI rules only a suspension between six months and a year.
	   The UCI will meet to decide whether to accept the ban by the
Swiss Federation or change it.
	   On the road, the world championships will also be missing other
top riders not caught in any drug taking, including the last three
Tour de France winners.
	   Marco Pantani of Italy who had a double victory in the Tour of
Italy and the Tour de France this season, virtually shut down his
season except for a few money-making criteriums.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, second to Pantani and 1997 Tour winner,
dropped out with an Achilles tendon problem while Bjarne Riis of
Denmark, the 1996 Tour winner, also is not competing.
	   With the world men's road title a one-day ride instead of a
grueling multi-stage race, the most prestigious title could go to
people such as Michele Bartoli of Italy or a come-backing Lance
Armstrong of the United States.
	   Armstrong, who won the 1993 world title, is rebounding after a
year off to recuperate from testicular cancer. Just before the
world championships in 1996 he revealed he had it but came back to
cme in fourth in the recent Tour of Spain.
	   The junior women begin the competition with its road race on
Tuesday with the elite women's time trial on Wednesday the first
major race.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey is in a position of self-defense
against Syria and is warning Damascus to stop supporting Kurdish
rebels, President Suleyman Demirel said Sunday.
	   ``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world. This
cannot continue,'' Demirel was quoted as saying by the
semi-official Anatolia news agency.
	   Ankara claims that Turkish Kurdish rebels, who wage cross-border
raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria, are sheltered by Syrian
authorities. Damascus denies the charges.
	   ``We are in a position of self-defense .... The situation is
serious. Turkey has suffered for many years, and it no longer wants
to suffer,'' Demirel said.
	   The war in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy
for the country's large Kurdish minority, has killed more than
37,000 people since 1984.
	   Turkey in the past few days sent about 10,000 soldiers into
northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases there.
	   Ankara has indicated it might send forces into Syria to
eradicate guerrilla bases there.
	   Hurriyet newspaper last week quoted the commander of Turkish
land forces, Gen. Atilla Ates, as saying: ``Our patience has run
out. We are determined to take all necessary measures if we don't
see any response to our goodwill.''
	   On Saturday, reports said Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian border
and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said would soon carry out
military exercises near the Syrian border, private television NTV
reported.
	   But Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was the last resort. ``I
don't believe it will come to that,'' he said.
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
	   In an effort to head off a military conflict, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad
in Damascus.
	   Mubarak was initially expected in Ankara on Monday, but due to a
full schedule in Cairo he may be forced to postpone his visit to
midweek, sources said.
	   Turkish newspaper headlines reflected rising tensions in Turkey.
	   ``Critical Days,'' wrote daily Turkiye, while the daily Aksam
claimed that Turkish forces could reach the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley in Lebanon, where Turkey claims there are rebel camps, in 30
minutes.
	   ``War is coming,'' said Kenan Kalelioglu, an engineer in Ankara.
``If the Syrians continue to support anarchy, Turkey will have to
act. We don't like war, but we are not afraid.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French jockey Olivier Peslier, riding Sagamix, won
his third successive Arc de Triomphe on Sunday, after holding off a
persistent challenge by Leggera.
	   Sagamix, at 2/1, took the lead going in to the final straight
after Happy Valentine had held the lead in the early stages.
	   The colt won by a neck from 11/1-shot Leggera, ridden by Richard
Quinn, which briefly was in first place before Sagamix strode
powerfully to the front 200 meters (yards) from the finish.
	   In the 14-horse race, run over a 2,400-meter (1 1/2 mile) course
at Longchamps, Tiger Hill, at 8/1, came in third.
	   Sagamix, now unbeaten in four races, finished in an unofficial
time of 2 minutes, 34 seconds.
	   It started as favorite after winning the Prix Niel, the main Arc
de Triomphe trial, three weeks ago.
	   Peslier, who tasted glory at the Arc de Triomphe on Helissio
(1996) and Peintre Celebre (1997), has now recorded three straight
wins at Europe's most prestigious race - equalling Pat Eddery's
record hattrick between 1985 and 1987.
	   ``The race started slowly and then my horse accelerated well,''
Peslier said after the race.
	   The win also gives trainer Andre Fabre his fifth win at the Arc.
	   ``The horse was well-prepared for the race by the whole team,''
said Sagamix's owner Jean-Luc Lagardere. ``He showed an absolutely
extraordinary heart. A horse runs with his legs...but can only win
with his heart.''
	   Sagamix's victory rounds off a fine season for Peslier.
	   In June, Peslier won the English Derby, Europe's other showpiece
horse race, on High-Rise, which never challenged strongly in
Sunday's race.

Rios overcomes painful back to beat Agassi in five sets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios overcame back problems and
beat Andre Agassi in five sets Sunday to win the Grand Slam Cup and
grab the richest prize in tennis, dlrs 1.3 million.
	   Rios, who looked like he would quit early in the match, finally
prevailed in two hours, 55 minutes, winning 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1),
5-7, 6-3.
	   Agassi at the end seemed to be worn out by nearly seven hours of
tennis in two days.
	   The American, who is No. 8 in the world, had not met the
qualifying standard but was given a wild card in an attempt to give
some luster to the men's field, which lacked No. 1 Pete Sampras and
No. 2 Pete Rafter.
	   Agassi had to settle for the runner-up prize of dlrs 650,000.
	   The dlrs 6.7 million tournament nominally brings together
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three of the men's Grand Slam champions elected not to show
up.
	   Rios, the highest-ranked player in he event at No. 3, was in
pain early in the match. He was given a massage by a trainer after
the third game, then dropped his serve on a double-fault in the
fifth.
	   This time, he took an injury time-out and was stretched on the
floor for a couple of minutes while the trainer worked on his back.
Rios also took some painkillers.
	   Back in the match, Rios immediately broke Agassi to level the
score. In the next game, he hit two aces in holding serve at love.
	   Rios broke Agassi's serve to win the set, hitting a spectacular
running backhand passing shot on his second set point.
	   Double-faults by Rios on game points in the first and seventh
allowed Agassi to serve for the second set. He wasted one set point
with a double-fault of his own, but hit a forehand winner to the
corner on the next.
	   Although he lost the set, Rios produced one of its highlights:
winning a point while sitting on the floor after slipping and
falling on the hard-court surface.
	   Rios was devastating on his serve in the third set, winning five
of six games at love, although he used several changeovers to
stretch and get more massage.
	   Wincing with pain nearly every time he made a shot, the Chilean
still used the full range of his extraordinary talent to baffle
Agassi.
	   Agassi saved two set points to hold serve for 5-5 and the set
went into a tiebreaker. Rios raced to a 6-1 lead and won the set
when Agassi hit a backhand long.
	   But Rios was not so error-free in the next set and twice had two
stave off break points.
	   He fell into a 0-40 hole while serving to stay in the set,
hitting a weak volley straight at Agassi that the American turned
into a passing shot winner.
	   Rios saved one set point with an ace, but then hit a backhand
into the net off a powerful return by Agassi.
	   Agassi fell a break down in the fifth, only to break right back.
The Chilean then broke Agassi's serve again to go up 3-2.
	   Serving to save the match, Agassi produced a double-fault to
give Rios three match points. Agassi saved one, but then committed
another double-fault to surrender.
	   Agassi needed three hours, 40 minutes to beat Karol Kucera in
the semifinals. Rios beat Mark Philippoussis in three quick sets.

Indian government wants death sentence for rapists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ Hemmed in by increasing protests over the
rape of four Catholic nuns in a village convent, India's interior
minister announced Sunday the government would consider legislating
the death sentence for rapists.
	   Lal Krishna Advani told United News of India that the federal
government would consult the legislatures of India's 31 states and
federally administered territories before making the required
changes in criminal laws.
	   ``There is a feeling of public outrage whenever a woman is
raped, and the minister is articulating his views to gauge public
opinion,'' Home Secretary B.P. Singh told The Associated Press.
	   Singh said the changes in rape laws had been part of regular
discussions between federal and provincial officials.
	   Touring the central state of Madhya Pradesh _ where the alleged
rapes took place _ Advani said declining moral values led to the
rape of a 90-year-old woman and a four-year-old girl in two recent
incidents.
	   Advani, considered a hard-liner in his Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, has ordered officials to ensure the guilty
were punished immediately, newspapers reported.
	   ``The rape of the nuns was such and outrageous and heinous
incident _ it has given further support to the idea that rapists
should die,'' the home secretary said.
	   Thousands of Indian Catholics and members of women's groups
staged street protests most of last week demanding that federal
investigators probe the alleged rapes.
	   Intruders brandishing swords and canes allegedly dragged four
nuns to a farm field and raped them in Nawapada village, police and
Christian groups said.
	   The maximum punishment under Indian law for rape is 10 years
hard labor in jail, which is not a sufficient deterrent, Advani had
told Parliament during a debate in July on rising crime against
women.
	   Indian laws currently provide for capital punishment only in
cases of murder and drug trafficking.
	   Few women in India complain to the police about rape, fearing
loss of face in society and lack of confidentiality.
	   Women's groups have also demanded changes in laws so that
victims do not have to undergo humiliating cross-examination.

From being a sentimental favorite, in form Armstrong is now real

contender &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cycling-World Championships. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Two weeks ago, American Lance
Armstrong was a sentimental favorite to win the World Cycling
Championships' top event, the elite men's road race. But after
landing fourth place in the recent Tour of Spain, he's suddenly a
genuine title contender.
	   ``The people who did well at the Tour of Spain are in race
condition for the World,'' Armstrong said. ``I will be in good race
condition,'' for Sunday's 258-kilometer (162-mile) road race.
	   ``I think my condition is better than ever before.''
	   Armstrong won the road racing world title in 1993 but then saw
his career _ and his life _ threatened by testicular cancer that
spread to his brain and lungs. Chemotherapy has now driven the
disease into remission, allowing the resilient 27-year-old Texan to
restart his career.
	   His challenge for the world title is helped by a long list of
absentees from the championships, which start Tuesday and climax
Sunday with the road race on the hilly roads in and around this
southern Dutch town.
	   Reigning road champion Laurent Brochard of France is not racing
after admitting taking banned substances as members of the
disgraced Festina team. Missing for the same reason is 1996 time
trial champion Alex Zuelle of Switzerland.
	   Also out of the running are reigning Tour de France titlist
Marco Pantani of Italy, 1997 Tour winner Jan Ullrich of Germany and
Bjarne Riis of Denmark, who won the tour in 1996.
	   Bobby Julich, third this year in the Tour also announced this
week he was dropping out because he was unfit after a grueling
season. And Frenchman Laurnet Jalabert, last year's time trial
champion, is out following a dispute with cycling's world governing
body.
	   Armstrong picked Italy's Michele Bartoli and Denmark's Rolf
Sorensen as possible winners, but admitted he also considers
himself a contender on a course which he believes favors him.
	   ``It is very much a classic course,'' Armstrong said. ``Very
difficult, long and (with) short, steep climbs. I have heard it
described as a puncher's course. The course suits me very well.''

Dissidents say Clinton administration pledges anti-Saddam funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi dissidents said Sunday that Clinton
administration officials have promised to agree to provide
financial aid to groups trying to oust Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
	   The dissidents, who had talks with senior U.S. officials in
Washington recently, said the officials informed them the
administration would not oppose a Republican proposal to fund
opposition groups. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The White House in the past has opposed direct aid to the Iraqi
opposition on the grounds it could lead to further U.S.
obligations. The groups themselves also prefer covert assistance
that would not openly identify them as U.S.-backed.
	   Republican congressmen introduced legislation last month to
authorize President Bill Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
opposition groups and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq.
	   The bill has some from Clinton's Democrat Party. Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, the Republican who introduced the Iraq
Liberation Act, said he consulted with the administration in
drawing up the measure.
	   Kurdistan Niwe, published by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
guerrilla group, reported in its Monday edition that the
administration has promised to approve the legislation. A copy of
the paper was sent Sunday to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   The paper said the administration informed Massoud Barazani,
leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Patriotic Union
leader Jalal Talabani about its plans for funding opposition
groups.
	   The two Kurdish leaders, frequent rivals, signed a
reconciliation accord in Washington last month after holding talks
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   The CIA aided Iraqi resistance groups after the 1991 Gulf War,
and Congress earlier approved some humanitarian and political
support for Kurdish and other opposition groups operating outside
Iraq.
	   Iraq condemned the legislation last Wednesday, saying that
Washington will be wasting money and effort if it tried to oust
regime.

Talks on southern Sudan war canceled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The latest round of talks to seek ways of
ending the civil war in southern Sudan have been canceled because
the Sudanese government declined to send representatives, a rebel
official said Sunday.
	   The talks were scheduled to begin in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi, Monday under the auspices of the regional
Intergovernmental Authority on Development.
	   ``As far as we know, there are not talks tomorrow because
Khartoum is not sending anybody,'' said Justin Atop Yaac, a
spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
	   Arop said the rebels had been informed of the cancellation by
authorities in Kenya, which was to host the talks. Officials in the
foreign ministry could not be reached for comment. Comment from
Khartoum was unavailable.
	   Government troops and the rebels have been fighting since Sept.
14 in the southern province of East Eduatoria.
	   Sudan's government accuses the rebels of launching an offensive
to try and capture the provincial town of Juba, about 1,200
kilometers (744 miles) south of Khartoum. Rebels say they attacked
government positions because the Sudanese air force was bombing
civilian targets in rebel-held areas.
	   Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan still in government
control.
	   The cancellation of the talks have dashed hopes among aid
agencies and donors that a three-month cease-fire to facilitate aid
program would be extended. The cease-fire expires Oct. 15.
	   Last month, the European Union said it hoped the cease-fire
would not only be extended but also expanded to cover other
provinces where aid, mostly food, is needed.
	   The government says the cease-fire applies to all of the south,
while the rebels insist it is restricted only to Bahr al-Ghazal, a
southwestern province where famine is concentrated.
	   The 15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militia burn or steal crops that the enemy relies
on. About 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and famines.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new Social Democratic-led
government will repeal cuts in pensions passed by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl before they take effect Jan. 1, a party leader said Sunday.
	   In an interview with German radio, parliamentary faction leader
Rudolf Scharping said his party will also ``immediately'' implement
another campaign promise: repealing a 1996 law allowing employers
to cut sick pay by 20 percent.
	   But Germans may still not end up with more money in their
pockets.
	   In a separate interview, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said
he would support a rise in the gasoline tax _ although not as much
as his likely coalition partners, the Greens, would like.
	   Meanwhile, in a sign that Schroeder may have settled on a
foreign minister, Greens party leader Joschka Fischer is to
accompany Schroeder when he visits President Bill Clinton in
Washington on Thursday.
	   Greens leaders said Sunday they would demand four government
posts in all _ with women named to at least two of them.

Malaysia wins 1st match of 10-nation ACC cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Malaysia defeated the tiny Indian Ocean
island of Maldives on better run rate on a soggy ground Sunday
after their one-day match in the Asian Cricket Council tournament
was abandoned midway due to rain.
	   A second match between Thailand and Nepal was washed out due to
the rain. Both teams gained a point each.
	   Malaysia scored 156 runs for 9 wickets in 43.4 overs, with Rohan
Selvaratnam scoring 37 runs in 56 balls in the rain-marred match
reduced from 50 to 45 overs in Katmandu, the capital of this
Himalayan kingdom. Selvaratnam was run out on a throw by Ali Nihad.
	   Maldives' Ibrahim Hussain, who clean bowled three Malaysian
batsmen _ Mathew Williams, Captain Menon and M Muniandy _ was
declared man of the match. Hussain's team-mate Mohammad Shahid also
took three wickets.
	   After losing its first wicket at three runs, Maldives lost
wickets at regular intervals and was at 69 for four after 26 overs,
when officials decided to stop play saying the outfield was too
wet.
	   Malaysian captain Ramesh Menon, who was out for four runs in his
innings, took three wickets.
	   Malaysia took two points from the game and leads the other nine
teams in the tournament _ Bangladesh, Thailand, Papua New Guinea,
the Maldives, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan and
hosts Nepal.
	   On Saturday, all four matches were canceled due to rain and all
the eight teams awarded one points each. The final of the 10-nation
ACC trophy is scheduled for Oct. 13.

Rios overcomes painful back to beat Agassi in five sets

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios overcame back problems and
beat Andre Agassi in five sets Sunday to win the Grand Slam Cup and
grab the richest prize in tennis, dlrs 1.3 million.
	   Rios, who looked like he would quit early in the match, finally
prevailed in two hours, 55 minutes, winning 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1),
5-7, 6-3.
	   ``I was going to retire, but the the trainer told me to give it
one more chance,'' Rios said.
	   ``Even if I was not feeling good, I played one of my best
matches,'' Rios said. ``I'm really proud I can win a match.''
	   Agassi at the end seemed to be worn out by nearly seven hours of
tennis in two days.
	   The American, who is No. 8 in the world, had not met the
qualifying standard but was given a wild card in an attempt to give
some luster to the men's field, which lacked No. 1 Pete Sampras and
No. 2 Patrick Rafter.
	   Agassi had to settle for the runner-up prize of dlrs 650,000.
	   The dlrs 6.7 million tournament nominally brings together
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three of the men's Grand Slam champions elected not to show
up for the richest event in tennis, which awards to ranking points.
	   Asked what he would do with his share of the cash, Rios said,
``put it in the bank.''
	   ``I'm not the type of guy who buys houses or cars,'' he said.
	   Rios said he thought twice of quitting. ``But once you are in
the match, you're winning, you see all the crowd, you are just
going to do your best.''
	   The Chilean said his back started hurting the night before the
match. ``But you don't want to go home without a final like this,
playing Andre,'' Rios said.
	   Rios, the highest-ranked player in the event at No. 3, was in
pain early in the match. He was given a massage by a trainer after
the third game, then dropped his serve on a double-fault in the
fifth.
	   This time, he took an injury time-out and was stretched on the
floor for a couple of minutes while the trainer worked on his back.
Rios also took some painkillers.
	   Back in the match, Rios immediately broke Agassi to level the
score. In the next game, he hit two aces in holding serve at love.
	   Rios broke Agassi's serve to win the set, hitting a spectacular
running backhand passing shot on his second set point.
	   Double-faults by Rios on game points in the first and seventh
allowed Agassi to serve for the second set. He wasted one set point
with a double-fault of his own, but hit a forehand winner to the
corner on the next.
	   Although he lost the set, Rios produced one of its highlights:
winning a point while sitting on the floor after slipping and
falling on the hard-court surface.
	   Rios was devastating on his serve in the third set, winning five
of six games at love, although he used several changeovers to
stretch and get more massage.
	   Wincing with pain nearly every time he made a shot, the Chilean
still used the full range of his extraordinary talent to baffle
Agassi.
	   Agassi saved two set points to hold serve for 5-5 and the set
went into a tiebreaker. Rios raced to a 6-1 lead and won the set
when Agassi hit a backhand long.
	   But Rios was not so error-free in the next set and twice had two
stave off break points.
	   He fell into a 0-40 hole while serving to stay in the set,
hitting a weak volley straight at Agassi that the American turned
into a passing shot winner.
	   Rios saved one set point with an ace, but then hit a backhand
into the net off a powerful return by Agassi.
	   Agassi fell a break down in the fifth, only to break right back.
The Chilean then broke Agassi's serve again to go up 3-2.
	   Serving to save the match, Agassi produced a double-fault to
give Rios three match points. Agassi saved one, but then committed
another double-fault to surrender.
	   Agassi needed three hours, 40 minutes to beat Karol Kucera in
the semifinals. Rios beat Mark Philippoussis in three quick sets.

Turin investigators probe any links to bin-Laden group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Investigators Sunday were trying to
determine if one of three men arrested here has links to Osama bin
Laden, the suspected mastermind of the U.S. embassy bombings in
Africa, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   Earlier Sunday, RAI state radio reported that police were
seeking to learn if the trio, arrested a few days ago in this
northern city, might have been planning a terrorist attack here or
abroad.
	   Seized by police in a warehouse rented by the three were pistols
equipped with silenzers, an Uzi machine gun, ammunition, wigs,
radio transmitters and gold ingots, ANSA said.
	   Police first said that all three were Egyptian, but ANSA later
reported that investigators suspected that one of three might be
Yemenite, possibly a member of the Islamic Jihad terrorist group or
have links with bin Laden, who is a Saudi exile who from
Afghanistan allegedly runs al-Qaeda, a radical Islamic network
accused of orchestrating the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last
August.
	   ANSA quoted investigators as saying that one of the men, an
Egyptian, had received several calls from London that had been
intercepted by Scotland Yard. The calls apparently came from a
suspected hideout in London linked to the embassy bombings, the
news report said.
	   A hearing for the men, being temporarily held on weapons
possession charges, was scheduled for Monday.
	   The head of Turin's anti-terrorism police squad, Antonio De
Santis, indicated the probe could widen, refusing to rule out
further arrests.

Pope seeks to heal wounds of war

<TEXT>
	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a beach packed with pilgrims, Pope John
Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left by war and
totalitarian rule and urged the international community to provide
``timely help'' to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outside
this Adriatic coastal city for the final Mass of John Paul's
three-day trip to Croatia. Scores of fishing and pleasure boats
anchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived from
Zagreb.
	   Adding to the numbers _ put at more than 500,000 by Croatia's
HINA news agency _ were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, the smaller
remaining Yugoslav republic. They streamed in when the border
crossing was opened Saturday night for the first time since war
ended in 1995, state-run Croatian television reported.
	   ``Croats are today called to give a new face to their country,
above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of the
ethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and by
the recent violence of war,'' John Paul said.
	   ``It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no true
freedom or democracy.''
	   The frail 78-year-old pope appeared in generally good form, but
his voice was weak by the end of the nearly 3-hour-long Mass. An
aide held up a white umbrella to shield him from the bright sun as
he sat on an altar facing the sea.
	   Reconciliation and the renewal of values were high on the pope's
agenda during his stay. The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a civil
war in 1991 that left over 10,000 dead and thousands missing before
the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the fighting.
	   John Paul said he was following with ``anxious concern the
continuing tragedy'' in the region of Yugoslavia, about 400
kilometers (240 miles) southeast of Croatia.
	   He said, ``mutual respect, forgiveness and reconciliation'' were
needed to stop the violence, and said he hoped the international
community would ``provide its timely help'' to achieve those goals.
	   The pope made no mention of threats by NATO to stage air strikes
if the Serbs continue their aggression against Albanians.
	   John Paul also spoke of the damage inflicted during the civil
war along Croatia's Dalmatian coast. Dubrovnik, especially,
suffered damage to some of its art and cultural treasures.
	   ``The eye of man can no longer rejoice in them,'' the pope said
of losses to architectural masterpieces. ``How can we not feel
regret for this?''
	   The big crowd was quiet as the pope delivered his homily, but
applauded when he spoke of Kosovo.
	   ``It is important to look beyond the trauma of the war and the
pope is here to express his wish that we draw strength from our
religion,'' said Anita Bosnic, a university student.
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican sees the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
	   Orthodox clergymen and a Muslim delegation attended Sunday's
Mass, and the pope greeted them.
	   For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was
Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Brazil's Gustavo
Kuerten won the dlrs 475,000 Mallorca Open tennis tournament
Sunday, beating the favorite Carlos Moya of Spain in three sets.
	   World No. 5 Moya took the first set 7-6, before losing the next
two sets to the Brazilian 6-2, 6-3.
	   The two hours and four minute match disappointed the crowd
packed into the local bullfighting ring on this Mediterranean
island for whom Moya is a local hero.
	   The Kuerten-Moya final was billed as duel between two Roland
Garros champions, the Brazilian from 1997 and the Spaniard this
year's winner.
	   In the tournament's doubles finals, Pablo Albano and Daniel
Orsanic of Argentina was due to face Jiri Novak and David Riki of
the Czech Republic.

Opposition leader says South Africa invaded because of water
</HEADLINE>
project &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ An opposition leader accused South Africa
on Sunday of having invaded Lesotho to control a hydroelectric
project, not to quell a military mutiny as the neighboring country
has claimed.
	   South African troops acting on behalf of the Southern African
Development Community arrived in this impoverished kingdom on Sept.
22 and immediately engaged in combat with Lesotho soldiers _ both
mutineers and loyalists who thought they were being invaded.
	   Basotho National Party leader Thesele Maseribane said South
Africa's intervention was aimed at controlling the Highlands Water
Project, which is intended to provide Lesotho with electrical power
and South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, with water.
	   At least 16 Lesotho soldiers were killed in firefights with
South African troops at Katse dam, which forms part of the
hydroelectric project and is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) outside
the capital.
	   Maseribane appealed to all political leaders to ensure that
royalties from the water project are paid to Lesotho, and used for
reconstruction of Maseru and other areas which were devastated in
an arson and looting spree that erupted during the military
intervention, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Maseribane made the accusation during the funeral of a
15-year-old BNP youth, Molahli Mokenele, who was killed when South
African troops stormed King Letsie III's palace on Sept. 22 to
remove opposition protesters.
	   The South African army, meanwhile, announced that one of its
soldiers was found dead with three bullet wounds in the back near a
military base outside Maseru. Authorities were investigating how
the soldier was killed.
	   The discovery on Saturday brings to 10 the number of South
African soldiers killed in the intervention, said Lt. Col. Laverne
Machine.
	   SADC-brokered talks on new elections for Lesotho were scheduled
to continue on Monday.
	   Opposition and ruling party officials tentatively agreed Friday
during the first day of talks that Lesotho would hold new elections
in 15 to 18 months. Opposition parties claim the previous elections
in May, which the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy won by a
landslide, were rigged.
	   Monday's meeting was to focus on who would govern Lesotho in the
period leading up to the new elections.

	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Police placed a leading democratic
politician under protection Sunday following the slaying of a
popular government minister seen as a compromise candidate to end
Mongolia's protracted political crisis.
	   Friday's slaying of Infrastructure Minister Sanjaasuregiin Zorig
shocked the capital, Ulan Bator, which has been locked in a
four-month standoff between the governing Democratic Coalition and
a resurgent opposition comprised largely of former communists.
	   About 4,000 people turned out in near-freezing temperatures for
the second night in a row Sunday on the square outside Government
House. As Buddhist lamas chanted prayers over a loud speaker,
mourners placed lit candles in Zorig's memory on the parliament's
wall and walked around the square three times as is the tradition
for holy processions.
	   Although police have not released a motive for Zorig's death,
people at the first vigil Saturday night called it a political
killing.

Iranian parliament speaker heads for Italy, Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's powerful parliament speaker left
Sunday for talks in Italy and Spain, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri told reporters at the airport that the
purpose of his week-long trip is to discuss political issues and to
expand trade relations between Tehran and the two countries.
	   Nateq-Nouri, a leading hard-liner in the Iranian government,
will meet with a number of senior officials including Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi. In Spain he will meet with Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and King Juan Carlos.
	   Nateq-Nouri's trip follows an announcement by the Iranian
government distancing itself from the death edict on British author
Salman Rushdie and the dlrs 2.5 million bounty placed on his head
in 1989 by a semi-official Iranian foundation.
	   The announcement last month by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
angered hard-liners.
	   Nateq-Nouri has not publicly commented on the government's
position but 150 members of the hard-line parliament he heads said
Sunday the death edict was irrevocable, Iranian television
reported.
	   ``As Majlis deputies, we assure Muslims all over the world that,
in this case, nothing except the decrees issued by God and
(Khomeini) in Iran have any credibility and no one has the power to
follow any other path,'' said the letter, the television reported.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian leader, said that
Rushdie must die for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
	   The Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union.
Moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in
elections in 1997, has been trying to improve ties with the West
since he took office.
	   Tehran also wants to increase trade with Italy, its fourth
biggest trading partner. Trade between the two countries totaled
dlrs 2.3 billion last year.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In the Arab world's biggest sing-along,
at least half a million people joined in chorus with 23 top singers
in a concert more about politics than Arab pop music's usual fare
of love and romance.
	   The show Saturday night in Beirut's main square was a live
version of a popular music video called ``The Arab Dream,'' which
is a plea for unity in the divided Arab world.
	   In the video, the song is accompanied by old newsreels from the
Arabs' long battle with Israel: Palestinians fleeing their homes at
the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 and, more recently,
Lebanese pulling bodies from wreckage left by Israeli artillery.
	   The video has been distributed only to TV stations, and some
Gulf satellite outlets say they're getting dozens of requests to
broadcast ``The Arab Dream'' from viewers who want to tape it. It
appears several times a day on Beirut stations.
	   Performers at Saturday's concert hailed from 16 Arab countries
and included such heartthrobs as Tunisia's Latifa, Egypt's Anoushka
and Kadhem al-Saher of Iraq.
	   At the climax of the concert, each of the singers sang a stanza
of ``The Arab Dream,'' and audience and performers joined in the
refrain about Arab unity.
	   ``The darkness of the night may have separated us. A beam of
light can carry us to the farthest skies. This has always been our
dream, one nation to embrace us all,'' goes the song.
	   ``The Arab Dream'' was written to ``gently prod Arab leaders
through art to ... convene a summit meeting,'' said Rabeh Ayyoub,
spokesman for the organizers of Saturday's concert. The last Arab
summit was in 1990 when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait split the Arab
world into pro- and anti-Iraq camps.
	   Ayyoub said the ``darkness'' in the lyrics refers to ``the
current Arab state of affairs ... the failure to take collective
action after 50 years since the establishment of Israel.''
	   Beirut radio stations estimated 500,000 to one million people
crowded into or around Martyr's Square for the concert. The show
started two hours late after scuffles broke out as police held back
the vast crowds pushing toward the stage.
	   Some in the audience carried placards of late Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser, a symbol of Arab unity. Others shouted slogans
and waved the flags of various Arab nations and the Palestinians.
	   ``The Arab Dream'' was written by poets Midhat el-Adl of Egypt
and Salem Seif al-Khaledi of the United Arab Emirates. The video,
produced in August, and the Beirut concert were organized by Ahmed
el-Aryan, an Egyptian-Palestinian who lives in the Emirates.
	   Despite the song's theme of unity, divisions showed up at the
concert.
	   Iraqi singer al-Saher does not appear in the video _ apparently
because of fears that popular Kuwait singer Nabil Shuail would
refuse to join in if al-Saher was included.
	   The Iraqi sang Saturday night. Just before the concert, it was
announced the Kuwaiti would not appear.

Edmundo keeps Fiorentina winning streak alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta had a quiet day, but another of
Fiorentina's many weapons hit the target Sunday to keep the club
alone atop the Italian League.
	   Brazilian striker Edmundo scored his first goal of the Serie A
season off a nice exchange with Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa in
the third minute of injury time to lift Fiorentina past Udinese 1-0
for its fourth win in as many games.
	   Batistuta, an Argentine, and Udinese's Marcio Amoroso, a
Brazilian, entered the day tied for the league lead with five goals
apiece, but both were held in check.
	   Fiorentina, enjoying its first stay in first place since 1982,
has 12 points, two more than Internazionale of Milan (3-1-0), which
continues to thrive despite the lengthy absences of superstar
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile's Ivan Zamorano and France's Youri Djorkaeff did the
damage Sunday in a 2-0 win over pesky Perugia 2-0.
	   Zamorano scored with a 12-meter (yard) shot 11 minutes into the
game, and Djorkaeff, a member of the World Cup champions, capped a
superb individual outing with an insurance goal off a short-range
header in the 54th.
	   German striker Oliver Bierhoff headed home his fifth goal of the
season just three minutes into AC Milan's 2-0 road win against
Venezia.
	   Milan, coming off back-to-back poor seasons, has nine points and
shares third place with Juventus of Turin. The two-time defending
champions rebounded from last week's loss to AC Parma by edging
Piacenza 1-0 on Filippo Inzaghi's early goal.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome finally
recorded its first win of the season, 2-0 over 10-man Cagliari; AC
Parma was shut out for the third time and drew 0-0 at Bologna;
Vicenza beat Bari 1-0; and Salernitana and Empoli drew 1-1.
Sampdoria of Genoa hosted AS Roma in the night match.
	   The fifth round of games will be in two weeks, because Italy's
national team plays a Euro 2000 qualifier against Switzerland next
Saturday.

	   TOURS, France (AP) _ Jacky Durand of France clinched the
Paris-Tours World Cup cycling race on Sunday after a winning a
sprint finish against Italian Mirco Gualdi.
	   Durand, who races for the Casino team, collects 100 World Cup
points for winning the 254 kilometer (141 mile) race from Paris to
Tours.
	   Gualdi, who rides for the Polti team, picks up 75 points.
	   In wet conditions, the two riders broke away from the pack two
kilometers from the end, and Durand powered away to become the
first French winner of the Paris-Tours race since Albert Bouvet's
victory in 1956.
	   Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu, Durand's team mate, came third, 30
second behind the winner, ahead of Italians Stefano Zanini in
fourth and Nicola Minali in fifth.
	   Michele Bartoli, of the Asics team, could have regained his
World Cup title with a good finish on Sunday but didn't figure
among the leaders.

Flight plan of ill-fated Ugandan airplane tampered with
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The flight plan filed by a Ugandan pilot
of an airplane which crashed en route to eastern Congo was altered,
apparently to conceal its real destination, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   The destination of the plane was erased and the town of Kasese,
390 kilometers (245 miles) west of Kampala, on the foothills of the
Rwenzori Mountains, inserted, Sunday Vision reported.
	   It quoted a sister of one of the passengers as saying the group
was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo en route to
Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by Congolese
rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Military officials earlier gave similar information and said the
plane had been spotted over Kasese but never landed.
	   The state-owned newspaper said three of the passengers had
business links with Kenya, Uganda and Congolese towns of Bunia and
Kisangani.
	   The Civil Aviation of Authority in Uganda did no receive any
signal from the pilot, but was informed from Kasese the airplane
had taken off, Sunday Vision said.
	   The twin-engine Islander, with 10 passengers, including a senior
military official, crash-landed Sept. 25 near Kisomoro, about 60
kilometers (38 miles) north of Kasese, and it appeared that the
disoriented survivors split into two groups to try to find their
way out of the remote area.
	   Uganda's army located five survivors Thursday and Friday. The
pilot was killed.
	   Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze, a brother of acting Chief of Staff James
Kazini, who had been on the plane, was among the four passengers
missing.
	   The passengers included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese and
several Ugandans.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Protesters took up Communist flags and banners for
the second day Sunday to mark the bloody fighting between
opposition lawmakers and government troops that broke out in Moscow
five years ago.
	   Bearing pictures of some of the estimated 200 people who were
killed during the clashes on Oct. 3-4, 1993, about 3,000 people
gathered at Smolenskaya Square in downtown Moscow to demand the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin and honor the dead.
	   Protest organizers had predicted that more than ten times that
number would turn out for the protest.
	   ``For seven years we have had barbarians, betrayers and
marauders in power,'' thundered Gennady Zyuganov, leader of
Russia's Communist Party. ``Today comes the time of reckoning for
the final results of this incompetent policy.''
	   Gen. Albert Makashov, one of the hard-liners at the center of
the October 1993 troubles, called for Yeltsin and his reform team
to pay for the pain they'd allegedly caused the Russian people.
	   ``Yeltsin should be turned into soap,'' he said, adding that the
other reformers should be led to the medieval site of executions on
Moscow's Red Square for judgment and punishment.
	   The protesters marched from the square to the main Russian
government building, the White House, to continue their protest.
	   Viktor Anpilov, head of the radical Russian Labor movement,
delivered an equally blunt message at a Sunday meeting of the Fifth
Congress of Officers of the USSR.
	   ``Any politician who seeks to preserve the presidency is the
enemy of the people,'' he said. ``And what should the officers do
with the enemies of the people?''
	   ``Shoot them!,'' the crowd of about 300 hollered back.
	   The 1993 skirmishes were sparked when Yeltsin decided to
dissolve the conservative, Soviet-era parliament.
	   Hard-line lawmakers refused to disband and barricaded themselves
inside the White House. The standoff erupted into violence when an
angry mob of supporters broke through police lines from the White
House into the neighboring building housing the Moscow mayor's
office. Armed hard-liners later attempted to storm the Ostankino
television broadcasting center.
	   The next day, Yeltsin called in troops and tanks that shelled
parliament and forced his foes to surrender.
	   The weekend rallies were precursors to what are predicted to be
much larger, country-wide protests on Wednesday, organized by
Russia's trade unions and the Communists.
	   The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
expressed concern Sunday that the protests this week would bring
bloodshed.
	   ``When people take to the streets, there are always those who
can provoke disturbances,'' Alexy said, according to the Interfax
news agency. He said that the Church, which had initiated
negotiations between the opposed camps in 1993, would continue to
be ``a conciliatory force in society.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to meet daily
until the summit
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ As new stone-throwing clashes broke out
Sunday in the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinians both said the
other side held the key to an Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   Security was tight in advance of a Jewish holiday beginning at
sundown Sunday, and the Palestinian lands remained sealed off.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to arrive
Tuesday for talks in advance of a hoped-for summit in Washington
later this month, and both sides have been busy staking out
positions in advance of her visit.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly accused
the Palestinians of not doing enough to crack down on Islamic
militants, said Israel's security was his paramount concern.
	   ``Israel has shown its willingness to go the distance,'' he told
reporters at a ceremony to usher in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
``Now it's up to the Palestinians to show their willingness to
carry out their part.''
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said it is working to
contain militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts
cannot provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks.
	   Two days before Albright's scheduled arrival, Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes for a speedy accord, but
said any movement must come from the Israeli side.
	   ``She has one yes in her pocket; that is Arafat's yes,'' Erekat
said of Albright. ``In order to reach an agreement she needs a
second yes, and that is Mr. Netanyahu's.''
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored initiative on an Israeli troop pullback, but
Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns.
	   Erekat spoke to reporters during a break in talks with Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh. The two were mainly discussing
secondary issues, including the so-called safe passage that would
permit Palestinian travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
the status of Palestinian prisoners.
	   In an intensified effort to resolve those issues, Erekat said he
would meet daily with Naveh until the mid-October summit in
Washington. He said that Albright is likely to participate in some
of those meetings during her visit. American officials participated
in the meeting between Erekat and Naveh.

ROME: next Saturday.

	   At Florence, Rui Costa provided the pass and Edmundo the strike
at the end of a swift counterattack in the game's dying seconds.
The difference between this Fiorentina and that of recent years is
that Batistuta now gets consistent support from his teammates, both
in attack and on defense.
	   Fifth-place Udinese (2-1-1) nearly pulled off the upset, though,
when midfielder Jonathan Bachini's shot in the 52nd minute hit the
base of the post with Fiorentina 'keeper Francesco Toldo out of
position.
 &UR; Inter 2, Perugia 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Djorkaeff was brilliant, providing the playmaking and
leadership that some thought Inter would lack with the veteran
Baggio and Brazil's Ronaldo sidelined by knee injuries. Djorkaeff,
whose goal late in second-half injury time Wednesday gave Inter a
1-0 Champions League win over Austria's Sturm Graz, was quick to
get his head on the rebound after Perugia 'keeper Marco Roccati
failed to hold winger Francesco Moriero's 30-meter (yard) blast.
	   Inter also produced its top defensive effort of the season,
caging in dangerous Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata (three
goals in four games). Perugia fell to 0-2-2.
 &UR; Milan 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Brazil's Leonardo provided the corner kick for
Bierhoff's early goal and then sent a 7-meter (yard) shot into the
low corner to seal victory in the 67th minute. Milan is 3-0-1,
while Venezia is 0-1-3 and the only club in the 18-team league
without a goal.
 &UR; Juventus 1, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, Inzaghi headed in Alessandro Del Piero's free kick in
the eighth minute and Juventus (3-0-1) won despite the absences of
several starters. Piacenza is 1-1-2.
 &UR; Lazio 2, Cagliari 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Portuguese defender Fernando Cuoto scored from 2 meters
(yards) out in first-half injury time and, after Cagliari (1-1-2)
saw Uruguayan midfielder Fabian O'Neill expelled, Yugoslavian Dejan
Stankovic fixed the final score off Marcelo Salas' assist in the
69th. Lazio improved to 1-3-0.
 &UR; Bologna 0, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, the hosts (0-2-2) had Brazilian midfielder Eriberto
sent off with 28 minutes left, but Parma (1-3-0) could not
capitalize.
 &UR; Salernitana 1, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Roberto Breda's rising blast gave Salernitana
(0-1-3) the lead after 10 minutes, but Empoli (0-2-2) equalized in
the 33rd on defender Giorgio Lucenti's goal.
 &UR; Vicenza 1, Bari 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Uruguayan striker Marcelo Otero's header in the 16th
minute, the first goal Bari (1-2-1) has allowed this season,
decided the match. Vicenza is 1-1-2.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dutch international Dennis Bergkamp, without a
goal and still recovering from this summer's World Cup, broke out
and scored twice Sunday as defending league and cup champion
Arsenal defeated Newcastle 3-0 at the Gunners ground in north
London.
	   Bergkamp scored in the 21st off a pass from French interantional
Nicola Anekla. Eight minutes later, Bergkamp slipped a pass across
the front of the net as Anekla scored, and then got his second on a
penalty in the 66th.
	   The victory gave Arsenal 13 points and moved the Gunners into
third place _ pending a late match Sunday with Chelsea at
Liverpool. Arsenal trails Aston Villa (20 points) and Manchester
United (14).
	   On Saturday, Ian Taylor scored twice as Villa defeated
struggling Coventry 2-1, and Manchester United moved into second
with a 3-0 win at last-place Southampton with goals from Dwight
Yorke, Andy Cole and substitute Jordi Cruyff
	   Two days after leaving Leeds to coach Spurs, George Graham
watched his team score a 1-0 victory over Derby with England
defender Sol Campbell heading the only goal. David Pleat handled
the coaching as Graham prepares to take over.
	   Leeds tumbled 1-0 at home to Leicester, whose manager, Martin
O'Neill, is rumored to be taking over at Elland Road. Veteran
striker Tony Cottee scored the winner 14 minutes to play.
	   Middlesbrough moved up to 12 points with a 4-0 crushing of
Sheffield Wednesday. Danish forward Mikkel Beck scored twice with
the others from Colombian Hamilton Ricard and Paul Gascoigne.
	   Struggling Blackburn gained a 3-0 victory over high-flying West
Ham with two goals from Gary Flitcroft.
	   Charlton's first away win came 1-0 at Nottingham Forest through
defender Eddie Youds, and Everton came from behind at Wimbledon to
win 2-1 on strikes by Danny Cadamarteri and Duncan Ferguson.
	   Also on Saturday, Huddersfield moved two points clear in
division one with a 2-0 victory over Oxford United while Sunderland
was held 0-0 at home by Bradford. On Sunday, West defeated Watford
4-1.
	   Kilmarnock opened up a one-point lead in the Scottish Premier
League Saturday but should have made it three after being held 0-0
at home by Dunfermline.
	   Rangers played Dundee at home Sunday and would move into first
with a victory.

Siemerink wins final in straight sets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands beat
No.1 seed Gred Rusedski 6-4, 6-4 to win the dlrs 400,000 Toulouse
Open tennis tournament Sunday.
	   Siemerink took 62 minutes to beat the hard-hitting British
player and win his fourth career title.
	   Most recently Siemerink won the Rotterdam ATP tournament in
March.
	   No. 2 seed Siemerink got a breakthrough in the fifth game of the
first set, when he broke Rusedski's powerful serve to go 3-2 ahead.
	   The Dutchman hit a fine backhand return to go level at 30-30 and
then hit another after Rusedski should have buried a
comfortable-looking backhand volley.
	   Rusedski, the world's No. 14, had his best chance to break back
when Siemerink was serving at 4-3 ahead.
	   But at 30-30, Siemerink made a fine smash and followed up with a
ferocious first serve to hold the game and go 5-3 ahead.
	   In the second set, the left-handed Siemerink broke serve in the
third game and served consistently to clinch the title.	   
	   Siemerink, 28, beat No. 3 seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden and
Wimbledon junior champion Roger Federer, Switzerland, on his way to
the final.

Edmundo keeps Fiorentina winning streak alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. UPDATES with Fiorentina coach quote. will be
updated after Sampdoria-Roma late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta had a quiet day, but another of
Fiorentina's many weapons hit the target Sunday to keep the club
alone atop the Italian League.
	   Brazilian striker Edmundo scored his first goal of the Serie A
season off a nice exchange with Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa in
the third minute of injury time to lift Fiorentina past Udinese 1-0
for its fourth win in as many games.
	   Batistuta, an Argentine, and Udinese's Marcio Amoroso, a
Brazilian, entered the day tied for the league lead with five goals
apiece, but both were held in check.
	   ``This team knows how to win when it struggles. It has
character,'' Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni said. ``This was
a victory that we deserved.''
	   Fiorentina, enjoying its first stay in first place since 1982,
has 12 points, two more than Internazionale of Milan (3-1-0), which
continues to thrive despite the lengthy absences of superstar
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
	   Chile's Ivan Zamorano and France's Youri Djorkaeff did the
damage Sunday in a 2-0 win over pesky Perugia 2-0.
	   Zamorano scored with a 12-meter (yard) shot 11 minutes into the
game, and Djorkaeff, a member of the World Cup champions, capped a
superb individual outing with an insurance goal off a short-range
header in the 54th.
	   Elswhere, German striker Oliver Bierhoff headed home his fifth
goal of the season just three minutes into AC Milan's 2-0 road win
against Venezia.
	   Milan, coming off back-to-back poor seasons, has nine points and
shares third place with Juventus of Turin. The two-time defending
champions rebounded from last week's loss to AC Parma by edging
Piacenza 1-0 on Filippo Inzaghi's early goal.
	   Also Sunday, Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome finally recorded
its first win of the season, 2-0 over 10-man Cagliari; AC Parma was
shut out for the third time and drew 0-0 at Bologna; Vicenza beat
Bari 1-0; and Salernitana and Empoli drew 1-1. Sampdoria of Genoa
hosted AS Roma in the night match.
	   The fifth round of games will be in two weeks, because Italy's
national team plays a Euro 2000 qualifier against Switzerland next
Saturday.
	   At Florence, Rui Costa provided the pass and Edmundo the strike
at the end of a swift counterattack in the game's dying seconds.
The difference between this Fiorentina and that of recent years is
that Batistuta now gets consistent support from his teammates, both
in attack and on defense.
	   Fifth-place Udinese (2-1-1) nearly pulled off the upset, though,
when midfielder Jonathan Bachini's shot in the 52nd minute hit the
base of the post with Fiorentina 'keeper Francesco Toldo out of
position.
 &UR; Inter 2, Perugia 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Djorkaeff was brilliant, providing the playmaking and
leadership that some thought Inter would lack with the veteran
Baggio and Brazil's Ronaldo sidelined by knee injuries. Djorkaeff,
whose goal late in second-half injury time Wednesday gave Inter a
1-0 Champions League win over Austria's Sturm Graz, was quick to
get his head on the rebound after Perugia 'keeper Marco Roccati
failed to hold winger Francesco Moriero's 30-meter (yard) blast.
	   Inter also produced its top defensive effort of the season,
caging in dangerous Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata (three
goals in four games). Perugia fell to 0-2-2.
 &UR; Milan 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Brazil's Leonardo provided the corner kick for
Bierhoff's early goal and then sent a 7-meter (yard) shot into the
low corner to seal victory in the 67th minute. Milan is 3-0-1,
while Venezia is 0-1-3 and the only club in the 18-team league
without a goal.
 &UR; Juventus 1, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, Inzaghi headed in Alessandro Del Piero's free kick in
the eighth minute and Juventus (3-0-1) won despite the absences of
several starters. Piacenza is 1-1-2.
 &UR; Lazio 2, Cagliari 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Portuguese defender Fernando Cuoto scored from 2 meters
(yards) out in first-half injury time and, after Cagliari (1-1-2)
saw Uruguayan midfielder Fabian O'Neill expelled, Yugoslavian Dejan
Stankovic fixed the final score off Marcelo Salas' assist in the
69th. Lazio improved to 1-3-0.
 &UR; Bologna 0, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, the hosts (0-2-2) had Brazilian midfielder Eriberto
sent off with 28 minutes left, but Parma (1-3-0) could not
capitalize.
 &UR; Salernitana 1, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Roberto Breda's rising blast gave Salernitana
(0-1-3) the lead after 10 minutes, but Empoli (0-2-2) equalized in
the 33rd on defender Giorgio Lucenti's goal.
 &UR; Vicenza 1, Bari 0 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Uruguayan striker Marcelo Otero's header in the 16th
minute, the first goal Bari (1-2-1) has allowed this season,
decided the match. Vicenza is 1-1-2.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Blyth Tait won the individual gold medal and led the
New Zealand team to the victory in the three-day event at the 1998
World Equestrian Games Sunday.
	   Fellow New Zealander Mark Todd took the silver on Broadcast
News, while Sweden's Paula Tornquist on SAS Monaghan finished
third. Defending champion Vaughn Jeffreys, also from New Zealand,
was fourth.
	   After the event's final test, show jumping, Tait, on Ready
Teddy, had 43.4 penalties, compared to Todd's 44.2. Tornquist
finished with 45.6 penalties.
	   David O'Connor of The Plains, Va. scored the U.S. team best
result to finish sixth on Giltedge with 51.4 penalties. Kerry
Millikin of Westport, Mass., placed 15 on Out and About, and
two-time World champion Bruce Davidson of Unionsville, Pa. finished
21th on Heyday.
	   At the three-day event team competition, New Zealand claimed the
gold with a total of 137.6 penalties, while France finished second

with the event's final test, the Free Style, Isabel Werth of
Germany was atop the provisional standings.

Six Tamil rebels killed in clashes with government soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE _ The following dispatch was submitted to the Sri
Lankan military censor, who made no changes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government soldiers fought through
mortar fire from guerrilla ranks to advance farther northward from
a town which fell to the military in fierce battles last week, the
military said Sunday.
	   Six rebels were killed in the fighting on Saturday near Mankulam
town, but there were no military casualties, a military statement
added. The area is 245 kilometers (153 miles) north of Colombo, the
Sri Lankan capital.
	   Last week, government soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels fought
fierce battles near the northern towns of Kilinochchi and Mankulam
in which at least 1,200 people died. The battles along a northern
highway the military is trying to capture were among the heaviest
in Sri Lanka's 15-year ethnic war.
	   The capture of the highway, linking the isolated northern Jaffna
peninsula with the southern mainland, will allow the government to
transport supplies overland instead of by air and sea. The military
has wrested two-thirds of the war-scarred highway.
	   Meanwhile, the government is planning to hand over a report on
24 child Tamil rebels to the United Nations, a newspaper said
Sunday.
	   The report will be handed over to Olara Ottunu, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative on children
and war, the independent weekly ``Sunday Times'' quoted a senior
foreign ministry official as saying.
	   Ottunu visited Sri Lanka in May earlier this year, and got
commitments from the rebels and the government not to use children
in war.
	   The children surrendered to the military on wednesday in the
thick of fighting, according to the government.
	   They are being detained and the government has not said what it
plans to do with them. Under emergency laws, they can be held
without trial indefinitely. In a photograph published by the
government, the children appear to be treated well.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983 between the military and the rebels who want to form
a separate homeland in the country's north and east.

Westwood wins Belgian Open, keeps shot at No. 1 for season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood beat Sweden's
Fredrik Jacobson in a playoff to win the Belgian Belgacom Open
Sunday, keeping his chances alive of ending the European Tour
season as the top golfer.
	   Westwood took the lead for the first time on the 12th hole
Sunday before Jacobson came back on the 17th with a birdie to force
a playoff with both men tied at 16-under par.
	   On the par 4 playoff hole, Jacobson hit his second shot to 14
feet (4.3 meters), compared to Westwood's 20 feet (6.1 meters), but
the Englishman won his fourth tournament of the year with great
putting.
	   If Westwood now wins the season-ending Volvo Masters at the end
of the month, he will dethrone Colin Montgomerie, a no-show here,
as Europe's No. 1.
	   Westwood, No. 2 in the rankings, shot a 5-under 66 Sunday, one
shot better than Jacobson's 67 on Sunday. Jacobson, who was ranked
127th in Europe, needed a top-eight finish to hold on to his
European Tour card next year and did considerably better.
	   Another Swede, Robert Karlsson, finished joint third with New
Zealand's Greg Turner, two shots off the lead. Jarmo Sandelin of
Sweden and England's Peter Mitchell were another two shots back at
12-under.
	   The 66,600 pound (dlrs 113,000) first prize brought Westwood
within easy striking distance of Scotland's Montgomerie. He now
trails the Scot's leading 760,077 pounds (dlrs 1.29 million) by
just 45,400 pounds (dlrs 77,000), which is less than the difference
in prize money between the top two at the Volvo Masters in Spain.
	   ``It's in my hands now,'' Westwood said.
	   It was the first time the Belgian Open was held since 1994, when
Nick Faldo won.

Schiffer says she's not quitting fashion shows after all
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A day after she was quoted as saying
she was through with fashion shows, Claudia Schiffer said she was
misunderstood.
	   ``I'm not quitting,'' the German top model said in a statement
issued Sunday by her publicists, Hoffmann Media.
	   The 28-year-old Schiffer said that when she told a Rome
newspaper she wouldn't work the runways anymore, she meant only in
Milan.
	   She said she has three new campaigns as model planned for 1999,
and continues under contract with L'Oreal cosmetics, Citroen cars
and a mail-order firm.
	   ``For me, the runway work was only a small part of my modeling
career, and more important at the beginning to become known
internationally,'' she said. But ``for almost two years now I've
only done fashion shows occasionally and for special causes, for
example, for Valentino.''
	   In Saturday's Il Messaggero, Schiffer was quoted as saying she
was leaving fashion shows behind for movies and advertising.
	   ``I love fashion but I never really liked the runway,'' she was
quoted as saying.

Queen faces dilemma as son, grandson hold parties on the same day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It's a tough one.
	   In an apparent failure of royal liaison, Queen Elizabeth has
been invited to two family parties on Nov. 14. Now she must decide
whether to attend grandson Peter Phillips' 21st birthday
celebrations, or a party marking her son Prince Charles' 50th
birthday, organized by his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   It's a duplication of dates unheard of in a world where diaries
are carefully coordinated months, if not years, ahead of time, and
has prompted speculation of royal rifts.
	   ''The queen is aware that there is a clash, but no decision has
yet been made,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, speaking with
customary anonymity.
	   Princess Anne, the queen's only daughter, chose Nov. 14 to
celebrate her son's birthday at Windsor Castle, west of London,
although his birthday is not until the following day.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles is reported to have organized a private party
the same night at Charles' country home, Highgrove, in western
England. His birthday is Nov. 14.
	   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on a report in The Mail on
Sunday tabloid that the clash ''is the first public evidence of
current tensions between senior royals,'' divided over plans to
modernize the monarchy in the wake of the death of Princess Diana.
	   The newspaper said Charles has angered his sister by trying to
emulate Diana's more approachable, hands-on style during public
engagements. Anne feels this is stealing the limelight from other
members of the royal family, who do valuable charity work, The Mail
on Sunday said.

Milan runway offers good gossip and simple styles
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) The Italian Spring-Summer 1999 collections
just opened over the weekend, but already there is lots to talk
about.
	   The good news is that the Italian designers are thinking simple
for next year's warm weather season.
	   The bad news is that top model Claudia Schiffer announced her
runway retirement.
	   The non-news is that neither Monica Lewinsky nor the Rome based
Gattinoni fashion house who offered the former White House intern
dlrs 500,000 to model for its ``size plus'' line showed up for the
``moda Milanese'' fashion week.
	   It's too early to declare the week's fashion winners, but the
booby prize is sure to go to Francesco Coveri who Saturday showed a
nude model bathing in a tub of lukewarm milk.
	   ``It's a shame when fashion is transformed into a fourth rate
circus,'' said Stefano Gabbana, of the Dolce and Gabbana duo, who
presented their D&AMP;G line Saturday.
	   The latest look of the label favored by the disco set harks back
to the coffee shop waitress. In the contemporary version the prim
black dress becomes a sexy tube dress and the apron is in
transparent plastic with cargo pants pockets.
	   Schiffer said goodbye to the runway at the end of her only
scheduled appearance at the Milan collection's Friday night for
designer friend Giorgio Ferrari. A radiant Naomi Campell made her
first appearance of the week Sunday for Gai Mattiolo.
	   Wearing a shimmering silver lame gown with demure front and
plunging back, the other ``most famous'' top model walked down the
runway arm in arm with the young Roman designer at the end of his
much-applauded show.
	   Rising star Mattiolo, whose body-hugging styles and love of
bright shades reminded many of the late Gianni Versace, opts for a
demure rather than daring look for next summer.
	   His models have romantic pinned-up hair styles, wear little
makeup and love soft fabrics, lace and empire waists.
	   Already a favorite among the Italian entertainment crowd, and
well known in Asia, Mattiolo may soon appear on the U.S. fashion
racks.
	   ``His fragrance is already doing very well,'' said Edward
Menicheschi, a Vogue America publisher.
	   Romeo Gigli, who showed Sunday on a circular runway in a new
fashion hall of the Milan trade fair, was also in a romantic mood.
	   Like Mattiolo, his models opted for innocence with childlike
hair styles, pale makeup and high-waisted styles.
	   Antique gold and silver gray were the favorite Gigli shades, and
lace and sheer chiffon the favorite fabrics.
	   Over the coming week, Italy's most famous fashion houses,
including Armani, Ferre, Fendi, Gucci, Prada and Versace will
present their version of the 1999 warm weather style.
	   According to trend watchers the season promises to be soft and
simple, bare but not too bold.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Paris Zoumboulis scored two goals as AEK
Athens beat Paniliakos of Pyrgos 3-1 at home Sunday, to retain the
lead in the Greek first division soccer league.
	   After six rounds, AEK has 16 points. It is followed by
Olympiakos Piraeus and Ionikos Nikea with 13 points each.
	   Olympiakos trounced Proodeftiki of Koridalos 6-1.
	   Ionikos hammered Ethnikos Piraeus 5-0 on two goals each by
Brazilian striker Paulo Andrioli in the 18th and 62nd minutes and
by Giorgos Stamboulis in the 18th and 64th. Scottish striker
Craig-James Brewster opened the scoring in the 10th minute.
	   AEK took an early lead with Zoumboulis in the 5th and came close
to a second three minutes later but Harris Kopitsis' shot went just
wide.
	   In the 23rd, it was Paniliakos' turn to miss a scoring
opportunity when goalie Chrisostomos Michailidis made a spectacular
save to a shot by George Papandreou.
	   Seconds before the end of the first half, Zoumboulis made it 2-0
off a center from Michalis Kasapis.
	   The visitors regrouped at half-time and drew within one goal in
the 74th when Vangelis Toyias beat Michailidis off a pass from
Yiannis Tatsis.
	   Paniliakos became more aggressive after the goal, launching one
attack after the other in an effort to level. But it was AEK which
scored again with a shot from the edge of the box by Toni Sawevski
in the 89th.
	   Olympiakos easily beat Proodeftiki 6-1 at home with three of its
players scoring two goals each.
	   The victory came four days after the Piraeus club defeated
Croatia Zagreb 2-0 in a game for the Champions League.
	   Olympiakos dominated the game particularly in the second half
when it netted four goals in eight minutes.

Insurer's finance chief quits over insider trading investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The chief financial officer of
Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Co. has resigned over an
investigation into possible insider trading, the company said
Sunday.
	   Markus Rohrbasser, 44, offered his resignation over a Swiss
investigation linked to the merger of Zurich's financial services
business and that of British tobacco group B.A.T., Zurich Financial
Services said in a statement.
	   The procedure opened by the Zurich district attorney's office,
which targets no named individuals, was prompted by unusual
movements in Zurich shares prior to the announcement in October
1997 of the Zurich-B.A.T. merger.
	   The merger, completed last month, created one of the world's
largest insurance and asset management companies.
	   The inquiry is still completely open, but Rohrbasser offered to
quit in the interests of the company, the Zurich statement
stressed.
	   Zurich named Guenther Gose, a board member since 1990, to
replace Rohrbasser, who has already left the company.

Turks reiterate warning to Syria; Egypt attempts mediation

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against
Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle democracy between the two
neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish
bases in Syria.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey was in a
position of self-defense and had suffered for many years from
Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking rebels.
	   Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the
Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it
is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in
Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. ``I am not only
warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot continue.''
	   He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel was
warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military
and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the
military would be charged with solving the issue.
	   ``Our patience has run out. We are determined to take all
necessary measures if we don't see any response to our goodwill,''
the commander of Turkish land forces, Gen. Atilla Ates, said last
week.
	   Milliyet daily speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage
pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon,
where Turkey says the rebels have bases. Another report claimed the
Turkish army had been put on alert.
	   But Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was
the last resort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said.
	   The war in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy
for the country's large Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000
people since 1984.
	   In an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over
into the entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the
graveness of the situation and that it should be dealt with
diplomatically and not through confrontation or threats.''
	   Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this week would
be fruitful.
	   Jordan, which cautioned Syria and Turkey to take into
consideration the higher interests of the region, offered to
mediate.
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure
Syria.''
	   Israel has also instructed its army to limit military maneuvers
along its border with Syria to avoid giving any impression that
Israel is poised to act.
	   On Sunday, the Arab League called on Turkey to end its military
cooperation with Israel.
	   Syria and Turkey have a long history of disagreements. Damascus
is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates
River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Syria
of having aspirations over a Turkish border province, Hatay, which
has a sizable Arab population.

Deputy premier denies plans to restrict dollar in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top economic official said Sunday that reports
of the government's alleged plans to prohibit use of the U.S.
dollar in Russia were ``nonsense.''
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said in an interview
with the NTV television station that the state needed dollars for
economic recovery.
	   ``The more dollars in the country, the easier it will be to put
the economy back on its feet,'' Maslyukov said.
	   Russian media reported last week that the economic program under
consideration by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government
included many elements of the Soviet-era command economy. The plan
leaked to the press, which included strict control over foreign
currencies, was drafted by Maslyukov.
	   Primakov has said that the government is considering several
options. Meeting with foreign economic advisors on Saturday, he
pledged to continue privatizing state property and appealed for
more long-term foreign investment to help Russia fight its way out
of the worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse in 1991.
	   He also stressed that the government had no plans to ban the
circulation of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies. But he
said the government would take steps to staunch the ``dollar
drain,'' the flow of dollars out of Russia.
	   The Central Bank said Friday that Russian companies had stashed
dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone.
	   In the NTV interview, Maslyukov said it would be ridiculous to
talk of banning the dollar when only 20-30 percent of transactions
in Russia are paid in cash and more than 70 percent in barter and
other non-cash payments such as promissory notes. He said that use
of another currency would help correct that imbalance, but did not
elaborate how.
	   ``There are no grounds to say anyone in this government plans to
ban the use of the dollar, limit the import of dollars or the right
of residents to buy or sell dollars,'' Maslyukov said. ``That is
nonsense.''

Russian delegation meets Milosevic as NATO threatens strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav statement of meeting, reports of
isolated fighting, other details.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his generals prepared
to defend the country against attack.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia the
dominant Yugoslav republic that controls Kosovo.
	   Despite Russia's opposition NATO is preparing for possible
intervention in Serbia's southern province to end seven months of
bloodshed.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that
Yugoslavia's defense minister and top general had also attended,
and that Ivanov handed Milosevic a message from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, but offered no details. A statement from Milosevic's
office afterward said any NATO strike would be an ``act of
aggression'' and asserted that in Kosovo the overall situation is
``improving daily.''
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement again
expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in Kosovo without
the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a
veto-carrying member.
	   ``Military interference ... would aggravate many times the
confrontation in Kosovo and undermine diplomatic efforts'' to
reestablish peace and dialogue, said the statement.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities indicated they
were ready for compromise by installing an interim government in
the rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that
up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   The Serb side reported no fighting Sunday, beyond two attacks of
civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, in which one
person was wounded. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, said the Serb Media Center.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which reports for the
Albanian side, said there was heavy fighting between government
forces and the guerrillas, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   NATO countries continued preparations.

Flight plan of ill-fated Ugandan airplane tampered with
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The flight plan of an airplane carrying a
senior Ugandan military official was altered after it crashed,
apparently to conceal its real destination deep inside rebel-held
Congo, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The pilot had listed a Congolese destination in the flight plan,
but the destination of the plane was subsequently erased and the
Ugandan town of Kasese, 390 kilometers (245 miles) west of Kampala,
was inserted, Sunday Vision reported.
	   It quoted a sister of one of the passengers as saying the group
was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo en route to
Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by Congolese
rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila. The plane never
landed in Kasese.
	   Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze, a brother of acting Chief of Staff James
Kazini, was aboard the plane, and the crash of a plane headed deep
inside rebel-held territory would have drawn attention to Ugandan
ties with the rebels.
	   Kabila has accused Uganda of involving its troops in a rebel
insurgency. Uganda has strongly denied the charge.
	   The twin-engine Islander, with 10 passengers, including a senior
military official, crash-landed Sept. 25 near Kisomoro, about 60
kilometers (38 miles) north of Kasese, and it appeared that the
disoriented survivors split into two groups to try to find their
way out of the remote area.
	   Uganda's army located five survivors Thursday and Friday. The
pilot was killed. Mwebaze was among the four passengers missing.
	   Other passengers included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese and
several Ugandans.
	   The state-owned newspaper said three of the passengers had
business links with Kenya, Uganda and in rebel-held Congo.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Paris Zoumboulis scored two goals as AEK
Athens beat Paniliakos of Pyrgos 3-1 at home Sunday, to retain the
lead in the Greek first division soccer league.
	   After six rounds, AEK has 16 points. It is followed by
Olympiakos Piraeus, Xanthi and Ionikos Nikea with 13 points each.
	   Olympiakos trounced Proodeftiki of Koridalos 6-1 and Xanthi beat
Ethnikos Asteras 1-0 away.
	   Ionikos hammered Ethnikos Piraeus 5-0 on two goals each by
Brazilian striker Paulo Andrioli in the 18th and 62nd minutes and
by Giorgos Stamboulis in the 18th and 64th. Scottish striker
Craig-James Brewster opened the scoring in the 10th minute.
	   AEK took an early lead with Zoumboulis in the 5th and came close
to a second three minutes later but Harris Kopitsis' shot went just
wide.
	   In the 23rd, it was Paniliakos' turn to miss a scoring
opportunity when goalie Chrisostomos Michailidis made a spectacular
save to a shot by George Papandreou.
	   Seconds before the end of the first half, Zoumboulis made it 2-0
off a center from Michalis Kasapis.
	   The visitors regrouped at half-time and drew within one goal in
the 74th when Vangelis Toyias beat Michailidis off a pass from
Yiannis Tatsis.
	   Paniliakos became more aggressive after the goal, launching one
attack after the other in an effort to level. But it was AEK which
scored again with a shot from the edge of the box by Toni Sawevski
in the 89th.
	   Olympiakos easily beat Proodeftiki 6-1 at home with three of its
players scoring two goals each.
	   The victory came four days after the Piraeus club defeated
Croatia Zagreb 2-0 in a game for the Champions League.
	   Olympiakos dominated the game particularly in the second half
when it netted four goals in eight minutes.
	   Alecos Alexandris scored in the 14th and 50th, Serbian striker
Ilija Ivic in the 25th and 52nd and Stelios Yiannacopoulos in the
48th and 56th minutes.
	   Albanian striker Rolanda Zaimi scored Proodeftiki's goal 32nd
minute.

Goverment approves new asylum policy measures, protests continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The government agreed on changes in its
asylum policy Sunday to improve the treatment of refugees, after a
Nigerian woman died during a deportation attempt two weeks ago.
	   The center-left government left the key principles of its policy
intact but created a special post of commissioner for refugee
issues and gave a committee more say in which asylum seekers could
stay. It also banned controversial deportation measures.
	   But the government stuck to a core principle _ once an asylum
request was finally turned down forced deportations would continue.
It also rejected calls for a blanket amnesty of illegal immigrants.
	   The government move came against a background of sustained
protest against the current treatment of asylum seekers. On Sunday,
over 5,000 people protested in Liege, 100 kilometers (65 miles)
east of Brussels, demanding that refugees be better treated. The
march was marred by skirmishes between police and demonstrators.
	   Two weeks ago, Nigerian asylum seeker Semira Adamu, 20, died in
a Brussels hospital from a brain hemorrhage, hours after police had
stuffed a pillow over her mouth to restrain her on a plane which
was about to depart for Africa.
	   She became the symbol of inhumane treatment and Interior
Minister Louis Tobback resigned over the incident. The head of the
police unit responsible for deporting Adamu also stepped aside.
	   ``Because of the dramatic death of Semira Adamu, there was an
urgent need for need initiatives to make the policy more humane,''
said Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene Sunday.
	   Government measures included a ban on the use of a pillow to
subdue deportees, a standard practice up to now, and more
independent outside control on the conditions within refugee
detention centers.
	   The government last week suspended the deportation of asylum
seekers from Brussels international airport until new measures were
approved.
	   Tobback had resigned because a policeman who had been sanctioned
for serious offenses against a deportee last year, was allowed to
assist on Adamu's deportation attempt.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

U.S. taxpayers will pay huge sums to rebuild Puerto Rican homes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SJU101 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ At a shelter in Puerto Rico last
week, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of a dlrs 39 million dollar U.S.
grant to rebuild hurricane-ravaged homes.
	   But two weeks after Hurricane Georges pummeled this U.S.
territory, thousands still languish in schools, community centers
and the homes of family and friends _ and her pledge looks like a
drop in the bucket.
	   The cost of getting the homeless into homes will be far greater
than virtually anyone had imagined, probably well beyond dlrs 1
billion. And U.S. taxpayers are sure to foot most of the bill.
	   Officials originally estimated overall property damage to the
island _ including roads, public buildings, parks, beaches _ at
dlrs 2 billion, a figure now believed to be underestimated.
	   So far, the effort to solve the homeless crisis has been
accompanied by confusion. Officials still don't know how many
homeless there are _ or how to give them homes.
	   Aside from killing three people on the island, Georges destroyed
nearly 30,000 houses and damaged at least another 60,000, the local
Housing Department estimates. Those left homeless can receive up to
dlrs 25,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well
as dlrs 13,500 to buy new appliances and furniture.
	   Puerto Rico authorities now say the FEMA program, which would
allow residents to rebuild their wood and zinc homes, may be
ill-advised because it will leave new homes as vulnerable to
hurricanes as the old ones.
	   Gov. Pedro Rosello instead wants federal block grants that,
combined with money from Puerto Rico's local budget, would
subsidize more expensive cement homes located out of harm's way.
	   Under his plan, hurricane victims would purchase houses worth
dlrs 65,000 for dlrs 15,000, with mortgage payments of about dlrs
100 per month.
	   ``Even though this has been a disaster for Puerto Rico, we
should look at this as an opportunity to build something better
than what we had before,'' explained Puerto Rico's Housing
Secretary, Ana Carmen Alemany.
	   The plan was presented to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo when he
arrived in Puerto Rico last week with Mrs. Clinton.
	   ``We are banking on having Secretary Cuomo going back to
President Clinton and (FEMA director) James Lee Witt and expressing
to them support for this program,'' Alemany said.
	   In the meantime, 15,000 Puerto Rican hurricane victims remain
holed up in shelters. More are staying with friends and relatives,
though no one knows exactly how many.
	   Concrete decisions on solving their longterm plight have taken a
back seat to the immediate need to restore water and electricity
and provide temporary shelter.
	   ``As of now, there is no program yet,'' admitted Bessie
Figueroa, the Puerto Rico Housing Department's liaison to FEMA.
	   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said most of Georges' homeless
represent ``the other face of Puerto Rico'': unwed mothers, welfare
recipients, the unemployed, those in homes most vulnerable to
disaster.
	   ``These are people who are still waiting to participate in the
development we've had over the past 50 years,'' she said.

Rios overcomes painful back to beat Agassi in five sets

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios and Venus Williams grabbed
the richest prizes in tennis Sunday, sharing between them dlrs 2.1
million for winning the two titles at the Grand Slam Cup.
	   Rios took home dlrs 1.3 million for beating Andre Agassi in five
sets, while Williams earned dlrs 800,000 for winning the inaugural
women's event with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Patty Schnyder.
	   Rios, who looked like he would quit early in the match because
of back problems, recovered to prevail in two hours, 55 minutes,
winning 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 5-7, 6-3.
	   ``I was going to retire, but the trainer told me to give it one
more chance,'' Rios said.
	   ``Even if I was not feeling good, I played one of my best
matches,'' Rios said. ``I'm really proud I can win a match like
that.''
	   Williams, 18, won a battle of teen-agers, breaking serve for 4-2
in the final set and serving out the match in one hour, 34 minutes.
Schnyder, 19, got dlrs 400,000.
	   Agassi, a former No. 1 who is back at No. 8 after dropping out
of the top 100 last year, at the end seemed to be worn out by
nearly seven hours of tennis in two days.
	   ``I wasn't feeling that good all day. It's hard to recover in 15
hours or so,'' said Agassi, who battled three hours and 40 minutes
to beat Karol Kucera in the semifinals, while Rios had a three-set
win over Mark Philippoussis.
	   ``I didn't really believe he was close to defaulting. I felt he
ran incredibly well,'' said Agassi, who got dlrs 650,000. ``He is
very talented.''
	   The American had not met the qualifying standard but was given a
wild card in an attempt to give some luster to the men's field,
which lacked No. 1 Pete Sampras and No. 2 Patrick Rafter.
	   The dlrs 6.7 million tournament nominally brings together
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three of the men's Grand Slam champions elected not to show
up for the richest event in tennis, which awards no ranking points.
	   Asked what he would do with his share of the cash, Rios said,
``put it in the bank.''
	   ``I'm not the type of guy who buys houses or cars,'' he said.
	   Rios, Australian Open runner-up, said he thought of quitting.
``But once you are in the match, you're winning, you see all the
crowd, you are just going to do your best.''
	   The Chilean said his back started hurting the night before the
match. ``But you don't want to go home without a final like this,
playing Andre,'' Rios said.
	   Rios, the highest-ranked player in the event at No. 3, was in
pain early in the match.
	   He was given a massage by a trainer after the third game, then
dropped his serve on a double-fault in the fifth.
	   This time, he took an injury time-out and was stretched on the
floor for a couple of minutes while the trainer worked on his back.
Rios also took some painkillers.
	   Back in the match, Rios immediately broke Agassi to level the
score. In the next game, he hit two aces in holding serve at love.
	   Rios, 22, broke Agassi's serve to win the set, hitting a
spectacular running backhand passing shot on his second set point.
	   With Rios wincing in pain nearly every time he hit the ball,
Agassi won the next set, although Rios produced one of its
highlights: winning a point while sitting on the floor after
slipping and falling on the hard-court surface.
	   Rios won five of his six service games in the third set at love,
but was less error-free in the fourth.
	   Serving to save the match in the fifth, Agassi produced a
double-fault to give Rios three match points. Agassi saved one, but
then committed another double-fault to surrender.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Dutch international Dennis Bergkamp scored his
first two goals of the season Sunday as league and cup champion
Arsenal defeated Newcastle 3-0 at the Gunners' ground in London and
moved into third behind Aston Villa and Manchester United.
	   In Sunday's other key match, Jamie Redknapp scored on a free
kick in the 83rd as Liverpool rallied for a 1-1 draw at home at
Anfield, leaving Chelsea with one win there in 39 matches.
Pierluigi Casiraghi's first goal of the season gave Chelsea a 1-0
lead in the 10th.
	   The free kick went in to the left of Chelsea goalkeeper Ed De
Goey, who was caught flat-footed and fooled by the hooking shot
from 20 meters (yards).
	   Aston Villa is the surprise league leader with 20 points to 14
for Manchester United and 13 for Arsenal. Six clubs have 12 points:
Middlesbrough, Derby, Wimbledon, West Ham, Liverpool and Chelsea.
	   Bergkamp _ the man of the day _ scored in the 21st off a pass
from French interantional Nicolas Anekla. Eight minutes later,
Bergkamp slipped a pass across the front of the net as Anekla
scored, and then got his second on a penalty in the 66th.
	   On Saturday in the Premier League, Ian Taylor scored twice as
Villa defeated struggling Coventry 2-1, and Manchester United moved
into second with a 3-0 win at last-place Southampton with goals
from Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole and substitute Jordi Cruyff
	   Two days after leaving Leeds to coach Spurs, George Graham
watched his team score a 1-0 victory over Derby with England
defender Sol Campbell heading the only goal. David Pleat handled
the coaching as Graham prepares to take over.
	   Leeds tumbled 1-0 at home to Leicester, whose manager, Martin
O'Neill, is rumored to be taking over at Elland Road. Veteran
striker Tony Cottee scored the winner 14 minutes to play.
	   Middlesbrough moved up to 12 points with a 4-0 crushing of
Sheffield Wednesday. Danish forward Mikkel Beck scored twice with
the others from Colombian Hamilton Ricard and Paul Gascoigne.
	   Struggling Blackburn gained a 3-0 victory over high-flying West
Ham with two goals from Gary Flitcroft.
	   Charlton's first away win came 1-0 at Nottingham Forest through
defender Eddie Youds, and Everton came from behind at Wimbledon to
win 2-1 on strikes by Danny Cadamarteri and Duncan Ferguson.
	   Also on Saturday, Huddersfield moved two points clear in
division one with a 2-0 victory over Oxford United while Sunderland
was held 0-0 at home by Bradford. On Sunday, West defeated Watford
4-1.
	   In Scotland on Sunday, Rangers moved into first place with a 1-0
as Jorg Albertz scored in the 79th. Rangers have 18 points to 16
for Kilmarnock. Celtic and Hearts have 13. Hearts Sunday drew 1-1
with St. Johnstone. Kilmarnock on Saturday was held to a 0-0 draw
at home by Dunfermline.

Report: Britain to deploy ground troops in Kosovo after NATO
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: ADDS three grafs with marchers demand Milosevic be indicted as
a war criminal; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is planning to deploy several thousand
ground troops and tank unites in Kosovo following a NATO
bombardment of the Yugoslav province in reprisal for killings of
ethnic Albanians, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson refused to confirm or deny
the report. He reiterated Britain is ready to take part in a NATO
attack, saying ``cat and mouse tactics'' by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic are unacceptable.
	   ``Our plans are not going to be disclosed to Slobodan Milosevic
on any program,'' Robertson said Sunday, asked about the news
report in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview. ``But
I think you can take it that a whole series of options have been
worked through and that we are ready to move on them.''
	   The Sunday Telegraph said a Royal Marines rapid reaction force
is undergoing specialist training to operate in Kosovo, where Serb
forces are blamed for brutality against the ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   The marines' role after air strikes would be peacekeeping,
similar to that of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia, but the
British soldiers would be prepared to engage Serb troops directly
if necessary, The Sunday Telegraph said.
	   Britain has already announced it will on Monday send four more
groud-attack aircraft to a NATO base in southern Italy, doubling
the number of Royal Air Force planes there in readiness for an
attack on Kosovo.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet meets Monday to approve
formally the use of force unless Milosevic halts the attacks on
ethnic Albanians and seeks a political settlement.
	   ``But it still remains to be seen by how much he is responding
and how long he is going to do it ... This time he can't get off
the hook with just cosmetics,'' said Robertson.
	   He added that sending a peacekeeping force to Kosovo after a
genuine cease-fire ``is part of the options that are available.''
	   ``What is clear is that Milosevic now recognizes that we mean
business and that's why he's moving with such speed at the
moment,'' he added.
	   Separately Sunday, some 500 people including human rights
activist Bianca Jagger and actor Corin Redgrave marched through
central London to demand that Milosevic be indicted as a war
criminal and tried in an international court.
	   ``The Serbian campaign in Kosovo has to be stopped and those
responsible for it brought to justice by the international
community,'' lawmaker John Austin said after marchers held a rally
in Trafalgar Square.
	   Ms. Jagger, 51, was held at gunpoint by Serb forces in Kosovo
this summer while filming a report for the British Broadcasting
Corp.

Egyptian government-run magazine calls for legalizing marijuana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A columnist for a leading state-run magazine
urged the government on Sunday to lift its ban on the sale of
marijuana, saying that legal efforts had failed to stop sales of
the drug.
	   Mohammed Shalan, a prominent psychologist who writes for Rose
El-Youssef magazine, said that for the ``law to be more practical
and more human it (the government) should abrogate the ban so that
the use of marijuana will not be illegal.''
	   Shalan wrote that marijuana, called bango in Egypt, is less
harmful than tobacco and liquor which are legal.
	   The use of hashish and marijuana is widespread in Egypt. The
government has estimated that some dlrs 3 billion a year are spent
on illegal drugs in Egypt.
	   Drug trafficking is punishable by death. Possession of marijuana
or hashish is punishable by a prison sentence that can vary from
months to years, depending on the quantity of the drugs seized and
whether the drug was for personal use or for sale.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against
Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle diplomacy between the two
neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish
bases in Syria.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey had suffered
for many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking
rebels and needed to defend itself.
	   Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the
Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it
is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in
Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. ``I am not only
warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot continue.''
	   He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel was
warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military
and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the
military would be charged with solving the issue.
	   ``Our patience has run out. We are determined to take all
necessary measures if we don't see any response to our goodwill,''
the commander of Turkish land forces, Gen. Atilla Ates, said last
week.
	   Milliyet daily speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage
pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon,
where Turkey says the rebels have bases. Another report claimed the
Turkish army had been put on alert.
	   But Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was
the last resort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said.
	   The war in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy
for the country's large Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000
people since 1984.
	   In an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over
into the entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the
graveness of the situation and that it should be dealt with
diplomatically and not through confrontation or threats.''
	   Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this week would
be fruitful.
	   Jordan, which cautioned Syria and Turkey to take into
consideration the higher interests of the region, offered to
mediate.
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
	   ``We have no part in this tension,'' Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. ``We have taken steps to reassure
Syria.''
	   Israel has also instructed its army to limit military maneuvers
along its border with Syria to avoid giving any impression that
Israel is poised to act.
	   On Sunday, the Arab League called on Turkey to end its military
cooperation with Israel.
	   Syria and Turkey have a long history of disagreements. Damascus
is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates
River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Syria
of having aspirations over a Turkish border province, Hatay, which
has a sizable Arab population.
	   ``War is coming,'' said Kenan Kalelioglu, an engineer in Ankara.
``If the Syrians continue to support anarchy, Turkey will have to
act. We don't like war, but we are not afraid.''

Goverment approves new asylum policy measures, protests continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Belgian government announced
changes to its asylum policy Sunday, including a ban on the use of
pillows to subdue deportees, two weeks after the death of a
Nigerian woman during a deportation attempt prompted outraged
protests.
	   The government rejected calls for a blanket amnesty for illegal
immigrants, and said forced deportations would continue once the
appeals process was exhausted.
	   ``Because of the dramatic death of Semira Adamu, there was an
urgent need for initiatives to make the policy more humane,'' said
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene Sunday.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital from a brain hemorrhage
two weeks ago, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her
mouth to keep her on a plane about to depart for Africa.
	   Interior Minister Louis Tobback resigned over the incident, as
did the head of the police unit responsible for deporting Adamu.
	   Other changes announced by the center-left government include
greater outside control on conditions within refugee detention
centers; the creation of a special post of commissioner for refugee
issues; and allowing a committee more say in which asylum seekers
could stay.
	   The government move came against a background of sustained
protest against the current treatment of asylum seekers. On Sunday,
over 5,000 people protested in Liege, 100 kilometers (65 miles)
east of Brussels, demanding better trearment. The march was marred
by skirmishes between police and demonstrators.
	   Adamu resisted returning to Nigeria because she claimed her
family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already has
three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant her
refugee status.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police raided a hotel in the
Bangladeshi capital Sunday and rescued 21 Muslim child refugees
from Myanmar allegedly captured to be smuggled to Persian Gulf
nations for use as camel jockeys, an official said.
	   The boys and girls, aged 4 to 10, were brought by their captors
to Dhaka from the southern Cox's Bazar district, where more than
20,000 Muslim refugees from Myanmar have been living in camps since
1991, the police official said. He spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Police said they detained four women who claimed to be mothers
of the children.
	   A quarter of a million Muslim refugees fled to neighboring
Bangladesh from Myanmar's western province of Arakan to escape
alleged rape, arson and forced unpaid labor in 1991.
	   Though tens of thousands have since been repatriated, more than
20,000 refuse to return home for fear of persecution.
	   Trafficking of children from Bangladesh to Persian Gulf
countries is common. While the boys are used as jockeys in camel
racing, a popular sport, the girls are sold for prostitution,
police say.

Report: Britain to deploy ground troops in Kosovo after NATO
</HEADLINE>
strikes &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Vaness Redgrave, graf 12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is planning to deploy several thousand
ground troops and tank units in Kosovo following a NATO bombardment
of the Yugoslav province in reprisal for killings of ethnic
Albanians, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson refused to confirm or deny
the report. He reiterated Britain is ready to take part in a NATO
attack, saying ``cat and mouse tactics'' by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic are unacceptable.
	   ``Our plans are not going to be disclosed to Slobodan Milosevic
on any program,'' Robertson said Sunday, asked about the news
report in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview. ``But
I think you can take it that a whole series of options have been
worked through and that we are ready to move on them.''
	   The Sunday Telegraph said a Royal Marines rapid reaction force
is undergoing specialist training to operate in Kosovo, where Serb
forces are blamed for brutality against the ethnic Albanian
majority.
	   The marines' role after air strikes would be peacekeeping,
similar to that of the peacekeeping force in Bosnia, but the
British soldiers would be prepared to engage Serb troops directly
if necessary, The Sunday Telegraph said.
	   Britain has already announced it will on Monday send four more
groud-attack aircraft to a NATO base in southern Italy, doubling
the number of Royal Air Force planes there in readiness for an
attack on Kosovo.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet meets Monday to approve
formally the use of force unless Milosevic halts the attacks on
ethnic Albanians and seeks a political settlement.
	   ``But it still remains to be seen by how much he is responding
and how long he is going to do it ... This time he can't get off
the hook with just cosmetics,'' said Robertson.
	   He added that sending a peacekeeping force to Kosovo after a
genuine cease-fire ``is part of the options that are available.''
	   ``What is clear is that Milosevic now recognizes that we mean
business and that's why he's moving with such speed at the
moment,'' he added.
	   Separately Sunday, some 500 people including human rights
activist Bianca Jagger and actors Corin and Vanessa Redgrave
marched through central London to demand that Milosevic be indicted
as a war criminal and tried in an international court.
	   ''Serbia has no right, under national or international law, to
Kosovo,'' Vanessa Redgrave told a rally in Trafalgar Square. John
Austin, a lawmaker from Blair's Labor Party, said Serbia's campaign
in Kosovo ''has to be stopped and those responsible for it brought
to justice by the international community.''
	   Ms. Jagger, 51, was held at gunpoint by Serb forces in Kosovo
this summer while filming a report for the British Broadcasting
Corp.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Italian Spring-Summer 1999 collections
just opened over the weekend, but already there is lots to talk
about.
	   The good news is that the Italian designers are thinking simple
for next year's warm weather season.
	   The bad news is that top model Claudia Schiffer announced her
retirement from Milan runways.

Doping commission reopens inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian Olympic Committee's anti-drug
investigator said Sunday he will reopen his inquiry into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in the country's top soccer
league.
	   The official, Ugo Longo, said he will look into reports that a
positive doping test turned in by a player in a 1997 Serie A match
was covered up.
	   He will also investigate a report that 24 players of Serie A
club AC Parma showed abnormalities in blood tests in July. The
players allegedly had elevated levels of red blood cells _ which
could indicate the use of EPO, a banned synthetic hormone.
	   Longo will not undertake an examination of the Italian national
team, he said. Media reports had suggested he would.
	   Prosecutors in Torino and Bologna have been carrying out their
own, separate inquiries since the summer. The fallout has included
the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) president Mario
Pescante and the firing of the chief of CONI's rug-testing
laboratory _ both last week.
	   In August, Longo wrapped up a two-week investigation, concluding
that legal muscle-builders such as creatine, not banned substances,
are a problem in Italian soccer and steps should be taken to curb
their use.
	   He has suggested creatine, an amino acid powder, be banned or
restricted.

Russian government condemns possible NATO attack on Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Patriarch Alexy's comments in new grafs 4-6,
edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government on Sunday condemned any
unsanctioned NATO attack on Yugoslavia as a ``rude violation'' of
the United Nations charter, and urged that the conflict be solved
diplomatically.
	   ``The Russian government thinks it necessary to emphasize again
that using force against a sovereign state without the sanction of
the Security Council would be a rude violation of the U.N.
charter,'' according to a government statement.
	   ``We are convinced that complicated ethnic conflicts, which the
Kosovo conflict undoubtedly is, cannot be settled militarily.''
	   The head of Russia's Orthodox Church joined in warning NATO away
from any attacks on Yugoslav targets.
	   ``Any military interference can trigger irrevocable consequences
and cause people who have nothing to do with the conflict to
suffer,'' Patriarch Alexy II said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Alexy spoke after meeting with the Orthodox Archbishop of Tirana
and All Albania, Anastasy. He noted that Kosovo is sacred to the
Serbs, ``a special place where the Orthodox Church keeps sacred
objects, which may also be destroyed.''
	   The government and church statements echoed earlier comments by
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other Russian leaders,
who sharply opposed any NATO attacks.
	   Western governments have warned that NATO might take military
action after accusations that Serbian forces committed atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Russia's parliament last week declared that any NATO military
action over Kosovo taken without U.N. approval would be considered
an ``illegal act of aggression.''
	   In a unanimous resolution passed Friday, the State Duma said it
would review all agreements between NATO and Russia if the Western
alliance were to opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   The NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch air strikes,
and a final decision about whether to use force won't likely be
made until later this month.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his generals prepared
to defend the country against attack.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Despite Russia's opposition, NATO is preparing for possible
intervention in Kosovo _Serbia's southern province _ to end seven
months of bloodshed.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that
Yugoslavia's defense minister and top general had also attended,
and that Ivanov handed Milosevic a message from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, but offered no details. A statement from Milosevic's
office afterward said any NATO strike would be an ``act of
aggression'' and asserted that in Kosovo the overall situation is
``improving daily.''
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement again
expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in Kosovo without
the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a
veto-carrying member.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities indicated they
were ready for compromise by installing an interim government in
the rebellious Serbian province. A Western diplomat also said that
up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have
been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   The Serb side reported no fighting Sunday, beyond two attacks of
civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, in which one
person was wounded. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, said the Serb Media Center.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which reports for the
Albanian side, said there was heavy fighting between government
forces and the guerrillas, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   NATO countries continued preparations.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported Britain preparing ground
troops and armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a
post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to
confirm or deny the report but repeated Britain was ready to
participate in a NATO attack.
	   The Yugoslav government said Friday the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels. Serbian
police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian
rebels in a seven-month crackdown. The conflict has killed hundreds
_ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left upward of 275,000
villagers refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the interim council,
drawn up without any consultation with them, in which Serbs
outnumber majority Albanians.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict.
U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans report Monday to the Security Council
on whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its assault
on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air
strikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   Human Rights watch, in a report issued Sunday, said both the
authorities and have committed atrocities in seven months of
conflict, but government abuses have been on a far greater scale.
	   The New York-based organization said Serbian police and military
``committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings,
systematically destroyed civilian property and attacked
humanitarian aid workers, all of which are violations of the rules
of war.''
	   ``The Albanian insurgency ... has also violated the laws of war
by such actions as the taking of civilian hostages and by summary
executions,'' the report said. ``Although on a lesser scale than
the government abuses, these too are violations of international
standards and should be condemned.''
	   On Saturday, Serb police took reporters to the site of what they
thought was a mass grave on a mountain top near the village of
Volujak, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of the provincial
capital, Pristina. Dogs, they said, had unearthed human bones in an
area formerly held by the Albanian separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   By Sunday, parts of five skeletons had been found, along with
Chinese-made bullet casings and empty casings of hunting rifles at
the site _ both characteristic for ammunition used by the KLA.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A US F-18 fighter carried out a successful
emergency landing at a NATO base on the island of Crete Sunday,
local media said.
	   The F-18 took off from the USS Eisenhower, the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier currently in the Aegean Sea.
	   The plane landed at Souda air base when the pilot reported a
problem in the landing system, private Antenna radio said.
	   The aircraft carrier is taking part in NATO military exercises
and could be used in possible alliance air strikes to try and end
the Kosovo crisis.

Italian Communists vote to yank support for Prodi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Prodi to go to Scalfaro Monday morning &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw
support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move
that could trigger the collapse of one of the country's
longest-lived postwar governments.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the government, but Prodi
has said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked
support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the
Senate, but counts on them for a majority in the Chamber.
	   A confidence vote could be scheduled in the next few days.
	   If Prodi loses his majority in the chamber, he would be forced
to resign and new elections could be called.
	   The presidential palace announced Sunday evening that Prodi had
a Monday morning appointment with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to
discuss the developments. Prodi could offer his resignation.
	   Scalfaro could turn to another politician to put together a
coalition, or ask Prodi to try to muster a coalition majority,
possibly from centrists now in the opposition and from Communists
unhappy with their party leadership's decision.
	   But a key centrist leader, Francesco Cossiga, a former premier
and head of state, has indicated his followers wouldn't bail out
Prodi.

Young couple to go on trial for grotesque killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A young man and young woman go on trial Monday for
the murder of a friend who prosecutors contend was killed during a
perverse love scene, its fatal ending written in advance.
	   The defendants, identified as Veronique Herbert, 20, and
Sebastien, 19, are to be tried behind closed doors at the court for
minors in Bobigny, outside Paris, because of their age at the time
of the March 1996 crime.
	   They both risk life in prison for the death of Abdeladim, then
16. Prosecutors claim he was killed while making love to Veronique,
allegedly stabbed to death by her and Sebastien.
	   The deadly drama stirred controversy at the time, with experts
focusing on the effects of violence in movies. According to the
prosecution, Veronique had a morbid fascination for films,
especially Oliver Stone's 1994 movie ``Natural Born Killers.''
	   The film follows a young, much-in-love couple on a killing
spree, with the attendant media attention.
	   According to the prosecution, Veronique, described by
psychiatrists as a ``calm, serious, good student'' from
Gournay-sur-Marne, outside Paris, had told friends she and
Sebastian planned to commit a murder. Plastic sacks and a metal saw
were bought in advance.
	   On the night of March 2, 1996, the pair allegedly lured
Abdeladim to Sebastian's family home, saying Veronique was
attracted to him. The young girl and Abdeladim become intimate.
	   Sebastien allegedly refuses Abdeladim's demands to leave the
room. According to the prosecution, Sebastien takes two knives from
a drawer and allegedly stabs the young man in the neck, after
asking the woman's permission.
	   Then, in what the prosecution's dossier likens to a ``horror
film,'' the young woman allegedly orders Sebastien to ``finish him
off,'' while she allegedly plunges the second knife into the
victim's stomach.
	   The pair, in a panic, bury the victim outside the house, wash
off and flee in the car of Sebastien's father.
	   Police found the couple, who confessed to the crime, in the
Cantal region of central France three days later.

Rios overcomes painful back to beat Agassi in five sets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios and Venus Williams grabbed
the richest purse in tennis Sunday, collecting between them dlrs
2.1 million for winning the two titles at the Grand Slam Cup.
	   Rios took home dlrs 1.3 million for beating Andre Agassi in five
sets, while Williams earned dlrs 800,000 for winning the inaugural
women's event with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Patty Schnyder.
	   Rios, who looked like he would quit early in the match because
of back problems, recovered to prevail in two hours, 55 minutes,
winning 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 5-7, 6-3.
	   ``I was going to retire, but the trainer told me to give it one
more chance,'' Rios said.
	   ``Even if I was not feeling good, I played one of my best
matches,'' Rios said. ``I'm really proud I can win a match like
that.''
	   Williams, 18, won a battle of teen-agers, breaking serve for 4-2
in the final set and serving out the match in one hour, 34 minutes.
Schnyder, 19, got dlrs 400,000.
	   ``She picked it up in the second set, but I got an early break
in the third and then another one,'' said the fifth-ranked
American. Schnyder is ranked No. 9.
	   Williams just had too much power for Schnyder and ran down the
tenacious Swiss.
	   ``We both played hard. She really wanted this title and I really
wanted this title, too,'' Williams said.
	   Agassi, a former No. 1 who is back at No. 8 after dropping out
of the top 100 last year, at the end seemed to be worn out by
nearly seven hours of tennis in two days.
	   ``I wasn't feeling that good all day. It's hard to recover in 15
hours or so,'' said Agassi, who battled three hours and 40 minutes
to beat Karol Kucera in the semifinals, while Rios had a three-set
win over Mark Philippoussis.
	   ``I didn't really believe he was close to defaulting. I felt he
ran incredibly well,'' said Agassi, who got dlrs 650,000. ``He is
very talented.''
	   The American had not met the qualifying standard but was given a
wild card in an attempt to give some luster to the men's field,
which lacked No. 1 Pete Sampras and No. 2 Patrick Rafter.
	   The dlrs 6.7 million tournament nominally brings together
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But three of the men's Grand Slam champions elected not to show
up for the richest event in tennis, which awards no ranking points.
	   Asked what he would do with his share of the cash, Rios said,
``put it in the bank.''
	   ``I'm not the type of guy who buys houses or cars,'' he said.
	   Rios, Australian Open runner-up, said he thought of quitting.
``But once you are in the match, you're winning, you see all the
crowd, you are just going to do your best.''
	   The 22-year-old Chilean said his back started hurting the night
before the match. ``But you don't want to go home without a final
like this, playing Andre,'' Rios said.
	   Rios, the highest-ranked player in the event at No. 3, was in
pain early in the match.
	   He was given a massage by a trainer after the third game and
took an injury timeout two games later. He was stretched on the
floor for a couple of minutes while the trainer worked on his back.
	   But he still won the set, hitting a spectacular running backhand
passing shot.
	   With Rios wincing in pain nearly every time he hit the ball,
Agassi won the next set, although Rios produced one of its
highlights: winning a point while sitting on the floor after
slipping and falling on the hard-court surface.
	   Rios won five of his six service games in the third set at love,
but was less error-free in the fourth.
	   Serving to save the match in the fifth, Agassi produced a
double-fault to give Rios three match points. Agassi saved one, but
then committed another double-fault to surrender.
	   Williams said she didn't think about the money during the match.
	   ``It's a nice bonus for winning,'' she said. ``It's a nice prize
pool but generally when you're playing here you are trying to win
your matches.''
	   Schnyder said she had trouble reading Williams's shots.
	   ``It's hard to assess her balls coming high and low,'' she said.
``You make a lot of mistakes. Her serve was sometimes too fast for
me, even her second.''

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ With the divisive and distracting issue of
liberalized citizenship for ethnic Russians put behind them,
Latvian politicians on Sunday turned to the question of forming a
government.
	   Negotiations among the six parties that won seats in Saturday's
national elections are expected to take several days and could be
complicated because there are few traditional alliances to rely on.
	   The party that won the most votes didn't even exist six months
ago and is led by former prime minister Andris Skele, who made
enemies across the political spectrum before leaving the post last
year.
	   But it could be relatively easy in comparison with the tensions
over the citizenship referendum that was also voted on Saturday,
which pitted nationalist sentiment against pragmatism.
	   Voters approved easing naturalization laws by a 53-45 margin, a
slim margin statistically but substantial in light of the strong
resentment many Latvians feel for the country's huge ethnic Russian
community.
	   Some 450,000 of the Russians are non-citizens, having become
stateless with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most of the
Russians came to Latvia during a halfcentury of Soviet rule, or are
their descendants, and many ethnic Latvians see them as unwelcome
remnants of a hated regime.
	   Latvia's naturalization laws placed high obstacles for the
stateless Russians who wanted to become citizens, requiring many of
them to wait until the next milennium even to apply.
	   Amid shrill denunciations from Russia and measured, but still
strong, criticism from the West, the Saeima parliament passed
liberalizing amendments in June. But nationalist politicians
mounted a referendum drive to overturn the changes.
	   Although the eased laws won't make naturalization necessarily
easy _ Russian speakers will still have to labor to learn Latvian _
the referendum paid off Sunday with something rare for Latvia: a
favorable word from Russia.
	   ``It is better to have Russia as a friendly neighbor than to
violate the rights of our compatriots,'' Russian Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Approving the changes also means Latvia neutralized an issue
that could have blocked its dream of becoming a European Union
member. Now, the country can proceed with another challenge in
achieving the dream: building up its economy.
	   The parties that won Saeima seats are generally in agreement on
economic matters, desiring to continue the market-oriented moves
that have produced large pockets of prosperity and renovation after
a half-century of Soviet shabbiness.
	   Much of Latvia's new prosperity has come from being an important
transit point between Russia and the West. Skele in particular
wants to solidify the economy by building up domestic production.
	   Skele's People's Party was at the top of the results with 20.9
percent. The conservative Latvia's Way had 18 percent, followed by
the National Harmony Party, Fatherland and Freedom, the Union of
Social Democrats and the New Party.

U.N. envoy in Iran to discuss problems with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Afghan leader &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The U.N. special envoy arrived here Sunday
to discuss the deepening conflict between Tehran and Afghanistan's
Taliban militia, which has seen both sides move troops to the
border.
	   During his five-day visit, Lakhdar Brahimi will hold talks with
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his deputy, Mohsen Aminzadeh,
who is responsible for Afghan affairs.
	   Brahimi told reporters at the airport that he also hopes to meet
with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   He was to fly to Pakistan on Thursday.
	   ``I will not be going to Afghanistan because U.N personnel are
not allowed to travel there for security reasons,'' Brahimi said.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the Taliban's main backer, and
Iran has been accused of supporting the Afghan opposition in the
north.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia admitted that its forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and
a journalist after taking the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Two diplomats escaped and made their way
home.
	   The Taliban, which rules about 90 percent of Afghanistan, said
renegade fighters killed the Iranians. But Taliban leaders have
refused Iranian demands that the killers be handed over.
	   In a statement released in Pakistan to the privately run News
Network International, the Taliban's reclusive leader said the
slain Iranians were not diplomats, but military personnel, and
accused Iran of ``repeatedly'' interfering in Afghanistan's
internal affairs.
	   ``If foreign interference continues..., it would force the
Taliban to take action,'' Mullah Mohammed Omar said.
	   Iran's response has been to deploy more than 200,000 Iranian
troops on the border with Afghanistan for military maneuvers.
Taliban leaders say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border in
response to the war games.
	   The Taliban on Friday accused Iran of violating its air space
during the maneuvers. Iran denied the allegation.
	   The Taliban continues to hold some 50 Iranian nationals. Tehran
says most were working as drivers delivering aid to Afghans
hard-hit by the war.
	   Apparently mindful of Brahimi's tour, Omar warned the United
Nations against using the killings of the Iranians as an excuse to
deny the Taliban recognition at U.N. headquarters in New York,
where the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani still
holds the Afghanistan seat.
	   ``It is highly regrettable that the United Nations still accord
recognition to the ousted and rejected Rabbani regime in sheer
violations of its own principles,'' said Omar in the statement
released in Pakistan. Rabbani's alliance controls barely 10 percent
of the country.
	   Omar's statement said every government has a right to introduce
the laws of its choice and the U.N. should not object to its stern
interpretation of Islam.
	   ``If the United Nations does not respect the aspirations of
Afghan majority and turns a blind eye to the ground realities...
then we will be left with no other option, but to make decisions on
our own,'' he said.

Former Swiss president Jean-Pascal Delamuraz dies at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Swiss president and economics
minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz died Sunday, the Swiss government
announced. He was 62.
	   The cause of Delamuraz's death, six months after he left office
on health grounds, was not given.
	   Born in Paudex, near Lausanne, in 1936, he studied law and
political science at the University of Lausanne.
	   Delamuraz was president of this Alpine country in 1989 and 1996.
He courted international controversy last year with his role in
Swiss attempts to set up a fund to compensate victims of the Nazi
Holocaust.
	   Delamuraz accused Jewish groups lobbying for the fund of
``blackmail.'' The remark prompted an international outcry and a
public relations debacle for the country. Delamuraz eventually
apologized for it.
	   The Swiss government subsequently proposed a 7 billion Swiss
franc (dlrs 5 billion) fund for a range of humanitarian causes,
including victims of the Holocaust.
	   Delamuraz joined the seven-member Federal Council, or cabinet,
as defense minister in 1984 and was economics minister from 1987
until his resignation earlier this year.
	   He belonged to the centrist Radical Democrats, one of four
parties in the governing coalition that shares out the cabinet
seats.
	   The popular Delamuraz took Switzerland into the World Trade
Organization, but suffered a setback in 1992 when the Swiss
electorate voted against joining a loose European free trade
grouping. The government then froze an application to join the more
closely knit 15-nation European Union, which surrounds the country.
	   Delamuraz left office in March this year after announcing in
January that, for health reasons, he was no longer certain he could
carry out his duties.
	   Last year, he underwent an operation for liver cancer. This
followed heart operations in 1992 and 1995.
	   Delamuraz is survived by his wife, Catherine, and their son and
daughter. Details of funeral arrangements were not immediately
available.

Liberalizing laws for Russians shows Latvia at a turning point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Latvian electorate's approval of
measures easing citizenship requirements for ethnic Russians was
less than resounding _ but represents a marked change in Latvian
psychology all the same.
	   ``We are becoming a civilized country,'' is how Janis Jurkans,
deputy leader of the National Harmony Party, put it early Sunday as
results from a national referendum came in.
	   Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia
had suffered the typical divorce syndrome: celebrate the new
freedom, then stew for years about wrongs committed during the
marriage.
	   For many Latvians, Russian conversations overheard on any
streetcorner in Riga were nettling reminders of how hundreds of
thousands of Russians streamed in during the Soviet years, leaving
ethnic Latvians feeling they were about to become a minority in
their own land.
	   The naturalization laws that the country established after
independence left the Russians suddenly stateless. They weren't
prevented from applying for citizenship, but many would have to
wait years _ the older the person, the longer the wait.
	   The first in-last out arrangement was clearly aimed at punishing
those who had arrived in the first wave of Russification. Worse,
statelessness was extended to children born to ethnic Russians in
independent Latvia.
	   That vexed the Kremlin and the two countries seemed unable to
stop antagonizing each other.
	   Often-overstated denunciations from Russia _ such as one
official's claim that Latvia was committing ``genocide'' _
reinforced Latvia's angry fear of Russia and played into the hands
of nationalists, who would exacerbate matters with ceremonies
honoring the Latvian SS.
	   In such an emotionally charged environment, getting 53 percent
of the voters to say they want to treat Russians more liberally was
a substantial showing that Latvians are learning how to forget past
wrongs.
	   Some hurdles remain: Although Latvia has now liberalized its
citizenship laws, citizenship still requires a knowledge of
Latvian. It is unclear if the government is capable of underwriting
the instruction of hundreds of thousands of people in a language
unrelated to their mother tongue.
	   The government has also been debating a language law that would
require Latvian to be used not only in state operations, but in
some private business spheres; medium proficiency in Latvian would
be required of hair-dressers, for instance.
	   For ethnic Russians, many of whom grew up in all-Russian
communities and learned no other language in school, that is a high
hurdle to clear.
	   But Russia may also be inclined too to learn to forget. Deep in
an economic crisis, it's unlikely the country can afford the trade
sanctions it once threatened against Latvia. If it were to cut off
its oil exports that flow through Latvia, it would lose foreign
income that it needs now more than ever.
	   Meanwhile, Latvia, by passing the citizenship changes, is in a
stronger position to pursue its bid to join the European Union,
which many believed would be torpedoed if the old laws stayed.
	   Concentrating on further strengthening its economy _ already
notable for strong growth, negligible inflation and a stable
currency _ can divert Latvia from thinking too much about past
wrongs.
	   In Riga's Old Town a brutally ugly Soviet-era building houses a
museum detailing the suffering of the occupation years. The
building stands on the site of an elaborate 14th century
guildhouse, built when Riga was a major Hanseatic League city, and
destroyed in World War II.
	   A replica of the guildhouse is under construction, and its frame
towers over the museum catologing Soviet wrongs.
	   Latvia isn't forgetting the past entirely, but the country's
attention is focusing more on the past as a model for achievement
than as a justification for resentment.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with report senior army officer killed in crash.
UPDATES throughout. Changes overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A senior military officer was killed in
the crash of an airplane in western Uganda which was reportedly on
its way to eastern Congo, a radio report said Sunday.
	   The private Capital Radio, citing Transport Minister John
Nasasira, said the army had found the remains of Col. Jet Mwebaze,
the brother of acting Chief of Staff James Kazini, who was among
the nine passengers of the plane which crashed Sept. 25.
	   No confirmation of the report was immediately available Sunday
evening, but a reporter from the independent newspaper The Monitor
said he saw a helicopter arrive at Entebbe airport Sunday carrying
five survivors of the crash and two coffins.
	   Mwebaze was one of four additional passengers on the twin-engine
Islander who had gone missing since the plane crash-landed in the
foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda.
	   The army this week had already found the remains of the pilot
who was killed in the crash and on Thursday said it found five
survivors roaming the remote area. Another four passengers,
including Mwebaze, had last been reported missing.
	   It was unclear Sunday whether the remaining three passengers had
been found.
	   Meanwhile, the government-owned Sunday Vision newspaper said the
flight plan filed by the Ugandan pilot had been altered, apparently
to conceal its real destination in eastern Congo.
	   The destination of the plane, which took off nine days ago from
Entebbe airport, was erased and the town of Kasese, 390 kilometers
(245 miles) west of Kampala, was inserted, the Sunday Vision
reported.
	   The airplane crashed later that day near Kisomoro, about 60
kilometers (38 miles) north of Kasese.
	   The newspaper quoted a sister of one of the passengers as saying
the group was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo,
en-route to Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by
Congolese rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila has accused Rwanda and Uganda of spearheading the
rebellion against him. Both countries maintain they are concerned
about Rwandan and Ugandan rebels operating against their
governments from bases in eastern Congo, but have not openly
admitted to militarily backing the Congolese rebellion.
	   Earlier this week Ugandan military officials said the plane had
been spotted over Kasese but never landed. They later gave a
contradicting statement that the plane had been destined for
Kasese.
	   The newspaper said three of the passengers had business links
with Kenya, Uganda and Congolese towns of Bunia and Kisangani.
	   The passengers also included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese
and several Ugandans.

	   TOURS, France (AP) _ Jacky Durand of France clinched the
Paris-Tours World Cup cycling race on Sunday after a winning a
sprint finish against Italian Mirco Gualdi.
	   Durand, who races for the Casino team, collects 100 World Cup
points for winning the 254 kilometer (141 mile) race from Paris to
Tours. He covered the distance in 5 hours 45 minutes 14 seconds.
	   Gualdi, who rides for the Polti team, picks up 75 points and
finished two seconds behind.
	   In wet conditions, the two riders broke away from the pack two
kilometers from the end, and Durand powered away to become the
first French winner of the Paris-Tours race since Albert Bouvet's
victory in 1956.
	   Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu, Durand's teammate, was third, 31
seconds behind the winner but ahead of Italians Stefano Zanini in
fourth and Nicola Minali in fifth.
	   Michele Bartoli, of the Asics team, could have regained his
World Cup title with a good finish on Sunday but didn't figure
among the leaders.

Russian delegation meets Milosevic as NATO threatens strikes

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, while Yugoslav generals
prepared to defend the country.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
met with Milosevic and Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic, to discuss possible NATO intervention
in Kosovo _ Serbia's southern province _ to end seven months of
bloodshed.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that
Yugoslavia's defense minister and top general had also attended,
and that Ivanov handed Milosevic a message from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, but offered no details.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office afterward said any NATO
strike would be an ``act of aggression'' and asserted that in
Kosovo the overall situation is ``improving daily.''
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement again
expressing opposition to any NATO intervention in Kosovo without
the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a
veto-carrying member.
	   A Yugoslav statement afterward said the leadership wanted the
Kosovo dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we
shall defend our country with all means.''
	   Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert,
even as Serbian authorities indicated they were ready for
compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious
Serbian province.
	   A Western diplomat also said that up to 120 Yugoslav army
armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out of Kosovo
so far.
	   The Serb side reported no fighting Sunday, beyond two attacks on
civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, in which one
person was wounded. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, said the Serb Media Center.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reports for the Albanian
side, said there was heavy fighting between government forces and
the guerrillas, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Despite the apparent Serbian moves to withdraw, NATO countries
continued preparations.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported Britain preparing ground
troops and armored units, to be deployed in a post-airstrike
peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to confirm or deny
the report but repeated Britain was ready to participate in a NATO
attack.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in a seven-month crackdown. The conflict has
killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left upward
of 275,000 villagers refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the proposed
interim council, in which Serbs outnumber majority Albanians.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict.
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans to report Monday to the Security
Council on whether Belgrade is complying with demands to halt its
assault on ethnic Albanians. If not, Washington has indicated that
NATO air strikes will follow within two weeks.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   Human Rights watch, in a report issued Sunday, said both the
authorities and have committed atrocities in seven months of
conflict, but government abuses have been on a far greater scale.

Zoff names Ventola, Totti for Euro 2000 qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Looking for fresh firepower, Italy coach Dino Zoff
on Sunday called up young strikers Nicola Ventola and Francesco
Totti for next weekend's Euro 2000 qualifier against Switzerland.
	   Zoff also selected two relatively untested goalkeepers,
20-year-old Gianluigi Buffon and Francesco Toldo, in naming his
20-man roster for the Group 1 match Saturday at Udine. Regular
starter Angelo Peruzzi is hurt.
	   With Christian Vieri and Roberto Baggio, Italy's top two
forwards at last summer's World Cup, nursing injuries, Zoff turned
to two of the most promising players in the country.
	   Ventola, 20, leads Internazionale of Milan with three goals in
Serie A play, while Totti, 22, is the focal point of AS Roma's
potent attack.
	   Lazio of Rome defender Giuseppe Favalli is the only other
newcomer.
	   Just one player was called from outside the Italian League,
defender Christian Panucci of Spain's Real Madrid.
	   Italy beat Wales 2-0 Sept. 5 in Zoff's debut as coach. He
replaced Cesare Maldini after the Azzurri were bounced from the
World Cup in the quarterfinals.
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers _ Gianluigi Buffon (Parma), Francesco Toldo
(Fiorentina)
	   Defenders _ Fabio Cannavaro (Parma), Giuseppe Favalli (Lazio),
Paolo Maldini (Milan), Christian Panucci (Real Madrid), Gianluca
Pessotto (Juventus), Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina)
	   Midfielders _ Demetrio Albertini (Milan), Jonathan Bachini
(Udinese), Giuliano Giannichedda (Udinese), Dino Baggio (Parma),
Diego Fuser (Parma), Luigi Di Biagio (Roma), Eusebio Di Francesco
(Roma)
	   Forwards _ Enrico Chiesa (Parma), Alessandro Del Piero
(Juventus), Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus), Francesco Totti (Roma),
Nicola Ventola (Inter).

Confused Ajax loses again; Feyenoord drops first points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The troubles of the top Dutch
teams worsened Sunday as Ajax went down 2-0 at lowly Sparta and
Feyenoord scraped a point 1-1 at FC Twente.
	   Feyenoord (6-1-0), eliminated this week from the UEFA Cup,
remains unbeaten and leads a highly unpredictable league by two
points from Twente and Vitesse Arnhem, with a game in hand.
	   Ajax's second defeat of the campaign reduced it to sixth with 14
points and the third of the traditional Dutch ``big three'', PSV
Eindhoven, is down in tenth with just ten points.
	   Sparta strikers Erik Tammer and Dennis Krijgsman did the damage
with a goal each, exposing the frailty of Ajax defenders Ole
Tobiasen and Mario Melchiot respectively.
	   Feyenoord was stunned by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's header on
62 minutes. Peter van Vossen made it worse just two minutes later
when he was sent off for a wild tackle from behind on German
defender Joerg Sobiech.
	   But it took just five minutes more for Twente's Erik ten Hag to
produce a bizarre back-headed own goal and pull the Rotterdammers
back into the game.
	   In Sunday afternoons's other games Vitesse Arnhem played a
scoreless draw with De Graafschap Doetinchem, NEC Nijmegen won 3-2
at FC Utrecht and AZ Alkmaar downed RKC Waalwijk 3-2.
	   And in the evening game SC Heerenveen climbed to fourth with a
2-1 victory over NAC Breda.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cardoso voting, color, quotes; polls
 &UR; Cardoso support strong as Brazil goes to polls
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso was the overwhelming favorite in Sunday's national
elections, getting a boost from fear of a deepening economic
crisis.
	   An imminent recession and soaring unemployment have overshadowed
the election, as the market panic that struck Asia and Russia now
targets Brazil, the world's ninth-largest economy.
	   ``The important thing is not to switch drivers in the middle of
the race,'' said Marcio Karte, a Rio newsstand dealer who voted for
the president.
	   Some 106 million voters went to the polls Sunday to choose a
president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies, a third of the
81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators. Voting is mandatory for
Brazilians between 18 and 70.
	   Pollsters unanimously predict Cardoso will be re-elected to a
second four-year term on the first ballot.
	   A survey taken Friday by the Datafolha polling institute gave
Cardoso 49 percent of the votes, compared to 26 percent for his
closest rival, former labor leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the
Workers Party. The poll questioned 21,057 people nationwide and had
a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
	   If he gets less than half the valid votes, which excludes blank
and voided ballots, Cardoso would face the No. 2 finisher in a
runoff on Oct. 25.
	   Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist, has held steady even as
Brazil lost the confidence of international investors _ and despite
promises to cut spending and even raise taxes if elected.
	   ``I voted for him even though he led the country into the
crisis, because he's the only one who can get us out,'' said
Rodrigo Jelmayer, a third-year law student in Sao Paulo.
	   Polls opened at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and close at 5 p.m. (2000
GMT). Voting was mostly peaceful, although army troops were
stationed in northern states with high Indian populations or a
history of land conlicts. A ban on liquor sales was in effect in
most of the country.
	   As usual, a ban on last-minute campaigning was widely flouted.
In Rio, 23 people were arrested for pamphleting.
	   Cardoso voted just before noon in Sao Paulo. He flashed a ``V''
sign to photographers but declined to talk to reporters. Lula voted
earlier in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo
where he worked for years as a factory lathe operator.
	   For the first time, more than half of Brazilian voters will use
electronic voting machines instead of paper ballots. The electronic
votes will be tallied in 24 hours, but the rest won't be counted
until Friday, electoral officials say.
	   Cardoso has pledged strong measures to control a ballooning
budget deficit of more than 70 billion reals, or dlrs 60 billion.
Fear that the government won't get financing has scared away
investors.
	   Many economists predict a recession in 1999 and even worse
unemployment, which unions now put at 18 percent of the work force.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan is heading negotiations for an
emergency loan package with the International Monetary Fund and
other public and private lenders, reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion.
	   Cardoso's success may hinge on the strength _ and cooperation _
of his inconstant five-party coalition in Congress. Legislators are
to vote on long-delayed reforms to cut spending and raise revenue.
	   Meanwhile, voters hope he can revive the magic of the Plano
Real, the economic program that eliminated 2,400 percent inflation
and propelled him to the presidency in 1994.
	   Markets have the same hope.
	   ``Cardoso has a clear vision and his policies don't stray off
track,'' said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Citibank in Sao
Paulo. ``It's incredible to see how far we've come, after so many
years of mismanagement.''

Lutheran church reopens in Moscow after six decades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Moscow Lutheran church that Soviet authorities
closed down six decades ago, during the era of Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin, reopened on Sunday.
	   The altar of the Lutheran Church of Apostles Peter and Paul was
restored with funds from Germany, the Moscow city government and
the Russian federal government, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The church was founded in 1624 and closed in August 1938, as
Stalin's Communist campaign against religion intensified.
	   The majority of the church's congregation are Germans. Only
about 10 percent are ethnic Russians, ITAR-Tass said.

Former Swiss president Jean-Pascal Delamuraz dies at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Swiss President Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz, whose disparagement of Jewish groups seeking
compensation for Holocaust victims sparked an international outcry,
died Sunday, the Swiss government announced. He was 62.
	   The cause of Delamuraz's death, six months after he left office
on health grounds, was not given.
	   Born in Paudex, near Lausanne, in 1936, Delamuraz was president
in 1989 and 1996. He joined the seven-member Federal Council, or
cabinet, as defense minister in 1984 and was economics minister
from 1987 until his resignation earlier this year.
	   He courted international controversy last year with his role in
Swiss attempts to set up a fund to compensate for Switzerland's
failure to force its banks to track accounts belonging to Holocaust
victims and their families, and for profiting from goods looted by
the Nazis and deposited in Switzerland.
	   Delamuraz accused Jewish groups lobbying for the fund of
``blackmail.'' The remark prompted an international outcry and a
public relations debacle for the country. Delamuraz eventually
apologized.
	   The Swiss government subsequently proposed a 7 billion Swiss
franc (dlrs 5 billion) fund for a range of humanitarian causes,
including victims of the Holocaust.
	   He belonged to the centrist Radical Democrats, one of four
parties in the governing coalition that shares out the cabinet
seats.
	   Delamuraz left office in March this year after announcing in
January that, for health reasons, he was no longer certain he could
carry out his duties.
	   Last year, he underwent an operation for liver cancer. This
followed heart operations in 1992 and 1995.
	   Delamuraz is survived by his wife, Catherine, and their son and
daughter. Details of funeral arrangements were not immediately
available.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Former Swiss president and economics
minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz died Sunday, the Swiss government
announced. He was 62.
	   Delamuraz died of a cancer-related illness in hospital in
Lausanne, six months after he left office on health grounds, Swiss
television reported.
	   Born in Paudex, near Lausanne, in 1936, he studied law and
political science at the University of Lausanne.
	   Delamuraz was president of this Alpine country in 1989 and 1996.
He courted international controversy last year with his role in
Swiss attempts to set up a fund to compensate victims of the Nazi
Holocaust.
	   Delamuraz accused Jewish groups lobbying for the fund of
``blackmail.'' The remark prompted an international outcry and a
public relations debacle for the country. Delamuraz eventually
apologized for it.
	   The Swiss government subsequently proposed a 7 billion Swiss
franc (dlrs 5 billion) fund for a range of humanitarian causes,
including victims of the Holocaust.
	   Delamuraz joined the seven-member Federal Council, or cabinet,
as defense minister in 1984 and was economics minister from 1987
until his resignation earlier this year.
	   He belonged to the centrist Radical Democrats, one of four
parties in the governing coalition that shares out the cabinet
seats.
	   The popular Delamuraz took Switzerland into the World Trade
Organization, but suffered a setback in 1992 when the Swiss
electorate voted against joining a loose European free trade
grouping. The government then froze an application to join the more
closely knit 15-nation European Union, which surrounds the country.
	   Delamuraz left office in March this year after announcing in
January that, for health reasons, he was no longer certain he could
carry out his duties.
	   Last year, he underwent an operation for liver cancer. This
followed heart operations in 1992 and 1995.
	   Delamuraz is survived by his wife, Catherine, and their son and
daughter. Details of funeral arrangements were not immediately

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a seaside beach packed with pilgrims,
Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left by war and
totalitarian rule and urged the international community to provide
``timely help'' to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   In his departure remarks, with President Tudjman with him at the
airport, the pope said Croatia ``must show great patience, wisdom,
a willingness to make sacrifices and generous solidarity in order
to overcome definitively the present postwar phase and attain the
noble goals to which she aspires.''
	   ``Democracy comes at a high price; the money to pay for it is
minted from the noble metal of honesty, reasonableness, respect for
others, the spirit of sacrifice, and patience. To claim that it can
be bought with a different currency is to run the risk of
bankruptcy.''
	   Tudjman is often criticized by western governments for
authoritarianism.

Confused Ajax loses again; Feyenoord drops first points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Dutch teams had a tough
day Sunday as Ajax went down 2-0 at lowly Sparta and Feyenoord
scraped a point with a 1-1 tie at FC Twente.
	   Feyenoord (6-1-0), eliminated this week from the UEFA Cup,
remains unbeaten and leads the league with 19 points, two over
Twente and Vitesse Arnhem, with a game in hand.
	   Ajax's second defeat of the season reduced it to sixth, with 14
points, and the third of the traditional Dutch ``big three'', PSV
Eindhoven, is in 10th place with just 10 points.
	   Sparta strikers Erik Tammer and Dennis Krijgsman did the damage
with a goal each, exposing the frailty of Ajax defenders Ole
Tobiasen and Mario Melchiot respectively.
	   Feyenoord was stunned by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's header at
62 minutes. Peter van Vossen made it worse just two minutes later
when he was sent off for a wild tackle from behind on German
defender Joerg Sobiech.
	   But it took just five minutes more for Twente's Erik ten Hag to
produce a bizarre back-headed own goal and pull the Rotterdammers
back into the game.
	   In Sunday afternoon's other games: Vitesse Arnhem played a
scoreless draw with De Graafschap Doetinchem, NEC Nijmegen won 3-2
at FC Utrecht and AZ Alkmaar downed RKC Waalwijk 3-2.
	   And in the evening game, SC Heerenveen climbed to fourth with a
2-1 victory over NAC Breda.

Aga Khan fetes May marriage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ King Juan Carlos of Spain was among 800
weekend guests feting the May marriage of Prince Karim Aga Khan,
the spiritual leaders of the world's Ismaili Muslims.
	   The Aga Khan wed Gabriele zu Leiningen in a private ceremony at
his estate, Aiglemont, in Gouvieux, 25 miles north of Paris near
Chantilly, on May 30. It was the second marriage for both.
	   The October reception was planned at the time of the marriage.
	   The Spanish monarch and his wife Sophie, along with former
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, were among the guests
invited to the reception.
	   Juan Carlos returned to Spain by special plane Sunday afternoon,
according to police in the town of Oise.
	   The Frankfurt-born bride, 35, a consultant at the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, took
the Muslim name ``Inaara'' upon her marriage to the 61-year-old Aga
Khan, his office said at the time, adding that the princess'
six-year-old daughter from her first marriage to Karl-Emich Prince
zu Leiningen was to live with her mother in France and Switzerland.
	   The Aga Khan is the 49th imam of the Ismaili community which has
a following of 12-15 million people worldwide. He has three
children from his first marriage to English-born Princess Salimah,
all of whom work at his headquarters at Aiglemont.

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ With the divisive and distracting issue of
liberalized citizenship for ethnic Russians put behind them,
Latvian politicians on Sunday turned to the question of forming a
government.
	   Negotiations among the six parties that won seats in Saturday's
national elections are expected to take several days and could be
complicated because there are few traditional alliances to rely on.
	   The party that won the most votes didn't even exist six months
ago and is led by former prime minister Andris Skele, who made
enemies across the political spectrum before leaving the post last
year.
	   Tensions also may remain over the over Saturday's other balllot
_ acitizenship referendum pitting nationalist sentiment against
pragmatism.
	   Voters approved easing naturalization laws by a 53-45 margin, a
slim margin statistically but substantial in light of the strong
resentment many Latvians feel for the country's huge ethnic Russian
community.
	   Some 450,000 of the Russians are non-citizens, having become
stateless with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most of the
Russians came to Latvia during a half-century of Soviet rule, or
are their descendants, and many ethnic Latvians see them as
unwelcome remnants of a hated regime.
	   Latvia's naturalization laws placed high obstacles for the
stateless Russians who wanted to become citizens, requiring many of
them to wait until the next milennium even to apply.
	   Amid shrill denunciations from Russia and measured, but still
strong, criticism from the West, the Saeima parliament passed
liberalizing amendments in June. But nationalist politicians
mounted a referendum drive to overturn the changes.
	   Although the eased laws won't make naturalization necessarily
easy _ Russian speakers will still have to labor to learn Latvian _
the referendum paid off Sunday with something rare for Latvia: a
favorable word from Russia.
	   ``It is better to have Russia as a friendly neighbor than to
violate the rights of our compatriots,'' Russian Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Approving the changes also means Latvia neutralized an issue
that could have blocked its dream of becoming a European Union
member.
	   The parties that won Saeima seats are generally in agreement on
joining the EU and other economic matters, desiring to continue the
market-oriented moves that have produced large pockets of
prosperity and renovation after a half-century of Soviet
shabbiness.
	   Much of Latvia's new prosperity has come from being an important
transit point between Russia and the West. Skele in particular
wants to solidify the economy by building up domestic production.
	   Skele's People's Party was at the top of the results with 20.9
percent. The conservative Latvia's Way had 18 percent, followed by
the National Harmony Party, Fatherland and Freedom, the Union of
Social Democrats and the New Party.

crash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A senior Ugandan military officer was
killed when an airplane reportedly headed for rebel-held Congo
crashed in western Uganda, a radio report said Sunday.
	   The private Capital Radio, citing Transport Minister John
Nasasira, said the army had found the remains of Col. Jet Mwebaze,
among nine passengers on the plane which crashed Sept. 25. Mwebaze
was the brother of acting Chief of Staff James Kazini,
	   No confirmation of the report was immediately available Sunday
evening, but a reporter from the independent newspaper The Monitor
said he saw a helicopter arrive at Entebbe airport Sunday carrying
five survivors of the crash and two coffins.
	   The army found the five survivors wandering the remote area last
week, as well as the remains of the pilot.
	   Mwebaze was one of four passengers on the twin-engine Islander
who had gone missing after the plane crash-landed in the foothills
of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda.
	   It was unclear Sunday whether the remaining three passengers had
been found.
	   Meanwhile, the government-owned Sunday Vision newspaper said the
flight plan filed by the Ugandan pilot had been altered, apparently
to conceal its real destination in eastern Congo.
	   The pilot had listed a Congolese destination in the flight plan,
but the destination of the plane was subsequently erased and the
Ugandan town of Kasese, 390 kilometers (245 miles) west of Kampala,
was inserted, Sunday Vision reported.
	   The newspaper quoted a sister of one of the passengers as saying
the group was flying directly to Bunia in northeastern Congo,
en-route to Kisangani, Congo's third largest town now controlled by
Congolese rebels trying to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   The crash of a plane carrying a senior military officer headed
deep inside rebel-held territory would have drawn attention to
Ugandan ties with the rebels.
	   Kabila has accused Uganda of backing the rebel insurgency.
Uganda has denied any direct involvement.
	   The airplane crashed near Kisomoro, about 60 kilometers (38
miles) north of Kasese.
	   The newspaper said three of the passengers had business links
with Kenya, Uganda and in rebel-held Congo.
	   The passengers also included an Israeli, an Asian, a Congolese
and several Ugandans.

1,000 march to protest abortion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 1,000 people marched through Paris Sunday to
protest abortion and decry a newly tabled bill to give homosexual
and unmarried couples legal rights.
	   The demonstration, organized by Renouveau Catholique (Catholic
Renewal), took marchers from the Palais-Royal square on the Right
Bank to Sacre Coeur, the basilica perched on a hill in Montmartre,
in northern Paris.
	   ``A people who kills its children has no future,'' ``To abort is
to kill,'' read banners carried by the crowd.
	   Renouveau Catholique decried the proposal to adjust laws in
favor of unmarried couples, calling it a ``serious attack on the
basis of society, which is the family.''
	   In France, abortion is available on demand in the first 12 weeks
or later if the fetus is badly deformed or if the mother's life is
at risk.
	   The anti-abortion lobby is small but vocal.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Unknown gunmen abducted three Britons and
a New Zealand citizen in Russia's breakaway Chechnya region after a
shootout with their bodyguards, a regional official said Sunday.
	   The four men, who were in Chechnya to install a cellular phone
system, were taken hostage Saturday after 20 men in camouflage
attacked the house where they lived in the Chechen capital Grozny,
said Shadid Bargishev, head of the regional anti-kidnapping
department.
	   The British Foreign Office initially said the four were seized
early Sunday morning, but later said the kidnapping had taken place
at 4 a.m. Saturday. It appealed to Russian authorities ``for their
cooperation for the safe and early return of the men.''
	   One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded in
the fire fight, the Interfax news agency said. Police were
searching regional hospitals for anyone coming in with gunshot
wounds.
	   The British Embassy in Moscow identified the four hostages as
Britons Peter William Kennedy, Darren Eamonn Hickey, and Rudolf
Franz-Joseph Petschi, and Stanley Frederick James Shaw of New
Zealand. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British firm
based in Waybridge, Surrey, that has been working with the Chechen
telecommunications company, an embassy spokesman said.
	   The kidnappers have not set conditions for the men's release,
the spokesman said.
	   The kidnapping took place only 500 meters (550 yards) from the
anti-kidnapping department, Interfax said. Policemen heard the
shots, but didn't react because gunfire is frequent in the evening
in Grozny, the report said.
	   ``Despite the fact that the government of Britain did not
recommend that its citizens visit Chechnya, these four came and did
not inform anybody about their presence, not even law enforcement
bodies,'' Bargishev said.
	   The British Foreign Office said that Britons have been advised
not to go to Chechnya for the last 4 1/2 years.
	   The incident ``will seriously slow down the plan for Chechnya's
revival,'' said Leon Wascinski, head of the Chechen mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to
Interfax.
	   The kidnappers ``whoever they are, are acting in defiance of the
interests of the Chechen people and are doing so deliberately,'' he
said.
	   The kidnapping came just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers, ending the pair's 14 months
of captivity in the turbulent republic in Russia's northern
Caucasus region.
	   Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted by
gangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war with
Russia, and dozens remain held.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been unable
to stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for some
criminal gangs.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago. Moscow says
that Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over its
affairs.

Armed men rob Ukrainian tourists on bus, escape police dragnet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two unidentified gunmen on Sunday held up
a bus with 25 Ukrainian tourists aboard, robbed them of their money
and jewelry, and escaped with a third accomplice on a waiting
scooter.
	   According to police, the 25 were traveling to the Ukranian
capital of Kiev aboard the bus along with the two men. Police did
not know their nationality.
	   Authorities said the bus left central Athens in the early
evening headed for the northern border with Bulgaria. Just 23
kilometers (14 miles) from the capital, the two men pulled out
pistols, ordered the driver to stop the bus and robbed the
passengers of an estimated dlrs 10,000 and an unknown quantity of
jewelry.
	   An accomplice was waiting for them on a scooter. Police launched
a manhunt, but were unable to locate the three men on the scooter.
	   Although armed robberies are not rare in Greece, it was the
first reported theft of its kind in recent memory.

Low turnout in troubled Chiapas state elections

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Ignoring pleas from
authorities and the Roman Catholic Church to turn out for elections
in troubled Chiapas state, voters opted Sunday to stay away in
droves.
	   Most of the 3,123 polling stations opened more or less on time
without incident, but turnout among the southern state's 1.9
million registered voters was extremely low.
	   Chiapas had been a bastion of power for the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party for decades, where it held sway through
repression and fraud at the polls.
	   But a combination of wide support among highland Indians for
Zapatista National Liberation Army rebels; an increase in poverty
and violence; and the feeble government response to last month's
devastating rains and floods has eroded any support the PRI
enjoyed.
	   Bishop Arizmendi Esquivel of Tapachula, near the Guatemalan
border, said Saturday it was the duty of all good Christians to
vote. Despite warm weather, few turned out.
	   In La Hormiga, a community of some 10,000 near San Cristobal de
las Casas, only a score of people lined up to vote when the polling
station opened on time Sunday at 8 a.m.
	   Gabriel Samuel Gomez, 34, an unskilled worker, said he was
voting for the PRI, because that's what he always did. But he
added: ``What can you do? They're all the same. They promise a lot
but when they get into power they forget about all of us poor
people.''
	   It was the same in the big town of Ocosingo, in the heart of the
rebel zone of influence, even though the Zapatistas had announced
Saturday they would do nothing to interfere with the elections and
people could do as they wished.
	   The rebels staged a brief revolt in 1994 to demand democracy and
better living conditions for the predominantly dirt-poor Indians.
	   Hundreds have been killed in sporadic clashes between rebel and
government sympathizers since then, including 45 people _ mostly
women and children _ massacred by a pro-government paramilitary
group on Dec. 22 in the village of Acteal.
	   Up for election are all 40 seats of the state legislature and
the presidents of 103 of the state's 111 counties. Elections in the
other eight counties near the Pacific Coast were postponed until
further notice because of flood damage.
	   The PRI and two other big opposition parties _ the conservative
National Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party _
and five other small political groups have fielded a total of 477
candidates.

Amid new revelations, Dutch remember victims of Israeli jet crash
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Families of victims killed in the
1992 crash of an Israeli cargo plane tearfully marked the sixth
anniversary Sunday amid new revelations that the jet was carrying
an ingredient for nerve gas.
	   Just meters (yards) from the crash site, hundreds of people
gathered to remember the 43 people killed when the El Al Boeing jet
carved a nine-story gash in an apartment complex on the outskirts
of Amsterdam.
	   The anguish triggered by the worst Dutch air disaster has began
to ease, say some family members. But a confirmation last week by
the Israeli government that the plane was carrying a chemical that
can be used to produce the nerve gas sarin, has rekindled memories
of that horrific crash on Oct. 4, 1992.
	   ``I don't want to hear it anymore,'' said Dolene Johnson, who
came to Sunday's memorial ceremony with her daughter. ``Every time
a new detail comes out, I have to start grieving all over again.''
	   Johnson's 24-year-old son, Ricki Tjin-Sie, was playing
basketball with his friends in the Bijlmer neighborhood on the
night of the crash. His body was found amid the smoldering rubble.
	   ``He didn't come home and we thought he was just missing, but
then came the dreadful news,'' said Johnson.
	   The annual memorial ceremony began with a procession through the
labyrinthian streets of the low-income, heavily immigrant
neighborhood infamous for its massive apartment buildings.
	   Led by Dutch Transportation Minister Tineke Netelenbos, families
walked in silence through litter-strewn streets. Around them were
towering apartments inhabited mostly by foreigners drawn to the
cheap rents of the neighborhood.
	   The procession ended at the crash site monument, where families
laid their wreaths and muffled cries gave way to wails and sobs.
Overcome by grief, one woman fainted and was treated by a first-aid
worker.
	   The ceremony also was attended by residents, many of whom have
complained of health problems they said are linked to the crash.
Last week, neighborhood doctors said some 300 residents are
suffering psychiatric disorders and unspecified physical complaints
as a result of the crash.
	   Experts have yet to pin down the exact cause, but new details of
the plane's ominous cargo have renewed calls for a comprehensive
investigation.
	   Last week, the Israel government acknowledged for the first time
that the plane was carrying a chemical that can be used to produce
the deadly gas sarin.
	   Up to 190 liters (50 gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate
(DMMP) on board the plane came from an American company in
Pennsylvania and was headed for the Israel Institute for Biological
Research in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona.
	   An Israeli government statement said the order had been made
``with the approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce for the
testing of filters.'' There have also been conflicting reports on
whether DMMP by itself is poisonous.
	   Coinciding with the Israeli confirmation, the Dutch government
announced it will hold a parliamentary inquiry to clarify exactly
what was aboard the plane.
	   ``If this had happened in a rich area, we would have had the
biggest investigation already,'' said Lidy Seinen, who attended the
memorial ceremony with a friend. ``Nothing will be changed _ those
people are dead _ but the truth must come out.''

Ohio State a strong No. 1; Arizona, Georgia crack AP Top 10
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Arizona and Georgia are no longer sleepers. The
Wildcats and Bulldogs muscled their way into the top 10 with
impressive road victories over the weekend.
	   Georgia (4-0) made the biggest leap in this week's Associated
Press' Top 25 college football poll, moving from No. 12 to No. 7
after Saturday night's 28-27 win over LSU at Baton Rouge. Arizona
(5-0) jumped four spots to No. 10 with a 31-28 victory over
Washington at Seattle.
	   Ohio State remained No. 1 for the fifth consecutive week after a
28-9 win over Penn State. The Buckeyes (4-0) were a near-unanimous
choice, receiving 66 of the 70 first-place votes and 1,746 points
from the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. Last
week, Ohio State had 58 first-place votes and 1,737 points.
	   Nebraska (5-0), with a close-call 24-17 victory over Oklahoma
State, held the No. 2 spot with one first-place vote and 1,640
points. Last week, the Cornhuskers had seven first-place votes and
1,660 points.
	   The rest of the Top 25 deck was shuffled a bit as UCLA (3-0), a
49-17 winner over Washington State, moved up a spot to No. 3, while
Tennessee (4-0) dropped a notch to No. 4 after a 17-9 win over
Auburn. UCLA had one first-place vote and 1,575 points.
	   Kansas State (4-0), which did not play on Saturday, remained No.
5 with two first-place votes and 1,519 points, followed by No. 6
Florida, No. 7 Georgia, No. 8 Florida State, No. 9 Virginia and No.
10 Arizona.
	   Florida (4-1) used a 16-10 win over Alabama to jump two spots,
while Penn State, ranked No. 7 last week, fell to No. 13 after its
loss at Ohio State.
	   LSU dropped five places to No. 11, followed by No. 12 Wisconsin,
No. 13 Penn State, No. 14 Colorado, No. 15 Oregon, No. 16 West
Virginia, No. 17 Virginia Tech, No. 18 Texas A-and-M, No. 19 USC
and No. 20 Arkansas.
	   Missouri was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Notre Dame, No. 23 North
Carolina State, No. 24 Syracuse and No. 25 Tulane.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Ohio
State, Nebraska, UCLA, Kansas State and Tennessee.
	   Tulane, 4-0 after a 21-7 win over Southern Mississippi made the
Top 25 for the first time since Dec. 3, 1979. NC State (3-1), a
38-17 winner over Syracuse last Thursday night, rejoined the
rankings for the second time this season.
	   Washington and Michigan fell out of the Top 25.

 &UR; Government postpones talks on southern Sudan cease-fire &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government saying it is postponing talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan on Sunday demanded a postponement
of talks on renewing a cease-fire agreement with rebels due to
fighting in the south.
	   Gen. Hassan Dahawi, the state minister for social planning,
accused the rebels of using the three-month cease-fire to shift its
forces to Eastern Equatoria, the scene of current fighting, the
Sudan News Agency reported Sunday. The cease-fire ends on Oct. 15.
	   Sudan called for a postponement of the talks ``because the time
was not suitable due to fighting currently taking place,'' the
agency quoted Dahawi as saying.
	   The talks were to be held Monday in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi,
under the auspices of the regional Intergovernmental Authority on
Development.
	   Sudan says the rebel offensive, which began on Sept. 14, aims to
capture the provincial town of Juba, about 1,200 kilometers (750
miles) south of Khartoum. Rebels say they attacked government
positions because the Sudanese air force was bombing civilian
targets in rebel-held areas.
	   Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan under government
control.
	   Dahawi also accused two of IGAD's members, Uganda and Eritrea,
of aiding the main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
in carrying out the offensive.
	   The postponement of the talks cut hopes among aid agencies and
donors that the three-month cease-fire to facilitate aid efforts
would be extended.
	   The government says the cease-fire applies to all of the south,
while the rebels insist it is restricted only to Bahr el-Ghazal,
where famine is widespread.
	   Last month, the European Union said it hoped the cease-fire
would not only be extended but also expanded to cover other
provinces where aid is needed.
	   The 15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militia burn or steal crops to deny food to their
enemies. Some 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
famines.

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a seaside beach packed with pilgrims,
Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left by war and
totalitarian rule and urged the international community to provide
``timely help'' to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   In his departure remarks, with President Tudjman with him at the
airport, the pope said Croatia ``must show great patience, wisdom,
a willingness to make sacrifices and generous solidarity in order
to overcome definitively the present postwar phase and attain the
noble goals to which she aspires.''
	   ``Democracy comes at a high price; the money to pay for it is
minted from the noble metal of honesty, reasonableness, respect for
others, the spirit of sacrifice, and patience. To claim that it can
be bought with a different currency is to run the risk of
bankruptcy.''
	   Tudjman is often criticized by western governments for
authoritarianism.
	   John Paul arrived back in Rome late Sunday evening

League leader Real Madrid loses 1-0 to struggling Betis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid lost its grip of the Spanish
soccer league Sunday, losing 1-0 at home to last placed Betis in
the fifth round.
	   Nigerian international Finidi George's 55th minute smash past
sprawled German keeper Bodo Illgner was enough to give Betis its
first league victory this season.
	   Not that the victory was easy, with Madrid keeping up the
pressure throughout a frantic second half.
	   Coming out keen after the break, Madrid's Clarence Seerdorf of
Holland hit the post within the first minute before Finidi's goal
hit from well outside the box temporarily threw the European
Champions off balance.
	   But Betis failed to capitalize, missing several chances to
extend its lead and giving Madrid time to pull its attack together.
	   Among the clearest opportunities to equalize was a shot from
Raul Gonzalez knocked over the bar by Betis keeper Antonio Prats,
and a thundering shot at goal from Brazilian Roberto Carlos.
	   But the equalizer did not come, and powerhouse Real Madrid
stayed on 10 points, two points behind the new leader of the first
division Zaragoza.
	   Earlier Sunday, Zaragoza gathered up its 12 point total with a
2-0 victory over modest Extremadura.
	   After a goalless first half, Argentina's Kily Gonzalez put
Zaragoza one up in the 56th minute.
	   Bosnian Savo Milosovic scored the second and final goal five
minutes before the final whistle, redeeming himself after fluffing
a penalty conversion five minutes after the break.
	   In Saturday's only fifth round game FC Barcelona trounced
Valencia 3-1, notching up a total of nine points, still one behind
archrival Madrid and three behind the leader.
	   In Sunday's other games, Oviedo claimed a place in the top half
of the table, trouncing Atletico de Madrid 3-1 with two goals from
midfielder Ivan Iglesias and a third from Panamanian Julio Cesar
Dely Valdez.
	   Only a doubtful penalty call allowed the visiting team to
partially redress the balance.
	   Iglesias' first goal came in the 32nd minute and his second in
the 70th, while Dely Valdez added the third in the 84th. Back from
injury, Brazil's tireless midfielder Juninho successfully hit home
a penalty to make it 3-1 just before the match ended.
	   Celta, meanwhile, convincingly beat Athletic de Bilbao 3-2 in a
mid-table battle.
	   Argentine Fernando Caceres headed Celta one up in the 16th
minute and Luboslav Penev of Bulgaria scored the visiting side's
second goal in the 31st.
	   Julen Guerrero got one back for Athletic de Bilbao 10 minutes
after the break, but Penev successfully hit home a penalty to make
it 3-1 in the 62nd.
	   Ismael Urzaiz scored a second compensation goal for Athletic
just before the final whistle blew.
	   In other fifth round matches Sunday, Mallorca drew 1-1 with
Tenerife as did Espanyol against Villarreal, Real Sociedad defeated
Deportivo de La Coruna 2-0, Salamanca beat Valladolid 1-0, and
Racing de Santander overcome Alaves by the same score
 &UR; Mallorca to Tenerife &QC; 
	   Mallorca went ahead in the 12th minute with a goal from
Brazilian Andre Luiz Moreira. Argentine Leo Biagini scored the
equalizer in the 50th minute.
 &UR; Espanyol 1, Villarreal 1 &QC; 
	   Espanyol drew 1-1 with visiting first division newcomer
Villarreal after a goalless first half.
	   The fist goal was scored for Espanyol by Quique Martin Sanchez
in the 55th minute, with Antonio Diaz scoring the equalizer in the
77th.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 2, Deportivo La Coruna 0 &QC; 
	   Oscar de Paula scored for Real Sociedad with 42 minutes played,
and Francisco Jose de Pedro added a second for the home side with a
penalty conversion in the 60th.
 &UR; Salamanca 1, Valladolid 0 &QC; 
	   Argentine Martin Alejandro Cardetti scored the only goal of the
match just before the break that was enough to give Salamanca a 1-0
victory over Valladolid.
 &UR; Alaves 0, Racing de Santander 1 &QC; .
	   Pedro Munitis scored the only goal of the match in the 15th
minute to give Racing de Santander a 1-0 victory over division
newcomer Alaves.

 &UR; French foreign minister meets British counterpart on Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was meeting
Sunday night with his British counterpart to discuss the situation
in Kosovo where threats of a NATO strike loom, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   A ministry spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, provided no details on the meeting between Vedrine and
Robin Cook.
	   The encounter was preceded by a lengthy telephone conversation
between Vedrine and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
spokesman said.
	   Tension surrounding an eventual NATO strike was mounting as
Western leaders sought a way to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to halt attacks on ethnic Albanians and seek a political
settlement to the Kosovo problem.
	   Britain has said it will send four more ground-attack aircraft
to a NATO base in southern Italy on Monday, doubling the number of
Royal Air Force planes there in readiness for an attack on Kosovo.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview Sunday that ``a whole
series of options have been worked through and that we are ready to
move on them.''
	   France is not a member of NATO's military wing, but is
nevertheless consulted.

Kuerten beats Moya to win Mallorca tennis open

tiebreak score; comments from Kuerten &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Brazil's Gustavo
Kuerten won the dlrs 475,000 Mallorca ATP clay court tennis
tournament Sunday, beating the favorite Carlos Moya of Spain in
three sets.
	   World No. 5 Moya took the first set 7-6, winning 7-5 on the
tiebreak, before losing the next two sets to the Brazilian 6-2,
6-3.
	   The two hours and four minute match disappointed the crowd that
had packed into the local bullfighting ring on this Mediterranean
island to support Moya _ a local hero.
	   ``I like to play with that kind of pressure because it motivates
me, while on the other hand I think it made Moya a bit nervous,''
Kuerten told reporters after the match.
	   The Kuerten-Moya final was billed as duel between two Roland
Garros champions, the Brazilian from 1997 and the Spaniard this
year's winner.
	   The tournament's doubles finals pitting Pablo Albano and Daniel
Orsanic of Argentina against Jiri Novak and David Riki of the Czech
Republic was called off because of rain.
	   The organizers said the final would be played next week during
the Palermo Open, the next ATP competition.

Naval officer who married into Doria Pamphili family dies in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Frank Pogson, a former British naval officer who
married into one of Rome's most important noble families and helped
open up the family's 15th century palace to the public, has died in
Rome.
	   The Doria Pamphili family said Pogson, 75, died Friday in Rome.
He had suffered from ill health for some time.
	   After marrying Princess Orietta in London in 1958 and moving to
Rome, Pogson took the initiative of opening up for public visiting
hours the family's private apartments in Doria Pamphili palace, an
complex of buildings near central Piazza Venezia with a base dating
from the early 15th century and later, upper Baroque floors.
	   He also worked to restore the palace gallery, one of Rome's most
important private art collections which reopened two years ago to
the public, allowing them to see masterpieces from artists such as
Titian, Caravaggio and Velazquez. Marble busts and intricately
mirrored rooms are among the highlights.
	   Pogson and the princess met in a church in Ancona, an Italian
seaport on the Adriatic, towards the end of World War II when she
asked him what time it was. She was doing volunteer work to help
Allied troops. He was serving in the British Navy.
	   Born in Maidenhead, England, in 1923, Pogson went on to study
history, one of his passions.
	   He was active in philanthropy, including involvement with a home
for the elderly poor in Rome, and made sure that some of the rooms
of the family's palace in the port city of Genoa were given to
sailors at low rent.
	   Pogson is survived by his wife, son Jonathan and daughter Gesine
and a sister, Margaret.
	   The funeral was scheduled for Monday in the family's parish
church, The Apostle Saints, which dates back to the 6th century.

	   LIDINGO, Sweden (AP) _ Defending champion Isaac Chemobo bested
the course record by a whopping one minute and 41 seconds Sunday as
he won the men's 30-kilometer race in Lidingoloppet, the world's
biggest cross-country festival.
	   Chemobo's winning time was 1 hour, 33 minutes and 33 seconds.
Fellow Kenyan William Musyoki set the old course record in 1996.
	   Philip Rugut and Wilson Omwoyo made it a podium sweep for Kenya,
finishing in 1:34.27 and 1:36.59 respectively. Portugal's Joao
Lopes placed fourth in 1:37.23.
	   Former world marathon champion Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya was
11th.
	   Finland's Annemarie Sandell, who finished fifth in the recent
World Half Marathon Championships, won the women's 15K for the
fourth time in 53.52.
	   More than 23,000 runners competed in the two-day festival on
Lidingo Island outside Stockholm.

 &UR; French foreign minister meets British counterpart on Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from ministry spokesman; ADDS more
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday
night with his British counterpart to discuss the situation in
Kosovo where threats of a NATO strike loom, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   A ministry spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, provided no details on the meeting between Vedrine and
Robin Cook.
	   The encounter was preceded by a lengthy telephone conversation
between Vedrine and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
spokesman said.
	   Vedrine and Cook were discussing ``the decisions that are to be
made on this dossier,'' the spokesman said, refusing to elaborate.
	   Tension surrounding an eventual NATO strike was mounting as
Western leaders sought a way to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to halt attacks on ethnic Albanians seeking greater
autonomy for Kosovo province and find a political settlement to the
crisis.
	   Britain has said it will send four more ground-attack aircraft
to a NATO base in southern Italy on Monday, doubling the number of
Royal Air Force planes there in readiness for an attack on Kosovo.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet meets Monday to formally
approve the use of force unless Milosevic backs down.
	   Also Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to deliver his
own assessment to the Security Council on whether Belgrade is
complying with U.N. demands to halt its assault on ethnic
Albanians.
	   If not, Washington has indicated that NATO air attacks will come
within two weeks.
	   France, active in seeking a solution to the Kosovo crisis, is
not a member of NATO's military wing, but is nevertheless
consulted.

Briton Armstrong coaches team to title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Champion Haka of Valkeakoski lost 1-0
away to VPS Vaasa Sunday in the last round of the Finnish soccer
championship. Haka finished on 48 points from 27 games, and VPS
took the silver medals with 45 points.
	   Haka, coached by Briton Keith Armstrong, secured the title the
week before, as the third promoted team ever in Finland to be
crowned champion.
	   The bronze went to another league newcomer, PK-35 of Helsinki,
coached by former German Bundesliga pro Pasi Rautiainen.
	   The fate of the lesser medals, and the UEFA Cup qualifying spot
to go with second place, was open to the very end. Haka pressed to
score against VPS, and PK-35 went forward in search of a winning
goal against HJK in a local tie. The 1-1-result had PK-35 finishing
on 44 points, one point behind VPS.
	   This year's winning coach Armstrong is immensely popular in
Finnish soccer after a stint as a studio commentator on national TV
during the World Cup in France.
	   Armstrong, 40, who hails from Corbridge, west of Newcastle in
north-eastern England, has lived in Finland for 19 years, winning
three championship titles as a player. The British forward gained
back-to-back gold with OPS of Oulu in 1979 and 1980, and also won
with Kuusysi of Lahti in 1984.
	   ``I scored at Anfield Road against Liverpool (for OPS) in the
European Cup. It was great, but we lost 10-1,'' Armstrong said.
	   As a coach, Armstrong led Haka to the promotion last year, and
added the Cup title as well.
	   But in this year's Cup winners' cup Haka was ousted last week by
Panionios of Greece in the first round on an aggregate score of
5-1.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with exit poll giving Cardoso first-ballot victory;
expected Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; Exit polls show Cardoso a winner on first ballot
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Exit polls showed President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso will win re-election on the first ballot,
the respected Ibope pollsters said Sunday.
	   Ibope said polls showed Cardoso had 54 percent of the vote,
compared to 29 percent for closest rival, former labor leader Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party. Ibope questioned 54,000
voters nationwide.
	   ``We can confirm that (Cardoso) will be the first president
re-elected in Brazilian history,'' Carlos Augusto Montenegro,
president of Ibope, said in a televised interview.
	   Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist, was the overwhelming
favorite in Sunday's national elections, getting a boost from fear
of a deepening economic crisis.
	   ``The important thing is not to switch drivers in the middle of
the race,'' said Marcio Karte, a Rio newsstand dealer who voted for
the president.
	   Some 106 million voters went to the polls Sunday to choose a
president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies, a third of the
81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators. Voting is mandatory for
Brazilians between 18 and 70.
	   But for weeks, the presidential race has been mostly a one-man
show. Cardoso held steady even as Brazil lost the confidence of
international investors _ and despite promises to cut spending and
maybe raise taxes if elected.

Cardoso's past inspires confidence in Brazilians

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ As a college student, he dreamed of
becoming a Roman Catholic cardinal. Now, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso is asking Brazilians to have faith.
	   ``The man who defeated inflation will lick unemployment,'' goes
a re-election campaign slogan.
	   And Brazilians have responded, rallying around the 67-year-old
sociologist as a bastion against the economic chaos that threatens
Brazil.
	   Cardoso draws enduring confidence from the Plano Real, the
economic program he devised in 1994 as finance minister that
slashed 2,400 percent inflation to near zero.
	   But the avuncular Cardoso also comes across as personally
honest, a rare quality among Brazil's recent leaders. The last
freely elected president before Cardoso, Fernando Collor de Mello,
was impeached for corruption.
	   So when Cardoso promised Brazilians austerity and possibly
higher taxes to reduce a bloated budget deficit, many fell in
behind him.
	   It's been a long journey for the Marxist-influenced author and
university professor to today's free-market champion.
	   The son of army Capt. Leonidas Cardoso, he was born in Rio de
Janeiro on June 18, 1931, and raised in upper middle-class comfort.
	   The family shuttled between Rio and Sao Paulo as Capt. Cardoso
rose through the ranks to general and a post in the War Ministry.
The younger Cardoso studied French and the classics and decided to
become a sociologist.
	   After obtaining his doctorate at the University of Sao Paulo in
1961, Cardoso went to Paris for postdoctoral studies in industrial
sociology at the Sorbonne.
	   Back in Brazil, Cardoso was considered a subversive by the
military regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985. He lived in exile in
Chile and France for four years.
	   Cardoso returned to Brazil in 1968 and helped found the
Brazilian Analysis and Planning Center, one of the country's most
prestigious think tanks. He also taught at foreign universities
such as the Sorbonne, Cambridge, Stanford and the University of
California at Berkeley.
	   In 1985, he ran for mayor of Sao Paulo, South America's biggest
city, but narrowly lost to former president Janio Quadros.
	   A year later, he was elected senator for the Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, and in 1987 led a splinter group that
became the Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
	   In October 1992, then-President Itamar Franco appointed him
foreign minister and, six months later, finance minister. With the
success of the Plano Real in 1994, he was elected president on the
first ballot.
	   The president's wife, Ruth Cardoso, is also a sociologist. They
have a son, two daughters and five grandchildren.

	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Wes Smith's broom-handled putter
carried him to a one-stroke victory in the PGA Senior Club
Professional Championship on Sunday.
	   Closing out a 4-under-par 68 by sinking an 18-foot (5.5-meter)
putt on the 18th hole, the 53-year-old teaching pro in Hollywood,
Florida, birdied four of the final six holes.
	   Smith had a 4-under-par 284 for the four rounds, a shot better
than Tommy Price of Hickory, North Carolina. Price shot a 70 on
Sunday.
	   Dick McClean of Kapalua, Hawaii, and Michael Zinni of Mankato,
Minnesota, tied for third at 286 after closing with a 72 and 73,
respectively.
	   McLean led by two strokes through 13 holes before a double bogey
at the par-4 14th hole and a bogey at the par-3 16th.

	   ST. PAUL, Minnesota (AP) _ Andrew Musuva of Kenya won the Twin
Cities Marathon on Sunday for the second straight year and Zinaida
Semenova of Russia captured the women's division.
	   On a cold day in which winds reached 20 mph (32 kph), Musuva was
timed in 2 hours, 15 minutes and 19 seconds _ 20 seconds off his
1997 time.
	   ``I stayed in the pack as long as possible to have others break
the wind,'' Musuva said. ``Just like last year, I wanted to be
patient. I decided to go hard about 22 miles and take the lead.
I've been training in hot weather (in New Mexico), and I'm not too
crazy about the cold.''
	   Andrey Kuznetsov, a 40-year-old Russian, was second in the field
of 7,500 runners, finishing in 2:15:36.
	   Semenova, running her first Twin Cities Marathon, broke away
from Russian compatriot Alina Ivanova halfway through the 26.2-mile
(42.2-kilometer) race and won in 2:32:06. Ivanova, second at Twin
Cities in 1995 and sixth in 1996, was timed in 2:34:04.
	   ``It was very lonely out there,'' Semenova said. ``The wind was
just too strong to be running by yourself. I'm not thrilled with my
time and had hoped to get under 2:30, but that's the best you can
expect with these conditions.''
	   Bev Docherty, 40, of St. Paul, won the women's masters division
in 2:43:23 and placed seventh overall. Mexico's Saul Mendoza won
the men's wheelchair division for the third straight year.

Dortmund stops Munich from setting record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund, showing signs of jelling in a
rebuilding year, on Sunday stopped Bayern Munich from equalling its
own Bundesliga record of seven straight victories to open the
season.
	   Christian Nerlinger, signed away from Munich this season, headed
in the 49th minute over error-prone 37-year-old libero Lothar
Matthaeus in the 49th minute to lift visiting Dortmund to a 2-2
draw.
	   Munich had opened with seven straight victories in the 1995-96
season before Dortmund dealt them a loss.
	   Dortmund, hoping to find the form that carried it to a Champions
Cup triumph two years ago, turned in its best performance under new
coach Michael Skibbe, hired this season to turn the club around.
	   Dortmund dominated the first 20 minutes, jumping ahead 1-0 on
Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat's fifth minute roller off a feed
from Nerlinger.
	   But Munich rattled the club by striking for two goals within
seconds.
	   Giovane Elber directed in a deflected shot by Thorsten Fink in
the 39th minute, followed by the club's big striker, Carsten
Jancker, lofting the ball over Dortmund's diving keeper Stefan Klos
seconds later.
	   Nonetheless, in the wide-open contest with both teams firing
regularly at the goal, Dortmund showed it may be on the way up
again after a hard year following snaring the Champions Cup.
	   Nerlinger's header over a badly positioned Matthaeus led to boos
for the libero, who also showed his age by blundering on both goals
Manchester United scored Wednesday in the 2-2 Champions Cup draw
against Munich.
	   MSV Duisburg, apologizing to the fans in a letter for being
blasted 5-0 by RC Genk in the Cup Winners Cup, made some amends by
posting a 2-0 victory over Stuttgart.
	   Midfielder Thomas Hoersen scored for the team in the 43rd minute
and Markus Beierle in the 56th.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Brazil and France will square off in the
opening match of the Mexico 1999 Confederations Cup, a highly
anticipated sequel to the 1998 World Cup final in which the French
hosts defeated the soccer-loving Brazilians.
	   ``Brazil doesn't have a chance,'' French coach Henri Emile joked
following Sunday's draw for the Jan. 8-20 tournament.
	   The opening game is to be held in Guadalajara's Jalisco stadium,
where the French beat Brazil in the 1986 World Cup.
	   The draw was presided over by FIFA Sports Director Walter Gagg
and CONCACAF President Jack Warner.

Matthaeus joins Basler and Marschall on injury list
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Matthaeus injury, recasts in parts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bayern Munich players Mario Basler and
Lothar Matthaeus Sunday joined striker Olaf Marschall in pulling
out of Germany's upcoming Euro 2000 qualifiers against Turkey and
Moldova.
	   Basler is suffering from a rib injury and won't be available for
the Oct. 10 match in Turkey and four days later in Moldova, his
club said Sunday.
	   Matthaeus, tore a muscle later Sunday in a match against
Borussia Dortmund, adding to the growing injury worries for new
German coach Erich Ribbeck.
	   ``I suppose this proves you should never decide too early on a
starting lineup,'' he said.
	   Marschall, the Kaiserslautern striker who is Bundesliga's
leading scorer with seven goals, said Saturday he had to miss the
two matches because of a strained tendon and bruised heel.
	   Ribbeck, who will make his debut in the Turkey match, also may
be forced to do without expected starter Ulf Kirsten, who is still
recovering from a bruise.
	   The Bayer Leverkusen forward, who received his injury during
Tuesday's UEFA Cup match against Udinese, missed Saturday's
Bundesliga match against Kaiserslautern.
	   Marschall, third on the national team's forward depth chart
behind Oliver Bierhoff and Kirsten, left the match early because of
his injuries after scoring his seventh goal in a 2-2 draw.
	   Ribbeck will also be without Bayern Munich defensive midfielder
Thomas Strunz, who is recovering from leg surgery.
	   The absence of Strunz and Basler will force Ribbeck to rebuild
the right side of his lineup, with Jens Jeremies of Bayern Munich
and Lars Ricken of Borussia Dortmund likely to move in.
	   But Ribbeck said Sunday he may consider building his revamped
squad around Munich and Leverkusen players, with newcomer Carsten
Ramelow and Stefan Beinlich from the latter club filling the right
side.

Congolese rebels say fighting inside key government airbase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels
said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase
in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
	   Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighters
were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold.
	   ``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said. He offered
no details and the report could not be confirmed independently.
	   Rebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu
where the rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President
Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ took up arms
Aug. 2 accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating
division among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa,
after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid.
	   Troops moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel
control, and moving west, had made steady gains against Kindu,
which the government apparently used to build up force for a
planned counter-offensive.
	   Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120
kilometers (75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in
northern Congo that links Sudan and the Central African Republic.
	   Also on Sunday, Ngangura said the rebels took Bumba, 400
kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Kisangani. These reports could
not be confirmed independently either.
	   Rebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel
strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to
join them.
	   The rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila. But the
president has so far refused, accusing the rebels of being puppets
of Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the
rebellion.
	   The conflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo's nine
neighbors, and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed
to stop it.

Morgan tied Irwin with sixth win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID DROSCHAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEMMONS, North Carolina (AP) _ Gil Morgan rallied from four
shots back with a final-round 5-under-par 65 Sunday to win the dlrs
1.5 million Vantage Championship.
	   Morgan's 12-under-par 198 total earned him dlrs 225,000 as he
edged Hale Irwin, who shot a 67, by one shot on the par-70,
6,600-yard (6,033-meter) Tanglewood Park championship course.
	   It was the second major comeback win of the season on the PGA
Senior Tour for Morgan. He came from five shots back in February to
win the LG Championship. Meanwhile, Irwin has two wins and two
seconds in his last four Vantage tournaments.
	   Morgan tied Irwin, the leading money winner on the tour, with
his sixth victory of 1998.
	   Jerry McGee, who started the day with a three-shot lead, tied
for third with Tom Wargo, two shots back. Wargo moved into
contention late with a third-round 64, while McGee birdied the
final hole to salvage a 1-over 71 after a disastrous triple bogey
on the 15th hole.
	   Morgan's win was his 13th on the tour _ six more than his entire
total on the PGA Tour over a 24-year span. Morgan did finish second
or third 41 times on the regular tour.
	   McGee was clinging to a one-shot lead over Morgan and a
two-stroke margin over Irwin and had just saved par on the 14th
hole with a 20-foot (6-meter) putt after escaping two sand traps.
	   But then disaster struck.
	   McGee, who has had trouble off the tee all season, hooked his
drive into the lake on the 15th hole and three-putted for a triple
bogey as his attempt for his first Senior Tour title went up in
smoke.
	   Meanwhile, Morgan, playing in the group ahead of McGee and
Irwin, took the lead for good with a 15-foot (4.6-meter) birdie
putt on the 16th.
	   Terry Dill tied the course record with a 62 and finished at
8-under. Dill birdied five of the opening six holes Sunday to beat
his career-best round by two shots. Irwin and Dave Eichelberger set
the Tanglewood 18-hole record last year when the course played to a
par-71.
	   Dill's 62 was 10 shots better than his second-round score and
also tied the low round on the Senior Tour this season. Irwin has a
pair of 62s, while Jay Sigel and Isao Aoki also posted that score.
None were on par-70 courses.

Palestinian kills four in Baghdad synagogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A Palestinian burst into a Baghdad
synagogue and killed four people Sunday hours before the start of a
Jewish holiday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Mahdy Mohammed Ali al-Sharkawi, a Kuwaiti-born Palestinian, shot
two Jews and two Muslims, the agency reported.
	   Iraq's cabinet, in a meeting chaired by President Saddam
Hussein, condemned the shootings and said that al-Sharkawi ``acted
in a very strange and surprising way.''
	   Iraqi police apprehended al-Sharkawi.
	   The shooting occurred hours before the Jewish festival of
Sukkot, a seven-day holiday commemorating the desert wanderings of
the biblical Israelites.
	   There are only about 100 Jews in Iraq, remnants of what was once
one of the most prosperous and influential Jewish communities in
the Middle East.
	   Some 350,000 Iraqi Jews live in Israel.

Major hospital complex in Alberta demolished after closure order

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ A seven-building complex that used to be
Calgary's leading hospital was blasted into rubble by demolition
experts Sunday, just a few months after it was closed to save
money.
	   While thousands of residents watched from their homes and from
hillside parks, Calgary General Hospital tumbled down in a span of
about nine seconds after the first charge of dynamite exploded.
	   A thick cloud of dust and smoke enveloped nearby homes, many of
which had been evacuated in advance of the demolition.
	   Dozens of hospitals across Canada have been ordered closed in
the past few years as provincial governments try to trim spending
on health care. But Calgary General was the first major hospital in
the country to be demolished.
	   It was of three hospitals in Calgary to be closed recently. The
city of 800,000 is now left with only one trauma center.

Buffalo defeats San Francisco and Chicago wins first game of
</HEADLINE>
season &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Rob Johnson threw for 254 yards
and a touchdown, and Buffalo shut down San Francisco's high-powered
offense for most of the game before surviving a late rally and
beating the 49ers 26-21 Sunday.
	   The Bills, who had won only one of their previous 10 games,
built a 23-0 lead in the third quarter before the 49ers staged a
comeback and pulled within 26-21 on Steve Young's 21-yard TD pass
to J.J. Stokes with 1:03 left.
	   San Francisco (3-1) then tried an onside kick, but it was
recovered by Buffalo (1-3). The 49ers, ranked first in the NFL in
rushing, passing and total offense, were held to 56 yards passing
and 105 total yards in the first half.
 &UR; Bears 31, Lions 27 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Erik Kramer and Edgar Bennett each threw for a
touchdown, and Kramer ran for another in the fourth quarter as the
Bears rallied for their first win of the season.
	   The Bears (1-4), who trailed 27-10 going into the fourth
quarter, held Barry Sanders to 28 yards on 14 carries, one of the
worst games of his career.
	   Kramer was 26-of-37 for 275 yards and two TDs, while Chris Penn
caught six passes for a career-high 106 yards. Lions rookie Charlie
Batch was 16-of-31 for 268 yards and two TDs, and Johnnie Morton
caught two passes for 138 yards, including a 98-yard TD catch.
 &UR; Falcons 51, Panthers 23 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tim Dwight returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for
a touchdown and the Falcons scored their most points in 25 years by
routing the winless Carolina Panthers.
	   Atlanta (3-1) scored three touchdowns in a 48-second span of the
third quarter. Carolina (0-4) fumbled on its first three
possessions of the second half and finished with six turnovers.
	   Dwight set the tone when he took John Kasay's opening kickoff at
the 7, cut through a gaping hole on the left side and cruised all
the way to the end zone.
 &UR; Colts 17, Chargers 12 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, it was billed as the rookie showdown between
Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, but Elijah Alexander and Ken Dilger
stole the show and led the Colts to their first win of the season.
	   Alexander intercepted a pass by Leaf to set up one touchdown and
recovered a fumble to set up another. Dilger ran in a 2-point
conversion on a well-executed fake after the TD and recovered an
onside kick after the Chargers had pulled within two points with
1:48 left.
	   That led to Mike Vanderjagt's third field goal, a 40-yarder that
clinched the game for the Colts (1-4). Manning was 12-of-23 for 137
yards with an interception, while Leaf was 12-of-23 for 150 yards
with an interception for the Chargers (2-3).
 &UR; Jets 20, Dolphins 9 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin rushed for 108
yards and a touchdown as the New York Jets snapped a four-game
losing streak to the Miami Dolphins.
	   Dan Marino had a poor day for the Dolphins (3-1), going 13-of-31
for 121 yards, getting sacked three times and throwing two
interceptions. Miami's running attack also sputtered, gaining just
34 yards.
	   Vinny Testaverde, subbing at quarterback again for injured Glenn
Foley, threw a 10-yard TD pass to Keyshawn Johnson for the Jets
(2-2).
 &UR; Cowboys 31, Redskins 10 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Jason Garrett, Emmitt Smith and Chris
Warren had big days as the Dallas Cowboys routed the winless
Washington Redskins.
	   Garrett completed 14 of 17 passes for 169 yards and a touchdown,
while Smith and Warren each ran for 100 yards and combined for
three touchdowns for Dallas (3-2).
	   Smith ran for 120 yards and a touchdown, and Warren rushed for
104 yards and two TDs against the Redskins (0-5), who are off to
their worst start since 1981.
 &UR; Patriots 30, Saints 27 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Adam Vinateri kicked a 27-yard field goal with
three seconds left as New England handed the Saints their first
loss of the season.
	   After New Orleans tied it on Doug Brien's 37-yard field goal
with 1:29 remaining, Drew Bledsoe completed four passes to set up
the game-winning field goal for the Patriots (3-1).
	   The Saints (3-1) had tied the game 27-27 after a heady play by
punt returner Andre Hastings. After the Patriots punted, New
England's Tebucky Jones batted the ball out of the end zone to
Larry Whigham, who unsuccessfully tried to down it. Hastings
grabbed the ball and raced 76 yards to the Patriots 26, setting up
O'Brien's field goal six plays later.

Yankees visit Strawberry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hearing the good news secondhand wasn't good
enough, so half a dozen New York Yankees visited Darryl Strawberry
on Sunday, a day after a cancerous tumor was removed from the
outfielder's colon.
	   Pitcher David Cone intended to bring one of the Yankees' caps,
which now have Strawberry's number 39 stitched in white on the
back.
	   ``We just want to show him how much we care _ and we got the job
done he wanted us to do,'' Cone said before joining teammates Chili
Davis, Joe Girardi, Derek Jeter and Tim Raines on the trip to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, about a mile (more than a
kilometer) from Yankee Stadium.
	   Strawberry was on the Yankees' minds as they prepared for
Tuesday's start of the AL championship series against Cleveland.
Dr. Stuart Hershon, the Yankees' team physician, held a clubhouse
meeting and gave an update on Strawberry's condition.
	   Hershon told them doctors believe the cancer had not spread, but
they won't know for sure until tests come back in about 10 days.
Doctors removed a 16-inch (41-centimeter) portion of Strawberry's
large intestine to get rid of a tumor almost 2 1/2 inches (6.4
centimeters) long.
	   ``I think we felt a lot better because everything came out
well,'' Tino Martinez said. ``There's a lot of relief around here.
Our thoughts are still with him, but there's a lot better feeling
around here.''
	   Strawberry remained in stable condition Sunday. He is expected
to remain in the hospital for about a week.
	   ``He's doing well. His family is with him,''
Columbia-Presbyterian spokeswoman Szuping Di said.
	   Strawberry also got a visit from Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, who didn't make it clear whether he went Saturday,
Sunday or both.
	   ``I was with him all day,'' Steinbrenner said at Yankee Stadium
without elaborating.
	   The Yankees were shaken when they learned last Thursday that
Strawberry had a cancerous tumor.
	   New York manager Joe Torre, who also visited the 36-year-old
outfielder, predicted Strawberry's illness will increase the
awareness of colon cancer among the Yankees.
	   ``Knowing George Steinbrenner, there'll be very thorough
exams,'' Torre said. ``I have a feeling we're going to have more
exhaustive physicals.''

Turks reiterate warning to Syria; Egypt attempts mediation

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against
Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle diplomacy between the two
neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish
bases in Syria.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Turkey had suffered for
many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking rebels
and needed to defend itself.
	   Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the
Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it
is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in
Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. ``I am not only
warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot continue.''
	   He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel was
warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military
and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the
military would be charged with solving the issue.
	   ``Our patience has run out. We are determined to take all
necessary measures if we don't see any response to our goodwill,''
the commander of Turkish land forces, Gen. Atilla Ates, said last
week.
	   Milliyet daily speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage
pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon,
where Turkey says the rebels have bases. Another report claimed the
Turkish army had been put on alert.
	   But Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was
the last resort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said.
	   The war in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy
for the country's large Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000
people since 1984.
	   In an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over
into the entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus.
	   ``War means the beginning of a chain reaction that will not
end,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency upon his return to Cairo. ``The use of military force does
not resolve differences or settle issues.''
	   The agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as
saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the
situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not
through confrontation or threats.''

Iraq demands withdrawal of Turkish troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad on Sunday called on Turkey to
withdraw the 10,000 troops it sent into northern Iraq to battle
Kurdish rebels.
	   Turkey's claims that it is ``pursuing rebels who oppose Turkish
authorities does not give them the right to violate Iraqi ...
sovereignty,'' the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Iraq demands that Turkey ``withdraw its invading forces ... and
stop their aggressive acts,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Turkey sent forces into northern Iraq on Friday.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey carry out cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and
Syria.
	   Turkey has accused Syria of aiding the rebels and has indicated
that it is prepared to take military action to eradicate guerrilla
bases in Syria. Syria denies the charge.
	   Northern Iraq is controlled by Iraqi Kurds who oppose Baghdad.
	   The statement said that the ``the only guarantee for
establishing peace and stability in the region'' was to reestablish
Iraqi authority in the region.

Confederations Cup to open with Brazil vs. France match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of tournament structure; New for some

 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Brazil and France will square off in the
opening match of the Mexico 1999 Confederations Cup, a highly
anticipated sequel to the 1998 World Cup final in which the French
hosts defeated the soccer-loving Brazilians.
	   ``Brazil doesn't have a chance,'' French coach Henri Emile joked
following Sunday's draw for the Jan. 8-20 tournament.
	   The opening game is to be held in Guadalajara's Jalisco stadium,
where the French beat Brazil in the 1986 World Cup.
	   The draw was presided over by FIFA Sports Director Walter Gagg
and CONCACAF President Jack Warner.
	   The eight competing teams were divided into two groups.
	   The national teams from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia and Egypt
will play the first round in Mexico City's Aztec stadium, while
France, Brazil, New Zealand and the United States will play in
Guadalajara.
	   The tournament originally was to feature the champions of FIFA's
continental confederations, but European champion Germany decided
not to participate. The United States, which lost to Mexico in the
North and Central American and Caribbean championship final, was
given an invitation to this tournament.
	   The Mexican organizing committee chose the city's Jalisco
Stadium to host the six Group B matches because of the weather and
the larger 50,000 capacity of the stadium.
	   Another factor is Brazil's popularity among the local fans.
Brazil played in Guadalajara in the 1970 and 1986 World Cups.
	   The finals will be split between Guadalajara and Mexico City.
	   Several European leagues have said their clubs will not release
their star players for the tournament because they are going to be
busy in regional tournaments, but FIFA officials did not agree.
	   ``The executive committee's decision is that all players that
were selected have to be released,'' Gagg said. ``The national
squads have to bring their best players.''
	   Jean Verbeke, vice president of the French Soccer Federation,
had warned Friday that his country would not be interested in
playing the tournament without its frontline players.
	   ``Our confederation takes this cup very seriously,'' Emile said.
``All our stars have to come here.''
	   FIFA recently amended its rules for the Confederations Cup, and
teams need only release players for national team duty 48 hours
before the tournament, rather than weeks in advance.
	   The draw, held at a sound stage of the Mexican TV-network
Televisa, also served to unveil the official mascot of the
tournament _ a cob of corn dressed in Mexico's national colors of
green, white and red, with a soccer ball at its side.

Exit polls show Cardoso overwhelming winner in Brazil election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results after 8.57 percent of votes counted.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Facing an uncertain economic
future, Brazilians stuck with the incumbent for the first time in
their history Sunday and re-elected Fernando Henrique Cardoso as
president, exit polls showed.
	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide
	   With 8.57 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso now has 51.07
percent and former labor leader Luiz Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva of
the Workers Party has 35.26 percent.
	   The outcome was no surprise. Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist,
was the overwhelming favorite in Sunday's national elections,
getting a boost from voters' fear of a deepening economic crisis.
	   ``The important thing is not to switch drivers in the middle of
the race,'' said Marcio Karte, a Rio newsstand dealer who voted for
Cardoso.
	   About 106 million voters went to the polls Sunday to choose a
president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies, a third of the
81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators. Voting is mandatory for
Brazilians between the ages of 18 and 70.
	   For weeks, the presidential race has been mostly a one-man show.
Cardoso held steady even as Brazil lost the confidence of
international investors _ and despite his promises to cut spending
and maybe raise taxes if elected.
	   ``I voted for him even though he led the country into the
crisis, because he's the only one who can get us out,'' said
Rodrigo Jelmayer, a third-year law student in Sao Paulo.
	   Voting was mostly peaceful, although army troops were stationed
in northern states with high Indian populations or a history of
land conflicts. A ban on liquor sales was in effect in most of the
country.
	   As usual, a ban on last-minute campaigning was widely ignored.
In Rio, 23 people were arrested for handing out pamphlets.
	   Cardoso voted just before noon in Sao Paulo. He flashed a ``v''
for victory sign to photographers but declined to talk to
reporters. Lula voted earlier in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo where he worked for years in an auto
plant.
	   For the first time, more than half of Brazil's voters used
electronic voting machines instead of paper ballots. The electronic
votes were to be tallied within 24 hours, but the rest weren't to
be counted until Friday, electoral officials said.
	   The big concern for Brazilians is what will happen after the
election.
	   Cardoso has pledged strong measures to control a ballooning
budget deficit of more than dlrs 60 billion. Many economists
predict a recession in 1999 and even worse unemployment, which
unions now estimate at 18 percent of the work force.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan is heading negotiations for an
emergency loan package reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion with the
International Monetary Fund and other public and private lenders.
	   Cardoso's success may hinge on the strength _ and cooperation _
of his inconstant five-party coalition in Congress. Legislators are
to vote on long-delayed reforms to cut spending and raise revenue.
	   Meanwhile, voters hope he can revive the magic of the economic
program that propelled him to the presidency in 1994 and eliminated
2,400 percent inflation.

	   HALIFAX (AP) _ It was the toughest mission Sgt. Maurice Robert
ever had to fly.
	   The veteran search-and-rescue technician from Canadian Forces
Base Greenwood in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley parachuted into
gusting winds and landed at the crash site where six of his
colleagues lay dead on Friday.
	   Robert extracted himself from 26 feet up a hardwood tree and
followed a local prospector into the bush on a mountainside near
Marsoui, Quebec His heart sank as he recognized the red nose of his
squadron's Labrador helicopter.
	   ``It was 200 to 300 yards from the burnt area,'' Robert said in
an emotionally charged interview from his home on Sunday. ``It was
pretty well beaten up but it was still identifiable.''
	   All of the crew members were close by, he said. They were all
dead.

	   HALIFAX (AP) _ A former Soviet spy has broken two decades of
silence about his role in an elaborate KGB deception that left the
careers of six RCMP counter-intelligence officers in tatters.
	   In a new book, Anatoly Maximov tells his side of Operation
Tournament, a KGB ploy to fool the RCMP Security Service into
thinking it had recruited Maximov as a double agent.
	   Maximov says the operation, from 1971 to 1978, gave the KGB a
wealth of information about the Security Service, sowed confusion
in enemy ranks _ and ironically helped lead to reform of Canada's
counter-intelligence arm to take it out of the hands of the RCMP
and make it a civilian operation.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada is campaigning for a seat in one of the
world's most exclusive clubs, the United Nations Security Council,
and the prospects for winning look good.
	   On Thursday, the General Assembly votes to fill two of 10
non-permanent seats on the 15-member council. Canada is a favorite
to win one, along with the Netherlands.
	   While the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia hold
permanent seats on the council, the executive arm of the UN, the
other seats are filled for two-year terms.
	   Canada has won a seat every decade or so since 1948 and is
likely to keep that record intact, says Geoffrey Pearson, a retired
Canadian ambassador and son of Nobel Peace prizewinner Lester
Pearson.

	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien should be promptly
subpoenaed to testify at hearings into RCMP conduct at last year's
Asia-Pacific summit, says a lawyer for 27 protesters.
	   Cameron Ward will table a motion on the issue today as
long-awaited hearings by a three-member panel of the RCMP Public
Complaints Commission begin into clashes between police and
protesters at the 1997 summit.
	   The commission is a federal agency independent of the Mounties
that was created in 1986 to assess complaints against officers.
	   It cannot punish officers, but only report on its findings _ a
sore point for many protesters.

	   WINDSOR (AP) _ A mother's nightmare ended in joy Sunday when she
was reunited with her three children almost two years after their
father took them to Lebanon.
	   A deeply moved Roula Chebaro knelt to embrace her daughter
Dalal, 5, and sons, Adnan, 9, and Ousama, 8, as they walked into
Windsor airport.
	   Their journey home began early Saturday in Lebanon, where their
father Chafic Chebaro fled with them on Dec. 14, 1996.
	   The couple were in the midst of a divorce, and he had picked the
children up for a weekend visit. They never came back.
	   Two Windsor police detectives worked on the case for months with
the RCMP, Canada Customs, and the federal immigration and foreign
affairs departments.
	   The father finally decided to return the children to their
mother after talking to her on the telephone and coming to the
conclusion they'd be better off with her.
	   ---
	   EDMONTON (AP) _ International speculators are helping create
turmoil in economies around the world and governments should try to
rein them in, says Conservative leadership candidate Joe Clark.
	   Canada should set the tone by using its international goodwill
and negotiating expertise to try to slow the rate at which money
traders bet on the fate of national currencies, he said in a
leadership debate on Sunday.
	   Clark said some European banks are already reconsidering their
lending policy towards speculative, high-risk ventures.
	   Federal Finance Minister Paul Martin and counterparts from the
world's seven richest countries were in Washington this weekend
hammering out an agreement in principle to ease panic in countries
shell-shocked by the roiling global economic crisis.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Claudia Schiffer, the Arab world's biggest
sing-along, the world's heaviest pumpkin, Queen Elizabeth and
Christopher Reeve. Some of the items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A day after Claudia Schiffer told a
Rome newspaper she was through with fashion shows, the supermodel
said she was misunderstood.
	   ``I'm not quitting,'' Schiffer said in a statement issued
Sunday. The 28-year-old said she meant only that that she wouldn't
work the runways anymore at shows in Milan.
	   ``For me, the runway work was only a small part of my modeling
career, and more important at the beginning to become known
internationally,'' she said. But ``for almost two years now I've
only done fashion shows occasionally and for special causes, for
example, for Valentino.''
	    &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In the Arab world's biggest sing-along,
at least half a million people joined in chorus with 23 top singers
in a concert more about politics than Arab pop music's usual fare
of love and romance.
	   The show Saturday night in Beirut's main square was a live
version of a popular music video called ``The Arab Dream,'' which
is a plea for unity in the divided Arab world.
	   In the video, the song is accompanied by old newsreels from the
Arabs' long battle with Israel: Palestinians fleeing their homes at
the founding of the Jewish state in 1948 and, more recently,
Lebanese pulling bodies from wreckage left by Israeli artillery.
	   The video has been distributed only to TV stations, and some
Gulf satellite outlets say they're getting dozens of requests to
broadcast ``The Arab Dream'' from viewers who want to tape it. It
appears several times a day on Beirut stations.
	   Performers at Saturday's concert hailed from 16 Arab countries
and included such heartthrobs as Tunisia's Latifa, Egypt's Anoushka
and Kadhem al-Saher of Iraq.

	   PORT ELGIN, Ontario (AP) _ A pumpkin the size of a small car has
weighed in at a new world record of 1,093 pounds (496 kilograms),
according to organizers of an Ontario pumpkin festival.
	   Gary Burke of Simcoe, Ontario, grew the behemoth in his back
yard and entered it Saturday in the Port Elgin Pumpkinfest.
	   The world record had been by held by Nathan and Paula Zehr of
Watson, New York, who in 1996 grew a pumpkin weighing 1,061 pounds
(481 kilograms).
	   ``Every day, I'd get home and spend a couple of hours looking
after it,'' Burke said.
	   During its peak growing period, the pumpkin gained almost 40
pounds (18 kilograms) a day.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In an apparent failure of royal coordination,
Queen Elizabeth has been invited to two family parties on the same
day. Now she must decide whether to attend grandson Peter Phillips'
21st birthday celebrations on Nov. 14, or a party marking her son
Prince Charles' 50th birthday, organized by his longtime love,
Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   It's a duplication of dates unheard of in a world where day
planners are carefully filled in months, if not years, ahead of
time, and it has prompted speculation of royal rifts.
	   ``The queen is aware that there is a clash, but no decision has
yet been made,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, speaking on
condition of customary anonymity.
	   Princess Anne, the queen's only daughter, chose Nov. 14 to
celebrate her son's birthday at Windsor Castle, west of London,
although his birthday is not until the following day.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles is reported to have organized a private party
the same night at Charles' country home, Highgrove, in western
England. His birthday is Nov. 14.
	   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on a report in The Mail on
Sunday tabloid that the clash ``is the first public evidence of
current tensions between senior royals,'' divided over plans to
modernize the monarchy in the wake of the death of Princess Diana.

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Christopher Reeve told a 6-year-old girl
paralyzed in an amusement park accident that thanks to advances in
spinal cord research she might walk again someday.
	   Reeve, who was paralyzed in a 1995 equestrian accident, on
Saturday attended a fund-raiser for Emily's Walk for Spinal
Research, a foundation founded by Emily Hunt's parents in her name.
	   Reeve told the girl and audience members that research involving
rats offers hope that spinal cord injuries can be mended. The only
barrier to human testing is money, Reeve said.
	   ``I just want you to know that what we're talking about now is
simply the financing of the procedure,'' he said. ``It's going to
happen.''
	   Emily suffered a spinal cord injury and her grandmother was
killed in August 1996 when an amusement park train derailed and
wrecked.

 &UR; Iraq demands withdrawal of Turkish troops

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Baghdad has called on Turkey to withdraw
the 10,000 troops it sent into northern Iraq to battle Kurdish
rebels.
	   Turkey's claims that it is ``pursuing rebels who oppose Turkish
authorities does not give them the right to violate Iraqi ...
sovereignty,'' the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a statement on
Sunday.
	   Iraq demands that Turkey ``withdraw its invading forces ... and
stop their aggressive acts,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Turkey sent forces into northern Iraq on Friday.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey carry out cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and
Syria.
	   Turkey has accused Syria of aiding the rebels and has indicated
that it is prepared to take military action to eradicate guerrilla
bases in Syria. Syria denies the charge.
	   Northern Iraq is controlled by Iraqi Kurds who oppose Baghdad.
	   The statement said that the ``the only guarantee for
establishing peace and stability in the region'' was to reestablish
Iraqi authority in the region.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
has said that the Senate does not now have the two-third majority
necessary to remove President Bill Clinton from office. Republican
Rep. Henry Hyde also said Sunday that he hopes to finish his
impeachment inquiry by year's end but won't accept Democratic
demands for limits on the investigation. Hyde's committee on Monday
was to take up a Republican resolution recommending an open-ended
inquiry into whether Clinton's behavior merits impeachment. The
Democrats will offer a separate version that would put a deadline
on the inquiry and limit it to the Monica Lewinsky affair, but it
is likely to be defeated. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reacting to the threat of a NATO
strike on Yugoslavia, Russia's defense and foreign ministers called
on President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, while Yugoslav generals
prepared to defend the country. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev met with Milosevic and Milan
Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic,
to discuss possible NATO intervention in Kosovo _ Serbia's southern
province _ to end seven months of bloodshed. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bickering broke out between the United States
and its rich allies even before the ink was dry on their action
plan for combating a widening economic crisis that has already
pushed a third of the world into recession. The disagreements
Sunday underscored that despite a major U.S. administration effort
to project unity and calm turbulent markets, the world's economic
powers still disagree strongly over just what they should be doing
to restore stability. The administration still played down the
disagreements and pushed ahead to demonstrate U.S. leadership by
assembling a multibillion-dollar bailout plan for Brazil, the
latest country threatened by panicked investors seeking to pull
their money out. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso was headed for re-election, according to exit polls,
indicating that Brazilians were giving him an unprecedented second
term to solve one of the country's worst economic crises in
decades. Exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute showed Cardoso winning with 56 percent of the vote
compared to 29 percent for his closest rival, former labor leader
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party. The outcome was no
surprise. Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist, was the overwhelming
favorite in Sunday's national elections, getting a boost from
voters' fear of a deepening economic crisis. (BRAZIL-ELECTIONS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against
Damascus, Egypt began shuttle diplomacy between the two neighbors
to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in
Syria. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Sunday that Turkey
had suffered for many years from Damascus' sheltering of the
autonomy-seeking rebels and needed to defend itself. Some 10,000
Turkish troops were deployed this week on the Turkish-Syrian
border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it is supporting
the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran
and Syria. (TURKEY-KURDISH REBELS)

Turks reiterate warning to Syria; Egypt attempts mediation

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against
Damascus, Egypt began shuttle diplomacy between the two neighbors
to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in
Syria.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Turkey had suffered for
many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking rebels
and needed to defend itself.
	   Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the
Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said. Damascus denies that it
is supporting the rebels, who wage cross-border raids from camps in
Iraq, Iran and Syria.
	   ``This situation is serious,'' Demirel said. ``I am not only
warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot continue.''
	   He did not elaborate and it was unclear whether Demirel was
warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military
and civilian leaders here have said that if diplomacy fails, the
military would be charged with solving the issue.
	   ``Our patience has run out. We are determined to take all
necessary measures if we don't see any response to our goodwill,''
the commander of Turkish land forces, Gen. Atilla Ates, said last
week.
	   Milliyet daily speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage
pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon,
where Turkey says the rebels have bases. Another report claimed the
Turkish army had been put on alert.
	   But Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin insisted Sunday that war was
the last resort. ``I don't believe it will come to that,'' he said.
	   The war in Turkey's southeast waged by rebels seeking autonomy
for the country's large Kurdish minority, has killed some 37,000
people since 1984.
	   In Sunday, Baghdad called on Turkey to withdraw 10,000 troops it
sent into Iraq on Friday, saying that Turkey's claim that it is
pursuing Kurds ``does not give them the right to violate Iraqi ...
sovereignty.''
	   Iraq demands that Turkey ``withdraw its invading forces ... and
stop their aggressive acts,'' the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a
statement Sunday carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
Northern Iraq is controlled by Iraqi Kurds who oppose Baghdad.
	   In an attempt to the ease tension that many fear may spill over
into the entire Middle East, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Assad in Damascus.
	   ``War means the beginning of a chain reaction that will not
end,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency upon his return to Cairo. ``The use of military force does
not resolve differences or settle issues.''
	   The agency quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as
saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the
situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not
through confrontation or threats.''
	   Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this week would
be fruitful.
	   Jordan, which cautioned Syria and Turkey to take into
consideration the higher interests of the region, offered to
mediate.
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ About 10,000 peasants forced from their
homes by fighting between leftist rebels and paramilitary groups
have agreed to return to their villages in rural northern Colombia
after receiving government assurances of protection, authorities
announced Sunday.
	   The refugees have spent the past three months camped in schools,
parks and sports halls in Barrancabermeja, a steamy oil refinery
city 180 miles north of the capital, Bogota.
	   The government said the first displaced peasants will begin
returning to their homes in Bolivar state on Tuesday.
	   President Andres Pastrana flew Sunday to Barrancabermeja, a
cauldron of political violence, to see off the refugees and to
reinforce his government's promise of military protection.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Hector Teran Teran, the second consecutive
opposition party leader to serve as governor of Baja California,
died of a heart attack Sunday. He was 67.
	   Family members said he died around 6:45 a.m. in the governor's
mansion in the state capital of Mexicali. He was the 10th governor
of Baja California, which borders California in the United States.
	   Unlike his predecessor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Teran was a quiet
but forceful politician who preferred backroom negotiations to
addressing crowds when it came to solving his state's many
problems.
	   Ruffo, a charismatic speaker, became Baja California's first
opposition governor in 1989 when his conservative National Action
Party won elections by a landslide despite fraud by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has been in power
in Mexico for seven decades.
	   Teran, a lifelong member of National Action, was elected with 54
percent of the vote in 1995 for a six-year term. Before that, he
served in the state legislature and the federal congress, and as a
member of the party's national committee.
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Federal Emergency Management
Agency has received 62,000 damage claims in Puerto Rico since
Hurricane Georges hit Sept. 21, making it one of the costliest
disasters ever for the island.
	   About 53,500 claims had been filed by telephone by Sunday, and
another 8,500 were received in the first two days at application
centers around the island, said Ed Conly, a public affairs officer
for the agency.
	   At that rate, the total number of claims could eventually
eclipse those of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 or Hortense in 1996, Conly
said.
	   ``The impact of this event is huge,'' Conly said. ``This is
going to be a lot larger disaster than Hortense and it's going to
be a lot larger than Hugo.''
	   About 15,000 people remained in 219 hurricane shelters across
the island Sunday, most of them in schools. Civil Defense officials
were moving some of the shelters to vacant factories and warehouses
so that classes could resume Monday.

Victoria state gets resupply of natural gas, industry to benefit
</HEADLINE>
first &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victoria's hospital services,
nursing homes and bread and milk supplies are expected to return to
normal Monday, 10 days after a refinery explosion and fire cut off
the state's supply.
	   But businesses and households have been warned not to turn on
gas meters yet by the state's gas distributor VENCorp or face fines
of Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,000) fines.
	   Victoria state's 1.4 million households were expected to be back
on line on Thursday, VENCorp said.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and looking
for electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   Those people lucky enough to have electric hot water heaters are
finding out just how many friends they have, as people arrive with
towels and soap to impose on them.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   Gas producer Esso announced that gas started flowing from its
plant at Longford in southeastern Victoria, site of the Sept. 25
fire and explosion that killed two men and injured eight, on
Sunday.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   The incident led to 100,000 workers being stood down and
millions of dollars in lost production.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis will cost 100
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it goes
on, which amounts to a third of the state's production.
	   ``A very small amount of gas is flowing from our plant into the
supply system,'' Esso's corporate and external affairs manager Ron
Webb said. ``It is essential that this message I am giving you is
understood -- that it is only a small amount of gas at this stage
and anybody thinking they can use this gas would be wrong.''
	   VENCorp spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said the company was
drawing up a list of large industries willing to begin taking gas
even if the early supply fluctuated.
	   He said some were unwilling because of the uncertainty of supply
but gas coming from New South Wales meant hospitals and nursing
home should return to normal Monday.
	   ``Some critical industries such as bread and milk which use
small levels of gas are being able to progressively start using
gas,'' Guthrie-Jones said.
	   ``Otherwise, it is domestic on Thursday.''
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell in early trading Monday as
market sentiment remained bearish following last week's steep
declines. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 143.26 points, or 1.08
percent, to 13,080.43 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Friday, the Nikkei posted a 26.57-point gain, or 0.20 percent.
	   The dollar bought 134.92 yen in early trading, up 0.14 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 135.65
yen overnight.
	   Market players were waiting to see how soon the government would
take new steps to bolster Japan's economy and fragile financial
system.
	   They were also watching how other global markets would react to
the weekend meeting of financial officials from the world's major
economies.
	   ``Tokyo stocks are still looking downward, and the market hasn't
confirmed a downside support,'' said Masaaki Higashida, deputy
general manager at Nomura Securities Co.
	   Last week, the Nikkei index repeatedly set new 12-year closing
lows. Friday, the index briefly touched a low of 12,973.24, the
first time the average broke below 13,000 points since January
1986.
	   Traders said the market outlook would remain uncertain until
Japan's ruling and opposition parties agree on an injection of
public funds into the financial system.
	   At the Washington meeting, the Group of Seven industrialized
nations urged Japan to take ``swift and effective action'' to
strengthen its financial system, including the prompt enactment of
measures to support viable banks with public assistance.
	   The G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy,
France, Canada and Germany.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.79 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,008.23.
The TOPIX closed down 1.70 points, or 0.17 percent, on Friday.
	   The currency market was little affected by the G-7 finance
ministers' meeting, which issued no specific statements regarding
the yen-dollar rate, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early morning. At Friday's close, the yield
stood at 0.715 percent and its price was 109.84 yen.

	   Security was tight in advance of a Jewish holiday beginning at

later this month, and both sides have been busy staking out
positions in advance of her visit.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly
accused the Palestinians of not doing enough to crack down on
Islamic militants, said Israel's security was his paramount
concern.
	   ``Israel has shown its willingness to go the distance,'' he told
reporters at a ceremony to usher in the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
``Now it's up to the Palestinians to show their willingness to
carry out their part.''
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said it is working to
contain militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts
cannot provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes for a speedy
accord _ but said any movement must come from the Israeli side.
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored initiative on an Israeli troop pullback, but
Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns.
	   Erekat spoke to reporters during a break in talks with Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh. The two were mainly discussing
secondary issues, including the so-called safe passage that would
permit Palestinian travel between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
the status of Palestinian prisoners.
	   Sunday's West Bank clashes occurred near Hebron, marking the
fifth straight day of skirmishing in or near the divided town.
Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians and
a frequent flashpoint for violence.
	   In the latest fighting, a crowd of about 100 Palestinians
gathered at the Israeli military checkpoint outside Hebron, and
some began throwing stones and bottles at the soldiers.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas, but
witnesses said no one was hurt during the two-hour disturbance.
	   Later, at the village of Bani Naim outside Hebron, about 100
Palestinians, mainly teen-agers and elderly people, marched to
protest what they said was illegal land confiscation by Jewish
settlers.
	   They marched to within 100 yards (90 meters) of a settlement and
Israeli troops took up protective positions, but the protest
remained peaceful.
	   In sealing off the Palestinian lands, Israel cited threats from
Hamas, which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings
since 1994. The group vowed to carry out attacks after Israeli
soldiers killed two wanted fugitives from the group last month.

Pope pleads for postwar recovery, democracy

	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has called on Croats to
heal war wounds and build democracy, in a message at the end of a
three day visit that included the beatification of a controversial
World war cardinal.
	   ``After long years of dictatorship, and the terrible experiences
of violence, which the people of this region have undergone, it is
now necessary to make every effort to construct a democracy on the
moral values inscribed in the very nature of the human being,'' the
pope said before departure Sunday.
	   John Paul called on united Europe to support Croatia's bid to
join: ``On the path leading to the European joint home, no one
should be forgotten.''
	   But Croatia, he said, ``must show great patience, wisdom, a
willingness to make sacrifices and generous solidarity in order to
overcome definitively the present postwar phase and attain the
noble goals to which she aspires.''
	   Standing by the pope as he spoke was President Franjo Tudjman,
whose authoritarian rule is often cited by the western governments
in rejecting Croatia's admission to western institutions.
	   Tudjman said the pope ``reinforced us in faith, convinced us
that we can look with pride to our achievements and build up the
future with confidence.'' He also thanked John Paul for ``having
brought to Croatian people new messages of hope and forgiveness,
peace and community.''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman
Catholics. They were overjoyed to see the pope again only four
years after his first visit. Hundreds of thousands attended pope's
public addresses; many others watched live TV coverage of the
events.
	   ``The pope's words heal and encourage,'' said Sanja Prpic, a
20-year-old student.
	   Earlier on Sunday, the pope held a Mass on Split's Adriatic
beach packed with up to 500,000 pilgrims.
	   He called on Croats to spur reconciliation among different
ethnic groups and to renew ``ethical and moral values undermined by
past totalitarianism and by the recent violence of war. It is an
urgent task, for without values there can be no true freedom or
democracy.''
	   The war erupted in 1991 when Croatian Serbs rebelled against the
country's independence from the former communist Yugoslavia. The
fighting only definitely ended in 1995, after the government
recaptured areas seized by rebels during the war.
	   The pope also addressed the most recent conflict, in the
Yugoslav southern province of Kosovo, urging the West to help
ending it.
	   ``Mutual respect, forgiveness and reconciliation'' were needed
to stop the violence, the pope said, expressing hopes that the
world powers would provide ``timely help'' to achieve those goals.
He made no mention of NATO planning for involvement in Kosovo.
	   The Vatican, one of the first countries to recognize Croatia's
independence, looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
	   Orthodox clergymen and a Muslim delegation attended Sunday's
Mass, and the pope greeted them.
	   The frail 78-year-old pope appeared in generally good form
during a full-schedule visit, although he was visibly tired later
Sunday.
	   For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's visit was
Saturday's beatification, the last step before possible sainthood,
of the controversial World War II cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac.
	   Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a martyr, but many Serbs and
Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.

Malaysia's Anwar arrives in court wearing neck brace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, the reformer
politician who says police beat him in custody, arrived in court
Monday wearing a neck brace.
	   Police escorted Anwar to the High Court for arraignment on five
counts of corruption and five of illegal homosexual acts.
	   It was the first time the former deputy prime minister and
finance minister had been seen by his lawyers and wife since he was
charged in a lower court last Wednesday and pleaded innocent to all
charges.
	   After arraignment in the High Court, a trial date is to be set.
	   With the lower court's permission, Anwar had been admitted
Saturday night to University Hospital for medical check-ups after
he displayed a black eye, bruised arm and neck last week. He was
whisked away from the hospital Sunday after police barred his
family from seeing him.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said doctors would submit a report
of their findings to the court, but did not say when.
	   Anwar was once the heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But as Anwar's popularity increased along with his
challenges of the long-ruling Mahathir, he fell out of favor and
was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge and gives police the power to
prohibit prisoners from seeing their lawyers or families.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, called it a ``breach of human
rights'' that the lawyers had been denied access to their client.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. And they forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.
	   After he was fired Sept. 2, Anwar led thousands of people in
peaceful protests against Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir has also accused
Anwar of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he
was ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS, ADDS later games, CORRECTS times of last two field
 &UR; By the Associated Press
 &UR; Buffalo beats 49ers 26-21

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Rob Johnson threw for 254 yards
and a touchdown, and Buffalo shut down San Francisco's high-powered
offense for most of the game before surviving a late rally and
beating the 49ers 26-21 Sunday.
	   The Bills, who won only one of their previous 10 games, built a
23-0 lead in the third quarter before the 49ers staged a comeback
and pulled within 26-21 on Steve Young's 21-yard TD pass to J.J.
Stokes with 1:03 left.
	   San Francisco (3-1) then recovered an onside kick, but the play
was wiped out by an offsides penalty against the 49ers, their
NFL-record 22nd penalty of the game. Buffalo (1-3) recovered the
second onside attempt to clinch the victory.
 &UR; Bears 31, Lions 27 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Erik Kramer threw two TD passes and ran for a score
as the Chicago Bears rallied for their first win of the season.
	   The Bears (1-4), who trailed 27-10 going into the fourth
quarter, held Barry Sanders to 28 yards on 14 carries, one of the
worst games of his career.
	   Kramer was 26-of-37 for 275 yards, while Chris Penn caught six
passes for a career-high 106 yards. Lions rookie Charlie Batch was
16-of-31 for 268 yards and two TDs, and Johnnie Morton caught two
passes for 138 yards, including a 98-yard TD catch.
 &UR; Falcons 51, Panthers 23 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tim Dwight returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for
a touchdown and the Atlanta Falcons scored their most points in 25
years by routing the winless Carolina Panthers.
	   Atlanta (3-1) scored three touchdowns in a 48-second span of the
third quarter. Carolina (0-4) fumbled on its first three
possessions of the second half and finished with six turnovers.
	   Dwight set the tone when he took John Kasay's opening kickoff at
the 7, cut through a gaping hole on the left side and cruised all
the way to the end zone.
 &UR; Colts 17, Chargers 12 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, it was billed as the rookie showdown between
Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, but Elijah Alexander and Ken Dilger
stole the show and led Indianapolis to its first win of the season.
	   Alexander intercepted a pass by Leaf to set up one touchdown and
recovered a fumble to set up another. Dilger ran in a 2-point
conversion on a well-executed fake after the TD and recovered an
onside kick after the Chargers had pulled within two points with
1:48 left.
	   That led to Mike Vanderjagt's third field goal, a 40-yarder that
clinched the game for the Colts (1-4). Manning was 12-of-23 for 137
yards with an interception, while Leaf was 12-of-23 for 150 yards
with an interception for the Chargers (2-3).
 &UR; Jets 20, Dolphins 9 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Hersey, Curtis Martin rushed for 108
yards and a touchdown as the New York Jets snapped a four-game
losing streak to Miami.
	   Dan Marino had a poor day for the Dolphins (3-1), going 13-of-31
for 121 yards, getting sacked three times and throwing two
interceptions. Miami's running attack also sputtered, gaining just
34 yards.
	   Vinny Testaverde, subbing at quarterback again for injured Glenn
Foley, threw a 10-yard TD pass to Keyshawn Johnson for the Jets
(2-2).
 &UR; Cowboys 31, Redskins 10 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Jason Garrett, Emmitt Smith and Chris
Warren had big days as Dallas routed winless Washington.
	   Garrett completed 14 of 17 passes for 169 yards and a touchdown,
while Smith and Warren each ran for 100 yards and combined for
three touchdowns for Dallas (3-2).
	   Smith ran for 120 yards and a touchdown, and Warren rushed for
104 yards and two TDs against the Redskins (0-5), who are off to
their worst start since 1981.
 &UR; Patriots 30, Saints 27 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Adam Vinatieri kicked a a 27-yard field goal
with six seconds left as New England handed New Orleans its first
loss of the season.
	   After New Orleans tied it on Doug Brien's 37-yard field goal
with 1:32 remaining, Drew Bledsoe completed four passes to set up
the game-winning field goal for the Patriots (3-1).
	   The Saints (3-1) had tied the game 27-27 after a heady play by
punt returner Andre Hastings. After the Patriots punted, New
England's Tebucky Jones batted the ball out of the end zone to
Larry Whigham, who unsuccessfully tried to down it. Hastings
grabbed the ball and raced 76 yards to the Patriots 26, setting up
O'Brien's field goal six plays later.
 &UR; Broncos 41, Eagles 16 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Bubby Brister, filling in for ailing John Elway,
threw four touchdown passes and Terrell Davis ran for 168 yards and
two scores as Denver routed Philadelphia.
	   The defending Super Bowl champions (5-0) built a 35-2 halftime
lead and 41-2 advantage after three quarters before Charlie Garner
ran for a pair of 3-yard scores in the final period for the winless
Eagles (0-5).
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, had 120 yards and both of his
touchdowns in the first quarter and finished the half with 168
yards. He sat out the second half.
 &UR; Bucs 20, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay bounced back from an embarrassing
Monday night loss, playing inspired defense to beat the Giants.
	   Charles Mincy returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown
on the third play of the game, and Regan Upshaw and Ronde Barber
also picked off passes for Tampa Bay (2-3), which was coming off a
21-point loss to Detroit.
	   The Bucs held New York (2-3) to 135 yards in total offense.
 &UR; Raiders 23, Cardinals 20 &QC; 
	   In Tempe, Arizona, Donald Hollas, playing his first NFL game
since 1994, replaced an injured Jeff George with 50 seconds left in
the first quarter and guided Oakland over Arizona.
	   Hollas was 12-of-22 for 104 yards and scored on a 1-yard run for
the Raiders (3-2), who were trailing 7-3 when he entered the game.
	   Jake Plummer was 23-of-39 for 208 yards and two touchdowns, but
had three interceptions that cost the Cardinals (2-3) their chance
at winning three straight games for the first time in two years.

Russian delegation meets Milosevic as NATO threatens strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATING with comments from foreign ministry
spokesman
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The pace of NATO preparations to
strike at Yugoslav targets may rise or fall depending on what the
U.N. secretary general tells the Security Council about the Kosovo
crisis on Monday.
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans to report on whether Belgrade is
complying with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If
not, Washington has said NATO will start air strikes within two
weeks.
	   Reacting to the threat of strikes, Russia's defense and foreign
ministers met President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his
generals prepared to defend the country.
	   Besides Milosevic, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, the meeting was also attended by
Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement repeating
opposition to NATO intervention in Kosovo without the sanction of
the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a veto-wielding
member.
	   A Yugoslav statement afterward said the leadership wanted the
Kosovo dispute solved peacefully. ``but in case we are attacked, we
shall defend our country with all means.''
	   The Yugoslav parliament scheduled a session for Monday to
discuss the crisis.
	   Preparing for any attack, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, even as Serbian authorities appeared ready
for compromise by installing an interim government in rebellious
Kosovo.
	   A Western diplomat also said that up to 120 Yugoslav army
armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out of Kosovo
so far.
	   The Serb side reported no fighting Sunday, beyond two attacks of
civilian cars by Albanian ``terrorists'' about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, in which one
person was wounded.
	   But the Kosovo Information Center, which reports for the
Albanian side, said there was heavy fighting between government
forces and the guerrillas, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   Meanwhile, NATO countries continued preparations.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported Britain preparing troops and
armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a post-airstrike
peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to confirm or deny
the report but repeated Britain was ready to participate in a NATO
attack.
	   The Yugoslav government said Friday the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in a seven-month crackdown. The conflict has
killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left upward
of 275,000 villagers refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected the interim council,
drawn up without any consultation with them, and one in which Serbs
outnumber majority Albanians.
	   Constituting the council, moribund since 1989, was part of a
last-ditch effort to show that Serbs intend to end the conflict.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.

Malaysia's Anwar arrives in court wearing neck brace
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, the reformer
politician who says police beat him in custody, arrived in court
Monday wearing a neck brace after a weekend checkup in a hospital.
	   Anwar sat stiffly, staring straight ahead in the police vehicle
because of the neck brace, before officers escorted him into the
High Court for arraignment on five counts of corruption and five of
illegal homosexual acts.
	   It was the first time the former deputy prime minister and
finance minister had been seen by his lawyers and wife since he was
charged in a lower court last Tuesday and Wednesday and pleaded
innocent on all counts.
	   Anwar was once the heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But as Anwar's popularity increased along with his
challenges of Mahathir's 17-year-rule, he fell out of favor and was
fired Sept. 2.
	   After he conducted two weeks of rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation and reform of the government, Anwar was arrested Sept.
20.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, called it a ``breach of human
rights'' that the lawyers had been denied access to their client.
	   After the High Court arraignment, a trial date is to be set.
	   Anwar had been admitted Saturday night to University Hospital
for medical checkups after he displayed a black eye, a bruised arm
and neck during his court appearances last week.
	   He said police had punched and slapped him in the face, knocking
him unconscious, and splitting his lip. He said he had been denied
medical attention for several days although he had trouble keeping
his balance and walking.
	   He was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge and gives police the power to
prohibit prisoners from seeing their lawyers or families.
	   Anwar was whisked away from the hospital Sunday after police
barricaded the stairwells and entryways, barring his family and
lawyers from seeing him. The hospital refused to give Anwar's wife,
a retired eye surgeon, a copy of his medical report.
	   Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the doctors would submit a
report of their findings to the court, but did not say when.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. And they forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.
	   The two top men in the government had clashed over economic
policy as Malaysia sank into recession. Mahathir also accused Anwar
of plotting within the ruling party to supplant him before he was
ready to retire.
	   Mahathir initially suggested that his former protege had
inflicted the bruises on himself to win public sympathy. But as
global condemnation grew, Mahathir ordered an independent
investigation.
	   An eye surgeon who examined Anwar last week determined the
jailed politician had been ``assaulted'' but the injuries had not
caused permanent eye damage.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso was headed for re-election, according to exit polls,
indicating that Brazilians were giving him an unprecedented second
term to solve one of the country's worst economic crises in
decades.	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide.
	   With 28.9 million votes or 27 percent of the total counted,
Cardoso now has 51.3 percent and former labor leader Luiz Inacio
``Lula'' da Silva of the Workers Party has 33.9 percent.
	   Experts consider exit polls more accurate than early vote
counts.
	   ``It's very good for Brazil that the president has received this
mandate from the Brazilian people and that he can now do what is
needed to protect the real (the local currency) and the Brazilian
people,'' Foreign Minister Luis Felipe Lampreia told reporters in
Brasilia.
	   The outcome was no surprise. Cardoso, a 67-year-old sociologist,
was the overwhelming favorite in Sunday's national elections,
getting a boost from voters' fear of a deepening economic crisis.
	   ``The important thing is not to switch drivers in the middle of
the race,'' said Marcio Karte, a Rio newsstand dealer who voted for
Cardoso.
	   About 106 million voters went to the polls Sunday to choose a
president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies, a third of the
81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators. Voting is mandatory for
Brazilians between the ages of 18 and 70.
	   For weeks, the presidential race has been mostly a one-man show.
Cardoso held steady even as Brazil lost the confidence of
international investors _ and despite his promises to cut spending
and maybe raise taxes if elected.
	   ``I voted for him even though he led the country into the
crisis, because he's the only one who can get us out,'' said
Rodrigo Jelmayer, a third-year law student in Sao Paulo.
	   Voting was mostly peaceful, although army troops were stationed
in northern states with high Indian populations or a history of
land conflicts. A ban on liquor sales was in effect in most of the
country.
	   As usual, a ban on last-minute campaigning was widely ignored.
In Rio, 23 people were arrested for handing out pamphlets.
	   Cardoso voted just before noon in Sao Paulo. He flashed a ``v''
for victory sign to photographers but declined to talk to
reporters. Lula voted earlier in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an
industrial suburb of Sao Paulo where he worked for years in an auto
plant.
	   For the first time, more than half of Brazil's voters used
electronic voting machines instead of paper ballots. The electronic
votes were to be tallied within 24 hours, but the rest weren't to
be counted until Friday, electoral officials said.
	   The big concern for Brazilians is what will happen after the
election.
	   Cardoso has pledged strong measures to control a ballooning
budget deficit of more than dlrs 60 billion. Many economists
predict a recession in 1999 and even worse unemployment, which
unions now estimate at 18 percent of the work force.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan is heading negotiations for an
emergency loan package reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion with the
International Monetary Fund and other public and private lenders.
	   Cardoso's success may hinge on the strength _ and cooperation _
of his inconstant five-party coalition in Congress. Legislators are
to vote on long-delayed reforms to cut spending and raise revenue.
	   Meanwhile, voters hope he can revive the magic of the economic
program that propelled him to the presidency in 1994 and eliminated
2,400 percent inflation.

Victoria gets resupply of natural gas, industry to benefit first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Victoria's hospital services,
nursing homes and bread and milk supplies were expected to return
to normal Monday, 10 days after a refinery explosion and fire cut
off the state's supply.
	   But businesses and households have been warned by the state's
gas distributor VENCorp not to turn on gas meters yet, or face
fines of Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,000).
	   Gas supplies for Victoria state's 1.4 million households were
expected to resume Thursday, VENCorp said.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   Those people lucky enough to have electric hot water heaters are
finding out just how many friends they really have, as people
arrive with towels and soap to impose.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   Gas producer Esso announced that gas started flowing from its
plant at Longford in southeastern Victoria, site of the Sept. 25
fire and explosion that killed two men and injured eight, on
Sunday.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   The incident led to 100,000 workers being sent home and millions
of dollars in lost production.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis will cost 100
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it goes
on, which amounts to a third of the state's production.
	   ``A very small amount of gas is flowing from our plant into the
supply system,'' Esso's corporate and external affairs manager Ron
Webb said. ``It is essential that this message I am giving you is
understood _ that it is only a small amount of gas at this stage
and anybody thinking they can use this gas would be wrong.''
	   VENCorp spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said the company was
drawing up a list of large industries willing to begin taking gas
even if the early supply fluctuated.
	   He said some were unwilling because of the uncertainty of supply
but gas coming from New South Wales meant hospitals and nursing
homes should return to normal Monday.
	   ``Some critical industries such as bread and milk which use
small levels of gas are being able to progressively start using
gas,'' Guthrie-Jones said.
	   ``Otherwise, it is domestic on Thursday.''
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Ignoring pleas from
government and church officials to vote, residents of the troubled
Mexican state of Chiapas stayed away from polling places.
	   Turnout Sunday among the state's 1.9 million registered voters
was estimated at 40 percent to 50 percent, said Francisco Gallardo
of Civic Alliance, an election monitoring group.
	   At stake in the elections were 40 state legislative seats and
the presidencies of 103 of the state's 111 counties.
	   First official results were expected early Monday.
	   Poverty and violence, widespread support for the anti-government
Zapatista rebels and the government's feeble response to
devastation caused by last month's floods have soured the
popularity of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party here.
Election results were expected to show the continued erosion of the
PRI's support.
	   The PRI, two other big opposition parties _ the conservative
National Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party _
and five other small political groups fielded a total of 477
candidates for the elections.
	   Despite exhortations from Bishop Arizmendi Esquivel of
Tapachula, who said Saturday it was the duty of all good Christians
to vote, few did so.
	   In La Hormiga, a community of about 10,000 near San Cristobal de
las Casas, only 20 people lined up to cast ballots when the polling
station opened.
	   Gabriel Samuel Gomez, 34, an unskilled worker, said he was going
to follow custom and vote for the PRI. But he added: ``What can you
do? They're all the same. They promise a lot but when they get into
power they forget about all of us poor people.''
	   The polls closed late Sunday without violence, though religious
disputes marred balloting in one county.
	   In San Juan Chamula, angry residents blocked 59 polling places
from opening to protest the jailing a year ago of five men.
	   The five were charged with murder in connection with a
long-standing dispute between ``traditionalist'' Catholics who
practice a syncretic form of their ancient Maya religion, and
neighbors who have converted to Protestantism.
	   More than 6,000 people milled in the central plaza under hastily
painted banners that read, ``There will be no vote until our
companions are freed,'' and ``Chamula united in one religion, we
are all traditional Catholics.''
	   Elections in the other eight counties near the Pacific Coast
were postponed until further notice because of flood damage.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Front announced Saturday it
would not interfere with the voting. Hundreds have been killed in
sporadic clashes between rebel and government sympathizers since
the Zapatista rebellion began Jan. 1, 1994, to demand democracy and
better living conditions for the state's predominantly poor Indian
residents.

Fleeing war, expulsion, displaced Sudanese face crisis without end

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Driven from their homes by civil war and
drought, 2 million Sudanese live in camps ringing the capital,
Khartoum. They are among 4 million displaced people in Africa's
largest country, the most in the world. The United Nations calls
their ordeal an emergency. But it is a crisis without the urgency
of a famine or the fury of a battlefield _ and, perhaps, one
without an end. Theirs may be what the world is coming to see as a
tolerable tragedy _ quiet, persistent suffering that no one seems
ready or able to fix.

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   MANDELA CAMP, Sudan (AP) _ Black clouds off the Nile River hang
low over the sprawling Mandela Camp, bringing the storms that make
an already wretched life even more miserable.
	   The clouds soon open up. Rain starts to fall.
	   And Barnaba Marial Marol, his cheeks hollow with hunger and his
eyes heavy with sorrow, begins his story.
	   ``We ran away naked,'' says the lanky, 33-year-old Dinka
tribesman from southern Sudan. ``We had nothing. Nothing. We left
our cows in the war zone, and we came with our hands empty.''
	   With 75 other people, he rode a truck from his hometown of
Rumbek to Wau, about seven hours away on bad roads.
	   From Wau, he boarded a rickety train north to Khartoum, arriving
eight days later to join hundreds of thousands of others fleeing
the fighting and famine of the civil war in the south.
	   He went to one squatter camp, then another. His mud hut was
demolished by bulldozers in 1995 _ part of a government policy to
raze illegal settlements around the capital _ so he moved to the
``Mandela camp,'' named for the South African president in an
ironic gesture to hope.
	   His wife left him two years ago. ``She wants to eat and I'm
jobless,'' he says. ``How is she going to stay with me?''
	   The trials have taken their toll.
	   ``I've become very old,'' he says.
	   ___
	   Barnaba counts himself among a group the United Nations calls
``war-displaced'' _ exiles within their own country with no right
to own land, no right to build a home and little, if any, prospect
of a future. Across a moonscape of shattered lives, they seek
shelter in mud huts or ``tukals,'' wigwams made of sticks,
cardboard, sacks or plastic.
	   But in Sudan _ with its famines, 15-year-old civil war and
droughts of biblical caliber _ the Mandela camp's plight, however
bad, is not quite a calamity.
	   The conditions in the camp are too good to be called famine, yet
too bad to be considered poverty. Rather, they are a tolerable
tragedy, a debacle repeated over and over, day after day, in
countless places in the Third World, where disaster defines life.
	   The crisis of Barnaba and others will receive neither attention
nor answers. The United Nations concedes their predicament is one
of its biggest failures in Sudan, and its officials in Khartoum say
the suffering could endure indefinitely.
	   It could become a forgotten disaster. Like the millions of
Afghans expelled by war that has lasted longer than many of them
have lived. Like the Kurds of southeastern Turkey, victims of a
brutal rebellion fought ostensibly for their liberation. Like the
350,000 Palestinians in Lebanon who have no right to live outside a
dozen camps of open sewers, tin roofs and a glut of guns.
	   Scenes from such calamities are relived daily in the Mandela
camp.
	   Water is delivered every day in blue, rusty tanks pulled by
donkeys. Electricity is a luxury no one can afford.
	   Malnutrition is rife, especially among children, and malaria can
become endemic when rains deliver floods that wreck the shoddy
houses and leave stagnant pools in which mosquitoes breed.
	   More dangerous are the demolitions.
	   The government has dispossessed as many as 50,000 people in a
matter of hours by tearing down their huts and houses. Since 1990,
at least 39 people have been killed in clashes over the
demolitions.
	   For Barnaba, that risk orders his life. He has nowhere to turn.
	   He is a Dinka, many of whom are at war with a national
government dominated by the Muslim, Arabized north, a regime that
propagates its brand of revolutionary Islam in one of the world's
most diverse countries. The war in the south, where people are
mostly Christians and adherents of tribal religions, and the
famines the fighting has caused have killed 1.5 million people.
	   ``If you meet the family of your enemy, will you help them? We
are the family of their enemy,'' says Barnaba, sitting on a ratty
mattress in a hut of cracked mud walls, its window and door covered
by burlap.
	   Near his bed, a boy urinates on the dirt floor.
	   ``If the government cares, then why are we like this?'' Barnaba
asks.

MANDELA CAMP: Barnaba asks.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ___
	   Jibril Hussein, at 15, is a newlywed at the camp.
	   His hands are still colored black by henna to mark his marriage
to his 14-year-old bride. To give them time together, his mother
and brother sleep outside on straw mats tossed in the dirt.
	   But their future together is bleak.
	   Jibril can neither read nor write. His father, a perfume seller,
died when he was 2. And he is a young man in another of the world's
militarized societies _ a candidate for war.
	   To Barnaba, the Mandela camp is sorrow, a life lost. To Jibril,
it is fear, a life to dread.
	   He is a Muslim from the drought-stricken west, and thus escapes
government efforts to convert the camp's Christians and animists
from the south. Residents say that some youths are forced to
memorize the Koran and that government aid agencies favor Muslims.
	   But Jibril fears the government's reach, just the same.
	   As part of a war that the government portrays as a religious
crusade, all young men must undergo two months of military
training. For the men in the camps, that is followed by 18 months
of service in the national militia, with likely duty in the south.
	   Such service is vastly unpopular. In the camps, where young men
are press-ganged in times of crisis, it is unpredictable, too.
	   ``They call you a holy warrior and send you to the south,''
Jibril says. ``But I don't want to go.''
	   Without proof of service, he cannot get a job other than day
labor. His passport will be invalid, a visa to work abroad
impossible. In a way, Jibril will live as a fugitive, dodging the
draft until he is 40 and perpetuating a cycle of idleness.
	   He doesn't care.
	   ``I could lose my leg or both legs. Or my arms. Is that a
future?'' he asks. ``I could die. Is that a future? That won't do,
that won't do at all. I don't want to die.''
	   ___
	   Michael Ashanding is the Mandela camp's everyman.
	   Like others here, he was a farmer in southern Sudan, raising the
corn, sorghum and cassava that grow so well in the reddish-brown
soil of the savanna.
	   But there are no farms near the camps around Khartoum. There's
no land to cultivate.
	   ``If there's work, I work,'' Michael says in his tukal of
cardboard bound by twine. ``If there's no work, I sit.''
	   He fled fighting in Bahr el-Ghazal province in the south in
1995. The journey, in driving rains, lasted five days.
	   He brought his wife and three children _ ``I didn't bring
anything else.'' He has had another child since.
	   Ensuring another generation of poverty, his children will not
learn to farm like their father, and they will not go to school to
pick up the skills that might secure them a job in the city.
	   Like their father, they will survive doing day labor _ digging
trenches for the phone company, making bricks along the Blue Nile,
picking cotton in fields to the south.
	   They will likely stay in the Mandela camp.
	   For them, the camp is misery that begets misery.
	   In every tragedy _ be it at Mandela or elsewhere _ those who
must endure it consider it their apocalypse, their end of the
world. To them, it is as cataclysmic as any disaster, anywhere.
	   Michael foresees a life without hope, without meaning _ for
either him or his children. He wants to leave. But to where?
	   His home in Wau is another apocalypse, where 80 people were
dying every day in August from famine.
	   The scenes were chilling: A woman grabbed a bowMichael, though, anythijg0ks preferable to the camp.
	   Even Wau.
	   ``In Wau, I can farm. I can eat what I grow, beans, anything.
Not like here,'' he says. ``Here, if I don't make money, I don't
eat.''
	   ``If God gave me the money, I'd go,'' he says.

North Korea confirms plans to continue rocket test-firing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea reiterated its position
Monday that it will continue to test-fire multi-stage rockets,
despite protests by the United States, Japan and other neighboring
countries.
	   North Korea took the stand, claiming that its Aug. 31 firing of
a rocket was an attempt to put an artificial satellite into orbit
and didn't pose any threat to other countries.
	   ``We make it clear once more that we will launch another
artificial satellite when we think it necessary, no matter what
anyone may say. This is our inviolable sovereign right,'' Minju
Joson newspaper, the North's government organ, said in an article.
	   The article was carried by Korean Central News Agency, the
North's official foreign news outlet.
	   The article charged that the United States and Japan are using
the North's Aug. 31 rocket-firing as an excuse to perfect their
``theater missile defense system.''
	   U.S. officials initially believed that what North Korea fired on
Aug. 31 was a two-stage missile which flew over Japan and landed in
the Pacific Ocean.
	   They later concluded that it was a three-stage ballistic rocket
with a range of over 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), which failed
to put an object into orbit.
	   Whether a missile or satellite, it showed a worrisome increase
in North Korea's missile capability, officials of the United
States, Japan and South Korea said.
	   The North's missile, believed to be Taepo Dong 1, is a variant
of Soviet-developed Scud missiles. It puts any targets in South
Korea and Japan within its range.

Desperate Africans brave treacherous strait seeking new life

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CEUTA, Spain (AP) _ The Rock of Gibraltar looms over everything,
a sentinel guarding Europe. On dark, moonless nights, desperate
Africans jam into smugglers' boats and try to sneak across the
narrow waters that separate poverty from presumed paradise.
	   But the Strait of Gibraltar is a treacherous place. Its strong
currents and changeable weather mean the sea can be flat as a dish
one moment and a churning maelstrom the next.
	   The Spanish government knows of 13 of the small wooden boats
that have sunk so far this year, drowning 45 would-be immigrants.
	   But volunteers who work closely with illegal immigrants say many
accidents go undetected. Based on information from relatives and
other immigrants, they estimate close to 1,000 people have perished
this year.
	   In the worst incident ever, 38 people drowned one night in June,
apparently when their smugglers' ``patera'' was intentionally
rammed by another boat. The open boats, powered by outboard motor
and built for a dozen passengers, usually are loaded with 20 to 30
immigrants.
	   Still, the strait remains a busy threshold for impoverished
Africans who are looking for a better life in Europe.
	   Under pressure from the rest of Europe, Spain only recently
began cracking down on the flow. The Civil Guard says 8,854 illegal
immigrants were detained in the first eight months of this year,
compared to 12,132 for all of 1997.
	   Preventive measures include elaborate fences that seal off Ceuta
and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves on the North African coast. A new
Civil Guard Maritime Service patrols the strait at night, searching
with radar for smugglers' boats.
	   Europe's concern is that once illegal immigrants reach Spanish
soil, not much stands in their way to crossing passport-free
borders into France and beyond to other European Union countries.
	   Spain had welcomed outsiders for years to do tough jobs spurned
by Spaniards, especially on the farms that provide much of the
fruit and vegetables consumed in northern Europe.
	   But the attitude changed in 1992, after legislation was enacted
to meet Spain's obligations under an EU treaty that allows
passport-free travel within the economic bloc but requires members
to restrict immigration from outside the community.
	   Despite Spain's crackdown, an estimated 20,000 people have
slipped into the country this year and 15,000 more made it to other
European nations, according to the Association of Moroccan
Immigrant Workers of Spain, which claims 14,000 members.
	   In all, 60,000 to 150,000 foreigners are thought to be living
illegally in Spain, which has a population of 40 million.
	   Government policy may have changed, but Spaniards generally
sympathize with the immigrants. Humanitarian groups offer food,
shelter and clothing to new arrivals.
	   ``We say hunger travels by itself; it doesn't need a passport.
When one is hungry, one travels,'' said Julio Martinez Silvida, who
heads the largest private support group in the southern region of
Andalucia.
	   Speaking to reporters at his office in the port of Algeciras as
immigrant children arrived for lessons denied them at Spanish
schools, Martinez said such people are fleeing 50 percent
unemployment in Morocco and wars, famine and political upheaval
elsewhere in Africa.
	   ``The farms exist because of the immigrants,'' he said,
estimating 60 percent find jobs in agriculture.
	   The aid groups advocate making it easier for Africans to get
temporary work permits.
	   In addition to crowding into ``pateras'' for runs across the
strait, would-be immigrants also sneak across hidden aboard
container ships and ferry boats from Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar, and
Melilla, close to Morocco's border with Algeria. They each pay
around 150,000 pesetas (dlrs 1,000) for the trip.
	   Africans hitch rides or take buses across the Sahara to reach
Morocco and then climb over or cut through the fences or bribe
their way across the border into Ceuta and Melilla. They hope that
once they are on Spanish territory to get temporary political
asylum or work permits.
	   The 2.5-meter-high (8-foot-high) border walls consist of
parallel wire-mesh fences separated by a dirt lane and bordered by
razor-barbed concertina wire coiled along the ground. Electronic
sensors and floodlights are being installed.
	   Critics of the effort to keep out poor immigrants say there is
no barrier that can stop people who are fleeing hunger and war.
Even Civil Guard sentries belittle the fence, showing foreign
journalists on a recent visit how easy it is to cut or climb.
	   Moroccans who are caught in the Spanish enclaves face immediate
deportation. People from other African countries spend months in
squalid camps. A lucky few get temporary work permits, but most are
sent home.
	   About 500 Africans from 22 nations are penned up at the
Calamocarro camp on a hillside on the edge of Ceuta, where they
share a few tents and shanties amid the stench of smoke and
garbage. Volunteers provide food, language classes and basic
medical care.
	   Kendy Anshem, a 29-year-old detainee who spent months trekking
here from Liberia in West Africa, scoffs at Europe's worries about
illegal immigrants.
	   ``How many thousands of immigrants go into the United States
every year?'' he asked. ``And the Europeans are worried about a few
hundred of us?''

Baja California Gov. Teran dead from apparent heart attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details and INCORPORATES US-Obit-Teran &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Hector Teran Teran, the second consecutive
opposition party leader to serve as governor of Baja California,
has died of a heart attack. He was 67.
	   Family members said he died of a sudden seizure at around 6:45
a.m. Sunday in the governor's mansion in the state capital of
Mexicali. He was the 10th governor of Baja California, which
borders with California in the United States.
	   Unlike his predecessor Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Teran was a quiet
but forceful politician who preferred backroom negotiation in
solving his state's many problems to addressing crowds.
	   Ruffo, a charismatic speaker, became Baja California's first
opposition governor in 1989 when his conservative National Action
Party won elections by a landslide despite fraud by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has been in power
in Mexico for seven decades.
	   Teran, a lifelong member of National Action, was elected with 54
percent of the vote in 1995 for a six-year term. Before that, he
served in the state legislature and the federal congress and as a
member of the party's national committee.
	   During his election campaign, Teran stressed the need for
greater public participation in government decisions, promising to
reduce the governor's authority and provide greater autonomy for
the state's four big cities.
	   Both Ruffo and Teran were plagued by big problems, from having
to battle PRI campaigns to discredit their administrations to
shootings and killings by drug gangs.
	   Baja California, with more than 2 million people, has long been
the site of a turf war among Pacific coast drug cartels for the
lucrative illicit market across the border in the United States.
	   The latest outbreak of violence was a massacre on Sept. 17 near
the fishing and tourist port of Ensenada, when masked gunmen _
believed to be linked to a drug gang _ dragged three related
families out of their beds at night.
	   The gunmen lined the people against a wall, mowed them down with
assault rifles and fled. Nineteen people died. The victims were
suspected of being linked to the drug trade.
	   Even so, the state remains one of the richest in Mexico and has
one of its lowest unemployment rates, partly due to tourism from
neighboring California, as well as its many ``maquiladora'' or
in-bond border industries, and the money sent back to relatives by
migrant workers in the United States.
	   Baja California also has one of the highest concentration of
urban residents in the nation.
	   Teran was born in 1931 in Moctezuma, in neighboring Sonora
state, the son of a small-town grocer. He studied business
administration at Monterrey's Technological Institute in Nuevo Leon
state, and went into business for a while before turning to
politics.
	   He is survived by his wife Alma Corella Gilsamaniego and their
four children _ Celia, Hector, Alfredo and Armando.
	   Funeral services will be held Monday.
	   The family has requested that instead of flowers the money be
donated to charities.

One Nation senator denies she'll stand aside for Pauline Hanson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The only right-wing populist One
Nation party candidate to win election to Parliament on Monday
rejected rumors she will give her Senate seat to party leader
Pauline Hanson.
	   Suggestions she should hand her Queensland Senate seat to Hanson
are ``nonsense,'' Heather Hill she said.
	   ``Pauline's never asked for anybody to ever do that. She's been
very clear ... if she didn't win her seat of Blair she would remain
as One Nation president,'' Hill said.
	   Hanson, who lost the new House of Representatives seat of Blair
to the Liberals, has so far refused to talk to the media.
	   Party adviser David Oldfield said suggestions Hill step aside to
allow Hanson to take up the Senate seat had merit, but doubted it
would happen.
	   ``I don't think Pauline would ask her and I'm sure that Heather
wouldn't be enthusiastic about it anyway,'' Oldfield said.
	   One Nation, which wants to cut off Asian immigration and abolish
Aboriginal welfare benefits, should be proud of its performance at
Saturday's election and will return even stronger at the next
polls, Hill said.
	   ``We managed to snare approximately 8 percent of the vote right
across Australia and you would think One Nation should be sitting
back and feeling very proud of itself,'' she said.
	   ``For our first time off the block, we really haven't done too
badly.
	   ``After a very short period of time -- it's only 18 months --
more than a million people voted for One Nation and it's
unfortunate that we weren't able to secure seats in the lower
house.
	   ``But we do believe we have been very successful and... I
believe that in three years' time we will be (in) a much better
position to have a positive impact,'' she told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Before the election, Hanson predicted she would win in Blair and
that One Nation would win six Senate seats and up to 15 in the
House of Representatives.
	   Hanson's former adviser John Pasquarelli said she could not
remain One Nation leader if she failed to gain a parliamentary
seat.
	   ``Without their head in Parliament it's just a nonsense to think
that she can be president and stay outside Parliament ... it
doesn't look good,'' said Pasquarelli, whom Hanson fired in late
1996.

Sumitomo Life to join trader, brokerage to sell investment trusts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest tie-up aimed at preparing for Japan's
``Big Bang'' financial reforms, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., Nissho
Iwai Corp. and Toyo Securities Co. said Monday they will join
forces in an investment trust business.
	   Sumitomo Life and Nissho Iwai will each buy a part of Toyo
Investment Trust Management Co., an affiliate of Toyo Securities,
the companies said in a statement. Sumitomo will take a 10 percent
stake while Nissho Iwai will take a 25 percent share.
	   A group of companies related to Toyo Securities will together
hold 25 percent of the business which will manage investment trust
funds, Japan's equivalent of mutual funds.
	   Toyo Investment Trust Management now offers Japanese and Asian
stock funds, but as restrictions in the industry are lifted it will
also invest in bonds and other financial products, the companies
said.
	   Through the alliance, Toyo will gain access to the huge customer
bases of Sumitomo Life and Nissho Iwai, the companies said.
	   Nissho Iwai hopes to gain a lineup of exclusive investment trust
funds that it can sell through its securities subsidiary, Nissho
Iwai Securities Co.
	   Sumitomo Life said it entered the alliance so it could offer its
customers ``high quality'' investment trusts and plans to manage
some of the money through a subsidiary it plans to set up next
year.
	   The move was the latest in a long list of joint ventures and
mergers between financial firms in Japan as sweeping reforms in the
industry allow companies to move into new businesses.

Padres 6, Astros 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres are going back to the
National League championship series after a 14-year absence, thanks
in large part to new hero Jim Leyritz.
	   And the Big Unit is not going to make it to the World Series as
many thought, because the Padres beat Randy Johnson and the Houston
Astros 6-1 Sunday night to clinch the tense division series three
games to one.
	   With the crowd of 64,898 hanging on every pitch, Leyritz hit his
third homer in as many games and 27-year-old Sterling Hitchcock was
dominating in his first playoff start, using a devastating
split-fingered fastball to strike out 11 in six innings.
	   Johnson lost his fifth straight decision in the postseason,
tying a major league record. He left for a pinch-hitter in the
seventh, and reliever Jay Powell gave up pinch-hitter John Vander
Wal's two-run triple and Wally Joyner's two-run homer in the
eighth.
	   ``Everybody counted us out,'' Hitchcock said. ``They said we
couldn't beat Johnson twice in a five-game series. Well, we beat
him twice in a four-game series. These guys never let up.''
	   Trevor Hoffman closed out the ninth for the Padres, who move on
to face the Atlanta Braves in the NL championship series starting
Wednesday night at Turner Field. Atlanta won five of nine from the
Padres this year.
	   This is the first time the Padres have been this far since 1984,
when they beat the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS only to lose the World
Series 4-1 to Detroit.
	   Tony Gwynn, 38, is the only player left from that Padres team,
although Bruce Bochy is the manager and Tim Flannery the third base
coach.
	   The Astros, who led the NL in scoring this season but managed
just eight runs in this series, go home frustrated for a second
straight year, having been swept by Atlanta in the first round in
1997. Houston has been in five postseason series, and lost all of
them.
	   Johnson was brilliant after being traded from Seattle to Houston
on July 31, going 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA. But the Padres beat him
twice this series.
	   Leyritz homered for the third straight game and for the sixth
time in 34 postseason at-bats.
	   He sent the crowd into a frenzy with his 422-foot (127-meter)
homer to left-center on a 3-1 pitch from Johnson leading off the
second. Leyritz had been just 4-for-37 (.108) with one home run
lifetime off Johnson.
	   ``This time of day, it's hard to see the ball,'' Leyritz said.
``I just swung in the right place and, with his velocity, was able
to hit it out.
	   ``We struggled in September once we clinched, but we were able
to step it up a notch,'' said Leyritz, obtained from the Boston Red
Sox on June 21.
	   The Padres won Saturday night's game 2-1 thanks to Leyritz's
solo homer to left with one out in the seventh. On Thursday, his
pinch-hit, two-run shot with two out in the ninth off Billy Wagner
sailed just inside the foul pole in right, tying the game at 4. The
Astros came back and won it 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth.
	   Leyritz is best known for his dramatic homer for the New York
Yankees in Game 4 of the the 1996 World Series against Atlanta. His
three-run, eighth-inning shot against Mark Wohlers tied the game at
6. The Yankees went on to win in 10 innings and defeated the Braves
in six games.
	   Trailing 2-1, the Astros loaded the bases without a hit off Joey
Hamilton in the seventh. Dan Miceli came on and retired the side on
four pitches, striking out Brad Ausmus and getting Carl Everett _
pinch-hitting for Johnson _ to pop up to third.
	   Jeff Bagwell walked leading off the seventh and eventually
reached third, but was caught in a rundown after Joyner fielded
Spiers' grounder to first.
	   The Padres scratched out an unearned run in the sixth to go
ahead 2-1. Greg Vaughn hit a high fly with two outs and left
fielder Moises Alou had to run in.
	   Alou tried to make a sliding catch and missed, giving Vaughn a
double. Ken Caminiti followed with a chopper to third baseman Sean
Berry and stumbled coming out of the box, but Berry made a bad
throw that bounced past Bagwell at first base, allowing Vaughn to
score.
	   Hitchcock came in overmatched in playoff experience by Johnson,
who had thrown 46 1-3 playoff innings. Hitchcock had made just two
relief appearances for the New York Yankees in the 1995 division
series against Seattle, totaling 1 2-3 innings.
	   But the lefty had the Astros swinging at his splitter, which
often dove into the dirt. He allowed two hits and one run and
walked none.
	   He was perfect through three innings before a splitter bounced
and hit Craig Biggio in the leg. Richard Hidalgo singled and Derek
Bell hit into a double play, moving Biggio to third. Bagwell
singled to center to score Biggio.

With election sewn up, Brazil's Cardoso must tackle economy

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With exit polls and initial
returns pointing to a landslide victory, the election was a breeze
for incumbent President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Now comes the
hard part, analysts say.
	   Cardoso managed to hold the rudder firm long enough to become
the first Brazilian president ever re-elected, even after fallout
from Russia's debt default which wiped out a good chunk of the
stock market's value and forced interest rates to near 50 percent a
month.
	   Now many economists predict a recession in 1999, deteriorating
unemployment and pressure on the government to raise taxes, all
which is likely to erode the president's popularity.
	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for his closest rival, Worker's Party candidate Luis
Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide.
	   Official election results with 35.3 percent of the vote counted
had Cardoso with 50.9 percent and Lula with 34.3 percent.
	   ``It's very good for Brazil that the president has received this
mandate from the Brazilian people and that he can now do what is
needed to protect the real (the local currency) and the Brazilian
people,'' Foreign Minister Luis Felipe Lampreia told reporters in
Brasilia.
	   The outcome was not a surprise to the 106 million voters who
went to the polls Sunday to choose a president, 27 governors, all
513 federal deputies, a third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,405 state
legislators. Voting is mandatory for Brazilians between the ages of
18 and 70.
	   Cardoso's popularity stems largely from the success of the Real
Plan, which dropped inflation from around 2,400 percent a year to
near zero now. The country's deepening financial woes, brought on
by investors bailing out of Brazil and other emerging markets,
failed to dissuade the electorate.
	   ``In voting for Cardoso, the electorate demonstrated the
importance it attached to stability,'' said Joaquim Eloy de Toledo,
an economist with the University of Sao Paulo. ``The electorate
approved his clear message that he would do all in his power to
guarantee the survival of the Real Plan and the stability it
brought to prices.''
	   But ensuring that stability now looks like a bitter pill to
swallow.
	   Analysts say that while the massive popular support may give the
president a honeymoon period which will help him push through
desperately needed fiscal reforms, that support will erode as the
effects of harsh economic measures sink in.
	   Cardoso has pledged strong measures to control a ballooning
budget deficit of more than dlrs 60 billion. His success hinges
largely on the cooperation of a Congress that knows little party
discipline and have managed to delay essential reforms through out
most of the president's first term.
	   ``The voters have accepted his putting economic stability before
tackling the serious social problems facing the country,'' Carlos
Esteban Martins, a political scientist at the University of Sao
Paulo.

United 1, Fusion 0, shootout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Jeff Agoos scored the decisive
goal in a shootout as D.C. United beat the Miami Fusion 1-0 Sunday
night to advance to Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference
finals.
	   Agoos' goal came in the sixth round of the shootout, won by D.C.
3-2 after a scoreless 90 minutes. The United, the two-time
defending MLS champion, won the best-of-3 game playoff series 2-0
and will play Columbus for the right to play in the MLS Cup.
	   United goalkeeper Tom Presthus made four saves in the shootout,
including a stop of Miami's Diego Serna in the fifth round that
would have given the Fusion the win. Jaime Moreno and Marco
Etcheverry also scored for D.C.
	   The playoff victory was the United's 12th straight since 1996,
despite playing a man down for the final 87 minutes. Forward Roy
Lassiter received a red card for an off-the-ball infraction three
minutes into the match.
	   Despite playing with only 10 men, D.C. nearly took the lead in
the 40th minute on a Moreno header. But Fusion defender Pablo
Mastroeni cleared Moreno's shot off the goal line.
	   Both teams missed chances in the second half to win in
regulation.
	   The Fusion's Nelson Vargas hit the crossbar from the edge of the
penalty area in the 87th minute.
	   One minute later, Etcheverry nearly had a breakaway on Fusion
goalkeeper Jeff Cassar, but Miami's John Maessner caught up to the
play to stop the United captain.
	   A Moreno shot went past the far post in the 59th minute. Miami's
Henry Gutierrez had a hard shot from 20 yards deflected wide with
six minutes to play.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-morning stock, dollar and bond rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply in morning trading
Monday, dropping below the psychologically important 13,000 mark,
as investors remained skeptical about whether Japan will be able to
stabilize its ailing economy and financial system.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 247.27 points, or 1.87
percent, to close the morning trading session at 12,976.42. On
Friday, the Nikkei posted a 26.57-point gain, or 0.20 percent.
	   The dollar bought 134.55 yen at midmorning, down 0.22 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and below its level late Friday in New York of
135.65 yen.
	   At a meeting in Washington, the Group of Seven industrialized
nations urged Japan to take ``swift and effective action'' to
strengthen its financial system, including the prompt enactment of
measures to support viable banks with public assistance.
	   But traders and investors in Tokyo said they doubted the
government would implement effective measures soon.
	   ``Tokyo stocks are still looking downward, and the market hasn't
confirmed a downside support,'' said Masaaki Higashida, deputy
general manager at Nomura Securities Co.
	   Last week, the Nikkei index repeatedly set new 12-year closing
lows. Friday, the index briefly touched a low of 12,973.24, the
first time the average broke below 13,000 points since January
1986.
	   Traders said the market outlook would remain uncertain until
Japan's ruling and opposition parties agree on how to strengthen
the ailing financial system.
	   The G-7 comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy,
France, Canada and Germany.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 12.30 points, or 1.21 percent, to 1,001.72. The
TOPIX closed down 1.70 points, or 0.17 percent, on Friday.
	   The currency market was little affected by the G-7 finance
ministers' meeting, which issued no specific statements regarding
the yen-dollar rate, traders said.
	   The dollar weakened against the yen as overseas players dumped
the U.S. currency, dealers said. The decline came despite the sharp
fall in Japanese share prices, which often weakens the yen.
	   The dollar's failure to break above a technical barrier at
around 135.50 yen triggered a wave of selling, dealers said.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in morning trading. At Friday's close, the yield stood at
0.715 percent and its price was 109.84 yen.

Malaysia's Anwar arrives in court with neck brace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; INSERTS 2nd graf with Anwar quote &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Reform politician Anwar Ibrahim,
who says police beat him in custody, wore a neck brace during his
arraignment Monday as policemen surrounded him to block any
conversation with his lawyers or family.
	   ``I've been treated worse than any other criminal,'' Anwar told
the court.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul issued a gag order against all
public statements about Anwar's guilt or innocence and said the
trial would be conducted in English ``so that justice can be seen
to be done.''
	   ``The judge isn't only me but millions of others,'' said Paul,
noting international press attention that has brought expressions
of concern about the former deputy prime minister's treatment from
the United Nations, the World Bank, and government leaders from the
Philippines, the United States, Canada, Australia and Indonesia.
	   However, Paul rejected a request by Anwar's attorneys that they
be allowed to consult with him during the proceedings. Two were
allowed to meet him privately in a lockup during a court break
after the reading of the charges.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said Sunday it was a ``breach of
human rights'' that lawyers have been prohibited from seeing their
client except when he is brought to court.
	   Anwar patted his mother's cheek as he stepped into the dock, but
his efforts to chat with her and his wife, sitting behind him, were
blocked by a barricade of five plain-clothed policemen.
	   The prosecution said that as a prisoner under the Internal
Security Act, Anwar is not entitled to visitors. He is being tried
on charges under the criminal code on five counts of corruption and
five of illegal homosexual acts.
	   He pleaded innocent to the charges in two lower court hearings
last week, when he appeared with a black eye, bruised neck and
arms, saying police had beat him until he was unconscious on the
night he was arrested, Sept. 20.
	   The prosecution also asked the judge to keep secret a report by
four government doctors who examined Anwar during a weekend
hospital stay until police complete their investigation of how he
was injured.
	   Anwar was once the heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But as his popularity increased along with his challenges
of Mahathir's 17-year-rule and disagreements over economic policy,
he fell out of favor and was fired Sept. 2 as finance minister and
deputy prime minister.
	   After he conducted two weeks of rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation and reform of the government, Anwar was arrested under
the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention
without charge and restricts other rights.
	   While Anwar has been held incommunicado and his wife has been
banned by police from addressing the public, the government and
ruling party has embarked on an information campaign, sending
Cabinet ministers and party leaders around the country to explain
why Mahathir fired him.
	   Judge Paul's gag order, issued at the request of the defense,
could stop that.
	   ``It isn't appropriate for anyone to comment on the guilt or
innocence of Anwar either directly or indirectly,'' Paul said. ``To
ensure a fair trial, from today onwards such statements should
cease to be made.''
	   In a clear reference to Mahathir, who described in detail the
sexual allegations against Anwar at a news conference and said he
is sure to be convicted, Anwar's chief lawyer, Raja Aziz Addruse
asked the judge to act.
	   ``A number of persons of high office have seen fit to express
publicly and in no uncertain terms their views that my client is
already guilty of the offenses,'' Raja Aziz said.
	   ``Because of the authoritative position these persons hold or
have held, their views are bound to influence the trial of the
accused and to adversely affect him.''
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. And they forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.

Plunky plungee practices world record bungy jump in secret

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A world record bungy-jump attempt
goes ahead Monday evening, with the plunky plungee diving from the
Sky Tower casino, the city's highest building, 630 feet (192
meters) toward the street.
	   The jump is actually a formality for the media -- because A.J.
Hackett, who is credited with popularizing the ``extreme sport''
pastime of diving from heights with elastic bands tied to the
ankles, has already done it.
	   In fact, Hackett has done two Sky Tower leaps -- during an early
morning Saturday practice session.
	   Monday night's leap is being described as historic, but a
handful of spectators watched the practice jumps about 6 a.m.
Saturday.
	   In constant rain, and with cloud at times lower than the launch
platform, Hackett made two perfect jumps from 630 feet (192 meters)
above the street. He started bouncing when he was about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the ground.
	   Television New Zealand is dedicating 30 minutes of prime-time
television to the jump and a website has been set up to broadcast
it live on the Internet.
	   Promoter Neil Green said there was no intention to fool people
about Monday night's jump, which would still be a world record --
as Hackett would be going closer to the ground than in practice.
	   ``Obviously we didn't want to spoil it -- and the whole idea of
it was to create that sense of excitement.''
	   Green said there was no pretense tonight's jump was the first as
there was no way Hackett would attempt it without doing one or two
jumps first.
	   ``There's just too much danger in this one not to get it
right.''
	   Bungy jumping is a modernization of a traditional Vanuatu tribal
test of courage in which villagers plunge head-first from high
platforms with vines tied to their ankles to break their fall at
the last moment -- they hope.

IMF head expresses concern about treatment of ousted Malaysian

 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund
said he was troubled by the arrest and apparent beating of a former
Malaysian deputy prime minister who played a leading role at annual
meetings of the IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank.
	   Michel Camdessus said Sunday that other members of the 24-nation
Development Committee also had expressed their concern to him about
the treatment of the Malaysian official Anwar Ibrahim, who had
headed the committee.
	   Anwar appeared in court last week with a black eye and bruises
and told the judge he had been beaten by police after his arrest on
charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has pleaded
innocent to the charges.
	   On Monday, Anwar arrived in a higher court for his arraignment
wearing a neck brace after a weekend checkup in a hospital. His
trial was scheduled to begin Nov. 2.
	   Anwar was once the heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But as Anwar's popularity increased along with his
challenges of Mahathir's 17-year-rule, he fell out of favor and was
ousted as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2.
	   ``I hope that the Malaysian authorities can reassure us as to
his condition when the committee meets'' on Monday, Camdessus said.
	   He described Anwar, 51, as a friend and said he demonstrated
''remarkable leadership qualities'' as head of the Development
Committee which represents the world's poorer nations.
	   ''He was a very good minister of finance ... and helped his
country resist Asia's financial crisis,'' Camdessus said. ''I was
troubled by what we learned and many members of the committee said
they were troubled.''
	   Last week James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, the
IMF's sister institution, also said he was ``deeply concerned, as
are many of my friends, about Anwar's status.''
	   ``A lot of us are feeling saddened by that situation, and we're
certainly going to monitor it and help in whatever way we can,''
Wolfensohn said. ``I hope he gets a fair chance to state his
case.''
	   Similar statements concerning Anwar were made by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
	   Thailand's finance minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, has
replaced Anwar as head of the IMF committee.
