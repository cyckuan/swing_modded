Countries React On U.S. Oil Release
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Clinton Friday directed the release of
30 million barrels of oil from the country's emergency reserves in a bid to
lower prices. OPEC's president said that Clinton's decision to release oil from
America's strategic stockpile would bring down prices, and Britain, battered by
truckers' blockades over high fuel costs, praised the move. The President's top
energy adviser cited a looming home heating crisis.

EU Details World Crises Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ECOUEN, France (AP) -- Defense ministers from the European Union on Friday
detailed the number of planes, ships and troops a proposed EU defense force
would need to ensure it can tackle world crises. The 15 member states are
expected to announce the resources each will commit to a rapid reaction force of
between 50,000 and 60,000 troops, able to deploy within 60 days and sustain
itself for a year. The corps is due to be operational by 2003. The new force
will mean that the EU is able to take military action when the United States
does not want to get involved, a key factor in promoting the bloc's credentials
on the world stage.

Chechen President: We Can Resist Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's president said in an interview published
Friday that rebel forces were prepared to resist Russia for another decade and
he urged Russian forces to give up the fight. ''Only new victims lie ahead,''
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov told the Kommersant daily. ''The Russian army
is a great army, and its mission is to fight with superpowers. There is a need
to make sure that the Russian army is not shamed again.'' Russia suffered a
humiliating defeat in the 1994-96 Chechnya war. Federal troops withdrew, giving
Chechnya de facto independence. Russian troops entered Chechnya nearly a year
ago, aiming to regain control of the region.

Wen Ho Lee Supporters Seek Pardon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's supporters are seeking a presidential
pardon for the Los Alamos scientist who was freed last week in a plea agreement.
Lee, 60, pleaded guilty Sept. 13 to one of 59 counts against him. The other 58
were dropped in a negotiated settlement of the nine-month national security
prosecution that had kept him in solitary confinement. Cecilia Chang of the Wen
Ho Lee Defense Fund in Fremont, Calif., sent out a thank-you note Friday to Lee
supporters expressing joy that he was released and sadness that he had to plead
guilty and lose such citizenship rights as being able to vote. Only a
presidential pardon could restore those rights.

E-Mails Detail Gore Buddhist Visit

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- According to reconstructed White House computer messages
belatedly turned over to Congress Friday, Vice President Al Gore's staff
described an event he attended at a Buddhist temple as a fund-raiser, and an
e-mail suggested he bring $20 as ''an offering.'' The long-missing messages,
provided to the House Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., also show that Gore's office was informed of an offer from a businessman
to raise $250,000 if a White House coffee meeting was arranged with President
Clinton.

Banks Unite To Help Euro
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The guardians of the world's most powerful currencies teamed
up Friday to help the beleaguered euro. The intervention by European Central
Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan had the desired effect,
pushing the currency briefly up more than 5 percent. But as the euro fell off
its quick gains, experts said the lasting effects of the unprecedented move
remained very much in question.

White House Releases Sleepover List

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the last 14 months, President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, hosted 404 overnight guests at the White House or Camp David, the White
House said Friday. Collectively they gave $624,000 to the first lady's Senate
campaign, according to an analysis by a watchdog group. The guest list was
released in the face of accusations that Mrs. Clinton rewarded donors with
sleepovers since she began her Senate campaign. Roughly one in four of the

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Preston Wilson hit his 30th home run and Cliff
Floyd drove in two runs as the Florida Marlins beat the struggling
Colorado Rockies 8-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson became the 24th major league player to have 30 homers and
steal 30 bases in a season. Luis Castillo added two hits and an RBI
as a steady rain and snow shower fell.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny (7-7) allowed four runs and six hits in seven
innings. Penny also had an RBI single and scored a run for the
Marlins, who won for only the fourth time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton went 2-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs for the
Rockies, who lost for the sixth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (10-5), had his third consecutive poor outing,
giving up six runs, nine hits and three walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd gave the Marlins a 1-0 lead in the first inning with a
one-out RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Helton hit a two-run double in the bottom half to give Colorado
a 2-1 lead. Dave Berg doubled past third to score Derrek Lee in the
second inning to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins took a 3-2 lead in the third on Wilson's solo homer
into the Colorado bullpen in right. Castillo had an RBI single and
Floyd a sacrifice fly in the fourth extended Florida's lead to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Penny's RBI single came in the fifth and an RBI double by Mike
Lowell and Lee's run scoring single in the sixth made it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castillo's two hits gave him 177 hits this season and
Florida's single-season hit record. ... Marlins OF Henry Rodriguez
was originally thought to have a sinus infection, but team doctors
revealed Friday that he had migraine headaches. ... RHP Reid
Cornelius will spend the remainder of the season in the bullpen to
give RHP Ryan Dempster two more starts. ... The Marlins renewed
their contractual agreement with Triple-A affiliate Calgary. ...

<HEADLINE> U.S. Citizens Cautioned in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Political demonstrations and a national truck
strike in Peru have prompted the State Department to advise U.S.
citizens living there to reduce travel in the country and avoid
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''While marches and demonstrations in recent months have been
largely peaceful, they have the potential to turn violent,'' a
State Department advisory said Friday. The advisory ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory noted there has been no evidence of anti-American
sentiment in recent demonstrations, but advised Americans to stay
alert.
</P>
<P>
   A bribery scandal involving the head of Peru's spy agency is the
source of the protests and political turmoil. The scandal caused
President Alberto Fujimori to announce he would dismantle the
intelligence service and call new elections in which he would not
be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a national truck strike has caused confrontations between
strikers and authorities. Intercity passenger buses are expected to
join the strike Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Nader Touts Agriculture Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY H. GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP) -- More than 12,000 people filled the
Target Center sports arena Friday night, paying $7 each to hear
presidential hopeful Ralph Nader denounce the major party
candidates and call for social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the crowd was proof his candidacy should be taken
seriously -- and that he should be allowed to participate in debates
with Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest gathering of paying citizens of the entire
year,'' for a Nader event the Green Party candidate told the
raucous crowd, which shouted, whistled and waved placards that
said, ''Let Ralph debate!''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's running mate, Winona LaDuke -- who lives on the White
Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota -- spoke about generational
justice and the environment, and how she and Nader would make the
world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not be taken for granted, and we will vote,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Nader proposed shifting control of U.S.
agriculture away from corporate conglomerates and back toward the
family farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''By weakening the stranglehold agribusiness has on the food
industry, we will be able to increase farm gate prices and
competition, which will consequently reduce food costs for
consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader billed the Target Center event a ''super rally'' and hoped
it would draw a large audience to raise money and build support for
his inclusion in the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   His farm plan calls for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws,
prohibition of meatpacker ownership of livestock production
facilities and allowing American farmers to grow industrial hemp.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him on a table during a news conference sat a pile of
18,000 signatures of Minnesotans requesting that Nader be included
in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota stop was the second of four major rallies. The
first, in Portland, Ore., was nearly as large as Friday's event,
selling out with 10,000 tickets at $7 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Nader visited Minnesota, he held a smaller rally
at the University of Minnesota that drew a packed house of 1,400
and raised about $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual way for a presidential candidate to raise money,
but Nader says the rallies are the best way to show how serious he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to demonstrate that we can draw far greater
audiences,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nader spoke, volunteers passed cardboard collection boxes
up and down the aisles of the crowded arena. At least two people
donated $1,000, and several others donated $500. Nearly everyone
seemed to donate something.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gonna bang our spoons until we get Ralph in the
debates,'' shouted former talk show host Phil Donahue, who spoke
before Nader took the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nader cited Minnesota as an example of a state on the cutting
edge of what should be done to spur more voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Three things -- debate access, public financing and same-day
voter registration -- helped Gov. Jesse Ventura get elected, and
Nader thinks those principles should be emulated by other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those three factors should be the law of the land,'' he said,
adding that ''campaign finance reform is the boulder on the highway
to justice.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Softball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Australia got a combined no-hitter
against Cuba, and China had only slightly more trouble in beating
Canada in their final tuneups before the softball medal round.
</P>
<P>
   Yan Fang had two hits Saturday (Friday night EDT) and scored the
only run for China (5-2). Zhang Yanqing struck out nine and allowed
just two hits as Canada (1-6) joined Cuba (1-6) in failing to make
the medal round
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Roche struck on nine in four innings and Brooke Wilkins
fanned six for Australia (6-1), which is guaranteed at least a
bronze medal. The hosts will play Japan, the only team to beat them
in the preliminaries, in the second semifinal Monday for a chance
at the title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to have another game with them,'' Australia coach
Bob Crudgington said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia-Japan loser plays the winner of the other
semifinal for the other berth in the gold medal game.
</P>
<P>
   China had already clinched a berth in the other semifinal. The
United States (3-3), defending champions and the heavy favorites
going in, needed to beat Italy (2-4) later Saturday to clinch the
remaining semifinal berth.
</P>
<P>
   Japan (6-0) was scheduled to play New Zealand Saturday night in
a game that has no effect on the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider it the four best teams remaining,'' Crudgington
said. ''It's a whole new tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Making its first Olympic softball appearance, Cuba held the
Aussies scoreless on two hits for the first four innings. But they
broke out with five runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Titcume and Natalie Ward hit consecutive homers to make
it 3-0, and Kerry Dienelt added a two-run single. The Aussies got
two more runs in the sixth on RBI singles from Sally McCreedy and
Selina Follas, and another in the seventh when Dienelt doubled and
scored on Titcume's single.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba spoiled the shutout when Maria Zamora walked in the bottom
of the seventh and scored on three wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Roche pitched against Japan in the teams' first meeting, losing
1-0 in the first extra inning when she allowed a double, a walk and
an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   As the only Australian pitcher to have lost in the tournament,
she was eager to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts, and there have been some words flying around, that
'she can't do it,''' she said. ''It shook me up. It's like a bomb
that hit me.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to deal with it, and that's what I've been doing for
the past few days.''

<HEADLINE> Slovenian Debevec Wins Shooting Gold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Slovenia's top gun shot his way to a
gold and two records.
</P>
<P>
   Rajmond Debevec shot an Olympic-record 1,275.1 to win the men's
50-meter rifle three-position Saturday. Juha Hirvi of Finland won
the silver with 1,270.5 and Harald Stenvaag of Norway took the
bronze, scoring 1,268.6.
</P>
<P>
   Debevec broke the finals mark of 1,273.9 set at the 1996 Games
by France's Jean-Pierre Amat. Debevec also broke the qualifying
record by shooting an 1,177 to advance to the eight-man finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the thrill of my life. I feel excellent,'' said
Debevec, also the world-record holder at 1,287.9. ''This is my
fifth attempt at the Olympics and I am really happy to finally
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anti of Winterville, N.C., finished in a three-way tie
for ninth with a score of 1,164. The only other American in the
field was Glenn Dubis of Bethel Park, Pa., who scored 1,160.0 to
place 18th.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing performance for Stenvaag in the final. He
was second to Debevec in the qualifying, but a score of 6.7 on one
of his shots opened the door for Debevec to pull away and Hirvi to
jump up and grab the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy,'' Stenvaag said. ''I had not expected to win,
but when I had 6.7, I knew I could at least get a medal.''

<HEADLINE> Mob Violence Breaks Out In Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Mob violence broke out after a police
truck ran over a woman in one village and a judge released car
theft suspects in a separate town in northern Guatemala, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Fray Bartolome de las Casas, 95 miles northwest of Guatemala
City, angry villagers took two police chiefs hostage late Friday
and threatened to burn them alive after their pickup truck ran over
a woman. Villagers besieged the police station, trapping the rest
of the small force inside.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time in Raxuja, 25 miles to the east, about 300
villagers took three accused car thieves hostage and threatened to
kill them after a judge let them go for lack of evidence, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and U.N. mission representatives tried to enter the
town, but the mob would not let them, saying they first wanted to
meet with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mob has made it clear they don't want anyone to enter,''
said Faustino Sanchez, spokesman for Guatemala's national police
force. ''They said they were fed up with not seeing justice in
their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives were able to meet with the mayor of Fray
Bartolome de las Casas, but mob leaders there refused to speak to
them. The size of the mob was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers stormed the police station after a woman sustained a
broken leg after being struck by the police truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't get out to get a look at them but we can hear them
yelling,'' officer Freddy Rene said by telephone Friday night.
''They are saying 'we want to burn them alive,' and they are
talking about our bosses, whom they are holding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan army was standing by, but a military spokesman
said soldiers were not told to move in because of fears it would
escalate the violence.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Ex-Girlfriend Complains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's ex-girlfriend has filed a burglary
complaint against the former football great, claiming he broke into
her home, erased a message on her answering machine and took a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Prody, 25, told officers Friday night that Simpson,
53, had used a key to enter her Miami-Dade County home between
midnight and 7 a.m., according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Prody said she telephoned Simpson about it and he admitted going
to her home because he wanted to erase a message he had left for
her, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing was the letter, which Simpson did not
want Prody to mail to a ''mutual friend,'' the report said. The
contents of the letter were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Prody did not want to pursue charges, Miami-Dade Police
spokesman Juan Del Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Prody reportedly stopped seeing each other six weeks
ago. In May, police were called to a Miami hotel after Simpson and
Prody got into a loud dispute where Prody allegedly slapped and
kicked him. Simpson refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1999, police responded to a 911 call Simpson placed
from Prody's house. According to a police report, Simpson said
Prody had been on a cocaine binge. Simpson later called it a
misunderstanding, saying he had placed the call about one of
Prody's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of killing his ex-wife, Nicole
Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. He later was found
liable for their deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay
$33.5 million in damages.

   MILAN, Mo. (AP) -- It's an unnerving sound, the screeching from a
truckload of hogs parked outside a slaughterhouse. A few hours
later the pigs, hardly make a squeal as they're scurried off to be
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from major customers -- primarily the McDonald's
Corp. -- farms and packinghouses are acting to reduce the stress and
suffering of the cattle, pigs and chickens they take to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Meatpackers are retraining workers and installing new equipment.
Egg farms that supply McDonald's are being forced to give laying
hens more room and eschew a practice known as ''forced molting,''
withholding food and water from the birds so they will lay more
eggs. And McDonald's is now looking at standards to alleviate
confined conditions on hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government helped the American Humane Association
launch a new program for certifying food as ''Free Farmed,''
awarded farms and processors that adhere to relatively strict
animal-welfare standards.
</P>
<P>
   Packinghouses began changing their practices in earnest in 1999
after McDonald's set animal-handling standards for its meat
suppliers, helped develop industry training videos and started
auditing the plants. The fast-food chain suspended purchases from
two cattle-slaughtering plants that failed its inspections. The
plants have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plants started to realize this is part of doing business, like
food safety is part of doing business,'' said Temple Grandin of
Colorado State University, the nation's leading authority on humane
livestock handling. McDonald's audits ''sent a big message out to
the industry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
suspended an 11-month protest campaign that included handing out
boxes, labeled ''Unhappy Meals,'' that were illustrated with
graphic pictures from slaughter plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the company, PETA said the slaughterhouse audits
and hen standards were ''a fine step in the right direction'' and
urged additional moves, such as refusing to purchase pork from
farms that confine sows to stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers care about social issues. They expect a lot from
companies like McDonald's,'' said Bob Langert, the company's senior
director of public and community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Audits assess whether the animals are frightened or upset during
handling and whether they are properly stunned before being bled
and skinned. A plant automatically flunks if auditors find an
animal is bled while still conscious.
</P>
<P>
   When properly handled, animals are calm and feel no pain when
they die, Grandin said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another a benefit for the companies, because stress can
result in discolored meat.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in industry practices are evident at the Premium
Standards Farm Inc. slaughterhouse in this northern Missouri town,
which kills 7,000 hogs a day.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the chutes and holding pens, including sprinklers
that are activated on hot days, are designed to calm the hogs. The
pens themselves resemble facilities where the animals are raised.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company became the first U.S. plant to install a
new stunning system that uses carbon dioxide rather than a jolt of
electricity to anesthetize pigs. Researchers say gassing is less
stressful for the faster-growing but more excitable pigs now being
bred.
</P>
<P>
   The Milan plant already was among the more humane
slaughterhouses in the country before McDonald's started its
audits, Grandin said. But Colleen Schultz Kaster, Premium
Standard's vice president of food safety and technical services,
said the restaurant chain's monitoring has made her job easier in
getting approval from company executives for further improvements
in the plant, such as a planned expansion of hog-handling
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just me asking for it. It's McDonald's asking for it,
and your children's Happy Meals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also has started conducting internal animal-welfare
audits based on the McDonald's reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, just 30 percent of the cattle slaughtering plants that
Grandin surveyed were stunning cattle properly. During the first
half of 1999, that had risen to 74 percent. By the end of the year,
90 percent had acceptable scores, she reported.
</P>
<P>
   Grandin also scored plants for the amount of mooing and
squealing heard -- such noise is a sign that the animals are under
stress -- and found that it has fallen, too. In 1996, the hog plants
she surveyed were so noisy they couldn't be scored. In 1999, more
than 70 percent had acceptable vocalization scores.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a real success story for the industry,'' said Carrie
Cooper, who writes about animal handling for the trade magazine
Meat &AMP; Poultry. ''It's a good example of the customers working with
the plants. It's not an adversarial relationship. It's very
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is considering setting
animal-handling standards for slaughter plants and has stepped up
training of its inspectors to detect proper and improper treatment
of livestock.

<HEADLINE> Affleck, Damon To Help New Filmmaker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS (AP) -- Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who went from
obscurity to celebrity for their 1997 screenplay ''Good Will
Hunting,'' will use the Internet to help launch the career of an
aspiring filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends have joined with Miramax and HBO to launch
Projectgreenlight.com -- the Hollywood phrase used for approving
production of a film.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish there was something like this when we were trying to
break in,'' Damon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, contestants can submit an original screenplay
online and join with other budding filmmakers to help choose the
winner. The winning screenplay will be announced in March. Miramax
will supply a $1 million budget and release the film in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Damon and Affleck will be co-executive producers of the film.
Although the actors didn't rule out starring in the winning film,
they would have to take a significant salary cut to keep the movie
within its budget.
</P>
<P>
   The contest will run through Oct. 22. Until then, contestants
can talk about filmmaking in chat rooms on the Web site, a feature
the producers say will lend guidance and support to otherwise
solitary screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very least, you will get feedback,'' Affleck said.
''Ideally, everyone gets something out of this.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper Sentenced To 12 Years In Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanley ''Flesh-N-Bone'' Howse has been
sentenced to 12 years in prison for assault with an assault rifle
and being an ex-convict with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Howse, of the Grammy-winning rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, had
faced up to 19 years in prison of the Dec. 26, 1999, incident.
Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp gave him the lesser term after
reviewing documents showing the rapper was abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the worst cases I've read in terms of childhood
abuse,'' the judge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper was convicted in June of pointing an AK-47 at a man,
despite the victim's testimony that Howse never threatened him with
a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jonathan Kissler told the judge his 27-year-old
client ''suffered horrendous childhood trauma'' that impact his
adult life.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loves guns and that's something that bothers the court,
bothers society and bothers himself,'' Kissler said.
</P>
<P>
   Howse has been convicted seven times since the mid-1990s of
crimes ranging from assault to spousal abuse, according to court
documents.

<HEADLINE> Royals 3, Indians 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gregg Zaun hit a solo homer with two
outs in the eighth inning Friday night, giving the Kansas City
Royals a 3-2 rain-delayed win over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Zaun's seventh homer came off Steve Karsay (5-9) and gave Kansas
City the win in a game delayed 1 hour, 50 minutes by rain in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians began the day tied with Oakland in the AL wild card
race and the five-time AL Central division champions could be
eliminated from the division race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico (8-6), Kansas City's fourth pitcher, earned the
win with two innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians went up 2-0 in the second against starter Brian
Meadows, when Sandy Alomar hit an RBI double and scored on a single
by Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City cut it to 2-1 in the second, on an RBI single by
Carlos Febles. Febles was thrown out trying to score on Johnny
Damon's double. The Royals tied it at 2 in the fourth on Mark
Quinn's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed chances to score in the middle innings, when a
second round of showers threatened to force a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland reliever Chris Nichting was lifted with the bases
loaded and two outs in the sixth, after hitting Joe Randa, walking
Quinn and then hitting Zaun with another pitch. Steve Reed defused
the threat when he got Febles to hit into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians appeared to have scored the go-ahead run in the
seventh, when Manny Ramirez doubled to left center with one out and
Roberto Alomar on first. But Ramirez's hit off Dan Murray bounced
over the wall, forcing Alomar to stay on third, and Paul Spoljaric
came on to record two quick outs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ramirez has reached base safely in 48 straight games, the
longest such streak in the AL this year. ... Quinn threw Ramirez
out at second in the third inning, his eighth outfield assist of
the year. That leads AL rookies. ... Meadows, who didn't return
after the rain delay, was denied a chance to win a fifth straight
start in September. ... Cleveland's Sandy Alomar passed Luke Sewell
into third place in the number of games caught for the Indians.
Alomar started his 944th game as Cleveland's catcher.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 5, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ray Durham took a few awkward steps and
collapsed, falling face first onto the artificial turf. What
followed were some of the most scary moments in this very memorable
season for the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star second baseman lay dazed and confused at the
Metrodome as his teammates, trainer Herm Schneider, manager Jerry
Manuel and a Twins team doctor went quickly to his side Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Not until after they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 did they know
their friend was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had this funny look on his face and then just kind of
tumbled to the ground. For a second, I thought he was joking about
something with the umpire,'' Chicago first baseman Paul Konerko
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''After about a second I ran over there. Something was wrong. He
was just trying to say stuff but it seemed like he couldn't move
his lips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Durham was carted off the field and taken to a hospital, where
X-rays and a CT scan were normal, Schneider said. The diagnosis was
bruised ribs from a head-first home plate slide and collision with
Twins catcher A.J. Pierzynski minutes before his collapse.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the clubhouse following the game, Chicago's
leadoff hitter sat on a training room table, still looking woozy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what I did. I'm all right now, I'm just a little
sore,'' Durham said, adding he'll need a few days to get right
again. ''All that is sore is my ribs. Everything else is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Durham wasn't there to see the White Sox beat the Twins. Later
in the night, second-place Cleveland lost to Kansas City 3-2,
cutting Chicago's magic number to two for winning the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Durham wasn't sure what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a moment there I was kind of out of it,'' he said. ''I was
talking and they kept talking to me and asking me questions. Good
thing I answered the questions right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the third, Durham slid head-first into the plate
to score a run. Back on the bench, he rubbed his midsection.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, Durham had taken warmups -- he had just
thrown a ball over Konerko's head at first base -- when he took a
few steps toward the White Sox dugout on the first-base side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was running off the field and I just felt like I had heavy
legs. It's happened before, but it was a long time ago,'' Durham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Manuel: ''He's fine. They couldn't find anything wrong with
him. He just happened to get dizzy. They did everything they could
to check him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider spoke with Durham's wife, mother and agent from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He assured them that it looks like Ray is going to be fine,''
agent Ed Setlick said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the ballpark, though, was thinking about Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, you're very concerned. When I went out there, he
was still kind of dazed,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Durham was rolled over on his back, and after several minutes of
attention from Schneider and Twins team physician Dr. Tom Jetzer,
Durham was able to sit up.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel and several teammates surrounded Durham while he was down
and DH Frank Thomas came out of the dugout to be with his fallen
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was scary, but he's OK. I saw a big hole in his shirt. The
blow at the plate really dazed him. Ray's tough as nails and he got
up and went back to the dugout, but he was out of it,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Durham was lifted onto a cart and taken off the field,
Schneider wrapped his arm around Durham's shoulder to cushion his
head. Durham was taken by ambulance from the Metrodome to a
hospital a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the third, Durham had stopped at third on Thomas'
single to left, but then went home when left fielder Jacque Jones
both catcher A.J. Pierzynski and Twins starter Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   Radke picked the ball after it rebounded and Durham slid into
Pierzynski to beat Radke's throw for a run that tied it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I thought he hit his head on my knee, but after I saw
the replay that didn't happen,'' Pierzynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit his 20th homer, a solo shot in the eighth off Bob
Wells (0-7) to put the White Sox ahead to stay at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Barcelo (4-2) got the victory in relief. Keith Foulke
got his 32nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Perry hit a two-run homer in the sixth to put Chicago
ahead 4-3 before Matt Lawton hit a solo shot to tie it in the
seventh off Mark Buehrle.
</P>
<P>
   Pierzynski hit a two-out RBI single to put the Twins ahead 3-2
in the fourth.
Notes: The White Sox have scored 939 runs. The 1931 New York
Yankees hold the major league record with 1,067. ... The Twins
announced they had signed a two-year player development contract
with the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League to be their
Triple-A affiliate.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Venus and Serena Williams overcame a
slow start Saturday to reach the quarterfinals in doubles at the
Olympics, beating Elena Likhovtseva and Anastasia Myskina of Russia
4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, who are three-time Grand Slam champions, won for
the 30th time in their past 31 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Before a capacity crowd of 4,000 on Court 1, Venus and Serena
each lost her serve in the opening set, and Serena struggled at the
net. But the sisters took advantage of early breaks in each of the
last two sets for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams puts her 29-match winning streak on the line
Sunday (Saturday night EDT) in the quarterfinals of singles against
Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario, the last player to beat her. That was at
the French Open, before Williams began a run that has included
titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten became the first
quarterfinalist in men's singles, beating Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia
7-6 (2), 6-3 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, seeded second, is one of only six seeded men remaining.
Top-seeded Marat Safin lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In other women's play, 10th-seeded Elena Dementieva of Russia
and No. 12 Barbara Schett of Germany advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Dementieva beat Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6-2, 6-1. Her
opponent in the quarterfinals will be Schett, who rallied past
Julie Halard-Decugis of France 2-6, 6-2, 6-1.

EU Outlines World Crises Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ECOUEN, France (AP) -- Defense ministers from the European Union on Friday
detailed the number of planes, ships and troops a proposed EU defense force
would need to ensure it can tackle world crises. The 15 member states are
expected to announce the resources each will commit to a rapid reaction force of
between 50,000 and 60,000 troops, able to deploy within 60 days and sustain
itself for a year. The corps is due to be operational by 2003. The new force
will mean that the EU is able to take military action when the United States
does not want to get involved, a key factor in promoting the bloc's credentials
on the world stage.

to make sure that the Russian army is not shamed again.'' Russia suffered a
humiliating defeat in the 1994-96 Chechnya war. Federal troops withdrew, giving
Chechnya de facto independence. Russian troops entered Chechnya nearly a year

Lee, 60, pleaded guilty Sept. 13 to one of 59 counts against him. The other 58

prosecution that had kept him in solitary confinement. Cecilia Chang of the Wen
Ho Lee Defense Fund in Fremont, Calif., sent out a thank-you note Friday to Lee

By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing a prospective heating oil crisis, the
government is putting 30 million barrels of its petroleum stockpile
into the market, hoping the additional crude will ease tight
supplies and reduce prices before the arrival of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were uncertain how much of an impact the additional oil
will have as it is released from the government reserve over the
next 30 days, and Republicans called it an election-year ploy aimed
at getting votes for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not political,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
insisted as he announced the oil drawdown Friday -- in the form of a
''swap'' for future oil -- from the federal Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. The reserve on the Gulf Coast has about 571 million
barrels of oil for use in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to help the American people get home
heating oil,'' said Richardson, adding that ''we need to make sure
that American families are warm this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time since the emergency reserve was
created after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that oil has been
ordered taken to deal with supply problems. The other was in 1991
when 21 million barrels was drawn just before and during the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   While hailed by many Democrats, the action was denounced by
Republican lawmakers and GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush,
who called it a favor to Gore ''to achieve short-term political
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserve should only be used ''in case of war or major
disruption of energy supplies,'' not to manipulate prices, said
Bush, echoing some GOP congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the oil reserve was created to address acute supply
disruptions or other emergencies that do not now exist. Bush said
use of the oil now could leave the country without an adequate
reserve when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action enhances our security,'' Richardson insisted,
because the refining companies that obtain the oil are obligated to
return oil to the reserve -- plus an additional amount -- before the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason that we are doing this is not for price, but to
deal with disruption, to deal with the problems of extreme
shortages,'' said Richardson. He cited Energy Department figures
that show distillate inventories -- heating oil and diesel fuel --
are 25 million barrels, or about 19 percent, below normal
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is most acute in the Northeast, where people rely
heavily on oil to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just what the doctor ordered. There will be an
immediate impact on prices when the markets realize we mean
business,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has lobbied the
White House to make some stockpiled oil available.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the oil will be offered for bid beginning Monday
with releases to continue for a month. He did not rule out further
action later if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While even a 30-million barrel infusion of government oil into
the market is small -- about the amount used in two days by the
nation's refineries -- the impact of government action could be
significant if it signals that the government is ready to
intervene, some energy specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're projecting that by Halloween the crude prices will be
$25 to $27,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst at A.G. Edwards
&AMP; Sons in St. Louis. On Friday, November crude was trading down
$1.32 at $32.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down the line it could help some,'' said Wilfrid L. Kohl of
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He said
''perception'' often plays a role in dictating future oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Gore sought to distance himself
from Clinton's decision, but he clearly welcomed the announcement.
A day earlier he had publicly urged the president to use the
reserve oil to ease the threat of soaring heating costs, and
continued the theme Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the reserve to try to affect prices has been the subject
of intense debate within the White House for months. Last spring,
when oil prices soared and gasoline costs skyrocketed, Clinton's
advisers were largely opposed to intervention.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, views began to change even among members of
the president's economic team as a series of production increases
by OPEC oil producers failed to push down prices or ease the supply
crunch, said one senior White House official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Army: Gunmen Kill Colombian Peasants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen wearing military uniforms killed
scores of peasants in two separate massacres in the north,
including nine people singled out on a farm and shot in the head,
the army said.
</P>
<P>
   A priest reported that up to 30 or more of the rural poor may
have been killed Thursday by the gunmen in the massacres near the
village of Tierralta, 330 miles north of Bogota, the army said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy and troops were headed to the region, army
spokesman said. But the army said the gunmen arrived at one farm
and singled out at least nine workers whom they shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who the killers were. Local media
reports speculated they were either members of a right-wing
paramilitary group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or
AUC.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar province, where the killings occurred, is an AUC
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes have targeted peasants before in the farming and
ranching region as they hunted for sympathizers of leftist
guerrillas groups who extort money from large landowners and kidnap
them.
</P>
<P>
   The AUC is estimated to have about 6,000 combatants and has
links to government security forces. Many AUC fighters are former
government soldiers. The AUC is paid by landowners for protection
services, and also makes money by taxing Colombia's drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Gore Presses Oil Plan  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coincidence? Or calculation? Not long after Al
Gore said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be tapped to help
homeowners beset by soaring heating costs, President Clinton said
that's what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not political,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself claimed no knowledge of Clinton's decision in
advance, as he campaigned on the oil issue for a second day, this
time in western Pennsylvania before an invited audience of 40
families with heating oil price problems.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the administration's announcement Friday, Gore held
his first campaign news conference in more than two months -- a
coming-out that might have put some in mind of that
weather-watching Pennsylvania legend, the groundhog.
</P>
<P>
   He flew back to Washington without saying anything more about
the announcement that 30 million barrels would be released. Gore
had urged the government to release 30 to 35 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   It all played neatly into a package meant to present Gore as a
leader who can get things done and isn't afraid of taking on
corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not sit on our hands and follow an agenda of, by and
for Big Oil,'' Gore told the Pennsylvanians.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, campaigning in
Florida, said, ''Ten months ago, the president and the vice
president thought it was a bad idea to release oil out of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that we're 45 days away from the election, they've changed
their mind,'' Bush said.'' ... It's a bad idea because the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve needs to be used in case of war or
major disruption of energy supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP running mate Dick Cheney called it ''an expedient, crass
political move.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, surrounded by couples invited to hear his oil case at
a union hall in Vanport, Pa., said ''some of these families in here
are facing an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   He charged that the oil industry has ''been trying by every
means possible to see an increase in the price of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The big oil companies have gone over there and said to OPEC,
'Why don't you cut back on your production, and that will raise the
price of oil for everybody,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These prices are skyrocketing, it's hurting small business,
it's hurting those on fixed incomes, it's hurting young families,
and the prospect for even higher prices ahead is going to cause
even more trouble unless we act,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was addressing a major concern in Pennsylvania, a
23-electoral vote swing state both Gore and Bush have high on their
target lists. According to the Gore campaign, 1.2 million
Pennsylvania homeowners use oil for heat.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Gore said he is campaigning ''as though
I am one vote behind'' in every state, despite polls indicating he
is even with Bush or ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have an overconfident bone in my body,'' he said.
''This is very much out there to be won or lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rejected suggestions that he will have the advantage
as the better and more experienced debater when he faces his
Republican rival next month, saying ''this ought to be a fresh
slate, even-steven going in.''
</P>
<P>
   On oil, he said that taking no action would lead to even higher
prices than those already squeezing families like those invited to
his session in Vanport, who said their heating oil costs had more
than doubled, to $1.30 a gallon or more.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, Ramona Wichter asked him whether major oil
companies were making more money because of the price surge.
</P>
<P>
   ''You bet they are, there's been a doubling of profits,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, of course Governor Bush, being a big oilman, he's not
going to do much about it,'' Wichter said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' said Gore.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ambassador Security Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has suspended the
security clearance of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk
pending an investigation into alleged security violations, a State
Department official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
''no indication of espionage in this matter,'' and that Indyk has
''cooperated fully'' with investigators from the State Department
and FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time there has been no indication that any
intelligence information has been compromised,'' the official said.
''This is a question of security procedures that have not been
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk, 49, is barred from handling classified materials and must
be escorted inside the State Department building.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials told The Washington Post the
investigation involves ''sloppy handling of information'' over ''a
longer period of time'' before Indyk took his position in Israel.
Indyk, who became a U.S. citizen in 1993, has been ambassador to
Israel from April 1995 to October 1997 and again since last year,
the Post said in its Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Post also reported a source outside the State Department
familiar with the investigation as saying it relates to Indyk's use
of unclassified, government-owned laptop computers to prepare
memorandums about discussions with foreign leaders while in
transit.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright approved the suspension,
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told the Post. ''She
holds Ambassador Indyk in very high regard and values his
contributions greatly,'' the spokesman said. But, he said, ''she
has been absolutely clear on the need for everyone to follow
security procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Indyk said: ''I regret that my trying to
do best possible job under very difficult conditions has led to the
temporary suspension of my security clearances while it is
determined whether correct security procedures were followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Security officials at State decided to pull Indyk's clearance on
Sept. 12, although no action was taken until Thursday. Members of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee requested a briefing on
Indyk on Tuesday after an anonymous phone caller told a committee
aide the department was going to ignore security concerns about
Indyk, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk's suspension comes in the same week it was revealed that
the Defense Department was investigating former CIA Director John
Deutch for alleged security violations he committed while deputy
secretary of defense. Those alleged breaches also included the
sloppy handling of secret data on personal computers and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch admitted to security violations as CIA director after he
retired; he apologized and was stripped of his security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have been extremely sensitive to
security issues since the April disclosure that a laptop computer
containing top- secret information about arms proliferation had
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension makes it virtually impossible for Indyk to do his
job at a critical juncture in peace negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born Indyk was named the senior Middle East
specialist on the National Security Council in January 1993. In his
first ambassadorship, he was an important conduit between the
Clinton administration and the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Laura Bush Glad To Be in Schools  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEHALL, Ohio (AP) -- Laura Bush reads to children with an
unwavering smile, trades pets' names with pupils, hold hands in the
hall and, if she's in the mood, makes ''rabbit ears'' behind a
child's head when it's time to take a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a teacher, I like to visit schools,'' says the former
librarian who married George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She generally leaves speeches to the politicians in the family.
But she can turn no-nonsense when someone questions the Republican
presidential nominee's stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband doesn't advocate vouchers,'' she said sharply in
response to a question about Bush's position on tax money for
children to attend private schools. ''He thinks vouchers are a
local issue and states need to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush campaigns on her own regularly, almost exclusively
with schoolchildren. While her husband campaigned in Cleveland this
week, for example, she joined Ohio first lady Hope Taft at a
suburban Columbus elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't forget to read every day -- it's good exercise for your
brain,'' she said as she walked hand-in-hand with 10-year-old guide
Kenny Tuaquoi.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, 53, toured classrooms and traded favorite pet names
with children -- ''I have a cat named Ernie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a rocking chair in the library with one of her
favorite children's books, ''Officer Buckle and Gloria'' by Peggy
Rathmann, she read with the cheery but disciplined voice of someone
who's used to reading aloud to an audience prone to wiggling. She
then donated the book to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Never dropping the demeanor of a patient teacher, she cautioned
a photographer about to back into a post, quizzed students on
safety tips cited in ''Officer Buckle'' and didn't blink when a
student interrupted her media briefing with an apparently
unorchestrated ''Three cheers for Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Taft!''
</P>
<P>
   Posing for group photos with students, she played along with the
first- and second-graders by making ''rabbit ears'' behind one
child's head.
</P>
<P>
   Kae Elementary School principal Peggy Martinez said the
governors' wives chose the school after pupils wrote to Taft,
asking him to read there. The school has doubled its passing rate
on the state's fourth-grade proficiency test with the help of money
from a state program that encourages literacy programs and
volunteer tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving her husband behind in Cleveland was fine with her, Laura
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a teacher, I like to visit schools. These are the issues I
like to talk about, these are the issues I know the most about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she prefers such smaller events, she has addressed large
gatherings, too -- even the Republican National Convention in
support of her husband this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He's often noted that he promised her before they were married
that she would never have to make a political speech, but he told
the convention, ''I know you're as glad as I am that she didn't
hold me to that promise.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she launched the First Lady's Family Literacy
Initiative for Texas and helped found the Texas Book Festival to
benefit Texas public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   While the Texas governor goes running for relaxation on the
campaign trail, his wife curls up with a book. She's reading
Katherine Anne Porter's collected stories.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Midland, Texas, she grew up the only child of Harold and
Jenna Welch. She graduated from Southern Methodist University,
earned a master's degree in library science from the University of
Texas at Austin and worked as an elementary school teacher and
librarian from 1968 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   She married George W. Bush, in 1977, three months after their
first date.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have kept their twin daughters, who are college
freshmen, out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very busy with their own lives, and we want them to
have a lot of privacy,'' Laura Bush said Thursday on ABC's ''Good
Morning America.''

<HEADLINE> Bush: Gore Overconfident Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Pumped by funky Latin music and a week undistracted
from his message, George W. Bush is making his most direct appeal
for help in loosening Democratic rival Al Gore's grip on Florida
and its 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you ready to work?'' the Republican presidential nominee
hollered to thousands of party activists crammed into the Coconut
Grove Convention Center, still throbbing to the steamy beat that
greeted the candidate, his brother Jeb and their families to the
stage Friday. ''Tonight after we leave, let's redouble our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's talk to those Democrats around South Florida who want
new leadership, who are sick and tired of the attitude in
Washington, D.C,'' Bush said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Swing voters are key to Bush and Gore's efforts to win the
influential state that the Republicans had considered a sure win.
Jeb Bush is governor and the GOP controls the legislature. But
polls show Gore and Bush in a dead heat, and the candidates are
waging a fierce battle especially among seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also courted elderly voters Friday by pushing a plan to
spend $67 billion over the decade to search for cures for age-old
afflictions -- $32 billion of that new proposed spending -- including
Alzheimer's disease and many forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''As president, I will fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach
far beyond what seems possible today,'' the Texas governor said at
a town hall-style meeting at the Sun City retirement community on
Florida's west coast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said Bush was copying a proposal the vice
president made several months ago to spur the research budget of
the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. And it painted the new
promises as a budget-buster, given Bush's other plans for tax cuts
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't pay for the promise he's making today,'' said Gore
spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign could not explain Friday how it was
accounting for its own budget increase for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the vice president would spend an additional $83.9
billion on medical research -- taking $18 billion from the projected
surplus and the rest from higher tobacco taxes. But the proceeds
from the tobacco taxes are, in Gore's budget blueprint, set aside
to make his fiscal plans balance and not apparently available for
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how you count it, the vice president is underfunding
what is necessary to fight diseases of the elderly,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''But worse, he is again making up phony
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   As he promised new medical research, Bush also hunted for the
right prescription to break ahead in a dead-even contest he had
been leading earlier. But being put off-balance by Gore for several
weeks slowed Bush down, and he dispensed this week with what had
become daily question-and-answer media sessions to focus instead on
his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no 'have to' (win) about it; we are going to win,''
Bush told an airport rally in Sarasota on his third swing through
Florida this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sun City Center, Bush told a predominantly elderly
audience that, if elected, he would ''promote medical advances with
new resources and new resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Bush would complete a five-year plan already in
progress in Congress to double NIH funding by 2003, to about $27
billion. Then, he proposes to keep that budget growing at the same
pace for the rest of the decade -- roughly 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to double the portion of the NIH budget that goes
for research grants between 2000 and 2006. That would bring the
level of grants to about $30 billion in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has the nation's largest concentration of people over 65
-- more than 18 percent. Elderly people are among the most active
voters.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore Lauded For 'Realness'  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Out campaigning, Tipper Gore often tells
her audiences, ''Politics is personal.''
</P>
<P>
   How personal?
</P>
<P>
   How about the greeting she got here from Sandra Bradley? ''You
saved my life,'' Bradley told her as she was handshaking her way
through the crowd at a rally for husband Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by other supporters eager to meet her -- and handlers
itching to keep her moving -- the vice president's wife stopped for
several minutes of talk with Bradley, who said she'd suffered from
depression and considered suicide but then had been inspired by
Tipper Gore's open discussion of her own depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wouldn't let go of me, just hugged me,'' Bradley said. ''I
don't know the last time I had a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mary Elizabeth ''Tipper'' Gore, campaigning isn't all hugs.
Or kisses, though she's still being asked about that Democratic
convention smooch from her husband. She says she's no born
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've evolved,'' she said, reflecting on her public style in an
interview with The Associated Press. ''Thank goodness!''
</P>
<P>
   When she married Gore three decades ago, she thought she was
wedding a newspaper reporter, albeit a senator's son. And Al Gore's
own political ambitions awakened soon after.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for her at first, she said. ''I'd never done public
speaking before.''
</P>
<P>
   But she gained strength when she learned to focus on her reasons
for enduring public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the purpose here? Why am I doing this?'' she asks
rhetorically. ''I believe in what I said, that we should
participate in our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, she made her own foray into the limelight with her
push for parental warning labels on music with violent or sexually
explicit lyrics. She also has been a strong advocate of helping the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, she has made mental illness her issue by publicly
discussing her depression after the Gores' son, then 6, was struck
by a car and nearly killed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also have three daughters, two of whom addressed the
Democratic National Convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning through Washington state this week, she drew crowds
everywhere, from an upscale cafe in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland
to the cafeteria of a technical college in industrial Tacoma. It
was clear that women in particular see the 52-year-old grandmother
as approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ''She comes across just as your next-door neighbor,'' said
Lorraine Oswin, 78, who let her coffee and chocolate cake sit
untouched as she waited to shake Gore's hand in Kirkland.
''Tipper's going to pull a lot of women voters.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Gore shifts easily between quiet
conversation and belly laughs. Onstage, she seems relaxed and
passionate about her husband. At an event at the technical college,
she threw back her head and laughed when she saw a woman holding a
hand-lettered sign saying, ''You go girl!''
</P>
<P>
   Torrents of laughter also greeted the notion that the passionate
kiss she shared with her husband at the convention may have turned
the tide of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh wow. You know, we could have saved a heck of a lot of
money,'' she quipped, quickly adding she believes her husband's
introduction to the nation, not the smooch, gave him a
post-convention increase in support.
</P>
<P>
   While she has a photogenic smile -- and is a former news
photographer herself -- Tipper Gore hardly seems a polished
politician. She says ''um'' when she talks. She's prone to nervous
giggles. And when her cell phone rings in her purse during a

back with an abashed expression on her face.

   ''Real -- that's the best way to describe her,'' said Randy
Loomans, a labor leader in Washington and one of a dozen women who
rode on the bus as she toured the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to call her, so I called her Mrs. Gore. She
said, 'Please call me Tipper,''' Loomans said. ''I may have been in
awe, but she was real.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Spain, the water polo power of the past
decade, opened defense of its Olympic men's title with a
hard-fought 8-7 victory over Kaszakstan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Estiarte, the 39-year-old Spanish captain playing in his
sixth Olympics, scored three goals, upping his total to 120 in his
Olympic career.
</P>
<P>
   Spain won the gold in Atlanta and the 1998 world championships
to go with its silver at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. It also won
silver at the 1990 and 1994 world championships. Kazakstan is the
Asian champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the close first half, Estiarte scored twice, but was matched
by Yuri Smolovyy.
</P>
<P>
   Spain had a two-man advantage early in the third period and
Estiarte scored for a 5-4 edge. Sergei Pederol scored on another
power play.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Zhivchikov came back to cut it to 6-5 when he beat Spanish
goalie Jesus Rollan that had Rollan furious.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Garcia scored the winning goal with 2:53 left in the game.

<HEADLINE> South Korea 7, Japan 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- South Korea's top rookie revived its
medal-round hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Hong Sung-heon snuffed out Japan's potential winning run
with a sweep tag at home in the bottom of the ninth, then hit a
tough-chance grounder in the 10th that led to a 7-6 victory
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hong, who was South Korea's Rookie of the Year in 1999 for the
Doosan Bears, hit a grounder down the line that deflected off the
glove of third baseman Norihiro Nakamura for a run-scoring error in
the 10th. A sacrifice fly made it 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Japan got a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 10th, but
the game ended with a double-play grounder. Hong ran to the mound
and jumped into the arms of reliever Jin Pil-jung.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left South Korea (3-3) still in the running for a
medal-round berth. Japan (4-2) finishes round-robin play with Cuba
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (5-0) and Cuba (4-1) led the eight-team field
heading into their international grudge match later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same old story for Japanese starter Daisuke
Matsuzaka, who again gave a full-length performance only to watch
from the bench as his team lost.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuzaka, Japan's major league Rookie of the Year in 1999,
pitched 10 innings of a tournament-opening 4-2 loss to the United
States in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He went nine this time, leaving with the score tied at 5. Both
teams had runners thrown out at the plate in the ninth to keep it
there.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Koreans stood in the outfield terrace and cheered
throughout, urged on by uniformed cheerleaders with pom-pons. They
jumped, hugged, blew whistles and waved flags as the South Koreans
hit one hard shot after another in a four-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   After a single and a walk, Kim Dong-joo -- known for hitting the
longest homer in Korean league history -- doubled to right-center
for a 2-0 lead. Kim hit one out of Olympic Stadium in Seoul this
season for Doosan.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Lee Seung-yuop -- Korea's version of Mark McGwire
-- broke an 0-for-10 slump with a first-pitch homer. Lee, a
187-pound first baseman, hit a Korean- record 54 homers last season
with the Samsung Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked good at that moment for South Korea, which had its
best pitcher on the mound. But Chung Min-tae, who'd like to play in
the U.S. major leagues next season, didn't make it out of the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshinora Okihara, an industrial league shortstop, hit his first
pitch for a leadoff homer and Nakamura drove in another run with a
single off Chung's right shin, just below the knee. Chung left the
game and was taken for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Japan pulled even at 5 in the seventh inning on a two-run single
by So Taguchi, a Gold Glove shortstop from Japan's major leagues.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Less than 48 hours after becoming the
first team ever to throw a scare into a U.S. men's Olympic team
with NBA players, Lithuania got back to the business of chasing a
third straight medal.
</P>
<P>
   There was no emotional letdown over what might have been. In
fact, Lithuania came out and took control in the opening 10 minutes
Saturday (Friday night EDT) and beat China 82-66.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand which games we must win and this was a must-win
game for us,'' guard Sarunas Jasikevicius said. ''No matter how
good you play against States, you really need to beat teams like
China if you want to get a good position (in the quarterfinals).
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there was a letdown. If anything, I think we
were really ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lithuania became the first team to lead in the
second half over a U.S. Olympic team since the NBA players started
competing in 1992. With just over a minute to play, Lithuania was
within five points but missed two free throws and the U.S. team won
85-76, by far the closest anyone has come against one of the Dream
Teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were really disappointed against States because they didn't
give it their best against us and we had the opportunity but did
things like miss 16 free throws so we were really disappointed,''
said Jasikevicius, who played at Maryland and now plays
professionally in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lithuania player with Atlantic Coast Conference ties,
Darius Songalia, will be a senior at Wake Forest this season. He
had 19 points on 7-for-10 shooting and grabbed six rebounds against
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the great game we played against States, the coaches
said in the locker room right away that this was going to be our
most important games and we had to let that game go
psychologically,'' Songalia said. ''We did and everybody came out
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania (2-2), bronze medalist at the past two Olympics, used
an 11-0 run to take a 21-12 lead over China (1-3) in the opening
eight minutes. The same tough defense Lithuania played against the
United States was there, but so was a pretty potent fast break to
try to offset China's height advantage, with 7-foot-5 Yao Ming and
7-1 Wang Zhizhi.
</P>
<P>
   China was never closer than nine points in the second half and
Lithuania finished with a 35-25 rebound advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's a tough game when you get banged around like
these two games and then have to get out on offense,'' said the 6-8
Songalia, who went against the likes of Alonzo Mourning, Kevin
Garnett and China's front line, a tougher two days than even a
weekend against Duke and North Carolina. ''Today we just tried to
run and get on the fastbreak and the coaches said their big guys
would get tired and they were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yao had 23 points on 9-for-12 shooting for China, while Wang,
who was saddled with foul trouble and played only 26 minutes, had
12 on 4-for-11 shooting.
Yugoslavia 78, Spain 65
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Danilovic scored 13 of his 14 points in the second half
as Yugoslavia pulled away to remain unbeaten in pool play.
</P>
<P>
   Danilovic, who played for the Miami Heat, missed all four of his
shots in the opening 20 minutes as Spain (1-3) stayed within two
points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But Danilovic had nine points in a 2&AMP;frac12;-minute span in the second
half, the last four in an 11-0 run that gave Yugoslavia (4-0) a
58-47 lead with 7:30 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia shot 71.4 percent in the second half (15 for 21) as
Danilovic hit all four of his field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Herreros had 16 points for Spain.
</P>
<P>
Russia 77, Canada 59
</P>
<P>
   Russia (2-2) put itself in good position to advance to the
quarterfinals by handing Canada its first loss of the tournament
with some outstanding defense.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Fetisov had 15 points to lead Russia, which faces winless
Angola in its final pool game. Yevgeny Pachoutine had five points,
seven rebounds and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Canada (3-1) came into the game leading the tournament with a
59.8 shooting percentage. Against Russia it was 32.8 percent (19
for 58) as Rowan Barrett and Michael Meeks, the second- and
third-leading scorers in the tournament at 19.0 and 18.3 points,
were held to two and six points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are long and athletic and they take things away,'' Canada
coach Jay Triano said of Russia. ''They deflected a lot of passes
and we didn't have a lot of control. You're not going to win
shooting like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia opened the second half with a 13-2 run for a 58-38 lead,
holding Canada to one field goal over the first 6:40. Canada got
within 10 points twice, but each time Sergei Tchikalkine hit a
3-pointer to extend the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash, who plays for the Dallas Mavericks, had 15 points to
lead Canada, while Todd MacCullouch, who plays for the Philadelphia
76ers, added 11.
</P>
<P>
   Canada can still win its pool by beating Yugoslavia in its final
game on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 8, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics took over the wild card
lead and tightened the AL West race, getting two-run singles by
Eric Chavez and Jeremy Giambi in a five-run first inning to beat
the Seattle Mariners 8-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics closed within one game of Seattle for the division
lead. They also moved one game ahead of Cleveland, a 3-2 loser to
Kansas City, for the wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   The A's won for the seventh time in eight games -- all on the
road -- to move to a season-high 16 games over .500. The Mariners
lost for the second straight night to Oakland after a season-best
eight straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off Tim Hudson's 5-2 victory Thursday night, the A's got
a solid performance from Omar Olivares (4-8). It was his first
start since June 16, a day before he went on the disabled list with
a strained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In five-plus innings, Olivares gave up two runs on four hits and
two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Service pitched four innings, giving up one run, for his
first save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia (8-5), who was 4-0 in four previous starts in
September, gave up four hits and also made a throwing error in the
first inning when Oakland batted around.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland can move into first place in the division Saturday, for
the first time since June 28, if it can beat the Mariners on
Saturday. That would give the A's the lead by a single percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   After Garcia surrendered three consecutive hits, capped by
Miguel Tejada's two-run double to open the fifth, he was gone. He
gave up eight runs, six earned, on eight hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long drew a walk to lead off the game, Randy Velarde
singled and Matt Stairs hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk to Ben Grieve, Chavez singled for a 3-0 lead.
Garcia threw the ball into center when he attempted to pick off
Grieve at second, moving runners to second and third, and Giambi
singled them home.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Stairs and Grieve singled before Tejada's double.
Center fielder Mike Cameron's error on Grieve's hit allowed Grieve
to take an extra base and resulted in another unearned run off
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore drove in Seattle's first run with an infield out
in the third. After Olivares was taken out after hitting Alex
Rodriguez in the back with a pitch to lead off the sixth, Edgar
Martinez had an RBI double off Service and pinch-hitter Raul Ibanez
had a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez's 137th RBI of the season tied Babe Ruth's major
league record for the most RBIs for a player 37 or older. Ruth had
137 when he was 37 in 1932. ... Tejada had his ninth three-hit game
of the season. ... The Mariners announced their schedule for the
2001 season. They will open it at Safeco Field against Oakland
Monday, April 2.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Prison Riot Kills One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Juvenile inmates rioted at a prison
in northern Honduras after police stopped an attempted mass escape
Friday. One inmate was killed in the 50-minute melee.
</P>
<P>
   Two bystanders were also injured when a guard dropped his gun
while running across the street to call for backup. The gun went
off when it hit the pavement, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The riot broke out after police shot into the air to stop 40
inmates who had jumped one of the fences surrounding the state
penitentiary in San Pedro Sula, 112 miles north of the capital,
authorities said. They did not release any more details.
</P>
<P>
   Rival gangs have caused numerous problems at the prison of 1,600
inmates in the past year. In November, 12 prisoners had their
throats slit and 32 others were injured in a fight between gang
members armed with sharp instruments, sticks and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have identified more than 200 gangs in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1999, Honduras' prison system saw more than 100
riots and 5,000 escapes.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Rison Surrenders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Oakland Raiders receiver Andre Rison was
convicted of one count of felony theft after pleading no contest
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rison first surrendered to Jackson County, Mo., authorities
Friday on four charges of writing bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   Rison, who spent the last three seasons with the Kansas City
Chiefs, posted $10,000 bond and was released. His initial court
appearance is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after posting bond, Rison entered the plea on the theft
charge in Johnson County, Kan., District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The charge stemmed from Rison's rental of a $1,000 tape recorder
last year from an Overland Park, Kan., business. He is scheduled to
be sentenced in that case Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver was charged in April with four felonies for
allegedly writing $158,000 in bad checks to an Atlanta jewelry
store. Those charges involved checks from a Jackson County bank or
transactions in the county in 1998, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia store, Elif Fine Jewelry, won a civil judgment
against Rison in December for $287,900 in jewelry, plus about
$43,000 in legal costs. The civil judgment involves the Jackson
County checks and other transactions, according to court records.
The company went to prosecutors after it could not collect the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rison also owes more than $34,000 in child support for his
2-year-old son, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   A Johnson County, Kan., judge has already entered a $200,000
civil judgment against Rison in a case brought by one of his
Leawood, Kan., neighbors, who said he never repaid money she lent
him. An additional claim of fraud in that case is scheduled for
trial next month.
</P>
<P>
   Police in River Falls, Wis., cited Rison last month for
allegedly giving false information after a bar fight.

<HEADLINE> Ronstadt Stalking Charge Dropped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A man enamored with Linda Ronstadt didn't
get to meet her in court but he did get a stalking charge against
him dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Bernard Ortiz was dismissed in favor of a
restraining order barring him from contact with the singer and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to have this trial because it would finally be his
chance to meet Linda,'' prosecutor Dan Nicolini said Thursday.
''She didn't want to feed that desire of his to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt also didn't think sending Ortiz, a schizophrenic, to
prison would help him, Nicolini said
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Ortiz, 56, was dropped Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz started writing Ronstadt letters in 1997 through her
brother and sister. The next year, Ortiz pleaded guilty to
attempted stalking and was placed on three years' probation. He
violated the conditions within three weeks by contacting her
family, and was sent to prison for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz started writing the singer letters again in October 1999,
Nicolini said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities arrested Ortiz on a felony warrant for stalking in
May after finding him at a Sun City arena where the singer was to
perform.

Israel Ambassador Security Suspended

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has suspended the security clearance
of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin S. Indyk pending an investigation into
alleged security violations, a State Department official said Saturday. The
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was ''no indication of
espionage in this matter,'' and that Indyk has ''cooperated fully'' with
investigators from the State Department and FBI. State Department officials told
The Washington Post the investigation involves ''sloppy handling of
information'' over ''a longer period of time'' before Indyk took his position in
Israel.

U.S. To Release 30M Barrels of Oil
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing a prospective heating oil crisis, the government is
putting 30 million barrels of its petroleum stockpile into the market, hoping
the additional crude will ease tight supplies and reduce prices before the
arrival of winter. Analysts were uncertain how much of an impact the additional
oil will have as it is released from the government reserve over the next 30
days, and Republicans called it an election-year ploy aimed at getting votes for
Vice President Al Gore. It is only the second time since the emergency reserve
was created after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that oil has been ordered taken
to deal with supply problems. The other was in 1991 when 21 million barrels was
drawn just before and during the Persian Gulf War.

between 50,000 and 60,000 troops, able to deploy within 60 days and sustain
itself for a year. The corps is due to be operational by 2003. The new force
will mean that the EU is able to take military action when the United States
does not want to get involved, a key factor in promoting the bloc's credentials

company -- this time chipmaker Intel Corp. The Dow closed up 81.85 at 10,847.37,
after dropping more than 140 points early in the session. The Nasdaq finished
down 25.11 at 3,803.76.

<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- The team that pulled off the biggest
upset of the Olympic baseball tournament became the first to lose
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Holness hit a pair of solo homers, including one in the 10th
inning for a 3-2 victory Saturday (Friday night) that severely
damaged the Netherlands' medal-round chances.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after it became the first team ever to beat Cuba in
Olympic baseball, the Netherlands (2-4) became the first ever to
lose to South Africa (1-5), making its inaugural appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Holness, the only dependable hitter in South Africa's lineup,
drove in all three runs with a sixth-inning homer, an eighth-inning
double and his 10th-inning shot that was only South Africa's third
of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-inning homer came off center fielder Rikkert Faneyte, a
part-time pitcher who also was called on to close out the 4-2
victory over Cuba on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Harrell pitched all 10 innings for South Africa, giving up
six hits and five walks while striking out four. Ken Brauckmiller
singled home a run in the seventh and Hensley Meulens doubled to
tie it in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Giants 1  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Curt Schilling picked the wrong time to get
his game together.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Giants clinched the NL West title with a victory
over Arizona, Schilling pitched a four-hitter to end his five-game
losing streak Friday night and lead the Diamondbacks to a 7-1
victory over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling struck out 10 and walked one in his eighth complete
game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight was probably as good as I've felt all year,'' he said.
''I felt healthy. Everything felt right.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had lost six straight, including an 8-7 defeat Thursday
night that clinched the division for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (11-12), who made a disparaging remark about Giants
star Barry Bonds to reporters after the game Thursday night, won
for the first time since Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to push Arizona over the top in the NL West after
coming over from Philadelphia in July, Schilling had been 0-5 in
his last six starts. He also had two singles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our reports said he had been struggling the last few starts,
but he was dealing tonight,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ''He
was spotting his fastball at 90-95 miles per hour. And he threw an
occasional split and breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling and the rest of the Diamondbacks never mentioned
Bonds' name after the game. Instead, talk was on the Giants' fans
at Pacific Bell Park, who loudly booed the pitcher for his
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''He kind of fed off the crowd,'' manager Buck Showalter said.
''He's a good competitor and they got his juices flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling called it the most hostile environment he's seen in a
long while.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fans are very aggressive and you appreciate that,'' he
said. ''The difference between here and Candlestick Park is like
night and day. It's not like a West Coast crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants clubhouse, boisterous the night before, was nearly
silent after the loss. The players quickly left.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (11-7) allowed five runs on seven hits in five
innings to lose for the first time in seven starts since Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds slid on the outfield grass as he tried to field Tony
Womack's hit to left to lead off the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Womack ended up with a triple, then scored on Danny Bautista's
sacrifice fly. Luis Gonzalez walked, went to second on Steve
Finley's single, then scored on Matt Williams' broken-bat single up
the middle. Gardner ducked to avoid the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds doubled off Schilling in the bottom of the inning with two
outs. Jeff Kent walked, but J.T. Snow flied out to right field to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Schilling singled, went to second when Gardner
couldn't get to Womack's grounder, and took third on Bautista's
single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling and Womack scored on Gonzalez's blooper to right, and
Bautista came in on Greg Colbrunn's sacrifice fly to center, giving
the Diamondbacks a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants avoided the shutout in the bottom of the inning.
Armando Rios tripled then scored on Doug Mirabelli's sacrifice fly
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Womack added an RBI single and Bautista hit an RBI double in the
top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The feud between Bonds and Schilling apparently stems from
an incident years ago when Bonds predicted a home run against
Schilling and hit it. Schilling said that didn't happen ... A day
after the Giants clinched, Baker had all his starters in the
lineup. He planned to give the regulars a rest Saturday for the
first game of a doubleheader, then play them again Saturday night.
... Livan Hernandez will start Game 1 of the playoffs for the
Giants. Baker has not determined the rest of the playoff rotation.
... It was Schilling's 65th career complete game. ... Bautista was
2-for-4 with a sacrifice fly. ... Womack was 3-for-5.

<HEADLINE> Children Smuggled For Camel Races  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- All 10-year-old Mohammed
remembers is meeting a mysterious red-bearded man in his village in
Pakistan, and then waking up from a drug-induced stupor in an
airport thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing: he says the red-bearded man told him he was now
a camel racer, at which point he fled the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The case has thrown renewed light on an abuse that is gaining
increasing attention from human rights advocates: the use of
children as jockeys in the camel races that are popular in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Arab Emirates banned the use of child
jockeys seven years ago, tiny Pakistanis or Bangladeshis are still
being smuggled into the oil-rich Gulf with promises -- usually false
-- of wealth. Since they are lighter than adult jockeys, children as
young as 4 have reportedly been forced to race camels and risk
dangerous falls.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe little Mohammed Zubair Arrian was kidnapped,
drugged and smuggled into Abu Dhabi on a Pakistan International
Airlines flight from Islamabad on a forged travel document.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he met the red-bearded man in Medina Syedan, his
village in Punjab province. He remembered losing consciousness in
his village, but nothing more until he awoke at Abu Dhabi
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I opened my eyes, I was in a totally different world,''
the hazel-eyed, brown-haired child said in an interview. The
red-bearded man ''threatened to kill me if I made any noise. But as
soon as he turned his back, I ran for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A passer-by found him lost and crying on the streets of Abu
Dhabi on Sept. 6, and turned him over to police.
</P>
<P>
   Ansar Burney, a Pakistani human rights lawyer, happened to be
visiting the Emirates, heard of the case and approached Emirates
authorities and the Pakistani Embassy. He said Mohammed phoned his
father, who had filed a missing persons complaint at his village
police station. The father sobbed with relief, Burney said.
</P>
<P>
   The red-bearded man is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   The Emirates Camel Racing Association declined comment on the
use of children for camel racing, refusing even to say what
penalties are imposed for violating its 1993 ban on jockeys under
the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on the Emirates
said ''relevant labor laws often are not enforced, as those who own
racing camels and use the children come from powerful local
families that are in effect above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   London-based Antislavery International, which has campaigned
against the use of child jockeys, says it knows of no one being
penalized for the practice.
</P>
<P>
   How could a drugged child be smuggled into a foreign airport?
Burney said airport, airline and immigration workers often take
bribes to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ''God saved this boy; he is very lucky to have escaped,'' Burney
said. ''We are grateful for the Emirates authorities, who did
everything possible to help us in this case.'' He said he was
arranging to get Mohammed home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mohammed seems to have been the victim of an outright
kidnapping, some parents are so poor that they sell their children
to men recruiting camel jockeys, to begging or drug smuggling
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Burney was credited four years ago with bringing home a group of
five children smuggled to the Emirates to ride camels. In 1998, he
persuaded Saudi authorities to release 22 children who were used to
smuggle drugs into the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Alaskans Work On Rape Reduction  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Native groups and police are joining
forces to deal with the rape and sexual assault of Native women, a
problem that has helped put Alaska at the top of the FBI's rape
statistics for most of the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are looking for a solution,'' said Denise Morris,
executive director and president of the Alaska Native Justice
Center, one of the groups in the ad hoc committee. ''I think it is
very important everyone is at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety issue in Anchorage has become acute. In the past 15
months, five Native women have been slain, and police say a sixth
victim may have looked Alaskan to her attacker. All the victims
were either homeless or substance abusers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's focus is on public education and prevention. It
has launched several initiatives, including educating rural Natives
about the dangers of urban areas, placing signs about sexual
assault in bar bathrooms and handing out wallet-sized cards with
personal safety advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is having an impact because the Native community
and law enforcement had never worked together before. This is
creating ... a bridge,'' said committee Chairwoman Cindy
Pennington, an Alutiiq and former police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Native women account for only 3.5 percent of Anchorage's 255,000
residents but constitute about 45 percent of rape victims,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear yet whether the committee's work is having an
effect. The numbers looked promising in 1999 when there were 161
reported rapes in Anchorage and the percentage of those who were
Native women fell to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this year there have been 143 reported rapes and
their percentage has increased to 42 percent. Committee members
note, however, that Native women may feel more comfortable
reporting rape now because of the committee's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members tried to pinpoint what was placing Native
women in particular at risk. They learned that Native women from
rural Alaska who come into the city for conventions and festivals
are more vulnerable because they don't have transportation and
accept rides from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages, everyone relies on each other to get around.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think nothing of flagging someone down for a ride,'' said
Karen Bitzer, executive director of Standing Together Against Rape.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, volunteers accompanied by plainclothes police
officers are on street corners handing out cards with safety tips
and instructions on how to get help. Free rides also are offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming from rural areas, you are more trusting, more open. The
likelihood of something happening increases,'' police Lt. Tom
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee stresses that rape should not be viewed as just a
Native problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps was to get the Downtown Bar Association
involved and train bartenders to spot predators, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   They look for a man who is buying a woman drinks but not
drinking himself, or a man who follows a woman from bar to bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think that waking up with a hangover is bad, imagine
waking up as a rapist,'' reads a sign in a men's bathroom.

<HEADLINE> Hamm's Goal Explosion Still On Hold  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- A statistic on Mia Hamm: She is tied
for leading scorer on the U.S. women's soccer team at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   How many goals has she scored? One. Six different U.S. players
have scored the six U.S. goals going into Sunday's semifinal game
against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Another statistic on Hamm: Her 126 international goals make her
the most prolific scorer ever in the women's game, but she has
never scored more than two goals in a world championship tournament
-- which for her includes three World Cups and the 1996 Olympics. It
would be as if Michael Jordan, Hamm's Nike commercial partner, had
scored all his 40-point games in the regular season with none in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go into a tournament, and you have personal goals that
you'd love to achieve,'' Hamm said. ''As front-runners, we all want
to score, we all want to help our team win. But I sit down and look
at the results that we've had, and I'm not going to trade those
results to get more goals for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is a fickle game, and goals don't come often even for the
best. But Hamm, who has been known to struggle with
self-confidence, is the most recognizable player in the world, and
the pressure rises at the big events for her to produce a flurry of
legendary, Pele-like finishes.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if it would happen at these Olympics. Hamm scored
two goals in a 4-0 victory over Brazil in the final warmup game
before the team left for Australia. She pumped her arms in
celebration after a great solo effort on the second goal, and her
former coach, Tony DiCicco, said she had reached a ''maturity
factor'' that would help her ''break out and have her best world
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm did score in the first game at the Olympics, a confident
strike after beating the offside trap against Norway. Asked after
the game what she would do to make sure Hamm keeps it up, coach
April Heinrichs deadpanned, ''We're not going to feed her for two
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm did not have a good game three days later, a 1-1 draw with
China. She looked tentative and appeared to pass up scoring
chances. She spent much of the game putting pressure on China's
defenders, who were constantly sending long balls forward. Hamm
also picked up a yellow card for disputing a call by the referee.
</P>
<P>
   The third game, against Nigeria, was an aberration. Both Hamm
and fellow forward Tiffeny Milbrett had to play cautiously against
a Nigerian defense that tackled with reckless abandon. Hamm served
up a fine corner kick that led to a goal by Brandi Chastain to give
the U.S. team the lead, then concentrated on not getting another
yellow card, which would have led to a one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't be as aggressive defensively,'' Hamm said. ''And
emotionally I had to be under control.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does Hamm stand going into the semifinals? Heinrichs
and the other players, aware of the pressure on Hamm's sometimes
delicate psyche, are quick to defend her. They point out that she
has played well defensively, can't find space to score because
other teams mark her so closely, and that she has helped set up
goals that make the American attack more than one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   ''China went home,'' Heinrichs said. ''And only two players had
scored for them. When you have a team like ours with six players
scoring goals, how do you scout that?''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' only concern is that Hamm is trying too hard to help
on defense, a point well taken by the 28-year-old forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get stuck back in the midfield sometimes, and as a
front-runner that's not where you want to be,'' Hamm said. ''But I
seem to get a lot of confidence offensively with my defense, and
sometimes it's at the expense of what I can do offensively. You try
to find a balance, but obviously my job is to help my team put the
ball in the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I just have to be as positive as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Spy Agency Disbandment Lauded  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori has sent Congress a
plan to disband Peru's disgraced spy agency, a move praised by
observers as a step toward easing the severe crisis that is cutting
short his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a bribery scandal engulfing his spy chief, Fujimori
last week promised to deactivate the much feared National
Intelligence Service and stunned Peru by saying he'd call a new
election, but not run in it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Fujimori sent the spy agency proposal to
Congress and promised to confirm by Monday that the spy chief is
out of office. Peru's widely respected national ombudsman called
the move ''encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The steps are now being taken to slowly break the impasse,''
said ombudsman Jorge Santistevan, alluding to days of foreign and
domestic pressure for Fujimori to make good on promises to disband
the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, the shadowy-but-powerful intelligence chief,
remained out of sight, as he has since the scandal broke. The
airing of a videotape showing him allegedly bribing an opposition
lawmaker sparked the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, protests against the government continued almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, anti-government demonstrators scrubbed red-and-white
Peruvian flags in soapy washtubs outside the presidential palace,
in a symbolic cleansing of Peru's ''dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   On past days they burned effigies of Fujimori and Montesinos,
and used fumigating guns to symbolically spray ''the rats'' out of
the palace, squirting foam, red paint and other liquids on rows of
irritated riot police. They even encircled the palace with a large
yellow tape embossed with warnings normally reserved for
construction sites: ''Danger! Mafia at work.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department on Friday advised U.S. citizens to reduce
travel inside Peru and avoid crowds, citing the potential of the
demonstrations, which have so far been largely peaceful, to turn
violent. The advisory ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government and opposition have reached agreement
for Fujimori to give written confirmation no later than Monday that
Montesinos no longer works for the state -- a key opposition demand
for continuing transition talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Latorre, a permanent representative of the Organization
of American States, said the agreement came in a meeting he
mediated Friday between government and opposition delegates on
holding a special election to replace Fujimori after his decade in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Latorre said the government agreed to certify that Montesinos
''no longer exercises any function ... of any kind for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks are part of an internationally backed effort to
strengthen Peru's democracy after Fujimori's much criticized
re-election in May.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to officially disband the spy agency, Fujimori's
government sent Congress a package Friday that called for scrapping
the nationwide network of agents and informants within 15 days of
the legislation's enactment. Fujimori has majority support in
Congress, and so the urgent measure was considered very likely to
pass soon.
</P>
<P>
   It called for a commission made up of the country's prime
minister, and interior and defense ministers to oversee the
dismantling of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders had warned that the dialogue on democratic
reform could be short if Montesinos isn't formally separated from
his public duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''This must inevitably begin with a resolution separating
Montesinos from any public function,'' said Alejandro Toledo, the
opposition leader who boycotted his May presidential runoff against
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo alleged at the time that election authorities were under
the sway of Fujimori and his spy chief and planned to rig the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won an unprecedented third, five-year term. His
government is proposing a March special election to replace him.
But he has rejected opposition calls to step aside early, vowing to
remain in office until he can hand over power to a new government
next July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Out Of Sync In 10-M Diving  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Americans dominated the Olympic
swimming competition. At the other end of the Sydney International
Aquatic Center, they were out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ruiz, the 21-year-old rising star of American diving, and
David Pichler, a 32-year-old in his second Olympics, finished
seventh out of eight teams on men's platform as synchronized diving
made its Olympic debut Saturday (Friday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   At least Ruiz and Pichler got to Sydney. The U.S. women failed
to qualify for the 3-meter synchronized event.
</P>
<P>
   American divers will be trying to avoid a medals shutout,
something that has happened only once since 1912, when the United
States boycotted the Moscow Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we could've medaled,'' said Ruiz, who moved from his
native Puerto Rico to Orlando, Fla., when he was 12 for better
training.
</P>
<P>
   Russia won the first two synchro golds, relegating the powerful
Chinese to the second tier of the medals stand.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Loukachine and Dmitry Sautin won the men's platform with
365.04 points. Vera Ilina and Yulia Pakhalina earned gold on
women's 3-meter with 332.64 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Jia and Tian Liang finished second on men's platform with
358.74 points. Germany's Jan Hempel and Heiko Meyer were third with
338.88.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little surprised because I thought China would win
platform,'' Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz, the first American since Greg Louganis to qualify in both
individual events, was clearly the stronger member of the American
team.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, a sixth-place finisher on platform at the 1996 Games,
botched the entry on his last two dives, creating a huge splash in
the water and resulting in scores ranging from 4.0 to 6.5. Ruiz'
marks were as high as 8.0 out of a possible 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our synchro was right on,'' Pichler said. ''Unfortunately, my
dives weren't particularly spectacular. I focused a little too much
on synchro. I left the last two dives a little short. It made a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans finished at 321.69, beating only the French in the
eight-team field and winding up a whopping 43.35 behind the winning
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has nothing to be sorry about,'' Ruiz said of Pichler.
''He's been a great partner. We both gave it our best. He was a
little bit out of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz will get a chance to win on his own when he dives in both
individual events. Pichler, 32, of Butler, Pa., is in the
individual platform and synchronized springboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I'm very disappointed,'' Ruiz said. ''It's just
going to push me even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   In women's synchro springboard, China's Fu Mingxia was denied a
record-tying fourth gold medal, taking silver with Guo Jingjing.
The bronze went to Ganna Sorokina and Olena Zhupina of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Louganis is the only diver to win four Olympic titles. Fu will
have another chance to equal his mark in the 3-meter individual
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried very hard to catch up but we couldn't do it,'' Fu
said. ''In terms of practical skill, I think they are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sautin, 26, broke the Chinese stranglehold on diving with his
10-meter victory in 1996. The Chinese won the other three events.
</P>
<P>
   Sautin and Lukachin briefly dropped to second behind their
rivals after Round 3, but clinched the gold with their two toughest
dives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done all right, but the Russians have done extremely
well,'' China's Tian said. ''The Russians had a high degree of
difficulty, which meant they were taking a big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian women led from start to finish in the 3-meter,
totaling 332.64 points on their five dives. China finished at
321.60.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainians were a distant third at 290.34.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Ilina, who won NCAA championships for Texas in
1997 and '98, had never finished higher than sixth in individual
Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   The synchronized event, in which divers leap at the same time
from adjacent boards and are judged on execution and
synchronization, gave her a chance to finally climb the medal
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe it yet,'' said Ilina, who flashed a ''Hook
'em, Horns'' sign. ''I have been going for it since I was 7. I'm
just so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese held down the top two spots after preliminaries of
the individual 10-meter competition Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sang Xue, 15, was first with 374.79 points and 16-year-old Li Na
was second at 366.60.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Wilkinson of The Woodlands, Texas, was in fifth with
331.20 points Sara Reiling of Roseville, Minn., was 16th with
282.84 points.
</P>
<P>
   The top 18 advanced to the semifinals on Sunday (Saturday night
EDT), to be followed by the evening final.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw On Bench For Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw watches intently as
her teammates scoot about the floor, then looks down and marks the
chart on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the sum of Holdsclaw's Olympic experience to date.
Like a backup quarterback in the NFL, she's on the bench with a
clipboard charting plays for coach Nell Fortner. The only
difference: she doesn't wear a cap.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, a WNBA all-star with the Washington Mystics, has yet
to play for the U.S. women's basketball team because of a stress
fracture in her right foot. The hope is she'll be ready for the
medal round starting Wednesday, but even that is iffy.
</P>
<P>
   It took her two months to get over an earlier stress fracture in
that foot. This one was found the day before the games started. She
does nothing at practice except watch and even if she could play,
her time on the court probably would be limited to short stints.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's coming along,'' Holdsclaw said Saturday (Friday night
EDT). ''Today I did some walking and little exercises to see how it
would feel. I'm just trying to take it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting plays at least keeps her in the games mentally. In a
93-42 victory over New Zealand on Friday, Holdsclaw kept track of
every play the team ran on offense, what kind of shot resulted and
whether it went in.
</P>
<P>
   ''That way I can go to Nell and show her what's working, that
we've run a certain play five times and scored four times,''
Holdsclaw said. ''It's kind of a chart to show what's been
effective for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw would prefer to have someone charting what she's doing
on the court, but that might not happen in these games. So she
tries to stay upbeat and tries to put her time on the bench to good
use.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you look at basketball from a different view,'' she
said. ''I guess it makes you a smarter player. I'm seeing what our
team is doing out there, who is scoring in what sets. It helps me
in learning where everyone is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortner did not sound optimistic about getting Holdsclaw back.
Though the U.S. is undefeated and hasn't had a game closer than 11
points -- not even the men's Dream Team can say that -- Fortner could
always use another body, especially one as talented as Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to her and the healing of her foot,'' Fortner said.
''I have no idea. I'd love to have her, but there's nothing we can
do about it. We just have to wait and see if it heals.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States (4-0) finishes pool play Sunday night (Sunday
morning EDT) against Poland (3-1), a game that will decide first
place in Group B. The Americans routed Poland 86-39 in Adelaide on
Sept. 7, but Poland didn't have its imposing center, 7-foot-2 Margo
Dydek, in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Dydek, who plays for the Utah Starzz, had 32 points, 13 rebounds
and five blocks in a 72-65 victory over Cuba on Friday. She'll
change things for the U.S. post players.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to make pump fakes that you're probably not used to
doing against someone that tall,'' Yolanda Griffith said. ''You
just don't go away from her. Attack her and get her in foul trouble
so they'll have to bring somebody else in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep everyone fresh, Fortner has scaled back practice.
The team did not practice at all the day before the New Zealand
game and worked for just an hour on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good,'' she said. ''We're playing well and we're
getting a lot of players minutes. We're not losing a lot when we're
subbing in. Really, we're not losing anything. I think that's been
a real positive.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Serbs Sticking With Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Her 11-year-old daughter hanging on
her shirttails, Sladjana Cosic waited in the narrow hallway,
seeking help from the local head of Slobodan Milosevic's political
party.
</P>
<P>
   These are troubling days for Cosic and other Kosovo Serbs who
scratch out a meager existence from humanitarian aid and garden
vegetables. Nevertheless, Milosevic remains popular, in part
because his anti-NATO message plays well among Kosovo Serbs who are
reminded every day that they lost the war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, they wonder what else they might lose if their
longtime leader exits the public stage after Sunday's election.
Polls show him trailing his main opponent, Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the election, Cosic and others had come to the
office of Milosevic's Socialist Party looking for favors. Though
she didn't say exactly what she wanted, she was clear on her
grievances: her husband needed a job; her daughter needed
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't optimistic anyone could, or would, be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just ready to explode with frustration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Veselinovic, 62, who runs the local office of the
telephone company, insists that 99 percent of the people support
Milosevic in this village eight miles south of the Kosovo capital,
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be president of the United States, not just
Yugoslavia,'' he said. ''The people want him.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's support among Kosovo's Serbs is critical, in part
because it is widely believed the Yugoslav president will use the
province as a base for widespread vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No proper census has been taken in Kosovo in a decade, and the
massive shifting of populations after the 1999 war has made it
impossible to know exactly how many Serbs live in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers estimate 60,000 Serbs are eligible to vote.
They plan to loosely watch the balloting to counter Milosevic's
expected inflation of that number.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters, meanwhile, are working to solidify the votes
they can, offering for example, to pay $2.50 to people who put up a
Milosevic poster on their home. Others waited outside the Socialist
Party offices to see if other ''help'' might come their way.
</P>
<P>
   Before the election, voters had little freedom of movement, few
economic opportunities and almost no options for improving their
lot. Besides all this, they are now facing political uncertainty --
and they are wondering if things really could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled this southern province
since the 78-day alliance air war forced Milosevic's forces to
withdraw. Those who remained have been subject to attacks leveled
in revenge for Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians, and have
watched helplessly as their declining numbers led to increasing
isolation within their own villages and within their country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has tried to help with programs to feed
Serbs in urban areas and bus services to link enclaves, but
spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said that the pressure the minority
communities feel has markedly increased in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Serbs have been forced to choose: Are you for
Milosevic or against him?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bad enough when you fear people outside the community,''
she said. ''But when you fear people within your own community
turning on you -- that's when it really gets dicey.''

<HEADLINE> Croatia 10, United States 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- This was no way to open the Olympics
for the U.S. water polo team.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans lost to Atlanta silver medalist Croatia on
Saturday, 10-7. Croatia used a fast-moving offense to spurt to a
7-2 halftime lead and cruise.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get easier Sunday for the U.S. team as it meets
powerful Yugoslavia, which won gold medals in 1984 and 1988, both
times beating the United States in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the line is Hungary, the favorite in the tournament
which also is in the Americans' preliminary group.
</P>
<P>
   The top four of the six-team group advance to the quarterfinals.
Their first performance does not indicate anything good is ahead
for the Americans, although Wolf Wigo scored three times for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatians controlled the tempo by moving the ball around
quickly and setting up scoring chances with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Dubravko Simenc opened the scoring seconds after Croatia got a
power-play advantage.
</P>
<P>
   After the Americans hit two goalposts in consecutive
possessions, Wigo tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatians took advantage of another power play and Ratko
Stritof made it 2-1. Igor Hinic made 3-1 when he skidded the ball
past U.S. goalie Dan Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   After Mile Smodlaka made it 4-1, Croatian goalie Sinisa
Skolnekovic kept stopping U.S. threats until Wigo broke through
with 4:41 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But it took less than 20 seconds for Stritof to reply, and an
interception seconds later led to a goal by Samar Barac that
Hackett got a hand on but couldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal by Hinic made it 7-2 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The United States outscored Croatia in the third period 2-1,
including Wigo's third. Two goals in the final two minutes by Chris
Humbert made it closer.

</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 5.5 quake struck at 1:22 a.m. and was centered

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Nike Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed an $11 million
lawsuit filed by an assistant soccer coach who claimed he was
forced to quit because he refused to wear Nike's ubiquitous swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New York,
Judge Allen G. Schwartz found no legal merit to any of the claims
made by plaintiff Jim Keady, including: federal civil rights and
human rights violations, criminal conspiracy, defamation and breach
of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also named St. John's University in Jamaica, N.Y.,
as a co-defendant.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a multimillion-dollar licensing deal between the
nation's largest Roman Catholic university and the Beaverton-based
sneaker company. Under the deal, the university's coaches and
athletes wore athletic equipment adorned with the Nike logo.
</P>
<P>
   Keady, a graduate assistant who worked with the team's goalies,
said he became aware of Nike's oft-criticized overseas factories
while studying for his master's degree in theology at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   He soon became convinced that supporting Nike's ''sweatshops''
was ''in direct violation of the social teaching of the Catholic
Church and the mission of our university.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Nike and the university, angry that
Keady went public with his position, ''forced him to resign and
conducted a campaign to discredit (Keady) and his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz found no evidence to support Keady's claims. He
also denied Keady's motion to amend his lawsuit to add racketeering
charges against Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint does not cure any of
the deficiencies in the original complaint,'' Schwartz wrote in his
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also criticized Keady for waiting five months to try
to add new allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court finds that (the) plaintiff acted in bad faith, and
with intention to unduly delay this litigation,'' Schwartz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Keady was overseas and unavailable for comment. His attorneys
did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nike and St. John's officials praised the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Sydney, Australia, where he is
attending the Olympics, Nike spokesman Vada Manager said the
company was vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''He failed the test legally, factually, as well as by acting in
bad faith,'' Manager said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, St. John's spokesman Jody Fisher said,
''The ruling clearly reaffirms our position, which we have
steadfastly maintained.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- It was a day of U.S. Olympic
disappointment: missed medals, too-small shoes, a sudden
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That changed once the American swimmers hit the pool intent on
making a final golden memory of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of swimming Down Under, the Americans continued
to dominate: four races, four medals -- including two consecutive
relay golds, in two consecutive world-record times, in the last two
races of the games.
</P>
<P>
   The first came in the women's 400-meter medley relay, adding an
eighth gold to Jenny Thompson's impressive Olympic legacy while
shaving a staggering three seconds off the previous mark. Thompson
now has 10 medals overall, including a silver and bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time Jenny got in the pool, I knew we had the world
record. I knew,'' said relay teammate Megan Quann, who also won
gold in the 100 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   The second gold followed in the men's medley relay, with the
Americans blowing out the runner-up Australians. The eight-day
competition ended the same way: The United States collected 33
medals, including 14 golds, to the host nation's 18 medals and five
golds.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting their golds, the U.S. men unfurled a banner
reading: ''Sydney 2000. In our hearts forever. Thanks Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The last races were typical. The women's 50? A bronze for Dana
Torres. Men's 1500 freestyle? A bronze for Chris Thompson. Then the
relay golds. Not a g'day, but a great day in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the American women could catch Dutch swimmer Inge De
Bruijn. She captured her third medal of the games in the 50-meter
freestyle, adding it to her world-records victories in the 100
freestyle and 100 butterfly. She also anchored the Dutch 400
freestyle relay team to silver.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the pool, the Americans were not as successful.
Running, rowing or spiking, there were no perfect endings for U.S.
Olympians outside the Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TRACK: Note to Charles Austin: check shoes before next
competition. The defending high jump champion arrived in the
Olympic Stadium, tried on his shoes -- and discovered they were too
tight. A tag on the new pair had the wrong size, Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin wound up borrowing a teammate's shoes and bowing out of
the competition. ''It's the weirdest thing that's ever happened to
me,'' said the five-time U.S. champion.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Deal, after a surprising performance, made a surprising
announcement. Deal, the 1996 silver medalist in the hammer throw,
failed to advance past the qualifying round Saturday and then said
this was his last Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Deal said he would retire after the Grand Prix Finals in Qatar
next month. The two other Americans in the hammer, Jud Logan and
Kevin McMahon, disappeared with Deal.
</P>
<P>
   The hammer throw washout was the second of the day for Americans
at the track. The three U.S. hopefuls in the 800 meters -- Mark
Everett, Bryan Woodward and Richard Kenah -- did not advance past
their first heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bad time to run a bad race,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones cruised into the
semifinals in the men's and women's 100 meters. Jones, starting her
bid for five Sydney golds, ripped off a 10.83 run in her second
heat to send the competition a little message.
</P>
<P>
   American Michael Johnson, the defending champion, and Australian
Cathy Freeman, who lit the Olympic torch at the opening ceremony,
both posted first-round victories in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable casualty on the first day at the track was
defending 100 Olympic gold medalist Donovan Bailey. The Canadian,
after battling the flu for several days, ran out of steam in his
second heat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won its first track and field medals, in the
shot put. Adam Nelson took the silver, while 1996 silver medalist
John Godina won the bronze. Arsi Harju of Finland won the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: Venus Williams still has her eye on two medals. The
U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion, already in the quarterfinals in
singles, advanced to the same round in doubles with her sister
Serena. The pair, winning for the 30th time in their last 31
matches, beat Elena Likhovtseva and Anastasia Myskina of Russia
4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Olympic boxing officials agreed with U.S. fighter
Brian Viloria: He didn't receive credit for a dozen solid body
shots landed in his losing decision to Frenchman Brahim Aslouf.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges just didn't do a good job of scoring body punches
in the bout,'' acknowledged Loring Baker, an American and the
general secretary of the International Amateur Boxing Association.
The U.S. team did not appeal, and the decision will stand.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- ROWING: After a four-year wait for redemption, the U.S. rowing
team of Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft found frustration -- and a bronze
medal. In 1996, the pair had just missed a gold; the same fate
befell them this time.
</P>
<P>
   During the four years between, Ryan donated a kidney to her
brother and the pair stopped training. But they came out of
retirement two months ago for one last shot at a gold. Instead,
they picked up a bronze to go with their Atlanta silver.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Redgrave won the gold and made history in the process.
The British rower pulled his crew to victory in the men's fours
Saturday (Friday night EDT), making him just the third person to
win gold at five straight Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Two arrested for carjacking after syringe threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Two people armed with a syringe they
allegedly said was filled with AIDS-tainted blood have been
arrested for allegedly carjacking a Long Island woman.
</P>
<P>
   David Locicero, 28, and Jenny McGuire, 19, both of Selden, were
arrested Friday morning after a high-speed chase that ended near
the Roosevelt Field Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau police said the suspects approached an unidentified
30-year-old woman as she left a supermarket on South Bayview Avenue
in Freeport at 9:20 a.m. Locicero allegedly brandished the syringe
and demanded the woman's keys.
</P>
<P>
   The woman gave him the car keys and went to call police as the
suspects fled in her 1987 Chrysler, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding officers spotted the car on Atlantic Avenue and Mill
Street. The couple drove onto the northbound Meadowbrook Parkway
followed by an unmarked car and two marked cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Locicero drove against traffic onto the Zeckendorf Boulevard
entrance ramp in east Garden City. No cars were entering the
parkway at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The three police cars corralled the Chrysler on the entrance
ramp and stopped it just short of the street, police said. Neither
suspect tried to escape on foot and they were arrested at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known whether the syringe was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Locicero and McGuire were scheduled for arraignment Saturday on
first-degree robbery charges.

<HEADLINE> Report: Auction houses agree to pay $512 million to settle suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses have
reached a tentative agreement to pay $512 million to settle claims
they conspired to manipulate prices they were paid by sellers and
buyers, The New York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The auction houses are each responsible for $256 million of the
settlement, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified lawyers
involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement comes after a three-year Justice
Department criminal investigation into whether the two auction
giants, which control 95 percent of the $4 billion worldwide
auction market, stifled competition by colluding on several
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement could include payments from top
executives including former Sotheby's Chairman A. Alfred Taubman
and Diana D. Brooks, its former chief executive, the newspaper
said. Both resigned in February and are under investigation by
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached Thursday night by lawyers for the
auction houses and the lead counsel representing more than 120,000
buyers and sellers, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sotheby's declined to comment, and a spokesman
for Christie's did not return a message. Lawyers for both houses
and for the buyers and sellers either declined to comment or did
not return messages.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is equivalent to about three or four years of
annual pretax profits for each firm. Had the auction houses lost at
trial, they could have been liable for triple damages, a judgment
that could have reached $1.3 billion, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan must rule on whether to
approve the settlement preliminarily and give notice to the buyers
and sellers before the agreement can be formally announced, The
Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil case grew out of a federal antitrust investigation
focusing on documents that court papers say record years of secret
meetings by top officials of the two houses aimed at colluding on
fees paid by buyers and sellers and other business practices.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous lawsuits, individuals allege the auction houses
since Jan. 1, 1993, have agreed to charge buyers the same rates and
since 1995 have agreed to charge the same rates from sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the auction houses also allegedly agreed to stop the
previous practice of negotiating the amounts of sellers'
commissions with some of their richest customers.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Kaplan certified class-action status for everyone who
bought or sold items from the auction houses between Jan. 1, 1993
and Feb. 7.

<HEADLINE> Professor's focus: Dying children and their families  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - As a graduate student in anthropology at the
University of Illinois in the early 1970s, Myra Bluebond-Langner
chose to focus her research on a culture almost as remote and
uncharted as the primitive people of Oceania so famously observed
by Margaret Mead.
</P>
<P>
   She found her subjects in a local hospital ward: children
afflicted with terminal illnesses - a population rarely talked
about and hardly ever studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time there was nothing more secret in our society than
the issue of death, especially the death of a child,'' said
Bluebond-Langner, now a distinguished professor of anthropology at
Rutgers University-Camden, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bluebond-Langner has been researching and writing about
terminally ill children and their families for 29 years. She has
written two books and is regarded as one of the leading authorities
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Recently named director of Rutgers' new Center for Children and
Childhood Studies, she is now beginning a study on how health care
decisions are made for children with cancer who are unlikely to be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Now 52, Bluebond-Langner says her exposure to so much tragedy
has given her a special appreciation for how precious life is.
</P>
<P>
   The children were her teachers, she wrote in ''The Private
Worlds of Dying Children,'' published in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most of their lives, even when they were sick, they were
caught up in the business of living. There were people to talk to,
games to play, houses to build, pictures to draw. There was so much
to do, and so little time to do it in,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then again, there never really is enough time. Life is a
terminal illness for all of us. It is just that some know the end
before others. I caught the children's sense of urgency, their fear
of wasting time, their knowledge of the finitude of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluebond-Langner won the Margaret Mead anthropology award for
''The Private Worlds of Dying Children,'' a volume considered a
classic by professionals in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial stages of her work, Bluebond-Langner stood in
hospital corridors for hours on end, observing and taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   She especially noticed the pains adults took to hide from young
leukemia patients the seriousness of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses wrote ''Possible WBC (White Blood Cell) Disease'' on
charts rather than risk having children see the word ''leukemia''
and as a warning to other medical staff members that the children
had not been - and should not be - told.
</P>
<P>
   If the children asked pointed questions, nurses and doctors
would ignore them, leave the room or even reprimand the questioner.
Parents, too, were reluctant to respond candidly.
</P>
<P>
   The children picked up on these signals and began acting under
the pretense that they didn't know they were dying,
Bluebond-Langner found.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't say much when they were questioned by adults. But
she discovered, by playing with them, watching TV and sharing meals
with them, that they talked a lot with other ill children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became clear that not only did they know, but they knew
that people felt uncomfortable talking about it,'' Bluebond-Langner
said. ''Their reluctance to speak was ... an indication of their
awareness of others.''
</P>
<P>
   With adults, the children would avoid certain topics: their
condition, their drugs, their appearance, the death of other
children, holidays or other future plans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they would talk about their daily routine, TV shows,
restaurants, movies, books and sports. This ''mutual pretense''
enabled everyone to act as if the children would get better.
</P>
<P>
   At times the pretense would be shattered, and the children would
try to repair it. When Santa came to visit a 7-year-old boy three
weeks before Christmas, a suggestion that the boy wouldn't live
until the holiday, he turned to the choked-up family members and
nurses by his bed and said, ''Santa has lots of children to see, he
just came here first.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluebond-Langner concluded in ''The Private Worlds of Dying
Children'' that it is possible to tell from their behavior how much
dying children know of their condition. And she suggested that
adults should take their cues from the children in deciding what to
tell them about their illness and when.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision should be made by the same rule of thumb that is
applied in deciding what to tell children about sex,'' she wrote.
''Tell them only what they want to know, what they are asking
about, and on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   She also believes adults should be honest with dying children.
''Let us offer children our support and encouragement in a way that
respects their awareness of the situation in which they find
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ann Goldman, senior physician in palliative care at Great
Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, said
Bluebond-Langner's work had a major impact on the way she and her
colleagues relate to young patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinical practice has changed because of her book. People are
now more aware of what children do understand and it's important to
include them in when you're talking to the families, and listen to
their needs, their fears and their expectations,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   After one of the boys Bluebond-Langner had observed died, his
5-year-old sister said, ''Good. Now can I have his toys?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, 'She's saying something else here. She's hurt,
she's angry. She wants some attention back. She wants a part of
Jeffrey.' I thought, 'What's it like to grow up with someone who's
terminally ill?'''
</P>
<P>
   She observed the families of nine children with cystic fibrosis,
the most common fatal genetic disease in the United States. The
research formed the basis of a second book, ''In the Shadow of
Illness: Parents and Siblings of the Chronically Ill Child,''
originally published in 1996 and released in paperback this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children are keen observers,'' she wrote. ''Well siblings
perceive their parents' struggles. They sense the seriousness of
their sibling's illness and reveal their awareness in their play
and speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluebond-Langner concluded that ''despite the terrible burdens
placed upon both body and spirit, these families appear, at least
for long periods of time, very much like other families.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynda Rushton, a specialist in clinical ethics at the Johns
Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, called Bluebond-Langner an
''extraordinary researcher.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The voice that she brings is often a voice that either hasn't
been heard or hasn't been heard in the way she's able to portray
the situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her office, lined with photos of children, Bluebond-Langner
said the biggest lesson she has learned over the years is ''the
preciousness of time and life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds so cliche-ish, but I mean that. Time cannot be
wasted, in terms of what we do with our own lives.''

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Begins in Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (AP) -- Militiamen in West Timor surrendered
hundreds of weapons Saturday in the first step of what Indonesia
and the international community hope will be a total disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weapons handover, Indonesia's head of state warned
the situation in West Timor remained volatile.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, President Abdurrahman Wahid accused security forces
of wrongly releasing six people, including Indonesian soldiers and
militiamen, suspected of killing three U.N. foreign aid workers in
Atambua in West Timor on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to show the world that Indonesia is serious to solve
the problems, including the killing of three U.N. officials in
Atambua,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid swore in a new police chief and ordered him to take tough
action against the militias, which many claim are covertly
supported by elements within Indonesia's military.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid raised the possibility of direct foreign military
intervention in West Timor, which is controlled by Indonesia,
unless order is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are rumors that 800 U.S. marines are ready to be sent to
Atambua to help guard the U.N. people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials in Jakarta denied the existence of any
such plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Atambua, near the U.N. office where the three humanitarian
workers were slaughtered, 12 militiamen arrived at a local police
station with three cars packed with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In all, seven automatic rifles, nine grenade launchers, 485
homemade guns, four grenades and 687 rounds of ammunition were
handed in by members of the Thunder militia group, one of many
groups that killed hundreds of people during last year's rampage in
East Timor after a U.N.-sponsored independence ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of officers standing guard, the police placed the
weapons in white sacks before locking them away in the station.
</P>
<P>
   ''More weapons will come in over the next few days,'' said
Superintendent Simatubang. ''We are going to receive all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is under intense international pressure to clamp down
on the militiamen after the killings of the three U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees humanitarian workers and three
Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 U.N. and other aid workers have been evacuated from
West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen warned that Indonesia
risked losing international financial assistance if it fails to
immediately disband the armed groups.
</P>
<P>
   While Saturday's weapons surrender was a positive first step,
hundreds of other militiamen are yet to come forward and surrender
their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's government has promised to use force to disarm the
militias after Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are intent on destabilizing U.N.-administered East
Timor's transition to self-rule and preventing 120,000 East
Timorese refugees languishing in squalid camps in West Timor from
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers in East Timor said on Friday that they feared
some militiamen may sneak back into the territory to avoid being
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Two peacekeepers have been killed in gunbattles with the
militiamen in East Timor recently.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri was scheduled
to arrive in Atambua on Sunday to witness more weapon handovers.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Found in French McDonald's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMBERY, France (AP) -- French bomb experts were called to a
McDonald's in southeastern France on Saturday after an employee
found a small explosive hidden in the fast-food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the restaurant's cleaning staff found the explosive
in a package in a bathroom area designated for handicapped
customers, local police said. The device was described as small and
not connected to a detonator.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not expressly intended to kill,'' said Olivier
Biancarelli, an official from the regional Savoie government.
''There were no claims of responsibility or statements found at the
location.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the restaurant, which is located in a suburb of
Chambery, the capital of the Savoie region, had not received any
prior threats. Authorities in Lyon, France's second-largest city,
were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was going to reopen Saturday afternoon, but
employees were too frightened to return to work, French television
reported.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, a bomb exploded at a McDonald's in western France,
killing a 27-year-old employee. Breton separatists were blamed for
that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a militant sheep farmer was sentenced to
three months in prison for vandalizing a McDonald's in southern
France. The farmer said his actions were to underscore his
opposition to multinational corporations and bad food.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Explains Oil Reserve Tap  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday that tapping
the government's emergency oil reserve is ''plainly the prudent
thing to do'' and announced a series of other actions to shield
low-income families from exorbitant heating costs this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families shouldn't have to drain their wallets to drive their
cars or heat their homes,'' he said at the White House before
leaving on a political trip to California.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed that $400 million in federal aid be released
''to help families that can least bear the burden of high energy
prices.'' He said it was the largest such release ever.
</P>
<P>
   The president defended the decision Friday to put 30 million
barrels of the government's petroleum stockpile into the market and
rejected Republican charges that the move was politically motivated
to help Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the critics, Clinton said, ''I doubt if they are
relying on home heating oil this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall heating oil inventories are more than 20 percent lower
now than they were at this time in 1999, Clinton said. Inventories
are down 50 percent on the East Coast and more than 60 percent in
New England, raising doubts about adequate supplies in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to claims that he has not developed an adequate
energy policy, Clinton took a slap at the Republican-controlled
Congress, which he said has ''chopped, blocked and ignored''
administration proposals aimed at promoting energy efficiency and
development of renewable energy sources as alternatives to oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every dollar we've sought to invest in cleaner, efficient
sources of energy, they have provided a dime. I urge Congress to
get off the dime and take action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his use of the emergency reserve, Clinton said, ''It's
plainly the prudent thing to do. ... This is the right thing to do.
It's good energy policy. It's good national security policy and
good family policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $400 million in energy assistance, Clinton
said he also was:
</P>
<P>
   --Asking the Environmental Protection Agency to help states
identify ways to use more and different kinds of heating oil in an
effort to build inventories further.
</P>
<P>
   --Directing federal agencies to make early contractual
commitments to purchase heating oil to give wholesalers ''the
confidence to build inventories in advance.'' Wholesalers have not
built up stocks, anticipating wholesale prices may decline later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Asking state public utility commissions to make sure that
factories and businesses that use heating oil as a backup keep
adequate reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taken together, these steps will enhance our nation's energy
security and help to cushion families from high heating bills,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were uncertain how much of an impact the additional oil
will have as it is released from the government reserve over the
next 30 days. Republicans called it an election-year ploy aimed at
getting votes for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not political,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
insisted as he announced the oil drawdown Friday -- as a ''swap''
for future oil -- from the federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The
reserve on the Gulf Coast has about 571 million barrels of oil for
use in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time since the emergency reserve was
created after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that oil has been
ordered taken to deal with supply problems. The other was in 1991
when 21 million barrels was drawn just before and during the
Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   While hailed by many Democrats, the action was denounced by
Republican lawmakers and GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush,
who called it a favor to Gore ''to achieve short-term political
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The reserve should be used only ''in case of war or major
disruption of energy supplies,'' not to manipulate prices, said
Bush, echoing some GOP congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Pennsylvania Republicans by satellite Saturday from
Orlando, Fla., Bush accused Gore of using the reserve as a personal
''strategic political reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the oil reserve was created to address acute supply
disruptions or other emergencies that do not now exist. Bush said
use of the oil now could leave the country without an adequate
reserve when needed.
</P>

   Refining companies that obtain the oil are obligated to return

   Richardson cited Energy Department figures that show distillate
inventories -- heating oil and diesel fuel -- are 25 million barrels,
or about 19 percent, below normal nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the oil will be offered for bid beginning Monday
with releases to continue for a month. He did not rule out further
action later if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While even a 30-million barrel infusion of government oil into
the market is small -- about the amount used in two days by the
nation's refineries -- the impact of government action could be
significant if it signals that the government is ready to
intervene, some energy specialists said.

<P>
   ''We're projecting that by Halloween the crude prices will be
$25 to $27,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst at A.G. Edwards

$1.32 at $32.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down the line it could help some,'' said Wilfrid L. Kohl of
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He said
''perception'' often plays a role in dictating future oil prices.

<HEADLINE> State says school administrators have no discretion in drug tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state education commissioner has upheld
an administrative law judge's ruling that a high school vice
principal violated state law when he failed to order a drug test
automatically for a student after a teacher suspected the boy of
being under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe's ruling on Friday could
change the way schools across the state handle students suspected
of drug use. While state law emphasizes automatic drug testing,
administrators have often consulted with nurses or other teachers
or reviewed a student's history before calling for a test.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Wayne Hills High School vice principal Joseph
Graceffo is the first in the state to punish an administrator for
failing to test a student for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, a teacher reported 16-year-old Nicholas
Lucatorto smelled of marijuana. Graceffo took the boy to two
nurses, who cleared him, then declined to order a test. Two weeks
later, the student died after using heroin at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe ruled that administrators have no discretion in deciding
when to test students if a colleague suspects drug use and that the
decision rests solely with a teacher or staff member.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that suspect students must be examined by a doctor
and not just given a urinalysis or other chemical screening.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials said the ruling clarifies state law
for administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case has garnered a lot of attention, so if there were
any doubts among any principals, this helps them,'' Mike Yaple, a
spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, told The
Record of Hackensack for Saturday's editions. ''It basically tells
us that there just isn't any room for discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Lucatorto, Nick's mother, didn't blame Graceffo for how
he handled her son's situation, but said she was pleased the case
received so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel bad for Joe Graceffo with what he went through, but
somebody had to go through this to get the issue out in the open,''
she said. ''Hopefully this will prompt more training with dealing
with kids who are at risk. It seems like this is a clear message.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Law Judge Mumtaz Bari-Brown had dismissed charges
against Graceffo stemming from an earlier incident in which he also
used discretion. Hespe overruled that decision and said Graceffo
was guilty of unprofessional conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the education commissioner acknowledged that school
administrators and staff members need more training on drug testing
and said Wayne's drug policy was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe called the district's request to have Graceffo fired
''spurious'' and said the school board ''took no other action
against other staff members who failed to properly implement the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   He upheld the judge's ruling that Graceffo be reinstated to his
job after 120 days without pay, which the vice principal already
has served.
</P>
<P>
   Graceffo praised the ruling and said he plans to return to work
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an ordeal, but you have to respect the commissioner's
decision,'' he said. ''I think I have a tremendous respect among my
colleagues and the students. I have the opportunity now to get back
to doing what I love to do.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Israelis, Germans Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Israeli and German negotiators have met to discuss
the long unanswered question of whether relatives of the 11 Israeli
athletes who died at the 1972 Munich Olympics will receive
compensation, a magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 28 years nothing has happened, so it's time that we
finally settle the matter,'' the lead Israeli negotiator, Arie
Schumer, told Der Spiegel. An Israeli delegation has already met
with Erwin Huber, chief of staff for the governor's office in
Bavaria state, of which Munich is the capital, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   German officials had previously rejected all claims for
compensation by the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Der Spiegel reported that Bavarian officials, along with
federal and city authorities, are looking into what amount of
compensation they might give to the relatives of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists stormed an Olympic
Village apartment house at the Munich Games, killing two Israeli
athletes and holding the others hostage in an effort to gain the
freedom of 200 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a botched rescue attempt after a 20-hour standoff, nine more
Israeli athletes were killed, as well as five terrorists and a
German policeman.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo's Albanians Concerned  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Although Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
will stay on the sidelines in Sunday's Yugoslav elections, many of
them will be quietly rooting for Slobodan Milosevic -- the man who
drove most of them from their homes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovo Albanians, who technically remain Yugoslav citizens,
fear victory by opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica will
encourage the West to make overtures to Belgrade and undercut their
aspirations for independence from Yugoslavia's main republic
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be simpler if Milosevic wins,'' said Bajram
Rexhepi, the ethnic Albanian community leader in Kosovska
Mitrovica. ''But even if Kostunica wins, we will try for
independence. We won't push for independence now because this is
not the time. But we will in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kosovo Albanians could vote as Yugoslav citizens in
Sunday's balloting, few are expected to do so. Many of the
province's 2 million ethnic Albanians had been boycotting elections
and other Yugoslav institutions since Milosevic canceled Kosovo's
autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted by the U.N. court in The Hague for
atrocities committed by Yugoslav forces during the 18-month
crackdown, which ended when NATO-led troops arrived here last year
after the 78-day Western bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suffering visited on them during Milosevic's rule,
many ethnic Albanians realize that as long as he remains in power,
the West is unlikely to cut any deal with Belgrade which would
restore Serb rule that effectively ended when international
peacekeepers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the United States nor any other major power supports
independence for Kosovo. But as long as Milosevic is president,
however, the prospects for that goal are certainly no worse than
under a Yugoslav leader more acceptable to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is better for Kosovo if Milosevic wins,'' said Mimosa, an
ethnic Albanian journalist who refused to give her surname.
''Kostunica is an unknown. We don't know his strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians interviewed in this dusty provincial
capital fear the West, in its drive to get rid of Milosevic, has
misjudged Kostunica, who himself is a strong Serb nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   They fear an opposition victory could lead to the gradual
withdrawal of the international presence from Kosovo and a sudden
influx of aid for Serbia at Kosovo's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe thinks the opposition in Serbia is democratic. They
don't know it could be worse than Milosevic,'' said Daut Demaku,
55. ''The opposition of Serbia is more criminal than Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, who is leading in all independent polls, has promised
to seek the return of the estimated 200,000 Serbs who fled Kosovo
after Yugoslav forces withdrew. That worries Kosovo Albanians, who
complain Serb opposition leaders have never openly condemned
Milosevic for his crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition of Serbia never criticized Milosevic (on
Kosovo). They have the same ideas,'' Sabit Abdullahi said.
''Kostunica is a modern nationalist. I don't believe the West
understands this.''

<HEADLINE> Old Wounds Obstruct Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For Israelis, exile is as tangible as the
stones of the Western Wall, a remnant of the Jewish temple sacked
by the Romans in A.D. 70.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, exile also echoes in stones -- the ruins of
homes abandoned in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet seven years after grudgingly acknowledging each other's
existence, Israelis and Palestinians still don't acknowledge each
other's pain. Palestinians say the Jewish temple is a myth, and
Israelis say the Palestinians alone are to blame for their exile.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, these issues -- sharing Jerusalem's
walled Old City and recognizing the Palestinians' right of return --
have blocked a permanent peace agreement. On Tuesday, Israel
suspended the talks, saying the Palestinians were refusing to budge
on the Jerusalem issue. Both sides have signaled that they are
looking more for gestures than for full-blown concessions, but so
complex and emotional are the issues that only the most painstaking
diplomacy is likely to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you come saying 'we and only we,' it will not work,''
acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami recently told Palestinian
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a basic, willful Israeli blindness, a disregard for
Palestinian rights,'' counters Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, is where Jews
come to mourn their exile 1,900 years ago from the Promised Land,
and to celebrate the rebirth of their state.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, Israel's independence in 1948 is Al Naqba,
''the catastrophe,'' and each anniversary is a time for Palestinian
families to picnic among the ruins of the homes they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall abuts what Jews call the Temple Mount, where
they twice built temples in ancient times and saw them destroyed.
To Muslims it is Harem as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, the place
from which the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Two mosques
stand there now.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the peace process has pushed both sides close to the
crunch, virtually every prominent Palestinian is insisting there
was never any temple. Even moderates like Mahdi Abdel Hadi deny its
existence. ''Archaeologists investigated everywhere, and they came
up with nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the archaeological evidence is overwhelming, including
staircases that perfectly match contemporary descriptions; the
etched directive ''To the trumpeting place,'' the area of the
temple where the Sabbath was ushered in and out with fanfares; the
very stones themselves, framed with the trim favored by Herod, the
king who built the temple.
</P>
<P>
   David Jacobson, who teaches archaeology at London University,
said no serious scholar questions the Second Temple's existence at
the site, although there are some doubts about whether the First
Temple, destroyed 600 years earlier, also stood there.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are even Islamic documents that make it clear that in
the seventh century, Muslims knew this to be the site of the
(Second) Temple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, links Israel's claims to
the holy site to its refusal to accept a Palestinian right of
return to the homes many fled during the 1948 war; she sees both as
being designed to consolidate Israel's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians,'' Ashrawi said, ''have been flexible to the
point of self-negation.'' Abdel Hadi said talk of a Jewish temple
imposes a Zionist ''narrative'' on Palestinian history -- part of
what the Palestinians say has been a systematic attempt to
overwhelm Palestinians in their own land.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a Palestinian would accept this, it would be political
suicide, ending the Palestinian question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is the word Israelis use to describe the implications of
a state of 5 million Jews and 1 million Israeli Arabs allowing
another 3.5 million Palestinians the right to move in.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered to accept fewer
than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians maintain they fled in 1948 for fear the
Israelis would massacre them all. Israel says some were driven out
by the fighting between Israel and the invading Arab armies, while
others heeded those Arab armies' calls to get out of the way until
the newborn Jewish state had been vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a travesty of historical truth to present the
Palestinian refugee problem as the result of mass expulsion,''
Ben-Ami said this week in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
''It was largely the inevitable byproduct of Arab and Jewish fears
and the protracted bitter fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel ''can assume neither political nor moral responsibility
for this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Mr. Ben Ami 'forgot' to mention,'' Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's PLO retorted in a statement, ''is that when Israel
was created, approximately 400 Palestinian towns and villages were
depopulated by Jewish armed groups under the cover of the war and
were razed to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of them now exist only as faint traces -- a village
of roofless homes here, and heap of rubble there, or an Arabic name
transformed into Hebrew -- Majdel to Migdal, Ikhdera to the busy
coal refinery town of Hadera.
</P>
<P>
   Some contemporary Israeli historians, like Benny Morris and Tom
Segev, have studied the 1948 war extensively and conclude that the
truth lies somewhere between the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Morris uncovered substantial evidence that Arab leaders at first
encouraged Palestinians to leave their villages in order to clear
the area for all-out war, while Israel urged them to stay; but in
later months, Israel ''gained an appetite'' for forcing Arabs out
of their villages, although he stressed that it falls far short of
today's allegations of systematic ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he accused Ben Ami, himself a history
professor, of ''suppressing what he knows are the facts and lying
about a historical episode.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis ''ordered and expelled large numbers of villages,
attacked other villages, causing them to flee, and then wouldn't
let them back after the war,'' Morris said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Defense Chiefs To Meet  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Ever since the 1950-53 Korean War, the
armies of South and North Korea have trained on the assumption they
might engage in another fratricidal conflict. Next week, for the
first time, their defense ministers will meet to talk about peace.
</P>
<P>
   The volcanic cones and tangerine groves of the South Korean
resort island of Cheju will serve as the setting for the talks on
Monday and Tuesday, which are one of the most significant steps
toward rapprochement since a June summit of the leaders of both
Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda has not been fixed and some South Korean officials
doubt whether sweeping measures that will ease tension across the
Korean peninsula can be achieved at a first round of negotiations.
Military cooperation is one of the trickiest issues facing the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   But even the symbolism of goodwill meetings between two men
whose tank- and missile-equipped armies face each other across the
Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, is bound to infuse the peace process
with fresh momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Il Chul, minister for the People's Army of communist North
Korea, and four deputies were scheduled to drive to Seoul after
passing through the border village of Panmunjom late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They then planned to fly to Cheju off the southern coast aboard
a South Korean military transport plane for the talks at a plush
hotel with Cho Sung-tae, South Korea's defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Koreas have halted propaganda broadcasts
against each other, held reunions of separated family members and
announced plans to reconnect a cross-border railway. Cultural
exchanges and the pursuit of joint business ventures, under way for
years, have escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet mutual mistrust is such that the Cold War-era impasse along
the sealed border, evident in the guard towers, minefields and
barbed wire fences that stretch coast to coast, remains locked in
place.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon report last week said that North Korea had made major
military improvements over the past year, including the placement
of large numbers of artillery pieces and rocket launchers near the
border.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul last week, Defense Secretary William Cohen said North
Korea's chemical, biological, nuclear and missile programs continue
to pose a threat to South Korea, the region and the United States.
Some 37,000 U.S. soldiers are based in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these weighty concerns, North Korea has proposed
limiting the talks next week to how Southern and Northern forces
can help reconnect the railway and build a highway linking the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That project will entail the removal of up to 100,000 mines
planted in the area of the rail corridor. South Korea plans to
bring in British and German mine-clearing equipment in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans, however, want to discuss establishment of a
military hot line as well as the notification of large troop
movements and observation of major military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation reportedly includes a three-star
general, a two-star general and two colonels. Kim, the 67-year-old
chief envoy, is a former navy commander who assumed his post as
armed forces minister in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is also deputy head of the National Defense Commission,
North Korea's most powerful administrative body. Its chairman is
leader Kim Jong Il, who took power in 1994 after the death of his
father and national founder, Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   The high-level talks in Cheju suggest that North Korea's
military remains unwaveringly loyal to Kim Jong Il, whose startling
pursuit of reconciliation with the South could expose his isolated
country to outside influences, thereby undermining his totalitarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The pillar of Kim Jong Il's power is the prestigious military,
which has more than 1 million members and has been pampered with a
large slice of North Korea's meager annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge cost of maintaining such a monolithic force on a
war footing has helped drain the decrepit economy, and there are
doubts about North Korea's ability to wage conventional warfare
with so much outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Koreans, long accustomed to the perceived menace in
the North, view as remote the possibility of another Northern
invasion, which would invite massive retaliation from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, we should be prepared for it, but I think it is
unlikely that North Korea would jeopardize everything to invade
South Korea,'' said Choi Sung-soo, a 31-year-old English teacher.
''Their loss would be much bigger than any gain.''

<HEADLINE> Two Philippine Villages Destroyed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- A military assault on Muslim rebels
holding 17 hostages in the southern Philippines has destroyed at
least two villages and sent more than 14,000 people fleeing from
their homes, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first confirmation of extensive damage to civilian areas,
local police said 100 to 200 bamboo houses were burned in the
fighting in Bandang and Samak, destroying the villages in the
municipality of Talipao. They said the villages, an Abu Sayyaf
rebel stronghold, were bombed by military planes.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting killed more than 30 rebels, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Jolo island by thousands of military troops
backed by planes, cannons and missile-equipped helicopters was
aimed at rescuing 17 hostages -- one American, three Malaysians and
13 Filipinos -- held by various Abu Sayyaf factions.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has tightly controlled information about the
attack, insists only two civilians have been killed despite
numerous unconfirmed reports of many civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the military reported the first death of a soldier
and said a rebel commander had been seriously injured. Three other
rebels were killed, bringing the confirmed guerrilla death toll to
28, with 60 others believed dead, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Six soldiers have been injured, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Luuk, a town about 30 miles east of Talipao, said
they saw American hostage Jeffrey Schilling, 24, of Oakland,
Calif., being led by two groups of rebels fleeing from the
military, Vice Governor Munib Estino said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's ankles and wrists were tied and he had cuts on his
arms and legs, they said. Villagers said they saw a rebel kick
Schilling from behind as they walked.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people who saw Schilling pitied him,'' Estino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who say they are fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the predominantly Roman Catholic
Philippines, have kidnapped scores of people since March. Most have
been released, with Libya and Malaysia reportedly paying more than
$15 million for 19 foreigners. The government stopped negotiations
and attacked after more people were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling visited a rebel camp on Aug. 28 with his Filipino
wife, who is the second cousin of a rebel leader. He says the
rebels abducted him after they argued over politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Estino said about 500 rebels in that group, armed with M-60
machine guns and bazookas were headed toward a beach, apparently
hoping to escape from Jolo. About 2,000 troops backed by howitzers,
artillery, and attack helicopters were closing in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has prevented most journalists from traveling to
Jolo to cover the assault. Until Saturday, the handful of reporters
on the island were restricted to its capital, also named Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials have urged journalists to depend on daily
briefings held in Zamboanga, about 85 miles away. However, military
spokesmen have provided only sketchy accounts of the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes said he would allow a group of
reporters to briefly visit the island Monday. Dozens of journalists
in Zamboanga had issued a statement deploring ''in the highest
degree'' the restrictions on press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a trip Saturday to Talipao, an Associated Press reporter saw
many abandoned homes. Lines of soldiers with M-16 rifles and
bandoleers of ammunition around their necks marched along the
roads, accompanied by armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 villagers crowded evacuation centers in
Talipao's town capital, Mayor Tambrin Tulawie said.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty children played in dank-smelling schools used as emergency
centers, with 60 people per classroom. Women cooked over wooden
stoves improvised from cookie tins on the dirt floors. Others took
shelter outside under tarps to escape the crowding.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav To Vote on Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After four wars, a decade of
punishing sanctions, the breakup of their country and the bombing
of their cities by NATO, Yugoslavs pass judgment Sunday on Slobodan
Milosevic, the man who made it all happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are immense in the presidential and parliamentary
elections. If voters turn Slobodan Milosevic out of office -- and he
accepts defeat, which is also a big ''if'' -- this battered,
dispirited country will have had a taste of real democracy, and
billions of dollars in Western aid and investment may follow.
</P>
<P>
   If he clings to power, bloodshed is likely. With Milosevic
trailing in pre-election polls and the perception widespread that
his people will cheat to win, opposition supporters are unlikely to
quietly accept any government claim of victory.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yugoslav federation, steadily diminished by the loss of
four of its republics during Milosevic's decade in power, will get
smaller. The pro-Western leadership in Montenegro says that unless
Milosevic goes, it too will break away, leaving the 59-year-old
former communist official with nothing but his native Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   That too could mean more violence for a Balkan region that has
already suffered tens of thousands of deaths since the start of the
breakup in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The streets could erupt again, too. Independent election
monitoring is severely curtailed, so the opposition is urging the
citizenry to gather in squares Sunday evening and await results,
which are expected to start coming in few hours after the polls
close Sunday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition apparently hopes to repeat the experience of
1996, when three months of big protests against fraud in municipal
elections forced Milosevic to back down and hand over power in
major cities.
</P>
<P>
   The election is a battle between two visions: the go-it-alone
nationalism of Milosevic, appealing to ancient Balkan pride and
humiliations, vs. the message of normalcy transmitted by Vojislav
Kostunica, mild-mannered law professor who raced to a 10-point lead
over Milosevic in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's promise to turn Yugoslavia into ''a normal European
democratic country'' is a seductive one for a nation mired in
isolation from the West, watching from the sidelines while other
former communist countries like Poland and Hungary set out to join
a peaceful, borderless European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's appeal is in his no-frills style. Where Milosevic is
assertive, Kostunica is soft-spoken; where Milosevic is imperious,
his rival is unassuming; when Milosevic was rising through the
communist party ranks, Kostunica was fired for being an
anti-communist.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic campaigns over television or at scripted public
events; Kostunica goes door-to-door to press home his message.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Milosevic's shrill denunciations of his foes as
''rats and hyenas'' in thrall to the West, Kostunica stresses his
own Serbian patriotism and strongly deplores last year's NATO
bombing of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, perhaps, Kostunica is untainted by the scandals
and corruption surrounding the Milosevic entourage. His campaign
poster simply reads: ''Who can look you straight in the eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   This image has rallied 18 opposition groups around him. But will
it win power?
</P>
<P>
   Charges of cheating have dogged Milosevic in previous elections.
Local and foreign-based monitoring organizations have recorded
flagrant violations during Milosevic's rule, first as president of
Serbia, then of Yugoslavia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Milosevic's switch of chairs in itself raised questions.
Constitutionally barred from staying on as Serbian president, he
made himself president of Yugoslavia, elected by a parliament
stacked with his supporters. Now his aides are saying that even if
he loses Sunday, he can still finish out his term, which officially
ends next June. The opposition rejects that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing brought Milosevic's popularity to a new low,
but the regime seems determined to survive at all costs. More than
2,500 pro-democracy campaigners have been detained in recent
months. Police have severely beaten anti-Milosevic demonstrators.
The Milosevic message monopolizes state-run TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic's regime has stolen years of our lives,'' Kostunica
said at an election rally. ''And now, it's preparing the theft of
the century.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica,'' people in the
crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is that we start living a normal
life,'' says Radmila Maslovaric, an English-language teacher. ''I
believe that by winning this election, Kostunica can bring back our
dignity and smiles on the faces of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica has spoken out against the indictment of Milosevic by
a U.N. tribunal on war crimes charges stemming from atrocities
committed against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo last year. And he
promises there will be no revenge-taking under his presidency -- a
reassuring notion in a political and social climate where grudges
are often settled by the gun.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, he promises to do his best for the province's Serb
minority and work to repatriate those who fled in fear of Albanian
vengeance. And in direct contrast to his rival, who has clung
tenaciously to power, Kostunica says he will call new elections
within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot promise immediate prosperity, but I give my word that
all the citizens of this country will be free and equal,''
Kostunica says. ''I give my word that I will try to change our
country to the better, without letting power change me.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite Kostunica's conciliatory and sensible messages,
Milosevic still has many hardline supporters -- an estimated 20
percent to 30 percent of the electorate -- who are ready to follow
their leader despite the decline his rule has brought to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will vote for Milosevic because he won't sell this country
to the Americans and NATO,'' says Milovan Stankovic, a 60-year-old
construction worker. ''They hate him and that's why I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing pressure on Milosevic by the United States and
its allies, as well as strict sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia,
allow Milosevic to exploit the country's isolation for propaganda
purposes and present himself as a true defender of national
interests against the ''evil'' NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's voters are mostly elderly and rural people, of low
education, very much susceptible to his rhetoric after years of
isolation and poverty. Psychologists call it a ''ghetto'' syndrome,
when isolated people begin to believe their isolation is good.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the main issue remains whether Milosevic's camp will
concede defeat if they are outvoted both for the presidency and for
seats in parliament. For one thing, they become more easily
extraditable to the U.N. tribunal once they are out of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We face a hot autumn,'' says Jozsef Kasza, a Kostunica backer.
''This regime is locked in a life-and-death struggle -- it either
survives or faces the international court of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Serbia and Montenegro will choose a president, the two
chambers of Yugoslavia's parliament and municipal authorities. Four
main political parties and coalitions are in the race, but the main
contest is between Kostunica's bloc and Milosevic's Socialists,
backed by his wife's neo-communist party.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates are running for president, but stand
little chance. If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, a
runoff must be held two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The 7.8 million eligible voters include about 1 million Kosovo
Albanians who will boycott the election, and this has raised fears
that Milosevic will contrive to make their votes his own. The NATO
and U.N. authorities running Kosovo are playing no monitoring role
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's pro-independence government has also called for a
boycott, but a pro-Milosevic camp there will take part.
</P>
<P>
   While inviting over 200 observers from left-wing groups and
''friendly countries'' -- China and other nations with flawed
democratic records -- the government has banned Western monitors,
fueling fears of cheating.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Goes to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By ALI KOTAROMALOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An independent medical team examined
Indonesia's former president Suharto for 10 hours Saturday to
determine if he is fit to stand trial on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the court-ordered examination will be presented
to a five-judge panel on Thursday. A doctor at the hospital,
Supardi, said the examination was completed, but refused to give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Judges also ordered that Suharto be present at the hearing. The
79-year-old former strongman has refused to attend previous
hearings on the grounds of failing health.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors for the defense maintain three strokes have damaged
Suharto's brain, but government physicians maintain he is able to
face court.
</P>
<P>
   Ousted from office in 1998 amid pro-democracy protests and
riots, Suharto is charged with embezzling at least $583 million in
government money to bankroll businesses controlled by his cronies
and children.
</P>
<P>
   He looked healthy as he arrived at Pertamina Hospital on
Saturday and walked unassisted before orderlies brought him a
wheelchair. He was accompanied by four of his children and several
bodyguards. Hundreds of police officers stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto appeared tired as he was wheeled out after his exam. He
did not speak to reporters and was whisked away in a heavily
guarded motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   The state's chief prosecutor in the Suharto case, Mochtar
Arifin, said claims that Suharto had problems speaking were not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suharto can communicate, but he talks slowly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Munich Attack Funds Mulled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Israeli and German negotiators have met to discuss
the long unanswered question of whether relatives of the 11 Israeli
athletes who died at the 1972 Munich Olympics will receive
compensation, a magazine reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 28 years nothing has happened, so it's time that we
finally settle the matter,'' the lead Israeli negotiator, Arie
Schumer, told Der Spiegel. An Israeli delegation has already met
with Erwin Huber, chief of staff for the governor's office in
Bavaria state, of which Munich is the capital, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   German officials had previously rejected all claims for
compensation by the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Der Spiegel reported that Bavarian officials, along with
federal and city authorities, are looking into what amount of
compensation they might give to the relatives of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists stormed an Olympic
Village apartment house at the Munich Games, killing two Israeli
athletes and holding the others hostage in an effort to gain the
freedom of 200 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a botched rescue attempt after a 20-hour standoff, nine more
Israeli athletes were killed, as well as five terrorists and a
German policeman.

<HEADLINE> Four Connecticut towns express interest in expanding prisons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LYME, Conn. (AP) - Four Connecticut towns have expressed
interest in expanding their existing prison facilities.
</P>
<P>
   East Lyme, Montville, Somers and Suffield have submitted written
proposals to the state Department of Correction in response to an
offer of incentives that include state tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   East Lyme already houses two prisons. The expansion of the
900-acre York Correctional Facility could result in state-funded
improvements in water and sewer facilities and roads, town
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will improve our infrastructure,'' First Selectman Wayne
Fraser said Friday. ''It's an obvious benefit to the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The money provided by the state could equal as much 10 new
businesses and more state employees frequenting businesses in town,
Fraser said. And the men's and women's facilities have been good
corporate neighbors, employing the most people in town, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Correction department spokeswoman Christina Polce said state
officials will review the proposals in the coming weeks and work
individually with the towns to explore the feasibility of each
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Correction Commissioner John Armstrong in July issued an urgent
appeal to towns and cities to consider prison projects that would
create space for 1,600 high-security inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The state has more than 17,000 inmates, nearly double the number
a decade ago because of tougher sentencing laws. The inmate
population is projected to grow to more than 21,000 prisoners in
2004, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison shortage has led to the controversial transfer of
inmates to facilities in Virginia. Nearly 500 Connecticut prisoners
were sent to Wallens Ridge State Prison last year to ease crowding.
More than 300 remain at Wallens Ridge, while 134 have been
transferred to the Greenville Correctional Center in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Russian Flight Arrives in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi officials welcomed a Russian plane
Saturday -- the second aircraft to land in two days without U.N.
clearance -- as evidence that the United Nations' 10-year-old trade
sanctions were collapsing despite U.S. and British objections.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupolev-154 carrying five tons of humanitarian cargo and 143
passengers, most of them businessmen, landed in Baghdad after
having informed the U.N. sanctions committee in New York of its
destination but not waiting for authorization.
</P>
<P>
   A French plane had arrived Friday carrying doctors, artists and
athletes opposed to the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ''These flights are an indication that both America and Britain
have failed in their attempts to isolate Iraq,'' said Abdulrazzaq
al-Hashemi, a senior member of Iraq's ruling Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq is very important. No one can ignore a country with
potentials like ours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The flights have so emboldened Iraqi authorities that al-Hashemi
declared the government will turn down future requests to fly to
Baghdad if organizers have obtained U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council is divided on the flights to Iraq,
with the United States and Britain trying to prevent nations from
punching holes in the sanctions. Russia and France maintain U.N.
authorization is not required for humanitarian flights. After
Friday's flight, France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said
''there will be other flights.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the
French flight a ''blatant violation'' of sanctions and U.N.
procedures. And Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said he
regretted that the French had not waited for U.N. clearance.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of business executives on the Russian plane
conflicted with the flight's declared humanitarian mission. The
executives were led by Yuri Shafranik, the president of Russia's
Central Fuel Company and a former energy minister.
</P>
<P>
   Shafranik told reporters there would be no letup in Russia's
campaign to have the U.N. sanctions lifted as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to conduct talks and point out the projects for
the future and implement them,'' he said. He added that the Kremlin
was fully behind the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and France are owed large amounts of money from
pre-1990 trade with Iraq and are keen to invest in its oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the businessmen, other Russians on the plane were
artists and athletes who were expected to meet and perform with
their Iraqi counterparts. The French plane also carried
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plane belonged to Vnukovo Airlines, whose
representative in Baghdad, Alexei Badikov, said he hoped Iraq and
Russia would resume scheduled flights within two months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain vehemently oppose a resumption of
passenger flights, saying they would be an economic resource and
therefore a breach of the sanctions. The two also insist all
flights -- including humanitarian ones -- require permission of the
U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions require the sanctions to remain in place until
Baghdad complies with demands to dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction. For the past decade, travelers to Iraq generally have
flown to Amman, Jordan, and then driven to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's flight was the second Russian plane to land in
Baghdad in a week. On Sept. 17 a Russian aircraft arrived with
humanitarian aid, but it had obtained clearance from the U.N.
sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.N. committee on Iraq, the Netherlands' U.N.
Ambassador Peter van Walsum, said Friday he expected the Security
Council to discuss the French flight.

<HEADLINE> Federal investigators seek documents from center's former scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELLEVILLE, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Attorney's Office has
subpoenaed documents from a former scientist of a cancer center
that had been ordered to stop accepting new patients into its
clinical trials earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Newark are seeking documents related to
The Garden State Cancer Center in Belleville and Immunomedics Inc.,
a Morris Plains-based pharmaceutical company, according to a copy
of the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration suspended the center's clinical
trials, many of which serve patients with late-stage cancers,
because of problems monitoring patients after treatment and in
record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Such trials require careful monitoring and follow-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena says the Attorney General's Office needs the
documents for the investigation of possible federal health care
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Juweid, the scientist who resigned from the center, told
The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions that he turned
over the documents to authorities Friday afternoon. The documents
included slides, unpublished research and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Juweid's attorney, Walter Lucas, said a letter accompanying the
subpoena indicated that Juweid was not a target of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Center founder David M. Goldenberg said he did not know about a
Justice Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've only heard about allegations coming from Dr. Juweid about
conflicts'' between the nonprofit cancer center and Immunomedics,
Goldenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberg said he has disclosed his ownership interest in
Immunomedics providing research grants to the cancer center to
federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The center's suspension affects 11 clinical trials, including
experimental treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, ovarian
and colon cancer. The treatments, pioneered by Goldenberg, focus on
using antibodies to deliver radio isotopes directly to tumors.
About 3,000 patients have undergone the treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The center is banned from accepting new patients into the trials
but can continue to follow the progress of patients who have
already begun treatment, Goldenberg said earlier.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Set Up Polling Stations  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIPLJAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Socialist party workers arranged the
ballot boxes in the back of what seemed to have been Nikosava
Trific's dining room Saturday, taped up a paper Serb flag and --
voila -- created a polling station for Yugoslav federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Trific's house was one of 34 private homes around this eastern
Kosovo city being converted to civic duty a day before the vote,
skirting U.N. orders that public buildings could not be used for
the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Private homes are increasingly being pressed into service these
days as schools, meeting places and clinics are converted by Serbs
who say they are ever more isolated. Unwilling to trust NATO-led
peacekeepers with guaranteeing their security, Serbs here remain
wary about walking a few feet away from their homes, never mind
going downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even after all that, we're going to come out and vote,'' said
Slavisa Stolic, a local Serb who watched with pride and
satisfaction as workers taped up a Serbian emblem on the yellowing
wall. ''Because this is Serbia. This is Yugoslavia. ...This is the
land of our fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs lost control of Kosovo last year after NATO launched a
78-day air war to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end his crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants. The province
remains under Yugoslav sovereignty, and U.N. officials had little
choice but to permit a vote rather than alienate the 100,000 Serbs
who still live here.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's defeat in this region, considered the cradle of Serb
culture, is considered to be one of the primary reasons the
Yugoslav strongman is trailing opposition challenger Vojislav
Kostunica in polls ahead of Sunday's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Serbs in this battered province admire Milosevic for
putting up a fight, for standing up to the West and facing NATO
bombers with resolve. That admiration comes even as the living
standards spiral ever downward and attacks by the ethnic Albanian
militants become ever more bold.
</P>
<P>
   For Serbs here, the vote itself seems almost a celebration of
their identity, a happy occasion in a place where there is little
joy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, workers carried the white particle board ballot
boxes past Trific's ripening tomatoes and cabbage patch as if they
were getting ready for a party. Smiling and telling stories, they
carefully arranged the yellow, green and white Xeroxed ballots in
little stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots were printed in both Serbian and Albanian -- even though
the province's ethnic Albanians have long boycotted any votes in
Yugoslavia in a bid to distance themselves from the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts fear that Milosevic will attempt to manipulate
votes from Kosovo, inflating the numbers of voters to bolster his
totals.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here dismiss questions about vote manipulation, and
declare they will adapt to changing circumstances. After all, they
have been managing to create separate lives, transplanting their
institutions from downtown to the edges of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, Trific's house in Lipljan had already
been pressed into service as an impromptu school. She was in the
hospital in Serbia proper Saturday, though officials insist she
gave approval for the polling place.
</P>
<P>
   Locals here describe her decision to permit the balloting as a
sacrifice -- one shared by many who have opened their homes to civic
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those on the periphery are trying to organize their lives,''
said Bosko Djoric, 60, a cafe owner. ''Soon everything will take
place in private houses.''

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Explodes at Danish Hotel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a parking
garage under a hotel in Denmark's second-largest city Saturday,
seriously injuring the driver, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Henrik Nielsen, 38, was in critical condition after the bomb
exploded under his seat as he turned the key in the ignition of his
Mercedes just before noon, Deputy Chief Investigator Allan Lund
said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred in Aarhus, about 120 miles northwest of
the capital, Copenhagen, in a parking garage below the four-story
Hotel Atlantic. No other damage was reported, Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was evacuated while bomb experts combed the area, but
guests were allowed to return Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still investigating possible motives for the blast,
but believed it may have been drug-related, Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The act is so violent and serious that something big must lie
behind it, possibly a showdown among criminals involved in
narcotics,'' Lund said.

<HEADLINE> NYPD dealing with massive sexual harassment suit  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Virginia Duffy watched through her tears as her
brother-in-law, Officer John Kelly, was laid to rest in a
traditional police funeral that brought out thousands, including
the mayor and the city's top police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, a former officer, stood with her relatives, many of whom
also are cops, and wholeheartedly accepted the sympathy given by
the rank-and-file, but bit her lip as a group of police brass -
including former Police Commissioner Howard Safir - paid their
respects to the 31-year-old Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The last years Kelly spent with the NYPD were not happy ones,
all because he filed a sexual harassment complaint on behalf of
Duffy, said his attorney, Jeffrey L. Goldberg. Kelly did so in
hopes of sparing Duffy any retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Duffy allegedly was still harassed, and so was Kelly, whose
story is a small part in what has turned into a $130 million sexual
harassment lawsuit filed in Federal Court. The department has
already been ordered to pay $1 million to a former deputy
commissioner who sued the NYPD, alleging she was fired after she
refused to rewrite her report critical of how police officials
handled Duffy's case.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are the city, the NYPD, Safir, several top Staten
Island police officials, and Joseph Monahan, the police lieutenant
who allegedly has harassed at least two female cops but has never
been punished. Monahan vigorously denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen a case that has involved and encompassed
chiefs, and brought in the police commissioner,'' said Goldberg,
who represents Duffy and other defendants, along with attorney
Daniel Gazan.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment was such a problem for the NYPD that in 1996
federal prosecutors brought a civil lawsuit against the department,
saying more needed to be done to prevent harassment of female cops
and employees. It was the first time the federal government had
taken such action.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit, also filed by Goldberg, involved Officer Sheryll
Goff, who claimed that from 1989 to 1992, she was repeatedly
harassed at the 110th Precinct in Queens and her supervisors failed
to intervene. Photographs and drawings of naked women and men, many
with her name or initials on them, were left on her locker, car and
chair, and on a bulletin board, the lawsuit said. The precinct's
lounge television was regularly tuned to the Playboy channel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, under a consent decree stemming from Goff's case, the
NYPD agreed to require its officers to take mandatory programs on
preventing sexual harassment, and how to properly report it. It
also increased the staffing of its Office of Equal Employment
Opportunity to 30 investigators from 20.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have declined comment on sexual harassment
cases because of the litigation. An official with the U.S.
Attorney's Office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
prosecutors are monitoring the follow-up to the Goff case closely.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the consent decree has done little to prevent
sexual harassment, and point to the case involving Duffy, Officer
Stacey Maher and one female and two male officers who worked with
the women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sexual harassment is still prevalent. Women who filed
complaints are still made victims again by retaliation,'' Goldberg
said. ''It is not the environment we thought the decree was going
to give us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy says sexual harassment within the NYPD is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to take care of this problem. It's the NYPD,
it's the good ol' boys club.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Duffy has left the force because of harassment,
Monahan remains a cop, currently a platoon commander at the 66th
Precinct in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, a decorated officer, says the allegations are false and
without merit. He also says Maher stalked him and he had to file
departmental charges against her. Maher denies those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has made me sick to my stomach to be falsely accused,''
Monahan said. ''I'm on the job 20 years - how does this happen?
This is complete and utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan says he thinks about leaving the force every day, but
one thing keeps him from quitting - it's the same thing that keeps
Duffy and Maher focused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to clear my name,'' he said. ''What they did to me is a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   -
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Duffy comes from a family of cops - she has two
brothers and a sister on the force. She met her husband on the job,
after joining the NYPD in July 1984. Duffy enjoyed her career, but
in September 1996, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan became her boss at the 123rd Precinct in Staten Island,
and she was assigned to be his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he got transferred there, that's when the sexual
harassment started,'' Duffy said in an interview. ''He wanted me to
go out with him, he was making lewd and disgusting remarks, and he
touched me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the civil complaint, Monahan stroked Duffy's legs,
shoulders and back while she was driving him to a meeting in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it clear I was happily married,'' Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan persisted, and Duffy resisted, the complaint says. In
November 1996 while both were on duty, Monahan allegedly told
Duffy: ''I would love to wrap your sexy legs around my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Monahan allegedly tried to punish Duffy by
telling another supervisor she was leaving work early. Duffy says
that charge is not true.
</P>
<P>
   In the precinct's small setting, word got around that Duffy was
having problems with Monahan, and Duffy saw the first bricks of the
so-called ''Blue Wall of Silence'' go up. Her supervisors - Lt.
Thomas Mulligan and Capt. Raymond Bischoff - told her in November
1996 ''not to take any action'' about Monahan, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy followed orders, but the harassment continued through
April 1997, with Monahan telling Duffy: ''You need to get rid of
your husband and get a boyfriend. You really need a boyfriend,''
the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy again resisted, but did not complain to her superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to deal with it on my own at first, hoping he would
get tired,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 21, 1997, Bischoff had Duffy removed as the
precinct's youth officer at Monahan's request, and changed her
hours and days off, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Duffy's brother-in-law, Officer John Kelly,
filed a sexual harassment complaint on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the complaint was filed, everything got worse,'' Duffy
said. ''The whole borough of Staten Island knew, and the job
started punishing me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were changing my tours, giving me undesirable
assignments, and no one would back me up,'' she said. ''All because
I blew the whistle, I broke the Blue Wall of Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was retaliated against, too, for three years, Goldberg
said. After Kelly's wife, also a cop, gave birth, his request for a
transfer back to day hours was denied, Goldberg said. His request
to be transferred to another unit also was turned down. He worked
lousy hours, never in sync with his wife's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 17, 2000, Kelly was killed in a car accident while
he was pursuing a stolen motorcycle on Staten Island. Kelly's
family remained silent about his treatment as top police officials
offered their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, who retired a year ago because she ''couldn't take it
anymore,'' remains outraged at how she and her brother-in-law were
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did nothing wrong,'' she said. ''I still cannot believe that
they let this get so out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   -
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Duffy, who said she immediately rebuffed Monahan, Officer
Stacey Maher befriended Monahan after he allegedly harassed her.
</P>
<P>
   Maher's behavior was not uncommon, said Peggy Stockdale, a
psychology professor at Southern Illinois University and an expert
on workplace sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's common for people not to complain,'' Stockdale said.
''Only between 5 to 20 percent of people who say they have
experienced some kind of harassment will make a formal complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher first met Monahan in 1988, two years after she joined the
force, when she was assigned to the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn.
Monahan, then a sergeant, assigned Maher to be his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was carrying my equipment into the precinct, and he shouted
to me 'That one's mine,''' Maher recalled. ''Then on January 18,
1988, he stuck his hands down my shirt and pants.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident occurred while Maher was driving Monahan
and she promptly turned the car back to the precinct house. She
then told her uncle, Capt. Joseph Carney, what happened. After a
talking to from Carney, Monahan began treating Monahan well, she
said
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm on the inside. I have great assignments. I'm his
favorite,'' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   So she made no formal complaint, and the two actually become
friends. She is invited to his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the friendship began to unravel. The complaint
said that Monahan helped get Maher's detective husband transferred
to a good post and then tried to force her into sex by saying he
could ''adversely influence'' her husband's assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Maher threatened to tell Monahan's wife, and Monahan allegedly
struck her in the eye in July 1996, the complaint said. Monahan was
then transferred to the 122nd Precinct on Staten Island, but a week
later, he ''made a sexual comment with regard to a female police
officer in his command, in front of several witnesses,'' the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan asked Maher to lie to the department's Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity if she was contacted about his past actions,
the complaint said. He also asked her if she would ask her uncle to
help get him transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Maher agreed, and Monahan was transferred in August 1966 to the
123rd Precinct on Staten Island, where he made Duffy his driver.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Maher was transferred to the 123rd Precinct. It's
there that her friendship with Monahan ends, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had told everyone I was his ex-girlfriend, and he dumped
me, and I couldn't handle the dump, so I was stalking him,'' she
said. ''Nobody would work with me. Nobody would talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher finally decided to tell her story to someone in authority,
but Lt. Thomas Mulligan, the precinct's integrity control officer
at the time, ''failed and refused to report'' her case to
higher-ups, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Maher was contacted by Equal Employment Opportunity
officials in regard to Duffy's complaint and told them her story.
Maher's name was then added to Duffy's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one ever wanted it to go like this,'' Maher said. ''We
expected the police department to take care of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Maher, who is on maternity leave from the force, is
determined to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love being a cop, I've always loved being a cop,'' she said.
''They think they took that away from me, but they're not getting
rid of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's expected to be months before the case of Duffy and Maher
goes to court. Their attorneys, Goldberg and Gazan, plan to take
three more depositions - one from Safir - next month.
</P>
<P>
   For now all the depositions in the case are sealed, which the
city's lawyers say is to protect privacy. But Gazan said the case
is going to cause a big stir when all the facts come out in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really amazing because this started out so small, but
high-ranking officers ignored the pleas for help and the
evidence,'' he said. ''This isn't going away. It just keeps
mushrooming to the point where it's now an atomic cloud and they
have to decide what to do about it.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Fashion Week Crosses Finish Line; Trends are Totaled  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Now that Fashion Week, spring-summer 2001
edition, has wrapped up, the good news is, many items that style
seekers will want - shirt dresses, slip dresses and shorts - just
might already be hanging in their closet.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is fashion never comes back exactly the same as
before. Spring shirtdresses are printed in a geometric pattern for
day or splattered with sequins for night; slip dresses take a shine
to metallics; and shorts truly live up to their name. Well, you
might as well make your shorts outrageously abbreviated when
they're done up in gold leather.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the trends that dominated the runway previews
that finished Friday night. But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing from fall, designers have opted for blouson tops and
dresses that cut the wearer some room. Designers also displayed a
penchant for patterns, notably stripes, which run in black/white or
brown/white throughout Ralph Lauren's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The season is also preoccupied with checks, right down to
Geoffrey Beene's black-and-white checked buttons on his
black-and-white checked jacket. And pleated skirts are making a
showing, even if not everyone's are as micro-mini as Oscar de la
Renta's, which he dubs ''tennis skirts'' but pairs with the
season's ubiquitous, towering high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Among the easiest updates are trench coats and hip-slung wrap
belts, which seem to accompany every other look.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hot pants are a big question mark,'' says Neiman Marcus
fashion director Joan Kaner. ''They're great for young people, but
I'd hate to see them adopted as a national trend on women of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has such a tiny tog made such a big showing, even among
designers who cater to career women or the social set. Mainstream
designer Ellen Tracy offers hot pants in gold leather, and Kenneth
Cole's look tie-dyed, while society designer Carolina Herrera
trotted them out in black silk with the season's trendy
off-the-shoulder blouse. Bill Blass' strike a note of modesty when
paired with a matching jacket and slingbacks; and Oscar de la Renta
offered a wild variation on the theme by sending out, of all
things, pink satin bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses are hardly a scarce commodity on spring runways, be they
wrap styles, shirtdresses or the slip variety. Gold seems to be the
spring standard, which is why Halston's wrap dresses are done in
gold lace, Nicole Miller's are gold denim and Richard Tyler's are
gold silk jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the millions of beads that comprise the season's
eveningwear end up on dresses. Shirtdresses are sequined at Badgley
Mishka, in white leather at Ralph Lauren, patterned in a turquoise
geometric print at Carolina Herrera, and in leopard-print chiffon
at Halston.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers seemed to stalk the urban jungle. There are
safari-pocket bustiers at Douglas Hannant, leather safari dresses
and jackets at Oscar de la Renta, and African warrior prints at
Anna Sui.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers stay closer to home, influenced by New York
City. Vivienne Tam's prints in black with color splashing are
inspired by the neon city lights as seen through the window of a
speeding taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Still other designers mine other times and places. Randolph Duke
goes back to ancient Greece, with draped, gauze gowns that suggest
goddesses of the era. Elsewhere, Art Deco patterns inform a lot of
looks, including black beaded dresses at BCBG, and tank dresses,
skirts and pants at Halston.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson pays tribute to the '50s with a red-and-white
striped, belted ''bombshell'' dress worthy of Marilyn Monroe. Other
designers, like Anna Sui, stop at the '80s. She reprises the
dance-club look popularized by '80s Madonna, with punk-inspired
black dresses slashed to pieces accessorized with fishnet hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   Some looks are high on notice-me drama. Pamela Dennis opts for a
flurry of feathers, fashioned into bustiers. Off-the-shoulder tops
are popular, too, such as one from Marc Jacobs, in fuchsia trimmed
with black patent leather. For pure sex appeal, designers slit
dresses and gowns high on the side, exposing lots of leg.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny stuff, be it pearlized leather or metallics, from gold to
bronze to platinum, will fuel spring styles. Calvin Klein liberally
uses iridescent silk and satin throughout his collection, in the
guise of pastel jackets and dresses. Nicole Miller also opts for
high-gloss looks, right down to the socks she shows with every
outfit, typically black with blue sparkles.
</P>
<P>
   Designers throw a curve ball into spring, avoiding straight
lines in favor of slants. That translates into a slew of
asymmetrical hemlines, such as Donna Karan's, on her swirling
ruffled dresses with handkerchief point hems.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonless dressing is a concept mentioned by designers
including Michael Kors and Geoffrey Beene, who combine clothes from
different seasons. Kors, who lowers hemlines and raises the comfort
level by showing wider, suede skirts with luggage-colored flat
sandals, pairs summer looks with wintry, mink-lined suede serapes,
and lightweight linen pants with heavier camel hair jackets.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you will want to pair that snowbound parka with
short shorts is something you'll need to decide come spring.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Return of Sect Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Beijing on Saturday demanded the United States
hand over the leader of a banned Chinese sect, calling a U.S. court
decision to let him stay an ''attack on China's legal system,''
state-run media said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the United States has
ignored repeated requests for Zhong Hongbao's extradition despite
ample evidence linking Zhong to rape and other crimes, the Xinhua
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action by the U.S. side helps a criminal suspect escape
the punishment he deserves,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang fled to Guam in February after eluding a nationwide
manhunt in China. His Zhong Gong sect, which has attracted millions
of followers in China, says he is a victim of political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and media reports have said China has given
U.S. officials documents from three women accusing Zhang of raping
or sexually assaulting them since founding Zhong Gong in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Xinhua report said China also accuses Zhang of
''counterfeiting certificates and illegal immigration'' but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal judge in Guam, a U.S. territory 3,700
miles west of Hawaii, said Zhang could remain in the United States,
though he stopped short of granting him full political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Sun called the decision a slap in the face to the Chinese
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   It is ''a wanton distortion of and attack against China's legal
system,'' Sun told Xinhua. ''The action of the U.S. side also
reveals its hypocrisy in respecting rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities began rounding up Zhong Gong's leaders when
it outlawed the better-known Falun Gong sect in July 1999,
following a protest in central Beijing by more than 10,000 Falun
Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   Both sects say they have no political objectives besides seeking
the freedom to practice their beliefs, which are based on
traditional Chinese health practices.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has called the groups ''evil cults'' and banned them as
a threat to public safety and Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of members of both groups have been arrested. Falun
Gong says as many as 50 of its members have died in Chinese prisons
or soon after release.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor reviewing police response to toddler choking death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) - The Somerset County Prosecutor's Office is
reviewing how the Bridgewater police department responded to a
report of a choking toddler, and whether anything could have been
done differently to prevent the child's death.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Wayne Forrest said his office will determine whether
an emergency medical technician who was ready to respond to the
child's house was told not to go to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Iarrapino began choking in the living room on Aug. 30,
and steadily worsened as her mother called police for help and
tried to perform lifesaving maneuvers on her daughter while waiting
for help to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to transcripts of the 911 call, a
dispatcher told Gail Iarrapino to ''shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   The child died the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest is investigating an anonymous letter left in the
family's mailbox, sealed in a Bridgewater Police Department
envelope, that claimed emergency medical technician Robert Hanlon,
a police department employee who had equipment to help choking
victims, was about two miles away and ready to respond, but was
told not to by police.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon's mother, Judy, said her son was ordered by police not to
discuss the case. He is captain of a local rescue squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''The squad is very upset that he wasn't allowed to go on the
call to help this baby,'' she told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Saturday's editions. ''It has not been explained to him why he was
not allowed to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forrest told the Courier News of Bridgewater that a review
of police radio transmissions has determined that one exchange -
''2-8'' - meant ''What's your location?'' and not ''Do not
respond.'' Michael Iarrapino, the girl's father, said he was told
by Bridgewater police that ''2-8'' meant do not respond, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Courier News also interviewed several emergency service
workers who faulted the way the dispatcher, who has not been
publicly identified, handled the call. Several said the dispatcher
gave the child's mother incorrect medical instructions on how to
try to help the child.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Warns on Army Presence  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Federal troops loyal to Slobodan
Milosevic announced Saturday they will guard Montenegro polling
stations during Sunday's national election, despite protests from
the republic's pro-Western leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement raised tension in Yugoslavia's smaller
republic, which may decide to declare independence if Milosevic
wins.
</P>
<P>
   The army's statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said it would deploy nearly 700 troops to ensure
''regularity of voting'' and avoid possible disruption by
Montenegro's pro-independence leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were called by Milosevic's central government
despite strong protests from the Montenegrin leadership, which has
decided to boycott the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A faction of Montenegrins loyal to Milosevic planned to organize
a vote independently, with makeshift polling stations. This led to
a dispute over which armed force -- Milosevic's army or the
Montenegrin police force -- would provide security during the
voting.
</P>
<P>
   While deeming the elections ''illegal'' and generally ignoring
them, Montenegrin Justice Minister Dragan Soc said the tiny
republic's police would not remain idle.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can't be any agreement with the army,'' Soc told The
Associated Press. ''Their (army's) aim is to keep our police as far
away as possible from the polling stations'' and ''attempt to
intimidate (people) and demonstrate force.''
</P>
<P>
   While Montenegro officially remains part of Yugoslavia, its own
leadership has severed nearly all ties with Milosevic's central
government and warned that if he stays in power after the
elections, the tiny republic would declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   Western powers have been supportive of Montenegro's leadership,
headed by President Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   But some 20,000 federal troops, loyal to Serbia, remain in
Montenegro. They have a tense relationship with the local
leadership, which relies on the Montenegrin police -- 20,000-strong
and well-armed.
</P>
<P>
   The army claimed in its statement that Montenegrin authorities
had agreed to its role in Sunday's balloting, but the police denied
this.
</P>
<P>
   Army commanders ''have not informed the government of Montenegro
that their military personnel would provide security,'' a police
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which deemed the elections illegitimate, added
that police would maintain public law and order throughout the
territory Sunday.

<HEADLINE> A college's rank tumbles, senior official resigns  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) - Small, private U.S. colleges that rely on
tuition for survival ignore at their peril the guidebooks and
magazine lists catering to parents and students zealously seeking
the perfect school.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hobart and William Smith Colleges, a liberal-arts campus
on the leafy slopes above this Finger Lakes town, took a tumble in
this month's U.S. News &AMP; World Report rankings of America's best
colleges, retribution was swift.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology professor Sheila Bennett was ousted as senior vice
president at the coordinate men's and women's colleges after she
failed to submit fresh data that the magazine uses each year in
assessing the academic merits of 1,400-plus schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe this was intentional - it probably was just an
administrative oversight,'' said Professor Jack Harris, the
faculty's presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the absence of other measures of reputation, these rankings
and a series of other guidebooks can have considerable import,'' he
added. ''The U.S. News survey is one of the most public
demonstrations of our quality and reputation, whether you buy into
it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode brings into focus the enormous competitive pressures
universities encounter in luring students and teachers,
particularly private institutions with small endowments that need
to flesh out their budgets with high tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
   A year's stay at Hobart and William Smith costs $25,200, plus
$6,800 for room and board. Hobart, a men's college, was founded in
1822 and William Smith was started for women in 1908. Its 1,800
undergraduates share faculty, classrooms and an 180-acre campus but
each has its own dean, admissions office and athletic programs and
awards its own degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Only 84 schools failed to return survey data to U.S. News this
year, some for philosophical reasons, the magazine said. Reed
College in Portland, Ore., has refused to participate since 1995,
saying it finds the survey too simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett came to upstate New York from Emory University in 1990
as provost and faculty dean. She stepped down from those posts this
spring amid criticism of her management style, taking a one-year
appointment in charge of off-campus and international programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of her duties was to supply U.S. News with such statistics
as graduation rates, financial and faculty resources and alumni
donations. The magazine said it made repeated calls and sent a
certified letter but ended up using data reported in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   That ended the school's longtime inclusion in the magazine's
''second tier'' of liberal arts colleges, dropping it to a ''third
tier'' of schools ranked from No. 81 to No. 120.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who retained her faculty job, declined to be
interviewed. The Chronicle of Higher Education said she resigned
her executive post at school President Mark Gearan's request soon
after the U.S. News rankings came out.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan would not say if the resignation was tied to the magazine
poll. He stressed that ''but for the regrettable circumstances of
U.S. News not having received the information, there would have
been no change'' in the school's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Fuller, senior fellow at the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said a school's performance
would normally vary ''over a matter of years, not of months, in any
significant way, so a dramatic change in your ranking if it was
negative would obviously be a real concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're often making distinctions based on a percentage point
or less, so if all the financial data is just off by the factor of
inflation, you probably will slip down considerably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings are ''predominantly a concern'' among private schools,
where competition for students is often fiercest, ''because they
have an effect on the institution's bottom line,'' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rankings will influence how many really good students
you'll get,'' he said. ''On the other hand, how many good students
you get is also one of the factors that's in the rankings.''

<HEADLINE> Panama Gets Peru Asylum Request  </HEADLINE>
By KATIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panamanian officials said Saturday
they have received an asylum request for Vladimiro Montesinos, a
shadowy former spy chief suspected in a bribery scandal that
quashed President Alberto Fujimori's plans to remain in power in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso held a special meeting with
cabinet officials Saturday to consider the request, according to a
spokesman for her office, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The asylum petition came late Friday, after Brazil had turned
down a similar request earlier this week, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, viewed as Fujimori's right-hand man throughout the
1990s, has remained out of sight since earlier this month, when
Peruvian broadcasters aired a videotape showing him allegedly
bribing an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery scandal prompted Fujimori to promise new elections
in which he would not participate and introduce legislation to
disband National Intelligence Service, the spy agency that
Montesinos had headed.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian opposition groups warned Friday that talks with
Fujimori on new elections would be damaged unless Montesinos is
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has provided asylum for several disgraced Latin American
leaders in recent years. They include former Ecuadorean President
Abdala Bucaram; former Haitian dictator Gen. Raul Cedras, and
former Guatemalan president Jorge Serrano Elias.

<HEADLINE> Panama Nixes Peru Asylum Request  </HEADLINE>
By KATIA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama rejected a request Saturday to
give asylum to Vladimiro Montesinos, a shadowy former spy chief
suspected in a bribery scandal that quashed President Alberto
Fujimori's plans to remain in power in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has provided asylum to some of Latin America's most
disgraced and reviled former leaders, but apparently drew the line
at accepting Montesinos, whom Peruvian opposition leaders want
tried in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ''After studying the request, the cabinet recommended that this
petition not be accepted,'' read a terse press statement issued by
the Office of the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual decision was made in an urgent meeting between
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso and her cabinet officials
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The asylum request was made late Friday in a telephone call by
Fujimori's top cabinet officer, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at the president's office said Brazil had reportedly
turned down a similar request earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, viewed as Fujimori's right-hand man throughout the
1990s, has remained out of sight since earlier this month, when
Peruvian broadcasters aired a videotape showing him allegedly
bribing an opposition lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori sent his Congress urgent legislation late Friday to
disband Peru's now-disgraced spy agency after opening talks with
that country's opposition on holding new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery scandal last week prompted Fujimori to promise the
new elections, in which he would not participate. He also pledged
to dismantle the National Intelligence Service, which Montesinos
had headed.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian opposition groups warned Friday that the talks with
Fujimori on the new elections would be damaged unless Montesinos is
arrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKSDALE, Miss. (AP) -- A fine actor is bringing fine cuisine
to the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Freeman and his lawyer, Bill Luckett, are opening a new
restaurant in Clarksdale called Madidi. Freeman, whose tastes lean
toward French cooking and extensive wine lists, said he could find
none of that within an easy drive of his Charleston ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope there is a large enough local population (who would
eat here) as well as people in the Delta who are willing to drive a
little ways for fine dining,'' the Oscar-nomianted actor said of
his investment in Madidi, which is expected to open by November.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman acknowledges his name will bring some attention to the
restaurant. He said that is not what will make it successful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a Michael Jordan's Sports Bar. It will have to
stand on its own reputation, not mine,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tana Vassel, economic development manager for the
Clarksdale-Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce, said the opening of
a fine-dining restaurant would improve Clarksdale's image.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're crying for something different than fast food
and mom-and-pop diners,'' Vassel said. ''I think it will help our
image by showing that we're not all hicks and barefoot up here. We
do enjoy fine things.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori May Try Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's early exit from
power after a special election next year may not mean he's
disappearing from Peru's turbulent political scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade that Fujimori has dominated Peruvian politics, he
has relied on shrewdness, patience and tenacity to triumph in times
of crisis. He still possesses those qualities -- and as he plans his
departure, he may quietly be preparing his return to power as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Fujimori is the kind of person who will just go
off and write his memoirs or give international conferences,'' said
political commentator Fernando Tuesta.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has said on more than one occasion that power
fascinates him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Power is not given up easily. It's the strongest drug that
exists,'' said Manuel Torrado, head of the Datum polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori stunned Peruvians a week ago when he announced he was
deactivating the National Intelligence Service and calling new
elections next year in which he would not run.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape distributed two days earlier showed intelligence
chief Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's closest adviser, apparently
bribing an opposition congressman. Montesinos was accused of
masterminding a campaign of smear attacks and dirty tricks to
assure Fujimori's re-election this year, and the videotape sparked
the political crisis that is ending Fujimori's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Panama rejected a request to give asylum to
Montesinos, who has been missing since Peruvian broadcasters aired
the videotape. The Peruvian opposition wants Montesinos arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The asylum request was made late Friday in a telephone call by
Fujimori's top cabinet officer, according to a statement issued by
the office of Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso. Sources at
Moscoso's office said Brazil had reportedly turned down a similar
request earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week about his own future plans, Fujimori grinned and
said, ''I've got a little surprise for you about what I'm going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the new elections, Fujimori's popularity shot
up in public opinion polls. One survey showed he leaped from a 43
percent job approval rating to 59 percent -- remarkably high after
10 years ruling a troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys in recent years have given Fujimori high marks for
crippling leftist insurgencies that bloodied Peru in the 1980s and
for ending economic chaos that included 7,700 percent annual
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the polls consistently showed that a majority
of Peruvians felt it was time for a change in the 2000 elections.
But Fujimori pushed ahead and won an unprecedented third five-year
term in voting tainted by widespread irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori this past week announced a proposed package of
electoral reforms. One would prevent immediate presidential
re-election, a demand, Fujimori pointedly noted, that was made by
the opposition. But it also would mean Fujimori would not have to
confront a popular president up for re-election in 2006 -- if he
decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also proposed a constitutional reform that would allow
a presidential candidate to win if he had a 10 percentage point
margin over his nearest rival. Currently the winner of the first
round must obtain a majority or face a runoff with the second-place
finisher.
</P>
<P>
   The change would strengthen the chances of Fujimori's political
alliance against Peru's fragmented and fractious opposition, which
has not been able to mount much of a threat against him over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori has to be calculating that a division in the
opposition will permit his designated candidate to win in 2001 and
him to return in 2006,'' said Mirko Lauer, a political columnist
for the opposition La Republica newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that at least 30 percent of Peruvians
would like to see Fujimori run in the special election. Such strong
support could easily turn into a springboard for his return to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Torrado said it is highly unlikely that Fujimori can manage to
have his designated candidate win next year's election. But he said
if Fujimori wins 30 percent of the votes, he will become the
dominant opposition force in Congress and a powerbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to be the head of the opposition. That's what he
wants in the short term, and then reach the presidency once
again,'' Torrado said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that could destroy Fujimori's hopes for a political
comeback, he warned, is the repercussions from the Montesinos
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos is the deciding factor. He is a weight around his
neck. With Montesinos, he can go straight to the bottom of the
sea,'' Torrado said. ''If he doesn't punish Montesinos, his future
is dark.''

<HEADLINE> Before Hillary Clinton there was Robert Kennedy  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in
New York faced charges of being a carpetbagger, getting the party's
nomination only because of the famous last name and wanting the job
as a stepping stone back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000? No, Robert F. Kennedy in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of criticism the first lady has encountered across
New York dogged Kennedy 36 years ago when he sought the very same
Senate seat she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 10 years old and I knew what a carpetbagger was,''
recalls the slain senator's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ''Everywhere
we went the carpetbagger issue was a part of the conversation ...
It was a huge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were really Bobby Kennedy haters out there and they were
at every stop,'' the younger Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kennedy actually spent much of his youth in New York
but like the rest of his family was identified with Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Senate seat until 1968 when he was assassinated in
Los Angeles as he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination.
It was less than five years after his brother, President John F.
Kennedy, was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kennedy listened to a lot of the same stuff,'' said Maurice
Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute
who was a newspaper reporter in New York City during the 1964
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first lady and some of her top aides have poured
over news reports from the time, looking for clues on how to handle
the criticism they have encountered.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they did is get Kennedy's son to stand by her side for
an endorsement event in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here in 1964, campaigning across the state with my
father, and I heard the same thing all across the state then - that
he's a carpetbagger and how could he be a good senator for New York
State,'' said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is somebody who was not born in this state capable of coming
in and offering leadership? My answer to that is resoundingly,
yes,'' the director of the Environmental Law Project at Pace
University and the Hudson Riverkeeper program added.
</P>
<P>
   After fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced in late
1998 that he would not run for a fifth Senate term, the younger
Kennedy briefly considered running himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a seat that I would love to occupy,'' he said, ''but I
have five young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After the elder Kennedy was killed, Republican Charles Goodell
was appointed by then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller to fill out the term.
Goodell then lost a three-way race in 1970 to Conservative James
Buckley, who lived in neighboring Connecticut - the second winner
of the seat to face carpetbagger charges. Moynihan won it back for
the Democrats in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond residency and White House connections, there are other
similarities between the 1964 race and this year's version.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, like Clinton, shoved a popular New York member of
Congress to the sidelines to become the party nominee. In 1964, it
was Sam Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time, it was (Rep.) Nita Lowey who was disappointed that
her chance had been ruined,'' said former Union College professor
William Murphy, who was one of the late congressman's top political
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overnight it was over for him,'' said Roger Mott, Stratton's
son-in-law and his former congressional chief of staff. ''Sam's
favorite quote from that time was, 'I think I was running a real
good race and had a shot at this until Bobby Kennedy decided he was
a New Yorker.'''
</P>
<P>
   This year, polls show Democrat presidential candidate Al Gore
well ahead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush in New York. In 1964,
President Lyndon Johnson buried Republican Barry Goldwater by
almost 2.7 million votes in the state.
ob Woodward won a
Pulitzer Prize for exposing the Watergate scandal, which led to
President Richard Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said the Internet is an alternative for readers who
think the media only doles out press releases, half-truths and
sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Web, there is infinite time and space,'' he said. ''It
will move us beyond accusations of bias in the media, and it will
level the political playing field.''

<P>
   SENS, France (AP) -- A car competing in a French auto rally went
out of control Saturday and hit a utility pole, knocking it over
onto a crowd of spectators, officials said. Five people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were injured, five seriously, after the driver
suddenly lost control of his vehicle near the town of Cerisiers in
Yonne, the region immediately southeast of Paris. The driver was
killed; his navigator was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 rescue vehicles were called to the scene. Victims
were taken to hospitals in Sens and Auxerre.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Regime Blames Polls  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- On the eve of a historic election
which polls say Slobodan Milosevic will lose, the government
claimed Saturday that opposition parties plan to declare victory
and set up a rival administration in pro-western Montenegro
regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Following the allegation, the government-run election commission
announced that voters in Sunday's presidential, parliamentary and
local election must show their marked ballots to electoral
officials before placing them in the box.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign factors who conduct a subversive activity have
prepared a sabotage plan,'' the commission said. ''They have
prepared a number of ballots'' already marked with the names of
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition denied any such plot and accused the Milosevic
government of trying to intimidate voters.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Yugoslavia's foreign ministry summoned Western
diplomats to complain about the alleged opposition plan. Diplomatic
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted deputy Foreign
Minister Miroslav Milosevic as saying the opposition would call on
the United States and European Union members to support the new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition leader, Goran Svilanovic, dismissed the
allegations as ''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the claim could pave the way for the government to
nullify the election if -- as polls indicate -- Milosevic trails his
strongest rival, Vojislav Kostunica. It could also set the stage
for a crackdown on Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic whose
president, Milo Djukanovic, opposes Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been rising in advance of Sunday's election, in
which the 7.8 million voters must decide whether to keep Milosevic
in power or opt for the opposition, which is pledging to end years
of economic decline and political isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia refused to let EU officials monitor the balloting and
severely limited the number of foreign journalists permitted in the
country. On Saturday, a Danish journalist was arrested in Belgrade
for allegedly entering the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian journalist and his cameraman were detained for
several hours Saturday by federal army troops in Montenegro after
filing street scenes in the capital Podgorica but were released.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 foreign reporters were also ordered Friday to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, backed by a coalition of 18 parties, has been running
about 10 percent ahead of Milosevic in recent polls. Three other
candidates are in the race, and if no one wins over 50 percent, a
runoff will be held in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Montenegro, which together with Serbia forms
Yugoslavia, has refused to take part in the election. However,
Milosevic's supporters there plan to go ahead with the election.
Voters in Kosovo, which is under U.N. and NATO administration, can
also take part although the majority ethnic Albanian community is
expected to boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of tension with Montenegro, the pro-Milosevic
army announced Saturday that it will guard polling stations in the
small republic. That could set the stage for an armed confrontation
with republican police loyal to the pro-Western administration.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin officials have said they may decide to declare
independence if Milosevic wins, setting the stage for another
Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan, dismissed
Belgrade's claim of a plot as a ''perfidious and cunning attempt to
distract public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not planning such a subversive action, and our police
never planned or even discussed it as an option,'' Burzan told
Montenegrin television. ''We will do our utmost to secure that
everything goes normally. We will not do anything that could be
perceived as a threat to anyone, or create any turmoil
whatsoever.''

<HEADLINE> Shooting suspect arrested at victim's funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A man wanted in connection with the
shooting death of a 19-year-old bystander was arrested when he
showed up at a church service for the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Wilson, 29, was charged with manslaughter in the
shooting death last Sunday of Taylik Davis. He was shot in the
chest when Wilson pulled out a handgun during a fight with another
man over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   After police received an anonymous tip that Wilson planned to
attend a memorial service for David, detectives staked out the
Liberty Baptist Church on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   They soon saw Wilson drive up to the church and walk inside,
trying to mingle with mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said when Wilson saw police, he ran out of the
church and onto its roof, jumped off and ran through several
backyards before he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in the Union County Jail in lieu of $400,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that immediately after the shooting, Wilson
grabbed the man with whom he had been fighting, told police that
was who shot Davis, then slipped into the crowd that had gathered
and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   When police detained the man, he told them it was actually
Wilson who fired the fatal shot.

<HEADLINE> Junta Shake-Up In Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Supporters of Ivory Coast's
opposition leader camped by the hundreds in front of his house
Saturday, praying, cooking and sleeping in his yard to shield him
from the increasingly aggressive military junta.
</P>
<P>
   If forces of junta leader Gen. Robert Guei do come for Alassane
Dramane Ouattara, they'll have to go through the market women
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be the shield on which they will smash themselves,''
said Sangare Namizata, who left her two 4-year-old children at home
eight days ago to stand guard before Ouattara's home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will not touch a hair on his head,'' insisted Edwidge
Koffi, a saleswoman in gray dress and matching purse.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been building daily in the West African nation in
anticipation of an announcement on whether Ouattara, a former
premier and International Monetary Fund official, will be permitted
to run against Guei in promised Oct. 22 elections to return the
country to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Guei rose to power during a Christmas Eve 1999 military coup,
the first in Ivory Coast's 40-year history. Two smaller military
uprisings have followed, shaking the reputation of stability that
had made Ivory Coast the financial center of West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The political trouble worsened Monday, when the government
announced it had beaten back an assassination attempt by mutineers
in Guei's own presidential guard. Security forces have arrested
scores since then, mostly soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect the alleged attempt was an elaborate ruse to
justify a pre-election crackdown on Guei's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara's supporters started setting up camp outside the high
cement walls around his luxurious white villa a little over a week
ago, after military vehicles started cruising past the house and
rumors spread of his imminent arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women traveled for hours or days from Ivory Coast's
remote interior to the pole-and-tarp shantytown that has sprung up
in one of Abidjan's most elegant neighborhoods, against the distant
backdrop of the city's downtown office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to protect him, because he's a good man,'' said Awa
Traore, hunched in printed cloth and headwrap over aluminum pans of
stew and meat on charcoal burners.
</P>
<P>
   Well over 500 people sleep there on some nights, with many more
on alert in homes in cities and towns around the capital in case of
trouble, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect Ivory Coast to bar Ouattara from running for the
presidency, and fear that could be one of many triggers that could
set off the violence threatening here.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has split Ivory Coast along ethnic and regional
lines, with Ouattara drawing much of his support from his native
north. Late Friday, Guei shed his junta's No. 2 and 3 officials,
both northerners.
</P>
<P>
   Guei gave no explanation for the shake-up, which also saw the
departure of a lower-ranked official from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Ten African heads of state are to discuss the country's growing
instability in a summit set for Sunday in nearby Lome, Togo. It is
the second Organization of African Unity summit in nine months on
Ivory Coast, valued by African leaders as a center of calm and
relative prosperity in a troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has forbidden Ouattara and other opposition leaders to
attend the summit or leave the country, and says he himself is too
busy to attend, Ivory Coast newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, recently increased
its military presence in the nation from 550 to 680, and has a ship
with the capacity to evacuate 3,000 people stationed offshore,
French Defense Ministry spokesman Luc Jouvence said Saturday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Jouvence said the increased military presence had nothing to do
with the heightening tensions in Ivory Coast. France has 25,000
nationals in Ivory Coast.

<HEADLINE> Twelfth case of West Nile Virus is reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 52-year-old Staten Island man has become the
12th city resident this year to become infected with the West Nile
virus, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose identity was not released, apparently became
infected in mid-August but tried to fight off a variety of symptoms
including fever, joint and muscle pain as well as dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   After he entered a hospital Tuesday, doctors diagnosed the virus
through blood and spinal fluid tests.
</P>
<P>
   The man remains lethargic but is listed in stable condition,
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His condition, thank goodness, is improving,'' Giuliani said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said eight of the 12 people in the city who were
diagnosed with the disease continue to recover at home, while four
remain hospitalized, though all appear stable. Two of those
hospitalized were Brooklyn residents and two were from Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani said the city will continue spraying city
neighborhoods with pesticides to control the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying of Central Park was completed Friday night,
Giuliani said. Plans for fresh spraying were set to begin Monday in
Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying was expected to continue until at least mid-October,
when authorities expect three or four days of freezing temperatures
to wipe out most mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit in federal court in
Manhattan aimed at forcing the city to stop spraying. The groups
say the pesticides are potentially more harmful to the city's
overall population than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A judge who is presiding over the case, though, has already
indicated that the few hundred people who have complained about the
spraying to a city health hot line may not carry as much weight as
the four human deaths blamed on the disease last year.

<HEADLINE> Fashion Week Ends  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Fashion Week, spring-summer 2001
edition, has wrapped up, the good news is, many items that style
seekers will want -- shirt dresses, slip dresses and shorts -- just
might already be hanging in their closet.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is fashion never comes back exactly the same as
before. Spring shirtdresses are printed in a geometric pattern for
day or splattered with sequins for night; slip dresses take a shine
to metallics; and shorts truly live up to their name. Well, you
might as well make your shorts outrageously abbreviated when
they're done up in gold leather.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the trends that dominated the runway previews
that finished Friday night. But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing from fall, designers have opted for blouson tops and
dresses that cut the wearer some room. Designers also displayed a
penchant for patterns, notably stripes, which run in black-white or
brown-white throughout Ralph Lauren's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The season is also preoccupied with checks, right down to
Geoffrey Beene's black-and-white checked buttons on his
black-and-white checked jacket. And pleated skirts are making a
showing, even if not everyone's are as micro-mini as Oscar de la
Renta's, which he dubs ''tennis skirts'' but pairs with the
season's ubiquitous, towering high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Among the easiest updates are trench coats and hip-slung wrap
belts, which seem to accompany every other look.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hot pants are a big question mark,'' says Neiman Marcus
fashion director Joan Kaner. ''They're great for young people, but
I'd hate to see them adopted as a national trend on women of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has such a tiny tog made such a big showing, even among
designers who cater to career women or the social set. Mainstream
designer Ellen Tracy offers hot pants in gold leather, and Kenneth
Cole's look tie-dyed, while society designer Carolina Herrera
trotted them out in black silk with the season's trendy
off-the-shoulder blouse. Bill Blass' strike a note of modesty when
paired with a matching jacket and slingbacks; and Oscar de la Renta
offered a wild variation on the theme by sending out, of all
things, pink satin bloomers.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses are hardly a scarce commodity on spring runways, be they
wrap styles, shirtdresses or the slip variety. Gold seems to be the
spring standard, which is why Halston's wrap dresses are done in
gold lace, Nicole Miller's are gold denim and Richard Tyler's are
gold silk jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the millions of beads that comprise the season's
eveningwear end up on dresses. Shirtdresses are sequined at Badgley
Mishka, in white leather at Ralph Lauren, patterned in a turquoise
geometric print at Carolina Herrera, and in leopard-print chiffon
at Halston.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers seemed to stalk the urban jungle. There are
safari-pocket bustiers at Douglas Hannant, leather safari dresses
and jackets at Oscar de la Renta, and African warrior prints at
Anna Sui.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers stay closer to home, influenced by New York
City. Vivienne Tam's prints in black with color splashing are
inspired by the neon city lights as seen through the window of a
speeding taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Still other designers mine other times and places. Randolph Duke
goes back to ancient Greece, with draped, gauze gowns that suggest
goddesses of the era. Elsewhere, Art Deco patterns inform a lot of
looks, including black beaded dresses at BCBG, and tank dresses,
skirts and pants at Halston.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson pays tribute to the '50s with a red-and-white
striped, belted ''bombshell'' dress worthy of Marilyn Monroe. Other
designers, like Anna Sui, stop at the '80s. She reprises the
dance-club look popularized by '80s Madonna, with punk-inspired
black dresses slashed to pieces accessorized with fishnet hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   Some looks are high on notice-me drama. Pamela Dennis opts for a
flurry of feathers, fashioned into bustiers. Off-the-shoulder tops
are popular, too, such as one from Marc Jacobs, in fuchsia trimmed
with black patent leather. For pure sex appeal, designers slit
dresses and gowns high on the side, exposing lots of leg.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny stuff, be it pearlized leather or metallics, from gold to
bronze to platinum, will fuel spring styles. Calvin Klein liberally
uses iridescent silk and satin throughout his collection, in the
guise of pastel jackets and dresses. Nicole Miller also opts for
high-gloss looks, right down to the socks she shows with every
outfit, typically black with blue sparkles.
</P>
<P>
   Designers throw a curve ball into spring, avoiding straight
lines in favor of slants. That translates into a slew of
asymmetrical hemlines, such as Donna Karan's, on her swirling
ruffled dresses with handkerchief point hems.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonless dressing is a concept mentioned by designers
including Michael Kors and Geoffrey Beene, who combine clothes from
different seasons. Kors, who lowers hemlines and raises the comfort
level by showing wider, suede skirts with luggage-colored flat
sandals, pairs summer looks with wintry, mink-lined suede serapes,
and lightweight linen pants with heavier camel hair jackets.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you will want to pair that snowbound parka with
short shorts is something you'll need to decide come spring.

<HEADLINE> Countries Mixed On U.S. Oil Release  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Britain and Venezuela welcomed the U.S.
decision to draw from its strategic oil reserves, saying it would
lower prices, but Iraq and Saudi Arabia dismissed the move Saturday
as an election-year ploy bound to backfire and destabilize the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq joined Saudi Arabia, a staunch U.S. ally in the Middle
East, in criticizing President Clinton's decision Friday to release
30 million barrels of oil to avoid a winter shortage of heating
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The move will do more harm than good in the ''greedy markets,''
Iraqi officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi government official said the release was ''an election
ploy requested by Al Gore. It seems that his request was granted by
Clinton.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Saudi
Arabia is the world's biggest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials rejected a U.S. television report that their
government intends to withhold oil in a bid to disrupt the market.
They said they had no plan to counter the U.S. release by cutting
Iraqi supplies or by halting exports when the current six-month
phase of U.N.-authorized sales ends in December.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which sits on the world's second largest oil reserves, has
an exemption from U.N. sanctions imposed since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait to sell oil and buy food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi official said the release would not calm the market's
fear of an oil shortage. Speculation was rife and the market was
operating under ''extreme U.S. pressure,'' he said, referring to
Washington's calls for an increase in oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Other Middle Eastern states had no immediate comment on the U.S.
move.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, which has been battered by truckers' blockades over
high fuel costs, Prime Minister Tony Blair praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this move, along with other efforts being made at
international level, will help to bring about a reduction in oil
prices in the very near future,'' said a statement issued by
Blair's office.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, Venezuela's oil minister, who currently holds the
rotating presidency of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, called Clinton's move ''positive,'' saying it would help
counter oil market speculation -- which OPEC has blamed for high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The simple announcement by U.S. authorities to place one
million barrels a day ... will provoke a strong descent (in oil
prices) on Monday,'' Ali Rodriguez said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said speculation adds $4 to $8 to the real price of
oil. He did not say by how much he expects prices to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan government accepted U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson's assurances that the decision was not an attempt to
rattle the oil market, but was a response to domestic concerns, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela hosts OPEC's second-ever summit next week, at a time
when oil prices have soared to levels not seen since the 1991
Persian Gulf War. Rodriquez said they would not discuss boosting
output.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Online grocer puts expansion plans in Bergen County and NYC on hold </HEADLINE>
TRE filed
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An online grocer has put on hold plans to open a
large warehouse in Bergen County, N.J., a delay that also calls
into question the company's plans to open a warehouse in South
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Thursday, New York City officials were promoting
plans by Webvan Group Inc. to open the Bronx distribution center
and bring more than 900 jobs to the borough.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan officials declined to comment on whether those plans
would go ahead, but said the opening of the New Jersey warehouse
would be delayed by at least six months. That facility, which was
to begin operating in 2001, would bring in 1,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been offered $3 million in incentives from New
Jersey and $11 million from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported in Saturday's editions that the
delay came after indications that investors are unhappy with the
performance of Webvan's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Like many similar Internet companies, Webvan has posted
significant losses. After recently acquiring HomeGrocer.com, the
companies posted combined losses of $103.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about the expansion delay, Merrill Lynch
analysts have said they are unsure Webvan will be unable to find
enough customers or enter new markets successfully around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently operates in nine markets, including San
Francisco, Chicago and Atlanta. It was expected to be in 13
metropolitan areas by the end of 2000 and 15 by the end of 2001,
but analysts now say that is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Army: Gunmen Kill Colombian Peasants  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Peasant farmers who were shot and hacked
to death with machetes in a northern village are believed to have
been the victims of rightist militias, police and army officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen wearing military-style uniforms attacked Nain, a poor
village in the mountains of Cordoba State, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The army said Saturday it had confirmed seven deaths, the bodies
brought by mule and horseback to the nearby town of Tierralta. A
local priest said Friday up to 30 people had been killed in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Nain appeared to be the work of a right-wing
paramilitary group, the United-Self Defense Forces of Colombia, or
AUC, said Maj. David Yaruro of the army's Eleventh Brigade based in
the nearby city of Monteria. Cordoba province is an AUC stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The army had said Friday that two separate massacres by gunmen
took place in the area, but Yaruro said he was aware only of the
one in Nain.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilantes have targeted peasants before in the farming and
ranching region as they hunted for sympathizers of leftist
guerrilla groups who extort money from large landowners and kidnap
them.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, ranging in age from 16 to 65, were apparently
killed on suspicion that they were guerrilla collaborators,
Monteria police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult terrain and clashes in Cordoba State prevented troops
from reaching the area, Yaruro said. Nain is about a three-hour
drive from Tierralta, along steep and unpaved mountain roads.
Tierralta is about 330 miles north of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary forces clashed Saturday
in the area, adding to the troops' difficulty in reaching Nain. The
leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the
country's largest rebel group, is trying to re-establish itself in
the area, which was seized by militia several years ago, Yaruro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The AUC is estimated to have about 6,000 combatants and has
links to government security forces. Many AUC fighters are former
government soldiers. The AUC is paid by landowners for protection
services, and makes money by taxing Colombia's drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary violence is a sensitive issue in relations between
Colombia and the United States. A $1.3 billion anti-drug aid
package for the South American country is conditioned on government
progress in dismantling the militias and severing army ties to
them.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Flights Challenge UN Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi officials welcomed a Russian plane
Saturday -- the second aircraft to land in two days without U.N.
clearance -- as evidence that the United Nations' 10-year-old trade
sanctions were collapsing despite U.S. and British objections.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupolev-154 carrying five tons of medical supplies and 143
passengers, most of them businessmen, landed in Baghdad after
having informed the U.N. sanctions committee in New York of its
destination but not waiting for authorization.
</P>
<P>
   A French plane had arrived Friday carrying doctors, artists and
athletes opposed to the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ''These flights are an indication that both America and Britain
have failed in their attempts to isolate Iraq,'' said Abdulrazzaq
al-Hashemi, a senior member of Iraq's ruling Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq is very important. No one can ignore a country with
potentials like ours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The flights have so emboldened Iraqi authorities that al-Hashemi
declared the government will turn down future requests to fly to
Baghdad if organizers have obtained U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council is divided on the flights to Iraq,
with the United States and Britain trying to prevent nations from
punching holes in the sanctions. Russia and France maintain U.N.
authorization is not required for humanitarian flights. After
Friday's flight, France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said
''there will be other flights.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called the
French flight a ''blatant violation'' of sanctions and U.N.
procedures. And Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said he
regretted that the French had not waited for U.N. clearance.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of business executives on the Russian plane
conflicted with the flight's declared humanitarian mission. The
executives were led by Yuri Shafranik, the president of Russia's
Central Fuel Company and a former energy minister.
</P>
<P>
   Shafranik told reporters there would be no letup in Russia's
campaign to have the U.N. sanctions lifted as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to conduct talks and point out the projects for
the future and implement them,'' he said. He added that the Kremlin
was fully behind the flight.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Itar-Tass agency, Shafranik said: ''We
not only can, but should, assert ourselves in Iraq, considering the
rich oil resources of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we lose Iraq, we will never have a good balanced budget
like we have for 2000-2001'', he added.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and France are owed large amounts of money from
pre-1990 trade with Iraq and are keen to invest in its oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the businessmen, other Russians on the plane were
artists and athletes who were expected to meet and perform with
their Iraqi counterparts. The French plane also carried
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plane belonged to Vnukovo Airlines, whose
representative in Baghdad, Alexei Badikov, said he hoped Iraq and
Russia would resume scheduled flights within two months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain vehemently oppose a resumption of
passenger flights, saying they would be an economic resource and
therefore a breach of the sanctions. The two also insist all
flights -- including humanitarian ones -- require permission of the
U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions require the sanctions to remain in place until
Baghdad complies with demands to dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction. For the past decade, travelers to Iraq generally have
flown to Amman, Jordan, and then driven to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's flight was the second Russian plane to land in
Baghdad in a week. On Sept. 17 a Russian aircraft arrived with
humanitarian aid, but it had obtained clearance from the U.N.
sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.N. committee on Iraq, the Netherlands' U.N.
Ambassador Peter van Walsum, said Friday he expected the Security

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Student's death was a 'terrible mistake'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The death of a 16-year-old student with a heart
condition who collapsed after climbing stairs to the school gym at
Gompers High School in the Bronx was a ''terrible mistake,'' Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said there was a letter in the file for Dantese
Jenkins that indicated he was not supposed to participate in
athletic activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why that letter was ignored, I don't know,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkens collapsed at about 8:20 a.m. Friday. The boy was taken
to Lincoln Hospital, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Harold Levy said he learned that Jenkins'
mother had given the school a doctor's letter stating that the boy
should not be involved in any physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, in a statement issued Friday evening, said school records
confirmed the boy's condition and showed that Jenkins had
participated in gym class for the second semester last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what the chancellor says to me, there was a terrible
mistake made at a minimum,'' Giuliani said. ''Obviously, there were
people responsible for it and they should be held responsible for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said three successive school nurses at Gompers last year
were responsible for reviewing the health record of each new
student. Two of them were removed for unsatisfactory performance;
the third served through the end of the last school year and did
not return. The Department of Health has yet to assign a new school
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one assigned to the Medical Room at Gompers appears to have
reported any health restrictions for this child,'' Levy said,
adding that the school's health service aide had been suspended
pending a disciplinary hearing next week.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said Jenkins' record also contained a written request for a
medical transfer to another school, but that no apparent action had
been taken. He said he asked Norman Wechsler, the superintendent
for Bronx high schools, to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he met with the boy's parents and offered prayers
and a promise to get answers to what happened to prevent a similar
death.
</P>
<P>
   He said the boy's father, Ken, was ''kind enough to ask how I
was doing with my cancer.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - A Schenectady police officer who
admitted he robbed crack from a drug dealer to bribe an informant
has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-year-old Richard Barnett pleaded guilty earlier in the
week to federal extortion and drug distribution charges. His
partner, 32-year-old Michael Siler, is to be arraigned on a
six-count indictment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State public service law requires police officers convicted of
felony charges be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and Siler were the first officers tagged under a
yearlong federal investigation into the city's police force.
</P>
<P>
   ''As mayor, I'm not going to have felons as members of the
police department,'' Mayor Albert Jurczynski said. ''The feds are
doing a thorough job of getting to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office has ordered a plea agreement with
Barnett sealed. Siler faces a maximum of 30 years in prison for
charges that include carrying a firearm during the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rights Activist Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's leading human rights activist was
released from prison Saturday and said he hoped to be the last
person jailed in Turkey under laws curbing freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Akin Birdal, former president of the independent Human Rights
Association, served 10 months in prison. He was convicted of
inciting racial hatred for urging an end to Turkey's 16-year war
against Kurdish rebels in the largely Kurdish southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope and wish is to be the last person imprisoned because
of writing and voicing ideas,'' Birdal said outside an Ankara
prison where he was greeted by 100 human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal said Turkey had not made concrete steps to improve its
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't the Turkish people deserve democratization?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is often criticized for its poor human rights record.
Europe and the United States have called on Turkey to crack down on
torture in police stations and reform its laws curbing freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal, 51, is still recovering from an assassination attempt in
May 1998, when two assailants shot him six times. Eleven members of
a far-right nationalist group were convicted and sentenced in
December 1998 to up to 19 months in prison for attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   He was released for health reasons last year after serving three
months, but was jailed again in March.
</P>
<P>
   Both the European Union and the United States criticized Turkey
for jailing Birdal. Scores of activists and writers have been
sentenced to prison terms in Turkey for writings and speeches seen
as sympathetic to Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 cases are still pending against Birdal for his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as a minority and
has rejected a cease-fire announced by the rebels last year. The
European Union, which Ankara wants to join, is pressing Turkey to
find a peaceful solution to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in fighting
since 1984.

   --Created in 1975 in a series of salt domes on the Texas and
Louisiana Gulf Coast in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan, S.Korea Pledge Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATAMI, Japan (AP) -- Japan and South Korea took a step toward
burying decades of animosity Saturday when their leaders agreed to
forge closer economic and cultural ties and to bolster cooperation
to ward off North Korea's military threat.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, when South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
made his first trip to Japan as president, the agenda was dominated
by how far Tokyo would go to apologize for its brutal 1910-45
colonization of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   This time, historical issues were barely touched upon. Instead,
Kim and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori agreed to coordinate
their high-tech skills in an information technology alliance.
</P>
<P>
   They also pledged to continue working in a three-way partnership
with the United States to deal with Stalinist North Korea's
unpredictable regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand-in-hand with President Kim Dae-jung, I hope to build a
new era of friendly Japan-South Korea relations in the 21st
Century,'' Mori said in a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Japan-Korea cooperation initiative'' issued after
Saturday's talks included promises to work together on electronic
commerce and information technology research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he would welcome a visit by the Japanese emperor to
South Korea, leaving the timing up to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was striking because Japan's imperial system is for
many Asians the most potent symbol of Japan's bloody conquest of
the region, which was carried out in the name of the emperor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the emperor's visit to Korea is very important,''
Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of efforts to improve cultural ties, Mori promised
legislation to introduce Korean as a language in college entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope exchanges and understanding between our two people will
take another leap forward,'' Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of North Korea's missile program has been
instrumental in bringing the nations closer.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has taken a keen interest in the dramatic detente between
the two Koreas that began with their landmark summit in June, and
Mori expressed support for their progress on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thawing ties on the Korean peninsula ties have contributed to
growing Tokyo-Pyongyang contacts, which fell apart two years ago
when the North tested a ballistic missile that flew over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In a second round of talks this year, a North Korean delegation
visited Japan in August to discuss setting up diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Kim told Mori on Saturday that he had the impression during the
June North-South summit that Kim Jong Il was eager to normalize
ties with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Kim also urged Japan to adopt a bill to extend
local voting rights to the 700,000 ethnic Koreans living in Japan
by the end of the year, and Mori responded that he was working hard
for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of South Koreans were brought to Japan before World
War II to work under slave labor conditions. Their descendants,
most of whom do not have Japanese citizenship, say they deserve a
say in the way they are governed.

<HEADLINE> Two years after child's body was found, police say man confesses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man being questioned about a burglary
surprised his interrogators Saturday by confessing to a grisly
murder two years ago of a 12-year-old girl in Queens, a police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bryant, 20, was arrested after admitting that he had
killed Leeann Mitchell, whose body was left so mutilated that she
wasn't identified until after Bryant made his confession, said
police spokesman Alan Krawitz.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities recovered the skeletal remains of the girl in a
wooded field in the Jamaican section on July 18, 1998, about 100
yards west of the street where Bryant lived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The body had been bludgeoned and set on fire, making
identification impossible, Krawitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had been arrested five times before in connection with
three burglaries, petty larceny and an assault before he was picked
up a sixth time Friday, Krawitz said.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning, Bryant began to speak about the killing, at
first blaming it on someone else, Krawitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just brought it up himself,'' Krawitz said. ''Maybe he felt
guilty or thought they knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was charged with second-degree murder and held for an
initial court appearance, police said.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Face German Party Meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASSAU, Germany (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters marched Saturday
outside the annual meeting of an extreme-right political party,
after city authorities failed to stop the group from screening a
video with a Holocaust denier who is banned from the country.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,600 demonstrators gathered in the southern town of
Passau, displaying signs such as ''Extreme-rightists unwanted,'' as
police said nearly 2,200 members of the German People's Union party
met in a conference hall.
</P>
<P>
   Passau officials initially had sought to ban the party from
showing a video with disputed British historian David Irving, who
is banned from entering Germany, where Holocaust denial and
incitement to racial hatred are illegal. The party took the city to
court and won the right to show the video there and in an appeal
heard Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A British judge had branded Irving an anti-Semite racist in
April in ruling that an American scholar was justified in saying he
denied the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The address by Irving -- part of a documentary on the Allied
bombing of the eastern city of Dresden at the end of World War II --
was being projected onto a giant screen in Passau's Nazi-era
Nibelungenhalle conference center, a favorite venue for far-right
gatherings. The city has discussed possibly razing the building,
after failing in previous attempts to stop the parties from meeting
there because of their rights as legally recognized groups.
</P>
<P>
   Passau Mayor Willi Schmoeller said he was pleased by the number
of demonstrators who turned out against the party, saying it was
important ''to make clear that this event isn't wanted in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, about 500 participants staged another
counter-demonstration to the German People's Union party at the
city's memorial to Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police said Saturday they had arrested seven suspects
in an arson attack in the western city of Wuppertal that injured
two children living in a transition home for immigrants from the
former Yugoslavia. The suspects all had neo-Nazi affiliation,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   That attack was in the same state as Duesseldorf, where a July
bombing at a train station that injured 10 recent immigrants from
the former Soviet Union, six of them Jewish, touched off the recent
wave of renewed awareness of neo-Nazi violence in Germany. At least
three people have been killed this year in hate-motivated violence.
</P>
<P>
   Leading officials of Germany's main churches also expressed
alarm Saturday over a rising wave of anti-foreigner sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racism and anti-alien feelings have become visible again in
our country in appalling proportions,'' Karl Lehmann, chairman of
the German Catholic Bishops Conference, said at the opening a
weeklong event aimed at promoting tolerance of foreigners in
Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The series of acts of violence against foreigners has shocked
us and makes us very worried again,'' said the head of Germany's
Lutheran Church, Manfred Kock.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Moves To Curb Illegal Guns  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, acting to curb illegal gun
sales, said Saturday the government was turning to the Internet to
make it harder to acquire weapons via computer or mail by using
fake firearms licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the Internet, despite all its benefits, is
making it easier for guns to fall into the wrong hands. There are
now 4,000 firearm sales-related sites on the Internet and there are
80 sites where you can actually buy a gun at an auction,'' Clinton
said in his weekly radio address, broadcast before he left for a
political trip in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, we must do more to ensure that every sale over the
Internet is legal and that no one uses the anonymity of cyberspace
to evade our nation's gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has set up a Web site, known as eZ Check, for
online federal firearms license authentication.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, licensed dealers can only ship firearms to
other licensed dealers. Sellers are required to obtain a certified
copy of the federal firearms license of the individual buying the
guns. Criminals, however, have gotten around this requirement by
using forged licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, created by the Treasury Department and its Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will allow licensed gun dealers
to quickly verify the validity of licenses presented for purchase
or shipment of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, ATF has documented a sizable
illegal market in guns fed by corrupt federally licensed dealers,
straw purchasers and unlicensed gun sellers, Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited an incident from May in which two New Jersey
teen-agers using a forged federal firearms license ordered guns
over the Internet for home delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they used a forged license, there was no scrutiny, no
background check, no questions asked. It was only because of the
actions of a suspicious UPS delivery man that this scheme was
thwarted,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Licensees are now required to obtain copies of licenses from
purchasers before making a shipment, but do not have to ensure that
the licenses are valid.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule, which will take affect next year after public
comment, will require licensed dealers to verify the licenses
through eZ Check and to report people attempting to obtain guns
with invalid licenses, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the fourth-ranking House Republican said the
plan ''sounds like a step in the right direction.'' Rep. J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference, added,
''It's important for the federal government to prosecute criminals
while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   William Powers, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,
said his group supports eZ Check, as long as it works the way the
government says it will.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's certainly appropriate that dealers are licensed
by the federal government to be in the business of being a
federally licensed firearms dealer,'' he said. ''And if they're
coming up with a system that provides greater ability to verify
those records, and it works the way it's supposed to, I don't think
it's a big deal.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Emphasize Debt Reduction  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The two top Republicans in Congress appealed
to President Clinton on Saturday to agree to use 90 percent of next
year's federal surplus for debt reduction, a goal that has become
the GOP's top pre-election budget theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we may not agree on all aspects of the budget, we can at
the very least do something on which we can all agree -- reduce the
debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare now and in the
future,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said in the
weekly Republican radio address, given with Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   They said their proposal would ensure that the surpluses of
Social Security and Medicare are used only for debt reduction,
while also strengthening the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' remarks spotlighted the turnaround that the GOP has
executed in its budget goals as the November presidential and
congressional elections approach. Until recently, their
highest-profile battle with Clinton had been their losing fight
over cutting taxes, a fight in which the president vetoed GOP tax
cuts for many married couples and for people who inherit large
estates.
</P>
<P>
   But in their radio address, Lott and Hastert did not mention tax
cuts until two-thirds of the way through their remarks. At that
point, Lott said Republicans would use half the remaining 10
percent of the surplus ''to grant some modest tax relief to working
Americans'' by expanding the contributions they can make to
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ''has been committed to debt relief for seven years now
..., (and) we are pleased to see the Republican leadership backing
away from their risky tax scheme for this year,'' said White House
adviser Joel Johnson, traveling with Clinton in California. ''What
we don't know yet is the Republican spending plan for this year.
They haven't sent the president their spending bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson challenged Republican leaders ''to commit to that kind
of debt reduction next year and the year after that and the year
after that. ... If you only do it for one year, it is a political
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN's ''Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields, the minority
leader of the House had a similar reaction. While saying the
Republicans waited too long to produce the plan, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ''I'm not opposed.'' But he added: ''I'd
like to have 90 percent over the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting with Clinton two weeks ago, GOP leaders
proposed using 90 percent of next year's projected $268 billion
surplus -- or $240 billion -- to reduce the $3.4 trillion publicly
held debt. The remaining 10 percent -- $28 billion -- would be used
for tax cuts and spending increases that congressional and White
House bargainers are negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans haven't mentioned it publicly, their plan
would actually provide an additional $13 billion for extra spending
or tax cuts. That is because of a gap between the spending
assumptions GOP leaders are now making and the more frugal, initial
versions of Congress' spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said that when Republicans presented their
debt-reduction plan to Clinton, he replied that ''whether we can do
it this year or not depends upon what the various spending
commitments are.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. President, we can do this if we work together,'' said
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have noted that Clinton's own budget proposed using
more than 90 percent of next year's surplus for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   They also have accused Republicans of backing big tax cuts that
over 10 years would consume much more than 10 percent of projected
surpluses. GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush has championed a
10-year tax cut exceeding $1.3 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador to Israel Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. ambassador to Israel is under FBI
investigation for suspected security violations, closing a critical
channel to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the midst of
difficult peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the first American ambassador stripped of his
security clearances, Martin Indyk is denied access to classified
documents and even discussions with Barak or other Middle East
figures, a senior State Department official said Saturday. By their
nature, such conversations are considered classified.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton endorses the State Department's handling of
the case and does not think the Indyk situation will affect the
U.S. peace efforts, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart,
traveling with Clinton in California.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation continues, Indyk, like all visitors,
must be escorted personally by a department official to go beyond
the State Department lobby, cafeteria and a few other nonsensitive
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time ambassador to Tel Aviv and recent head of the State
Department's Near East Bureau ''can still talk to people, but he
can only have coffeehouse conversations,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official, also speaking anonymously, said
Indyk is alleged to have mishandled work-related classified
materials, including taking some home.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk's indiscretion involved the use of an unclassified,
government-owned laptop computer to prepare while in transit
memorandums about discussions with foreign leaders, said a source
outside the State Department who is familiar with the
investigation. Once entered into the State Department system, the
documents were classified. The source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Indyk also was accused of removing classified
briefing books to his office to prepare for meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that my trying to do the best possible job under very
difficult conditions has led to the temporary suspension of my
security clearances,'' Indyk said in a statement. ''Jeopardizing
the national security interests of the U.S. is absolutely abhorrent
to me, and I would never do anything to compromise those
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed gratitude that the State Department ''agreed with
my firm conviction that no classified information has been
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have been ultrasensitive about
security since the April disclosure that a laptop containing
top-secret information about arms proliferation had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Indyk's former deputy in the bureau, Ronald Neuman,
nominated to be ambassador to Bahrain, was suspended from his job
without pay in connection with an inquiry into his handling of
classified materials. The Neuman matter was said to have been
resolved, but he apparently has not been reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ''holds Ambassador Indyk
in very high regard and values his contribution greatly,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. But, he said, ''She has
been absolutely clear on the need for everyone to follow security
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no indication of espionage in this matter at this
time,'' Boucher said. ''There is no indication that any classified
information was compromised'' by Indyk.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk was sent to Tel Aviv for an unusual second term as
ambassador last year at the request of Barak. With Barak's election
to succeed hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu, the Clinton
administration saw larger opportunities for a peace settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Gadi Baltiansky, a Barak spokesman, said in a statement Saturday
that Barak ''highly appreciates Ambassador Indyk and his
contribution to furthering the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Indyk returned to Washington this month to help prepare for
Clinton's separate talks with Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on the sidelines of the Millennium Summit at the United
Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the Barak and Arafat sessions with Clinton, which produced
no movement either on the future of Jerusalem or on other aspects
of the stalemate, Indyk suggested in a speech that Israel and the
Palestinians eventually must share the Holy City. Israel considers
undivided Jerusalem its permanent capital, and the Palestinians
demand sovereignty over its eastern part.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk, 49, held jobs with a pro-Israel lobby and a Middle East
think tank before taking a White House job with the newly elected
Clinton in 1993. Born in London and reared in Australia, Indyk
became a U.S. citizen just before being sworn in as head of the
Middle East desk at the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then sent him as ambassador to Israel in April 1995 for
2&AMP;frac12; years. In that time, he drew close to the late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who led Israel into negotiations with Arafat and the
Palestinians. Rabin was a mentor of Barak, who like Rabin is a
former Israeli armed forces chief.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk will remain in Washington, where, Boucher said, ''He has
cooperated fully with Department of State and FBI investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of State Department's Near East Bureau, Indyk was a
leading formulator of tough Clinton administration positions at the
time against both Iran and Iraq. He also was paired with Dennis
Ross, senior U.S. mediator on the Arab-Israeli conflict under four
secretaries of state, to work on the half-century-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk's suspension comes in the same week it was revealed that
the Defense Department and the Justice Department were
investigating former CIA Director John Deutch for alleged security
violations he committed while deputy secretary of defense. Those
alleged breaches also included sloppy handling of secret data on
personal computers and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch admitted to security violations as CIA director after he
retired; he apologized and was stripped of his security clearances.
The acknowledged security violations while he was at the CIA are
the primary focus of the Justice Department's renewed criminal
investigation of Deutch.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan strikes a religious note as he accepts Right to Life nod  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - Reform Party presidential nominee Pat
Buchanan decried the exclusion of religion in some parts of society
Saturday as he accepted the nomination of the New York State Right
to Life Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the establishment doesn't want our ideas or voices
heard,'' he said. ''The younger generation takes abortion for
granted and God out of public schools for granted. This is why I
believe we've got to wage this war.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who national polls indicate is likely to receive about
1 percent of the vote, will appear on New York ballots as the Right
to Life candidate as well as a candidate on his independent
Buchanan-Reform line.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in front of about 80 supporters at the state's Right to
Life Party committee meeting, Buchanan complained that he is being
overlooked in the presidential race and excluded from the debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates requires candidates to
register at least 15 percent of support in media polls to be
included.
</P>
<P>
   During a 30-minute speech, Buchanan denounced illegal
immigration, deployment of U.S. troops for peacekeeping missions
and economic sanctions that punish a country's people but not its
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And he joked about the recent removal of his gallstones,
suggesting that he could auction them over the Internet to raise
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is trying to bring some life to his flagging campaign,
which suffered from his four-week absence due to the surgery and
the fight to secure federal funds earmarked for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning campaign swings through traditionally Democratic
states like Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey, which he said
will be ignored by Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Radio advertisements and some television spots in the smaller
media markets are also planned. His campaign received $12.6 million
in federal campaign money last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are six weeks left, we have to spend about $2 million a
week,'' Buchanan told one woman in the audience. ''Do you have any
ideas?''

Albright, Arafat Discuss Peace Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Yasser
Arafat on Saturday, a day after the Palestinian leader rebuffed efforts by
Israel's prime minister to arrange a two-way summit. Arafat does not object to a
meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, but wants assurances that it will
produce results, said a senior Palestinian official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The official said Israel wants to arrange a meeting as soon as
possible. Barak has little time left to try to conclude a peace treaty. In her
phone call, Albright assured Arafat that the United States is making every
effort to break the deadlock, said an Arafat spokesman.

By The Associated Press	   Rain fell across much of the nation Saturday as a
tropical storm
system fell apart over the Southeast and a cold front pushed across
the northerain states. sunnyow fell in the Rockies.
<TEXT>

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio trade barbs on soft money  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Rick Lazio were
at loggerheads Saturday over how and when to ban soft money
advertising from their Senate race, sniping at one another over the
details of a proposed financial disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Lazio's original deadline for reaching a deal
passed, the two sides continued swapping proposals, leaving open
the possibility that some agreement might be reached to ban
unregulated party spending from the nation's highest-profile Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough is enough,'' Clinton said after speaking at a forum on
child care in upper Manhattan. ''This is an issue that I think is
more important to make progress on than bicker about.''
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters that the Democratic party had agreed to stop
running ads on her behalf if Republicans promised to cease paying
for commercials boosting Lazio. She said she would also urge
independent groups who support her to refrain from running radio
and television commercials and asked that Lazio do the same.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager responded by saying he looked forward to
seeing Clinton put a stop to soft-money advertising by Monday,
something she did not promise to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they do (come off the air), we'll know she's serious and
we have a deal,'' Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns argued Friday over whether outside groups -
like the AFL-CIO for her and the American Conservative Union for
him - should be forbidden from running ads for either candidate.
Clinton asked Lazio to have groups supporting him promise to stay
out of the race, but then said she had no control over what
organizations on her side might do.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she offered a new proposal that she said would bind
only entities connected to the political parties, not the outside
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least we can have a core agreement that the parties will
not engage in soft money advertising,'' she said. ''I think that's
a very good start. ... If there was a misunderstanding, let's get
beyond it.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, criticize the outside groups on Lazio's side
as being purely political entities that existed specifically to
boost Republican candidates, while she said those supporting her
cause were long-standing organizations formed to advocate certain
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said representatives of the state Democratic party, the
Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee had agreed to refrain from paying for
pro-Clinton commercials if their Republican counterparts did the
same. Her supporters in the Liberal and Working Families parties
made the same promise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers has stopped short of saying he
would abide by an agreement, although Lazio's aides have said they
believe all Republican party entities would observe any ban the
campaign agrees to. The Republican National Committee says it will
do whatever Lazio asks.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio extended his original 5 p.m. Saturday deadline for a deal
to Monday, saying he still wanted to see the two campaigns come to
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess there's always room for hope that they will come to
their senses and do the right thing and walk away from this
reliance, this addiction to this kind of dirty money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to the unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate, rather than directly advocating
voting one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Should soft money be banned, Lazio could have an advantage
because the latest federal filings showed his campaign had more
hard money than hers - $10.2 million to $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded she'd be hurt by a soft money ban, and said
she'd have to step up her hard-money fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to have to add more fund-raisers, I'm going to have
to carve out the time to make more calls, but I'm willing to do
that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Gore 'Misleading Americans'  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush, trying to slow Al Gore's
momentum and overcome discouraging polls, accused his rival on
Saturday of engaging in ''a disturbing pattern of embellishments
and sudden reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent has unfortunately spent the week misleading
Americans,'' Bush told a meeting of Pennsylvania Republicans via
satellite as he wrapped up two days of Florida campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed Gore on energy policy, his relations with the
entertainment industry, the vintage of a union song, and the
relative costs of arthritis medicine for humans and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks -- among Bush's harshest yet on Gore -- came as the
Texas governor ended what his campaign viewed as one his strongest
weeks since the party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   It was marked by few mistakes, well-received appearances on the
popular Oprah Winfrey and Regis Philbin daytime talk shows, a shift
back to basic issues and well-attended, enthusiastic rallies. At
the same time, Gore appeared to be having trouble holding his
post-convention momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a strong, substantive week,'' Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes told reporters aboard the candidate's plane ''I'd like to
add a few adjectives, if I might,'' Bush chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these outward shows of optimism, Republican
strategists remained disappointed in state and national polls
showing he and Gore close both nationally and in states like
Arizona, North Carolina and Florida that Republicans once believed
were locked up.
</P>
<P>
   And the FBI's investigation of a missing videotape on Bush
debate preparations and a report that it may have been sent to the
Gore campaign by someone in the Bush camp raised new anxieties
within the Bush campaign about unwelcome distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, the candidate's brother and governor of Florida, told
reporters he was under no illusion that he could easily deliver
Florida -- despite its recent tendency to vote Republican in state
and national elections. Clinton won here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be tough,'' Jeb Bush said, suggesting his brother's
loss of his once-comfortable lead in Florida reflects a general
tightening of the race nationwide. The governor of Florida didn't
actively campaign for his brother earlier, keeping a low profile in
the race. Some Republicans in the state have complained in recent
weeks that the Bush campaign took the state for granted, thinking
their overall lead and the fact that his brother was governor would
make Florida a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush even suggested his brother might have to assemble a 270
majority in the electoral college without relying on Florida's 25
electoral votes -- a daunting feat that would essentially require
Bush to carry almost all the other battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush and his aides were quick to jump on a series of
what they viewed as Gore blunders or reversals. In his remarks to
Pennsylvania Republicans, Bush cited:
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore's role in raising $4.2 million for Democrats from the
entertainment industry at a Beverly Hills fund raiser on Monday
after harshly criticizing the industry a week earlier for marketing
violence to children -- criticism he and running mate Joseph
Lieberman later appeared to moderate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore's statement to a group of senior citizens that his
mother-in-law and his dog take the same arthritis medicine, but
that her prescription costs three times as much. His aides later
conceded that the figures he cited came from a congressional study,
not from actual family expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   -- His comment to a Teamsters conference in Las Vegas that ''Look
for the Union Label'' was ''one of the lullabies I heard as a
child.'' In fact, the jingle first appeared in 1975, when Gore was
27.
</P>
<P>
   -- His recommendation to President Clinton to tap into the
nation's strategic petroleum reserve to help damp down rising fuel
prices -- reversing his position of last winter. Clinton ordered
such a step on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''His misrepresentations are serious business -- not the
legitimate debate of political disagreements. They are a disturbing
pattern of embellishments and sudden reversals,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore countered in a speech to union workers in Cleveland he
addressed by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, the other side said they wanted to talk about the
issues,'' he said. ''But that didn't seem to last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also questioned Gore's statement on Friday that he had been
''part of the discussions on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve since
the days it was first established.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Problem is -- the reserve was first established in 1975, two
years before Gore even went to Congress,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokeswoman Kym Spell said Bush showed he doesn't
understand how Congress works because the reserve was authorized in
1975, but was not funded until two years later when Gore worked on
the project as a member of a Commerce subcommittee on energy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, at an Orlando airport rally, Bush ridiculed
Gore's position on the oil stockpile, located in underground
caverns in Louisiana and Texas. ''He's using it as if it's the
strategic political reserve,'' Bush quipped.
</P>
<P>
   State surveys suggest Gore and Bush are very close in a number
of places that most had thought were leaning to Bush -- including
Arizona and North Carolina. Gore has become very competitive in the
state-by-state races and appeared to have an advantage in the race
for 270 electoral votes.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Survive Perilous Journey  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The pilot's view from the sputtering, stolen
vintage crop-duster wasn't encouraging: endless, swelling sea and
gray sky. America was not in sight. The fuel was almost gone.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10 people on the pirate flight out of Cuba had one thing
left: faith. So they prayed as their plane headed into the water of
the stormy Gulf of Mexico west of their island homeland.
</P>
<P>
   All but one survived and realized their dream to come to
America. While the journey was extraordinary, it is a trip
regularly taken by Cubans trying to escape their communist country.
Many don't survive. Just last year, 11 people drowned when their
boat sank off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The only survivors
were two adults -- and Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The airplane flight began early Tuesday in Pinar Del Rio, a
province west of Havana. Lenin Iglesias Hernandez, 35, left the
home he shared with his extended family in the town of Los
Palacios, supposedly heading for his job flying crop dusting
planes.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, his wife, 31-year-old Mercedes Martinez, left
the house with their sons, Erik, 13, and Danny, 7. They were going
to Havana, a sister-in-law said later. They didn't carry suitcases
and there was no indication they would be gone for an extended
time.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hernandez landed at Pinar del Rio's Herradura Airport,
where his wife, their sons and six others were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had plotted the escape because of problems with an
uncle who is active in the communist party and was a famous
commander in President Fidel Castro's army during Cuba's revolution
four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   They took off in the aging Antonov AN-2 Colt crop duster at 8:45
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   As they flew out of the mountainous area, air traffic
controllers in the Cuban capital lost contact with the plane
shortly after 9 a.m. By then, the controllers had already told the
Miami tower that the plane was northbound, across the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' destination was Miami, but shortly into the flight
Hernandez realized they were running out of fuel. They also were
lost, ending up far to the west of their planned route north.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, he radioed Havana air traffic control and asked for a
Miami-Key West radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Havana radioed back: ''crash in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew why we wanted the frequency,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., two Florida Air National Guard F-15C fighters and an
AWACS plane diverted from a training mission were searching for the
missing plane.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hernandez spotted a speck on the horizon, the
Panamanian merchant ship Chios Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two minutes didn't pass ... Lenin saw a boat far away,''
survivor Rudolfo Fuentes recalled, the memory raising goose bumps
on his arms. ''God put that boat there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez flew over the freighter repeatedly until they were
noticed. Then, before the plane ditched in the water, the Cubans
took off their shirts and shoes and put their heads between their
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We prayed to God and we landed,'' Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane jolted across the rough water, with waves 4 to 6 feet
high produced by Tropical Storm Helene. Fuentes suffered a
concussion. A medical examiner would later determine that Ludel
Puig, 21, suffered a fatal head injury during the landing.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane came to a halt, the captain of the Chios Dream,
Konstantinos Kalaitgis, watched the survivors scramble out of the
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   ''People go all over the place,'' Kalaitgis said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's wife couldn't swim, so Fuentes held her up with his
left arm. Two women and three children clung to a lone life ring
that was losing air and to one of the plane's wings. The children --
ages 6, 7 and 13 -- didn't suffer a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The plane slowly sank, eventually sliding nose-up beneath the
waves some 285 miles southwest of Key West.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Chios Dream 45 minutes to reach the survivors.
Because of the rough sea, they stayed on board the ship until
Wednesday night before being transferred to a Coast Guard cutter.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   They were taken to Key West, where Fuentes and his wife, who
suffered a severe leg cut, were admitted to a hospital. Their son
stayed with them.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were taken to Miami, where they were given permission
to apply for U.S. residency. Fuentes and his family were given
temporary humanitarian parole pending later processing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fuentes and his wife, 35-year-old Liliana Ponzoa,
left the hospital. With 6-year-old son Andy in tow, they went to
St. Mary Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church in Key West to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had so much faith that I knew we were going to live. I was
saying 'calm down, calm down,' to the others,'' Ponzoa said.
''Thank God we're alive.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Polls Show Tight Race  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush are locked in a
close race in a national tracking poll out Saturday and several
states thought to be swinging Gore's direction reflected an overall
tightening of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll out Saturday had Gore at
48 percent and Bush at 45 percent, within the poll's 4 percentage
point error margin. A Newsweek poll out Saturday also showed the
race within the margins, at 47 percent for Gore to 45 percent for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been up 10 points in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking
poll earlier in the week and was up by 8 points in the last
Newsweek poll, both among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   New state polls in Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and
Michigan highlighted the trend that the race in those battleground
states is very competitive in some battleground states while Gore
retained a lead in others.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in Sunday editions of the Chicago Tribune looked at the
race in five of the largest battleground states from New Jersey to
Michigan. The polls found that the races in Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Michigan were very close, while Gore has a lead in Illinois and New
Jersey -- something reflected in earlier polls.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls taken Sept. 11-17 showed the race more competitive
in Michigan and Pennsylvania than in other recent polls, reflecting
the tightening of the race nationally. The Illinois poll of 703
registered voters and the other polls were of 500 registered voters
in each state. The polls had error margins of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   --In Illinois, Gore led Bush 47 percent to 35 percent in the
Tribune poll. (reflecting recent polls)
</P>
<P>
   --In New Jersey, Gore led Bush 50 percent to 32 percent.
(reflecting recent polls)
</P>
<P>
   --In Pennsylvania, Gore had an edge of 43 percent to 38 percent.
(Some recent polls have shown Gore significantly ahead)
</P>
<P>
   --In Michigan, Gore and Bush were essentially even -- Gore at 42
percent and Bush at 40 percent. (some recent polls showed Gore with
an edge)
</P>
<P>
   --In Ohio, they were also even with Gore at 42 percent and Bush
at 40 percent. (reflecting recent polls)
</P>
<P>
   In other new polls:
</P>
<P>
   --In California, a poll taken for the San Francisco Examiner-KTVU
showed Gore at 50 percent and Bush at 38 percent. The poll of 820
likely voters was taken Sept. 17-20 and had an error margin of 3.5
percentage points. (reflecting recent polls)
</P>
<P>
   --In Vermont, Gore was up 52 percent to 39 percent in a poll of
603 likely voters taken Sept. 19-21 by Research 2000. The error
margin was 3.5 percentage points. (reflecting recent polls)
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek national poll suggested Gore is favored on top
issues like health care, education and Social Security, and he is
seen about equally to Bush on the question of leadership qualities,
a characteristic that has been a big Bush advantage for months.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio inch closer to soft money Senate pact  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton tweaked an earlier
proposal to ban soft money advertising from the Senate race on
Saturday, and rival Rep. Rick Lazio responded to the new offer of
financial disarmament with a tentative ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The public back-and-forth - the two sides spoke at news
conferences, not around a negotiating table - appeared to mirror
the ups and downs of the previous day, when Lazio trumpeted a deal
and the first lady's campaign said no agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that we have an agreement, based on what I am
hearing what Mrs. Clinton said,'' Lazio said a few hours after
Clinton explained her plan to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request
for comment after Lazio said he was satisfied with her offer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Clinton said the Democratic party had agreed
to stop running ads on her behalf if Republicans promised to cease
paying for commercials boosting Lazio. She said she would also urge
independent groups who support her to refrain from running radio
and television commercials and asked that Lazio do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had secured promises from Republicans in New York
and Washington to stop spending money on ads for him. He said he
hoped soft money ads would be off the air by Monday, although
Clinton said the Democrats would stop running their commercials on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident she has the will to do the right thing,'' Lazio
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement appeared to cover spending by political
parties, but not by outside organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns had argued Friday over whether those outside
groups - like the AFL-CIO for her and the American Conservative
Union for him - should be forbidden from running ads for either
candidate. Clinton asked Lazio to have groups supporting him
promise to stay out of the race, but then said she had no control
over what organizations on her side might do.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she offered a new proposal that she said would bind
only entities connected to the Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least we can have a core agreement that the parties will
not engage in soft money advertising,'' she said. ''I think that's
a very good start. ... If there was a misunderstanding, let's get

</P>

   She did, however, accuse the outside groups on Lazio's side of

</P>
<P>
   Clinton said representatives of the state Democratic party, the
Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee had agreed to refrain from paying for
pro-Clinton commercials if their Republican counterparts stopped
running ads for Lazio. Her supporters in the Liberal and Working
Families parties made the same promise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had gotten an oral commitment from the Republican
Senate Campaign Committee and written commitments from the state
Republican and Conservative parties to stop spending soft money on
his behalf. He did not mention the Republican National Committee,
but an RNC spokesman said the committee would do whatever Lazio
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio both emphasized that any agreement would cover
only soft money spending for radio and TV commercials, not direct
mail or get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's focus on what we know we can hear and see,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had extended his original 5 p.m. Saturday deadline for a
deal to Monday, saying he still wanted to see the two campaigns
come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to the unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost

<HEADLINE> Israel Tries To Arrange Summit  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
called Yasser Arafat on Saturday, a day after the Palestinian
leader rebuffed efforts by Israel's prime minister to arrange a
two-way summit.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat does not object to a meeting with Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, but wants assurances that it will produce results, said a
senior Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Israel wants to arrange a meeting as soon as
possible. Barak has little time left to try to conclude a peace
treaty. An increasingly hostile parliament has threatened to topple
him when it reconvenes in a month.
</P>
<P>
   In her phone call, Albright assured Arafat that the United
States is making every effort to break the deadlock in the peace
talks, said Arafat spokesman Nabil Aburdeneh.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said Albright did not refer to a possible
Arafat-Barak meeting in her conversation with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is to present compromise proposals to both
sides. The document was initially expected by this weekend, but
Palestinian officials said it might not be delivered before
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult issue remains the future of Jerusalem,
particularly control over holy shrines. The Palestinians have
rejected several compromise proposals, including awarding
sovereignty over a key site sacred to Muslims and Jews to the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist on full sovereignty in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem, where the major holy sites are located, while
Israel has said it is willing to consider compromise.
</P>
<P>
   One idea has been to sign an agreement on other core issues --
borders of a Palestinian state, the fate of Palestinian refugees --
but postpone discussion of Jerusalem. However, the Palestinians
fear this would give Israel more time to build Jewish neighborhoods
in disputed areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not willing to delay any issue,'' Aburdeneh said.
''Either the agreement is comprehensive or there is no agreement.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Aides Confident on Tape Origin  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign aides to George W. Bush say they are
confident a videotape of the governor preparing to debate didn't
come from one of their own and they are miffed with FBI handling of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is centering on whether someone in the Bush
camp sent it to Al Gore's campaign, a federal law enforcement
official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know who took our materials,'' Bush communications
director Karen Hughes said Saturday. ''I'm confident it's not
anyone authorized to have access to those materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is completely inappropriate and wrong for the Justice
Department to play politics by leaking information in the midst of
a presidential campaign,'' Hughes added. ''The only people
interested in helping Al Gore prepare for a debate are people who
support Al Gore, not people who support Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The official refused to divulge the name of the person
tentatively identified but said the early evidence appeared so far
to point to someone in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who had access to the sessions and the tapes, Hughes said
only herself, campaign chairman Don Evans, campaign manager Joe
Allbaugh, chief strategy adviser Karl Rove, media consultant Mark
McKinnon and issues adviser Josh Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   The incident created obvious tensions within the Bush
organization at time when it is struggling to keep from being
knocked off message and working to stem Gore's advance in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The notion the FBI had a suspect within the Bush camp, in
particular, rattled many in the campaign and gave rise to
heightened speculation about who might have done it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was said to be curious, but not overly concerned, and did
not believe that any members of his inner circle were directly
involved.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he joked to several associates that he
wondered if anyone at the campaign headquarters was ''sweating
bullets,'' sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides did not rule out the possibility of theft, suggesting
a junior staffer might have somehow gotten his or her hands on a
copy or that someone who may have had access to the Bush campaign's
ad production company might have taken it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, a package arrived at the Washington office of
former Rep. Thomas Downey, who has been helping Gore prepare for
upcoming debates. The package had a postmark of Austin, Texas --
where the Bush campaign is based -- but Downey didn't recognize the
sender's name.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic sources said at the time that Downey told associates
he saw Republican Bush in what appeared to be a mock debate with
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who is serving as Gore's stand-in during
Bush debate preparations. The package also contained documents.
</P>
<P>
   Downey's attorney turned the materials over to the FBI, which
began a preliminary inquiry to see, among other things, whether
there was any evidence that federal law had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The early FBI inquiry produced the tentative identification, but
investigators do not believe it is solidly confirmed yet, and are
conducting more tests on the material and continuing the
investigation, said the law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Hughes said any suggestion the FBI has a
suspect within the Bush campaign is contrary to what campaign
officials were told as recently as Friday night by FBI field agents
in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The agents ''told our campaign manager it would be premature to
draw any conclusions about who provided videotape and debate
information to the Al Gore campaign,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   She said campaign manager Allbaugh would call FBI Director Louis
Freeh ''to complain that if they have identified who took it,
Governor Bush would like to know.'' A Bush aide speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Allbaugh also would ask how the FBI
could have identified who took the tape if they hadn't interviewed
everyone with access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh was called by a Freeh lieutenant Saturday, the aide
said, but was not satisfied with his explanation and still wants a
call from Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials did not return calls seeking comment Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Republican campaign officials said late Saturday that two FBI
officials made the rounds of Austin campaign headquarters on Friday
talking to various people, but that none were there on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have been interviewed so far, the officials
said, were Hughes, Evans, Allbaugh, Bolton and McKinnon. The
highest ranking official not yet interviewed by the FBI was Rove,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the unsolved mystery led to suspension of a
low-level staffer at Gore headquarters in Nashville, Tenn.,
communications director Mark Fabiani confirmed on Saturday. The
junior staffer admitted to joking -- ''not based on any actual
fact,'' he swore in an affidavit -- with a former fraternity brother
about knowing ''a mole'' in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We conducted an internal review and found no evidence the
campaign has either received or used confidential information from
the Bush campaign,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   The purloined tape seems to be from a session conductes during
the Democratic convention, Hughes said. It was made at Bush's ranch
in Crawford, Texas, she said, noting that ''very few (copies of the
tape) were made.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Justice Department officials are still trying to
determine if a federal statute has been violated or if it points to
a state violation such as simple theft.

Polls Show Tight Presidential Race
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush are locked in a close race in a
national tracking poll out today and several states thought to be swinging
Gore's direction reflected an overall tightening of the race. The CNN-USA
Today-Gallup tracking poll had Gore at 48 percent and Bush at 45 percent, within
the poll's 4 percentage point error margin. A Newsweek poll also showed the race
within the margins, at 47 percent for Gore to 45 percent for Bush. Gore had been
up 10 points in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll earlier in the week and
was up by 8 points in the last Newsweek poll, both among likely voters.

Iraq Flights Challenge U.N. Sanctions

   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi officials welcomed a Russian plane Saturday --
the second aircraft to land in two days without U.N. clearance -- as evidence
that the United Nations' 10-year-old trade sanctions were collapsing despite
U.S. and British objections. The Tupolev-154 carrying five tons of medical
supplies and 143 passengers, most of them businessmen, landed in Baghdad after
having informed the U.N. sanctions committee in New York of its destination but
not waiting for authorization. A French plane had arrived Friday carrying
doctors, artists and athletes opposed to the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Yasser
Arafat on Saturday, a day after the Palestinian leader rebuffed efforts by
Israel's prime minister to arrange a two-way summit. Arafat does not object to a
meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, but wants assurances that it will
produce results, said a senior Palestinian official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The official said Israel wants to arrange a meeting as soon as
possible. Barak has little time left to try to conclude a peace treaty. In her
phone call, Albright assured Arafat that the United States is making every

president's appearance helped raise $400,000 at the Democratic National

<HEADLINE> Rains in India Kill More Than 200  </HEADLINE>
By CHANDRA BANERJEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Torrential rains and floods in eastern
India have killed at least 210 people in the last six days and have
left nearly 15 million stranded, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal state, called the
situation ''quite grave,'' and said efforts would now focus on
rescuing those stranded by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said at least 210 people had died. The
government could confirm only 148 deaths in West Bengal because it
was still verifying reports from other districts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of deaths occurred when the victims were swept away in the
swirling flood waters. Others died when their mud and thatch homes
collapsed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters dropped food packets and pouches of drinking water
in the worst affected areas. Soldiers were using boats to ferry
people who had been left stranded on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   The floods swept away roads and railway tracks in many places,
cutting off the flooded areas from the rest of the state and
further hampering rescue work. Hundreds of trucks carrying food and
supplies to the northeastern region were trapped en route.
</P>
<P>
   Food shortages were reported from different districts and people
displaced by the floods were clamoring for plastic sheets to build
temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Berhampore district, police opened fire to disperse mobs
that were looting relief material, the United News of India news
agency reported. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The flood situation was further aggravated when the government
Friday ordered the release of water from two dams following a sharp
rise in the water level in the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Murshidabad district, 720 miles southeast of
New Delhi, swirling flood waters were flowing about 15 feet high,
washing away thousands of mud huts and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The flood situation was expected to worsen as weather
forecasters predicted heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours in
parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring state of Bihar, where some areas have been
flooded, swollen rivers swept away a half mile stretch of railway
track in the east.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, which neighbors India in the east, rains washed
out mud embankments, swamped 50 villages and marooned up to 250,000
people in the north, relief officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three children and two women drowned in swirling flood waters
Thursday and Friday in hardest-hit Rajshahi district, 145 miles
northwest of Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, Yasin Ali, a relief
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 people were left homeless after their mud and
straw huts either collapsed or were washed away by flood waters,
Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   The rain-swollen Padma and the Mahananda rivers burst their
banks this week and washed out parts of flood protection
embankments in Rajshahi and neighboring Chapainawabganj districts.

<HEADLINE> Mob Violence Breaks Out In Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAY BARTOLOME DE LAS CASAS, Guatemala (AP) -- A mob of villagers
that stormed a police station held two officers for hours until one
escaped and the other was freed, ending a rampage that residents
blamed Saturday on police mistreatment of Mayan Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out in Fray Bartolome de las Casas, 95 miles
northwest of Guatemala City, after a police truck ran over a woman
here Friday, injuring her leg.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 angry villagers stormed the police station and took
two police chiefs hostage. The mob ignited a huge bonfire, burning
motorcycles, typewriters and chairs looted from the station, and
threatened to throw their hostages in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hostages, Obidio Escobar, was tied to a wall in a
jail cell with a mob of locals standing guard outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw some of my friends planning to join the mob,'' said
Escobar, chief of police for this steamy mountain town of 33,000.
''I just had to wait until they were given the chance to stand
guard'' in order to escape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Escobar's escape late Friday, police officers talked the
rest of the mob into releasing the group's second hostage, officer
Marcelino Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this largely Indian town said Saturday that police
insensitivity toward Mayan Indians motivated the confrontation. The
spark came, villagers said, when police showed indifference after
the car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opinions they have of us Indians are drastic,'' said
Andres Ayu, a first grade teacher in a nearby hamlet. ''This time
they tried to cover up evidence and dismiss a crime against us.
They got a surprise when we arrived at the station to really show
our feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lack of respect for the police, it's that and nothing
else,'' Alfred Ku, a local shop owner, said of the incident. ''But
how can people respect a police force that fails to respect them?''
</P>
<P>
   Escobar did not comment on charges by villagers that police
ignored the injured woman. ''One of our cars ran into a vendor's
stall and ran over a woman. I don't have details of what
happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work with people. We try to bring them the law and teach it
to them. But it's difficult. They insist on taking the law into
their hown hands,'' Alfredo Anton, deputy commissioner of the
National Civil Police, said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia: Drug Fight To Go Forward  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Possible lengthy delays in the delivery
of 18 U.S.-built combat helicopters will not restrict Colombia's
fight against cocaine production, the nation's top military
commander said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials warned Thursday in Washington
that Colombia may have to wait at least until 2002 to receive the
Black Hawk helicopters that are an essential part of a $1.3 billion
U.S. anti-drug aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also warned they might not have enough money to buy
all of the Black Hawks included in the recently approved plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers said such delays would cripple operations
to wrest control of Colombian coca fields guarded by heavily armed
guerillas and right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials had expected to begin receiving the
helicopters by the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But armed forces chief Gen. Fernando Tapias said the U.S.-backed
anti-drug offensive would go forward as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Black Hawks arrive, the military will use ''the means
that we have,'' Tapias told reporters Friday at the Tolemaida army
base south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian military already has 18 U.S.-built UH-1N ''Huey''
helicopters which U.S. officials say can be used in the interim.
The more expensive Black Hawks are faster, higher-flying, and able
to carry more troops.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters are needed to transport U.S.-trained
counter-narcotics troops into coca-producing areas and provide
armed escort for airplanes that spray the drug crops with deadly
herbicides. Guerrillas often fire on the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. special forces troops have already trained one 1,000-man
army anti-drug battalion deployed in southern Colombia, and are
currently training another battalion.
</P>
<P>
   While Tapias downplayed the effects of a helicopter delay, a
prominent congressman warned it would severely hamper counter-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first people harmed will be the people in the United
States, since the drug routes would be maintained intact and in
permanent action,'' lawmaker Manuel Velazquez told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The aid from Washington responds to a boom in cocaine and heroin
production and trafficking from the South American country that
produces an estimated 90 percent of the world's cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Oil Reserve Tap  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing global worries about the economic
impact of high oil prices, President Clinton said Saturday that
tapping the U.S. emergency oil reserve was ''plainly the prudent
thing to do.'' He denied he was motivated by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families shouldn't have to drain their wallets to drive their
cars or heat their homes,'' he said at the White House before
leaving on a trip to California.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he acted to cushion Americans against a likely
sharp jump in heating costs this winter because of tight supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The government will start taking bids Monday for 30 million
barrels of oil -- about 5 percent of the 571 million barrel reserve
-- for delivery in November.
</P>
<P>
   Although the price has moderated in recent days, crude oil
remains above $34 a barrel. High prices have led to demonstrations
in France and England and unease in the United States, where gas
stations charged more than $2 a gallon in some areas this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Rising energy costs are becoming an issue in the presidential
campaign as winter bills are expected to be as much as 50 percent
higher than 1999's.
</P>
<P>
   Despite incremental production increases by the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Counties, worldwide supplies remain
extremely tight, largely because of a strong U.S. economy and a
quicker than expected economic rebound in Asia, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cited energy costs as one reason for Europe's
currency problem that on Friday prompted a dramatic attempt to prop
up the euro. A meeting of the world's top finance ministers, which
began Saturday in the Czech Republic, has taken on additional
urgency because of concern that oil prices could hamstring the
world economy if not contained.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in private discussions with
other ministers Saturday, explained Clinton's use of the emergency
oil reserve. More broadly, he characterized the high cost of oil
''the biggest cloud in the relatively blue sky'' of a fundamentally
sound global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers, in a communique, welcomed the U.S. decision to
use the oil to deal with what Japan's minister, Kiichi Miyazawa,
said was ''the most serious problem'' facing the ministers'
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the U.S. action to release a limited quantity of
it's oil reserves in the form of swap transactions,'' the
Communique said in a brief section on energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials quickly cited the endorsement as evidence
that the oil release was not viewed around the world as a political
decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president dismissed suggestions by
Republicans -- including George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore's
GOP rival for the White House -- that tapping the reserve would not
in the national interest or that he was acting to aid Gore's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's plainly the prudent thing to do. ... This is the right
thing to do. It's good energy policy. It's good national security
policy and good family policy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Republican-controlled Congress had ''chopped,
blocked and ignored'' administration proposals aimed at promoting
energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a House GOP leader, Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, said
the administration ''has done nothing over the past seven and a
half years to put in place a comprehensive energy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Florida, Bush said Saturday that Gore is using
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ''as if it's the strategic
political reserve.'' Gore on Thursday proposed tapping the reserve;
Clinton's announcement came Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government oil is to be released as part of a ''swap'' that
will require recipients of the crude to return a like amount of oil
-- plus a negotiated ''premium'' amount -- next year when prices are
expected to be lower. First deliveries are expected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced that states will share $400 million ''to
help families that can least bear the burden of high energy
prices'' He said it was the largest such release ever of low-income
energy assistance funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's top economic adviser, said that despite
reservations in the spring about using the reserve, all of the
president's economic advisers supported his decision.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sperling said, ''We felt there was a serious enough
risk of a supply shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others were uncertain about the impact of the
drawdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down the line it could help some. It won't help instantly,''
said Wilfrid L. Kohl of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies. But he said a ''perception'' often plays a
role in dictating future oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices will fall, but the effect will be temporary,'' said
Venezuela oil minister Ali Rodriquez, the current OPEC president.
</P>
<P>
   Some energy experts said the action shows the administration may
intervene again if oil prices do not decline. Others raised the
possibility that OPEC might retaliate by holding back production.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the closest U.S. ally among OPEC members,
criticized Clinton's decision, but U.S. officials said the Saudis
had assured them they were not too upset. Saudi Arabia has said oil
prices are too high and should be in the $25 to $28 a barrel range.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time since the emergency reserve was
created after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that oil has been
ordered taken to deal with supply problems. The other was in 1991
when 21 million barrels was drawn just before and during the
Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Former Tigers Player Rodriguez Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Aurelio Rodriguez, a model of consistency at
third base for the Detroit Tigers during the 1970s, died Saturday
after being hit by a car on the city's southwest side. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was walking with an unidentified woman about 2 p.m.
when the car apparently jumped a sidewalk and struck them before
hitting a utility pole, police Sgt. Michael Matuzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had to be pulled from beneath the vehicle and was
pronounced dead at Henry Ford Hospital. The other pedestrian and
the female motorist were hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked and saddened to have lost one of our own, and
our thoughts and prayers go out to his family,'' Tigers spokesman
Tyler Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a native of Cananea Sonora, Mexico, broke into the
major leagues with the California Angels in 1967. He was traded to
the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season.
</P>
<P>
   In what longtime Detroit general manager Jim Campbell called his
biggest trade, Rodriguez went to Detroit along with shortstop Ed
Brinkman and pitchers Joe Coleman and Jim Hannan in October 1970
for pitcher Denny McLain, third baseman Don Wert and outfielders
Elliott Maddox and Norm McRae.
</P>
<P>
   McLain had won 31 games and the AL Cy Young and Most Valuable
Player awards for Detroit's 1968 world champions, and shared the
1969 Cy Young Award with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1970 McLain had worn out his welcome in Detroit,
following injuries and suspensions for consorting with bookmakers,
carrying a handgun on the team plane and dumping a bucket of ice
water on two sports writers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez played in at least 128 games in seven of his nine
years in Detroit, and won a Gold Glove award in 1975. His last
season as a Tiger was 1979, Sparky Anderson's first as manager. By
1992, Anderson had used at least 43 players at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for manager Billy Martin's 1972 East Division champions,
Rodriguez went hitless in 16 at-bats in Detroit's playoff loss to
Oakland. Playing for the New York Yankees in the 1981 World Series,
however, he hit .417 (5-for-12).
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez' big-league career with seven teams ended in 1983. He
finished with a .237 average with 124 home runs and 648 RBIs in
2,017 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez played in the Mexican League as late as 1987 and
coached in the Cleveland Indians' minor league organization in
1988. He returned to the Mexican League as a manager in the
mid-1990s.

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Kills 44 Yemenis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Rift Valley fever has killed 44 people in
north Yemen during the past 48 hours, bringing death toll from the
mosquito-borne virus to 122 in only a matter of days, a Health
Ministry official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The official said 23 people died in Wadi Mour and another 21 in
the adjoining northern region of Hajjah.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted from livestock to humans by mosquitoes
and causes diarrhea, nausea, and internal bleeding that can result
in death.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Saudi Arabia has reported 16 deaths from Rift Valley
Fever in its southern region near the Yemeni border over the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the San'a government's request, Saudi aircraft sprayed the
affected areas in Yemen this week with anti-mosquito insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, which lies north of Saudi Arabia, is currently
fumigating against mosquitoes in towns and villages and at cattle
farms, slaughterhouses and waste dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian health officials say neither Rift Valley nor West Nile
fever have been reported in the kingdom, but 13 people have died in
neighboring Israel of the West Nile disease, a similar
mosquito-borne virus.

Polls: Gore, Bush in Dead Heat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush are locked in a close race in a
national tracking poll out today and several states thought to be swinging
Gore's direction reflected an overall tightening of the race. The CNN-USA
Today-Gallup tracking poll had Gore at 48 percent and Bush at 45 percent, within
the poll's 4 percentage point error margin. A Newsweek poll also showed the race
within the margins, at 47 percent for Gore to 45 percent for Bush. Gore had been
up 10 points in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking poll earlier in the week and
was up by 8 points in the last Newsweek poll, both among likely voters.

<HEADLINE> Man Sues Prescription Drug Maker  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN WITTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A man acquitted of killing his infant
daughter after taking a prescription drug that he says put him in a
psychotic state is suing the drug's maker to recover medical, legal
and funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Ehlis, 26, of Grand Forks, had been taking Adderall,
designed to improve mental concentration, when he shot 5-day-old
Tyra on Jan. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists testified in court and the judge agreed that Ehlis
lacked the capacity to understand what he was doing because of the
drug. Its label warns that in very rare circumstances, it can cause
''psychotic episodes at recommended doses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlis said that through the lawsuit he hopes to bring more
attention to the danger of some prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think more needs to be known about these drugs in general,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in federal court, asks drug maker
Shire Richwood Inc., of Florence, Ky., for more than $100,000 in
damages, said Ehlis' attorney, Andy Vickery.
</P>
<P>
   Shire Richwood spokesman Stefan Antonsson declined comment on
the lawsuit, but said: ''We are deeply saddened by the tragedy that
took place in North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say Adderall remains
a safe and effective drug for controlling Attention
Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlis, diagnosed with ADHD as a child, was a student at the
University of North Dakota when he started taking Adderall in
January 1999 to help him manage the disorder. Weeks later, he
fatally wounded his newborn, then shot himself in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is to be prescribed under close medical supervision.
But Ehlis did not seek medical attention at the time of the
killing, apparently because he did not realize he was having a
psychotic event, Vickery said.

<HEADLINE> Mortar Rounds Found on Mass. Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. (AP) -- Contractors digging a well at a polluted
military base on Cape Cod unearthed more than 225 mortar shells and
rounds less than half a mile from an elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of them are fused, so there is no potential for any of
them to blow,'' said Jason Alves, of the Massachusetts Military
Reservation's Impact Area Groundwater Study Office, which is
directing the well's installation. ''They were likely used for some
kind of training, but we just don't know what kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Lubber, regional chief of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said it was unacceptable for so many shells to be discover
by accident so close to residential communities.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Friday dug up 200 60 mm and eight 81 mm mortar
shells, and found 20 60 mm mortar rounds. Three weeks ago, they
uncovered a large Vietnam-era bomb, and Alves said there could be
hundreds more mortars in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The munitions will be destroyed in a controlled environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This type of disposal was at best irresponsible from a public
safety and public health perspective,'' Lubber said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent discovery is the largest cache of undetonated
explosives found at the 20,000-acre base, declared one of
Massachusetts' worst hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is significant; we didn't expect to find this,'' said
Colonel Richard Freeman who is in charge of the military's joint
program office for the cleanup. ''Unfortunately, it's more of the
same. It's something that shouldn't have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The base has been used as a firing range since 1911.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio appear to have reached tentative settlement in soft money Senate pact </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton tweaked an earlier
proposal to ban soft money advertising from the Senate race on
Saturday, and rival Rep. Rick Lazio responded to the new offer of
financial disarmament with a tentative ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that we have an agreement, based on what I am
hearing what Mrs. Clinton said,'' Lazio said a few hours after
Clinton explained her plan to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign responded by saying that because Lazio had
agreed to abide by the soft money ad deal that Clinton offered at
an event Saturday morning, it appeared that a verbal agreement,
brokered through the media, was in place.
</P>
<P>
   The public back-and-forth - the two sides spoke at news
conferences, not around a negotiating table - appeared to mirror
Friday's ups and downs, when Lazio trumpeted a deal and the first
lady's campaign said no agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, Clinton said the Democratic party had agreed
to stop running ads on her behalf if Republicans promised to cease
paying for commercials boosting Lazio. She said she would also urge
independent groups who support her to refrain from running radio
and television commercials and asked that Lazio do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had secured promises from Republicans in New York
and Washington to stop spending money on ads for him. He said he
hoped soft money ads would be off the air by Monday, although
Clinton said the Democrats would stop running their commercials on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident she has the will to do the right thing,'' Lazio
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement appeared to cover spending by political
parties, but not by outside organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns had argued Friday over whether those outside
groups - like the AFL-CIO for her and the American Conservative
Union for him - should be forbidden from running ads for either
candidate. Clinton asked Lazio to have groups supporting him
promise to stay out of the race, but then said she had no control
over what organizations on her side might do.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she offered a new proposal that she said would bind
only entities connected to the Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least we can have a core agreement that the parties will
not engage in soft money advertising,'' she said. ''I think that's
a very good start. ... If there was a misunderstanding, let's get
beyond it.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, accuse the outside groups on Lazio's side of
being purely political entities that existed specifically to boost
Republican candidates, while she said those supporting her cause
were long-standing organizations formed to advocate certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said representatives of the state Democratic party, the
Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee had agreed to refrain from paying for
pro-Clinton commercials if their Republican counterparts stopped
running ads for Lazio. Her supporters in the Liberal and Working
Families parties made the same promise, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had gotten an oral commitment from the Republican
Senate Campaign Committee and written commitments from the state
Republican and Conservative parties to stop spending soft money on
his behalf. He did not mention the Republican National Committee,
but an RNC spokesman said the committee would do whatever Lazio
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lazio both emphasized that any agreement would cover
only soft money spending for radio and TV commercials, not direct
mail or get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's focus on what we know we can hear and see,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had extended his original 5 p.m. Saturday deadline for a
deal to Monday, saying he still wanted to see the two campaigns
come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money refers to the unlimited funds collected by political
parties. While hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor, can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate, soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a candidate or attack a candidate, rather than directly advocating
voting one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign has already raised millions of dollars in
soft money; Lazio's campaign does not have its own soft-money
account but has benefited from soft-money spending by outside
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Should soft money be banned, Lazio could have an advantage
because the latest federal filings showed his campaign had more
hard money than hers - $10.2 million to $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded she'd be hurt by a soft money ban, and said
she'd have to step up her hard-money fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to have to add more fund-raisers, I'm going to have
to carve out the time to make more calls, but I'm willing to do
that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Write on Impeachment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday he has
read books about his presidency and impeachment, but has no
interest in contributing to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   After a fund-raiser, Clinton stopped at a book shop in the
Willow Glen section of San Jose and invited reporters inside with
him to look around.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged reading a few books about his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the impeachment ordeal that
followed. Yet he wasn't tempted to buy Peter Baker's ''The
Breach,'' a new book about the scandal that was on a table of newly
released hardbacks in the front of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he plans to write his own account of the scandal
after he leaves the White House, Clinton replied: ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to think about other things when I get out,'' he
said. ''I've thought about it enough already.''

By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton
appeared to have reached a deal late Saturday banning the use of
soft money advertising from the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the two sides have come to a close enough point that
we effectively have a deal,'' said Clinton's campaign manager, Bill
de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio told reporters that ''it appears that we have an
agreement, based on what I am hearing what Mrs. Clinton said,''
referring to the soft money ad deal Clinton had offered at an event
early Saturday.
</P>

hoped soft money ads would be off the air by Monday, although

</P>
<P>
   Any violation of the agreement would result in a proportionate
response- if a group on one side released a $100,000 ad the other
side could respond with a $100,000 ad of their own, de Blasio said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Wants To Ratify Crimes Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Spanish judge who sought the
extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet called
Saturday for nations to ratify a treaty creating the world's first
permanent war crimes court and criticized the United States for
opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   National sovereignty does not apply to crimes against humanity
because ''the victim could be anywhere ... and such crimes could
have been committed in several countries,'' Baltasar Garzon told
the First World Congress of Public Prosecutors in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ''In such cases, the principle of universal justice must be
applied,'' Garzon added. ''It is important to emphasize that the
International Criminal Court will not try countries, but
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said crimes against humanity could include genocide, torture,
terrorism, drug trafficking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries meeting in Rome in June 1998 approved a statute
creating the International Criminal Court, which would have
jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 countries must ratify the statute before the treaty
can enter into force. So far, 19 countries have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon criticized the United States for assuming ''contradictory
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States government wanted to establish an
international tribunal to try crimes committed by Iraq during the
Gulf War,'' Garzon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet, it is fiercely opposed to the creation of the
International Criminal Court.'' Other opponents include China and
Israel, Garzon said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials felt the treaty yielded too much
prosecutorial power to the new court, leaving U.S. troops and
citizens vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions. In
subsequent negotiations, Washington has tried to negotiate an
exemption for Americans to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon gained international renown for his investigations into
human rights abuses under the former military dictatorships of
Chile and Argentina. He has brought charges against officials for
the deaths of Spaniards in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one believed that atrocities committed during World War II
would ever again be repeated,'' Garzon said. ''Yet over the past 50
years they have emerged in Tibet, Cambodia, Indonesia, Latin
America, Europe and Africa and so far only two ad hoc tribunals
were created to try crimes committed in Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.''

officials warned Thursday in Washington that Colombia may have to wait at least
until 2002 to receive the Black Hawk helicopters that are an essential part of a
$1.3 billion U.S. anti-drug aid package. Officials also warned they might not
have enough money to buy all of the Black Hawks included in the recently
approved plan.

Clinton: Oil Tap Cushions Price Hike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing global worries about the economic impact of
high oil prices, President Clinton said today that tapping the U.S. emergency
oil reserve was ''plainly the prudent thing to do.'' Clinton said he acted to
cushion Americans against a likely sharp jump in heating costs this winter
because of tight supplies. Clinton dismissed suggestions by Republicans --
including George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore's GOP rival for the White House
-- that tapping the reserve would not in the national interest or that he was
acting to aid Gore's candidacy.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said today he has read books about

section of San Jose and invited reporters inside with him to look around. He
acknowledged reading a few books about his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and the impeachment ordeal that followed.

<HEADLINE> 45 Iraqis Come To U.S. From Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Forty-five Iraqi Christians have been bused
from Mexico to the United States, where they applied for political
asylum after they and more than 80 others were detained in a shabby
Tijuana hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five others were expected to arrive from the hotel in
Mexico later Saturday for interviews with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Including those who had tried to walk across the border, the INS
reported Saturday afternoon it was processing 124 Iraqis, including
42 children, who were seeking asylum. Sixteen had been released by
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't describe our feelings right now, we are so happy,''
said Wally Sako, a relative of one of Iraqi Christians, known as
Chaldeans.
</P>
<P>
   The group had gathered in Tijuana, just across the border from
San Diego, home to the second-largest community of Chaldeans in the
United States after Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   They said they feared religious persecution if they returned to
their homeland and hoped to live in the United States instead.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities agreed to release all 133 Chaldeans held
there to the United States, though it wasn't immediately clear how
soon the others would be freed. A 15-year-old American boy of Iraqi
descent who was among nine people arrested at the hotel after they
were suspected of violating immigration laws was released from jail
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The situation would most likely be resolved over the next few
days after intense negotiations between authorities from both
countries, Jose Angel Pescador, Mexico's undersecretary for
population and migration services, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no interest in returning them to their country of
origin,'' he said after meeting with the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials had offered them the opportunity to apply for
political asylum there, but Duraed Gabriel, one of the Iraqis who
has spent three months in the hotel, said they had no intention of
remaining in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to insist that we go the United States because we
have relatives there,'' he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   One 25-year-old Iraqi interviewed at the Tijuana hotel Saturday
said he had been waiting there to get into the United States for
two months. He declined to give his name out of fear for his family
in Iraq. The man said he left his country because his life was in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   He said he drove across the Iraqi border to Turkey and flew from
Istanbul to Mexico City in a trip arranged by a smuggler, costing
the Iraqi $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will build my future there,'' he said of his plans to live
in San Diego or Detroit. ''I am very, very (glad the) United States
will accept us. We are all very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight people still in jail in Mexico were expected to appear
before a judge in the next 48 hours on charges of violating Mexican
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Four of them are Iraqi Americans who were living at the hotel
and assisting the Chaldeans in applying for asylum. None of the
people arrested had adequate explanations when asked what they were
doing in a hotel with so many undocumented immigrants, Pescador
said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of their alleged crimes were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested was Raymond Barno, said his brother Gabe
Barno, who was outside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Barno used to work in a U.S. immigration office in Port
Huron, Mich., and had been assisting the Chaldeans with their
asylum applications, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't done anything illegal and he never thought of doing
anything illegal,'' said Gabe Barno, an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three days, at least 72 Iraqis have been detained
by U.S. authorities after they tried to enter the United States at
the world's busiest port of entry without visas.
</P>
<P>
   Two women and a child were released on humanitarian grounds,
said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Carl Rowan Dies  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carl Thomas Rowan, a well-known commentator
once called America's ''most visible black journalist'' for his
eloquent columns exploring race relations and championing civil
rights, died Saturday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan died of natural causes at a Washington hospital, said his
son, Carl Rowan Jr. His father had suffered from a variety of
illnesses in recent years, including diabetes and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though he was feeling sick, he said he had to go in and
do the column,'' Rowan Jr., a lawyer, said about his father's final
column last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carl provided one of journalism's most distinctive voices,''
said Jonathan Wolman, executive editor of The Associated Press, who
knew the columnist for many years in Washington. ''He was a
pioneering reporter who crossed into government and then into
commentary, always speaking his mind, usually poking away at the
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Allen H. Neuharth, founder of USA Today and the Freedom
Forum, a nonpartisan foundation that advocates speech and press
freedom: ''Carl Rowan was a poor, black country kid from Tennessee,
who said 'no' to the status quo there, across the USA, and around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowan was a Freedom Forum trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan's career spanned more than half a century. Besides his
columns, he was a frequent guest on public affairs radio and
television programs and served in the administrations of Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''First I see myself simply as a newspaper man and
commentator,'' Rowan told one interviewer. ''I inform people and
expose them to a point of view they wouldn't get. I work against
the racial mindset of most of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1925 in Ravenscroft, Tenn., a dying coal mining town,
Rowan in his autobiography told of growing up with ''no
electricity, no running water, no toothbrushes ... no telephone, no
radio and no regular inflow of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he excelled in school and graduated in 1947 from Oberlin
College in Ohio. He entered journalism after a stint as one of the
Navy's first black commissioned officers. He worked as a copy
editor at the Minneapolis Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington Post profile, Rowan was called ''the most
visible black journalist in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His reporting on race relations led Kennedy to appoint him a
deputy assistant secretary of state. Before returning to
journalism, he also served as ambassador to Finland in the Kennedy
administration, and as director of the U.S. Information Agency
under Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was for black journalists among the very pioneers in the
business,'' said Washington Post columnist William Raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   David Gergen, editor at large of U.S. News &AMP; World Report
magazine and like Rowan a frequent television commentator, called
Rowan ''a breakthrough American. He not only broke barriers as a
public servant but did the same thing in journalism. ... He had a
bite to his journalism that attracted people far beyond the black
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Carl Rowan was known primarily as a perceptive newspaper
columnist, but he was also great company,'' said syndicated
columnist and TV commentator Jack Germond. ''He was a frustrated
song and dance man whose company we all enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   He displayed his sense of humor a year ago during the Gridiron
Club's annual dinner, where journalists lampoon the president and
politicians. Rowan donned a blond wig to drag out a portrayal of
Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who secretly recorded
conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could always count on him doing something outrageous. He's
worn his share of dresses,'' Raspberry joked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high profile in the nation's capital and accolades
during his distinguished career, Rowan never forgot his humble
childhood, his son said. After reading about a local high school
where black students were embarrassed to stand as their names were
called for an honor roll ceremony, Rowan created Project Excellence
to help and encourage black youth to finish school and go on to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan, who advocated strict handgun control, was arrested and
charged in 1988 with using an unregistered weapon to wound a
teen-ager who intruded into his backyard. He argued that he had the
right to use whatever means necessary to protect himself and his
family. A mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan also is survived by his wife of 50 years, Vivien; son
Jeffrey, a clinical psychologist; daughter, Barbara, a former
journalist; and four grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Child Critically Injured at Disney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy was in critical
condition Saturday after he became pinned beneath a car on
Disneyland's Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin ride, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics arrived at the theme park late Friday to find the
Southern California boy underneath a vehicle, said Cynthia Harriss,
president of Disneyland Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''There appeared to be no malfunction of the ride or the safety
mechanism,'' said police Lt. Joe Vargas. ''How he got from the car
to the ground is something they'll have to determine.''
</P>
<P>
   California Occupational Safety and Health Administration also
was investigating, Harriss said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the boy's injuries and his name were withheld by his
parents, said nursing supervisor Jean Necas at University of
California, Irvine Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Car Toon Spin is a slow-moving, 5-minute ride in which
passengers take a cab through a cartoon world.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a 13-year-old girl was injured on the same ride when
she got off to retrieve a stuffed toy and her foot became caught in
the rails that the ride's cars travel on. The ride had to be shut
down while paramedics freed her.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Missing from Cruise Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) -- The Coast Guard was searching Saturday
for an elderly cruise ship passenger who may have fallen overboard.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the cruise ship Dawn Princess, owned by
London-based Princess Cruises, alerted the Coast Guard early
Saturday that a 73-year-old woman from Michigan hadn't been seen
since Friday afternoon and could have fallen over the cruise boat's
railing.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard sent two boats and a helicopter to retrace the
cruise ship's path along a 225 mile stretch of water between Juneau
and Ketchikan that is filed with islands, inlets and straights,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Roger Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   The air temperature Saturday was in the 50s, but the Wetherell
said a person wouldn't survive long in the cold water. Heavy fog
was hampering the search Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dawn Princess left Juneau early Saturday and was on its way
to Ketchikan when an employee assigned to clean the woman's cabin
found her bed had not been slept in. Wetherell said the woman was
traveling alone.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's crew checked the ship's computerized system that
notes each time a passenger or crew member boards or departs the
ship, but found no evidence that the woman had stepped off in
Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Bernard John Warner authorized a physical search of the
ship, and the Dawn Princess' intercom was used several times to
call for her.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was docked in Ketchikan on Saturday afternoon.

Finance Ministers Rule Out Oil Tax Cut

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The world's richest nations signaled Saturday
they would intervene again in foreign exchange markets if necessary to help
Europe's ailing currency -- but they ruled out the idea of pushing oil prices

bolster the euro, which fell this week to record lows against the U.S. dollar,
the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries said they would keep an eye on

the poll's 4 percentage point error margin. A Newsweek poll also showed the race
within the margins, at 47 percent for Gore to 45 percent for Bush. Gore had been

<HEADLINE> Man Opens Fire in Gay Bar, Kills 1  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- A man who said he wanted to shoot gay people
and asked the way to the nearest gay bar later opened fire there,
killing one person and wounding six others, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman walked into the Backstreet Cafe late Friday, ordered
a beer and after a few minutes pulled a handgun from his coat and
began firing, said police spokeswoman Shelly Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 25 people in the bar were wounded, one critically.
Danny Lee Overstreet, 43, died at the scene in what police were
investigating as a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like firecrackers at first,'' said a woman who said
she was sitting in a booth when the shooting began. She asked not
to be identified for fear she might lose her job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked up and saw people falling to the ground,'' she said.
''You could feel the wind off the bullets, they were so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Edward Gay, 53, was charged with murder in connection
with the shootings and was being held without bail Saturday.
Additional charges were expected, Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Gay had been in a different bar Friday and had asked
patrons there where the city's nearest gay bar was, telling
witnesses he wanted to shoot some gay people.
</P>
<P>
   One person gave the man directions and then called police, who
arrived at the Backstreet Cafe shortly after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found Gay walking down a street about two blocks from
the Backstreet Cafe and arrested him, Alley said. She said police
found a 9 mm pistol in a trash can near the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came one week after members of Roanoke's gay and
lesbian community held a gay pride festival.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force came to Roanoke for a candlelight vigil Saturday night.
Outside the Backstreet Cafe, flowers, cards and balloons were left
by members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Payne, co-owner of a gay and lesbian book and gift shop a
few blocks from the bar, said there had not been any growing
tension or acts of violence against gays in Roanoke. ''I think this
guy had a problem with his name. He probably got picked on and
picked on as a kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alley said Gay had confirmed the witness reports and admitted
during questioning that he wanted to shoot gay people but gave no
motive.
</P>
<P>
   He was carrying identification listing a home address in Citrus
Springs, Fla., but Alley said he had been living at various Roanoke
addresses for about a year, including a campground and a motel a
few blocks from the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gay is named in a Citrus County warrant accusing him of
trespassing in July and an injunction against domestic violence,
both misdemeanors. He did not have a record in Roanoke, Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet's sister, Darlene Overstreet, said her brother often
visited the Backstreet Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just stopped by to have a beer, that's all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Five other victims of the shooting remained hospitalized
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Book Describes a Manipulative Diana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Despite Buckingham Palace's vehement objections to
the book, a British paper published excerpts Sunday of a new
biography of the late Princess Diana by her most senior adviser
depicting her as manipulative and desperately in need of attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times printed the first installment of its
serialization of ''Shadows of a Princess,'' by Patrick Jephson, who
was employed by Diana between 1987 and 1996 and was her private
secretary through the events leading to her 1992 separation from
Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles issued a rare joint
statement Sept. 15, saying they ''deeply deplored'' publication of
the book and that they feared it would only create more speculation
about the princess and upset her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Jephson insisted his book would be a ''truthful and balanced
account'' intended as a service to the late princess and those who
worked with her.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt in this week's Sunday Times, however, does not do
her any obvious service. Jephson is sometimes snide in his
criticism and takes a psychoanalytical approach to his subject,
describing, for example, what he called ''her pathological craving
for victimhood and self-justification.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says he believes the royal family could have prevented
Diana's calamitous rebellion with some support and encouragement:
''A small handful of sugar lumps would have been enough'' to lead
her to safety, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page article, The Sunday Times also outlines future
installments of the book, which it appears will say more positive
things about the princess, particularly about her relationship with
her sons.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Lloyd Alva Anderson, a resourceful outdoorsman
who founded Recreational Equipment Inc. in his kitchen to improve
equipment options for himself and his friends, died Sept. 13. He
was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his wife Mary founded REI, now a $621
million-a-year business, in 1938, before full-color camping
catalogs and warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   REI's first 23 members contributed $1 each to build group-buying
power. Today, there are 1.7 million REI members and the co-op,
which opened a flashy new flagship store in 1996, now has more than
50 outlets in the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson stepped down as president in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife were inducted into the national Cooperative
Business Association's Hall of Fame in 1993 for their work in
establishing REI.

Joseph A. Ball
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Joseph A. Ball, a respected trial
attorney probably best known for his role on the Warren Commission
that investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,
died Thursday. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Called one of the leading American trial attorneys of his
generation, Ball's career stretched more than a half a century and
included defending such clients as Watergate figure John D.
Ehrlichman, auto maker John DeLorean and Saudi Arabian financier
Adnan Khashoggi.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by Chief Justice Earl Warren, who had known Ball from
California political circles, Ball and another lawyer, David Belin,
were assigned to determine the identity of Kennedy's assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Ball wrote most of the controversial report, which concluded
that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Phillip Glasier
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Phillip Glasier, whose interest in falconry led
him to establish the National Birds of Prey Center in western
England, died Sept. 11. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   He founded the Falconry Center at Newent in Gloucestershire in
1967, and expanded its activities to include all types of birds of
prey. The Center, now run by Jemima Parry-Jones, Glasier's
daughter, has 80 species including hawks, eagles and owls.
</P>
<P>
   Glasier wrote a popular account of hawking, ''As the Falcon Her
Bells,'' in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''Falconry and Hawking,'' published in 1978, traced the history
of hawking and falconry. The book also provided detailed notes on
the breeding, rearing and training of a variety of species.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Hawk in the Hand,'' an autobiography, was published in 1990.

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Aurelio Rodriguez, a model of consistency at
third base for the Detroit Tigers during the 1970s, died Saturday
after being hit by a car on the city's southwest side. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a native of Cananea Sonora, Mexico, broke into the
major leagues with the California Angels in 1967. He was traded to
the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season and to the Detroit
Tigers later that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez played in at least 128 games in seven of his nine
years in Detroit, and won a Gold Glove award in 1975. His last
season as a Tiger was 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez' big-league career with seven teams ended in 1983. He
finished with a .237 average with 124 home runs and 648 RBIs in
2,017 games.

Carl Thomas Rowan
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carl Thomas Rowan, a well-known commentator
once called America's ''most visible black journalist'' for his
eloquent columns exploring race relations and championing civil
rights, died Saturday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan died of natural causes. He had suffered from diabetes and
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan's career spanned more than half a century. Besides his
columns, he was a frequent guest on public affairs radio and
television programs and served in the administrations of Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   His reporting on race relations in the 1950s led Kennedy to
appoint him deputy assistant secretary of state. Before returning
to journalism, he also served as ambassador to Finland in the
Kennedy administration, and as director of the U.S. Information
Agency under Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   His three-times-a-week column was nationally syndicated by King
Features. He was a 1995 Pulitzer Prize finalist for his
commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Rowan was a panelist on ''Inside Washington''
from 1967 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan is survived by his wife, son, daughter and four
grandchildren.

Jack Weir
</P>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Jack Weir, a Presbyterian
Church leader who met with the Irish Republican Army in the 1970s
in a brave but fruitless hope of ending violence, died Sept. 18. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not announced, but Weir had suffered from
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Weir was clerk of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church when he was part of a delegation of Protestant churchmen who
arranged a meeting with leaders of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Violence had raged in Northern Ireland for five years, and the
IRA was then embarking on a bombing campaign in England which
killed dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met Dec. 10, 1974, in Feakle, in the Republic of
Ireland, and had a cordial encounter. The meeting broke up early
when the IRA men were warned that police were on the way.

<HEADLINE> No. 9 S. Cal 34, San Jose St. 24  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Carson Palmer led a late Southern Cal rally
Saturday as the No. 9 Trojans scored three touchdowns in the final
8:07 to beat San Jose State 34-24 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Petros Papadakis bulled 5 yards up the middle for the go-ahead
score with 2:34 remaining as Southern Cal (3-0) came back from a
12-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who completed 22 of 38 for 338 yards and two touchdowns,
threw to Matt Nickels for the 2-point conversion and a three-point
pad over the Spartans (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis added an insurance touchdown -- his third TD of the
game -- on a 3-yard run with 57 seconds left after Chris Cash
intercepted a pass at the Spartans' 30 and returned it to the 21.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Kelly had seven catches for 106 yards for the Trojans,
and Sultan McCullough rushed for 136 yards on 21 carries as
Southern Cal overcame four lost fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' defense held San Jose State tailback Deonce
Whitaker, who entered the game as the nation's third-leading
rusher, to 49 yards on 13 carries, although he did score twice.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Arroyo completed 20 of 41 for 256 yards, and Rashied
Davis had six catches for 121 yards for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal, which had trailed since late in the first half,
stormed back to take the lead with marches of 80 and 67 yards in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spartans' Nick Gilliam missed a 35-yard field goal
early in the fourth, Palmer capped the 80-yard drive with an 8-yard
scoring pass to tight end Antoine Harris, who was wide open across
the middle in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal then took the lead with the 67-yard march that
ended when Papadakis dragged three San Jose State defenders into
the end zone with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had opened their 12-point lead when they scored
twice in the final 5:01 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They went up 24-12 after Chris Tandy sacked Palmer, the Southern
Cal quarterback fumbled and Brandon Miles recovered at the San Jose
State 38. Arroyo hooked up with Davis on a 38-yard pass on the next
play, down to the Southern Cal 24.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-yard completion to Davis put the ball at the Southern Cal
14, then Whitaker scooted up the middle to score on the next play,
46 seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State came back from a 12-10 deficit with a 67-yard
drive to its second touchdown. Arroyo connected with Davis on a
42-yard pass down to the Trojans' 2, then Whitaker scored on a
1-yard run two plays later to give the Spartans a 17-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal had gone in front earlier in the second quarter,
scoring their second touchdown but failing for the second time to
make the PAT kick. Kelly scored on a 61-yard pass from Palmer, then
David Newbury's kick hit the right upright.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-0, the Trojans scored their first touchdown on
Papadakis' 1-yard dive 1:17 into the second quarter, capping an
87-yard march. The snap on the PAT attempt bounced back to the
holder, however, and Newbury was tackled as he tried to get off a
desperation pass.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State turned a blocked punt and a Southern Cal fumble
into 10 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' Casey LeBlanc broke up the middle to block Mike
MacGillivray's punt, and Jamar Julien caught the ball on the hop at
the 10-yard line and scored just 2:28 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans wasted a scoring opportunity later in the first
quarter when Marcus Allmond, who caught a pass from Palmer and was
near the goal line, fumbled into the San Jose State end zone and
Josh Parry recovered for a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo then marched the Spartans 62 yards to a 35-yard field
goal by Gilliam.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State, which beat Stanford 40-27 two weeks earlier, was
a 23-point underdog against Southern Cal.

<HEADLINE> 100-Meter Champ Reflects on Race  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On the day after he won the Olympic
100-meter race, Maurice Greene had a note of wonderment in his
voice as he held the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a lot of pride in it,'' he said. ''It's something that
doesn't come easy. You work four years for something that lasts
nine seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greene's case Saturday night, 9.87 seconds to be precise. The
time was off his world record of 9.79 but plenty good enough to win
and confirm his status as the world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best roller coaster ride I've ever been on,'' the
two-time world champion said Sunday. ''This is the most exciting
time I've ever had. I wish I could express it to you. It's
something I'd love to share. I can't think of any words that would
help you feel what I feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster hit bottom four years ago when Greene failed
to qualify for the Olympics and sat in the stands at Atlanta,
watching the most glamorous race of the games with tears of sadness
streaming down his cheeks. ''I was wishing I was there in the
finals, changing the outcome of the race, getting the United States
a medal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ride completed its full trip Saturday night, with tears
flowing again, this time for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Training partner Ato Bolton, running for Trinidad and Tobago,
finished second, a familiar situation when he runs against his
friend. ''I told Ato last night I couldn't have done this without
him,'' Greene said. ''Ato brought me to where I am. We're so hard
on each other. I help him and he helps me to places we couldn't
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton was the only one of the eight starters in the 100 at
Atlanta who made it back for the race at Sydney. Now he prepares
for the 200, a race in which Greene and world record holder Michael
Johnson pulled up with injuries in the U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I could play the role of spoiler in the 100,'' Bolton
said. ''I was going to have to run a personal best to beat him. I'm
more confident at 200, the way Maurice is running the 100.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt for Maurice (being injured in the 200 trials). I knew
how bad he wanted to beat Michael. That's the way it goes. Does it
make my job easier? You betcha.''
</P>
<P>
   The pals have stayed together in Sydney, sharing a house with
other runners. In the early days here, Bolton said the place was
rocking with music, but as the 100 approached, the tone changed.
''He started playing the slowest gospel music,'' he said, nodding
at Greene. ''I thought Maurice was having a funeral in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After the second round, something switched on,'' Greene said.
''I was so nervous. I was pacing, walking around the house. I'm a
person, when it's time to run, nothing bothers me. I don't let
anything in between my goal, what I want to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The training guru for Greene and Bolton is ex-Olympian John
Smith, who said there is nothing complicated about his methods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have three rules,'' he said. ''The first is show up for
practice. The second is show up for practice. And the third is show
up for practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to keep things simple. We practice to create what
we need for the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said he brings a plan to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always said to be No. 1, you train like you're No. 2,''
he said. ''You've got to work very hard because the person behind
me might be working harder.''

<HEADLINE> Palmeiro Hits 400th Career Homer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas first baseman Rafael Palmeiro
became the 32nd major leaguer with 400 career homers when he hit a
three-run homer in the fifth inning against Anaheim on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a 3-1 pitch from Angels reliever Scott Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who turns 36 on Sunday, is the first player to reach
the milestone in a Texas uniform. Palmeiro, who has 39 homers this
season, has hit 193 of his 400 homers in seven seasons with the
Rangers (1989-93 and 1999-2000).
</P>
<P>
   His first major league homer came Sept. 9, 1986, when as a
member of the Chicago Cubs he homered off Philadelphia's Kevin
Gross at Wrigley Field. Palmeiro hit the first 25 homers of his
career with the Cubs from 1986-88 and hit 182 with Baltimore from
1994-98.
</P>
<P>
   There are six other active players with 400 career homers, Mark
McGwire's 554 being the closest to Hank Aaron's record 755. The
other active members of the 400-homer club are Barry Bonds (493),
Jose Canseco (446), Ken Griffey Jr. (438), Cal Ripken Jr. (415) and
Fred McGriff (413).
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and McGriff also hit their 400th homers this season.

<HEADLINE> Former Tigers Player Rodriguez Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Aurelio Rodriguez, a model of consistency at
third base for the Detroit Tigers during the 1970s, died Saturday
after being hit by a car on the city's southwest side. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was walking with an unidentified woman about 2 p.m.
when the car apparently jumped a sidewalk and struck them before
hitting a utility pole, police Sgt. Michael Matuzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had to be pulled from beneath the vehicle and was
pronounced dead at Henry Ford Hospital. The 35-year-old pedestrian
was in critical condition and the female motorist was in good
condition at Detroit Receiving Hospital, spokeswoman Mattie Majors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked and saddened to have lost one of our own, and
our thoughts and prayers go out to his family,'' Tigers spokesman
Tyler Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was living in Tucson, Ariz., while serving as the
Arizona Diamondbacks' Rookie League hitting instructor. He had come
to Detroit to sign autographs Sunday with Tom Brookens, another
former Tigers third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be sorely missed,'' said former teammate Alan
Trammell, now a first base coach with San Diego. ''Right now, I'm
just a little bit in shock that he's no longer with us. It's just a
sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a native of Cananea Sonora, Mexico, broke into the
major leagues with the California Angels in 1967. He was traded to
the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always hate when tragedy strikes somebody, especially so
sudden like that,'' Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett said
while attending the Dodgers-Padres game. ''He was just the nicest
guy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez played in at least 128 games in seven of his nine
years in Detroit, and won a Gold Glove award in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a great arm, he hit for some power and he was a pretty
good all-around ballplayer,'' Trammell said. ''But he was more
known for his glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aurelio was as good as anyone I ever saw,'' he said. ''He had
a style of his own, which was different than Graig Nettles and
Brooks Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's last season as a Tiger was 1979, Sparky Anderson's
first as manager. By 1992, Anderson had used at least 43 players at
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a nice man. He was a very nice human being,''
Anderson said Saturday from his home in California. ''He probably
had as good a pair of hands on him as anybody, and a great arm --
the only two arms I've ever seen like that, (Travis) Fryman and
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for manager Billy Martin's 1972 East Division champions,
Rodriguez went hitless in 16 at-bats in Detroit's playoff loss to
Oakland. Playing for the New York Yankees in the 1981 World Series,
however, he hit .417 (5-for-12).
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez' big-league career with seven teams ended in 1983. He
finished with a .237 average with 124 home runs and 648 RBIs in
2,017 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez played in the Mexican League as late as 1987 and
coached in the Cleveland Indians' minor league organization in
1988. He returned to the Mexican League as a manager in the
mid-1990s.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Manager, Closer Blast Duquette  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox manager Jimy Williams and closer Derek
Lowe criticized Boston general manager Dan Duquette on Saturday for
failing to discipline outfielder Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Everett reported late for the opener of Thursday's doubleheader
against Cleveland, breaking one of Williams' rules, then got into a
shouting match with Darren Lewis and had to be separated from his
teammate. Everett openly cursed his manager in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was the general manager, I would back the manager, and if
you can't, you probably need to get rid of me,'' Williams said
before Saturday's 8-7, 10-inning win against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said Duquette's treatment of Everett was a slap at Williams
and set a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hope it doesn't snowball to the point where there's no
rules at all,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, sliding toward elimination, is five games back in the
wild-card race with seven games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said a team can't function if the players aren't all
held to the same standards. Williams added the problem was
''fixable,'' and that he intend to fulfill his contract, which runs
through the 2001 season
</P>
<P>
   ''You finish what you started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette denied a rift with Williams in Saturday's editions of
The Boston Globe and Boston Herald, but refused comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Everett criticized reporters for ''lies'' in their its coverage,
saying reports Lewis had questioned his commitment to the team were
fabricated because no reporters heard the conversation. He declined
to give his version.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't set anything straight that people lie about,'' Everett
told reporters. ''I let you soak in your own lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he wouldn't comment, then added: ''You can pretty
much read between the lines on what was said.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Everett was booed during a pinch-hitting appearance.
He said Saturday he blamed reporters, not fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those reporters want the fans to be negative to me,'' he said.
''That's their only goal in life, because they're miserable
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett added he had no problems with Williams, and said he had
nothing to apologize for in his confrontation with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's been targeted because of his large contract and
status as one of the team's stars, along with pitcher Pedro
Martinez and shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter pointed out that no one else was involved in
similar controversies, he said: ''Who's going to mess with Nomar?
He owns this town. Who's going to mess with Pedro? He owns this
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said these side issues may have helped prevent a third
straight trip to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're on a pace to win 85 games,'' Lowe said. ''You tell
me if it's a distraction to the team or not.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Hampton struck out nine, matching his
season high, and Edgardo Alfonzo homered Saturday night as the New
York Mets beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza was 2-for-4 with two RBIs for New York, which
lowered its magic number for clinching a playoff berth to three.
The Mets remained 3&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL
East.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (14-10) won for the first time in five starts since Aug.
27, giving up three runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings. He allowed
just two runners in the first five innings, then gave up a run in
the sixth and two more in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell and John Franco combined for 2 1-3 innings of
scoreless relief as New York won its second straight following a
7-13 September start.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Cliff Politte (3-3) twice escaped bases-loaded
jams and allowed three runs, six hits and four walks in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York went ahead in the first when Timo Perez, who led off
with a double, scored on a fielding error by first baseman Brian
Hunter. New York loaded the bases but Darryl Hamilton hit an
inning-ending popout.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo homered into the left-field upper deck, just inside the
foul pole, in the third for a 2-0 lead and Piazza hit an RBI double
in the sixth. With the bases loaded and one out, Politte struck out
Mike Bordick and Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sefcik hit an RBI grounder in the sixth and and appeared
to beat Alfonzo's relay throw from second to first. However, first
base umpire Greg Gibson called him out, prompting protests from
Phillies manager Terry Francona and first-base coach Brad Mills.
Hampton then struck out Bobby Abreu for the third time in the game.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it 7-1 in the seventh on RBI singles by Piazza and
Robin Ventura, and two run-scoring wild pitches by Wayne Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bennett hit a two-run, two-out single in the seventh and
Philadelphia then loaded the bases. Joe McEwing, who went to left
as a defensive replacement, made a sliding catch of a Sefcik liner
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Benny Agbayani did not start due to a strained right
hamstring sustained Friday night. While the team did not think the
injury is serious, he is likely to miss two-three games. ... There
was an overwhelming majority of Mets fans among the 22,570 in
attendance.

<HEADLINE> Transit Talks Resume in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Transit officials and union negotiators
agreed to return to the bargaining table on Sunday to try to
resolve a week-old strike that has affected nearly half a million
commuters.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,300 bus drivers and rail operators walked off the job
Sept. 16, and about 650 MTA clerks were honoring their picket line.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained far apart after talks broke off Friday on
ways to address what the MTA says will be a $438 million operating
deficit over the next 10 years if expenses aren't cut.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA wants to hire more part-time operators and drivers at
entry-level wages and cut overtime costs by 15 percent. The drivers
want more money for pensions and for a health care trust
administered by the union.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA has offered raises of 2.7 percent a year over the next
three years; the union wants 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Herb Wesson meet with both sides Saturday and said
he was optimistic that Sunday's bargaining would be in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we've done anything, hopefully it's that we've got the
commitment that tomorrow they will begin to negotiate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MTA spokesman Jose Ubaldo, who declined to say what he discussed
with Wesson. ''We're just worried about the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   United Transportation Union officials did not immediately return
messages.
</P>
<P>
   The last transit strike in Los Angeles was a nine-day walkout in
1994.

Finance Ministers Rule Out Oil Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The world's richest nations signaled Saturday
they would intervene again in foreign exchange markets if necessary to help
Europe's ailing currency -- but they ruled out the idea of pushing oil prices
lower through a tax cut. After staging Friday's surprise concerted strike to
bolster the euro, which fell this week to record lows against the U.S. dollar,
the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries said they would keep an eye on
the euro and ''cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate.''

   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Forty-five Iraqi Christians have been bused from Mexico to
the United States, where they applied for political asylum after they and more

expected to arrive from the hotel in Mexico later today for interviews with the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Including those who had tried to
walk across the border, the INS reported this afternoon it was processing 124
Iraqis, including 42 children, who were seeking asylum.

New Book Describes a Manipulative Diana
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Despite Buckingham Palace's vehement objections to the book, a
British paper published excerpts Sunday of a new biography of the late Princess
Diana by her most senior adviser depicting her as manipulative and desperately
in need of attention. The Sunday Times printed the first installment of its
serialization of ''Shadows of a Princess,'' by Patrick Jephson, who was employed
by Diana between 1987 and 1996 and was her private secretary through the events
leading to her 1992 separation from Prince Charles. Queen Elizabeth II and
Prince Charles issued a rare joint statement Sept. 15, saying they ''deeply
deplored'' publication of the book.

<HEADLINE> Women's Volleyball: Brazil 3, US 1  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. women's volleyball team stole
one game from Brazil, and that was enough -- even in the Americans'
first Olympic loss.
</P>
<P>
   The United States gained valuable confidence even in their
25-17, 20-25, 25-15, 25-15 defeat Sunday (Saturday night EDT), and
still exceeded everyone's expectations by finishing second in Group
A.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will enter the quarterfinals with a 4-1 record,
and probably will play South Korea when the next round begins
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost five straight matches in major tournaments to the
powerful Brazilians, the Americans didn't figure to have much of a
chance this time.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting blown out in the opening game, they got their
blocking going with Danielle Scott, Sarah Noriega and Heather Bown,
shutting down star Brazilian hitters Leila Barros and Erika Coimbra
to take a 10-5 lead in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team pushed it to 20-12 and got to game point before
faltering. Brazil scored five straight points to get to 24-20, but
Robyn Ah Mow set up Logan Tom perfectly for a slam down the middle
to square the match.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans led 6-4 to start the third, but Brazil went on a
10-2 spurt, and the U.S. team couldn't recover. The closest the
United States got in the fourth was 15-13.
</P>
<P>
   The United States didn't lead at all in the first game, but it
wasn't blown out, either, and when Tara Cross-Battle and Scott
teamed up on two emphatic stuff blocks, Brazil had only a 20-16
lead. The Brazilians then scored five of the next six points to win
the opener.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lewinsky To Host TV Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who
became world-famous through her dalliance with President Clinton,
reportedly is to host six 10-minute episodes of a television show
for Britain's Channel 5 network.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ''Monica's Postcards,'' will feature Lewinsky as a
roving reporter, The Daily Express newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the episodes, to be broadcast in November, Lewinsky
interviews ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' author Helen Fielding,
discusses her body image during a trip to a West Coast health spa
and visits the set of American soap opera ''Days Of Our Lives,''
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted a channel spokesman as saying the episodes will be
reporter-led and feature Monica prominently throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 or Lewinsky's spokesperson could not be immediately
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal surrounding Lewinsky's affair with the president led
to Clinton's impeachment and Senate trial, where he was acquitted.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Trainer Cited by Race Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- State horse racing authorities issued
two complaints Saturday against prominent Southern California
trainer Robert Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, trainer of Starmaniac and Mojave Moon, was cited after
morphine was detected in urine samples taken from each horse. No
other details were given.
</P>
<P>
   The California Horse Racing Board began investigating in June
after two post-race tests confirmed the presence of morphine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was found in separate tests at Truesdail Laboratories
of Tustin, Calif., and Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Starmaniac finished first in the sixth race at Hollywood Park on
June 10 and Mojave Moon finished third in the fourth race at
Hollywood Park on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who was inducted to the National Thoroughbred Racing
Hall of Fame in 1995, was unavailable for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards at Santa Anita Park will hear the case at a date to
be determined, said Mike Marten, racing board spokesman.

</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (3-1) trailed 12-0 before scoring 30 straight points as

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Takahashi Win Track Events  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Naoko Takahashi, running alone for the
last four miles on a warm, humid day, broke the finish-line tape in
the women's marathon Sunday (Saturday night EDT) and raised her
arms in triumph. Then she bowed to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, overcoming 91 percent humidity, won gold in an
Olympic-best 2 hours, 23 minutes, 14 seconds to become the first
Japanese woman to win an Olympic track and field gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Lidia Simon of Romania won silver in 2:23.22 and Joyce
Chepchumba of Kenya won bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Chepchumba didn't want to stop. She crossed the finish line and
kept running, apparently thinking she had not yet completed the
race. Officials told her to stop, and she stood on the track for
several seconds -- hands on her hips -- in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, who took a victory lap waving a tiny Japanese flag,
broke the previous Olympic best of 2:24.52 set by Joan Benoit in
the inaugural women's marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese flags greeted Takahashi along much of the marathon
course, which crossed the Harbor Bridge and wound through the
streets of Sydney -- passing by the posh shops and restaurants of
Darling Harbor -- before heading into the suburbs and on to the
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She broke away from the pack with about 4&AMP;frac14; miles remaining, and
led the rest of the way. It was 57 degrees at the start of the
race, and 70 by the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really hasn't set in to me that I have really won the gold
medal,'' Takahashi said through a translator. ''Sometimes I feel a
little sorry that it's finished and sometimes I feel relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia finished
ninth. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, who set a world best of 2:20.43 in
the Berlin Marathon last year, was 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Clark, a pathologist from Anchorage, Alaska, finished
19th in 2:31.35 -- a personal best by nearly two minutes. She was
the only U.S. entrant in the race.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's Aguida Amaral finished in 3:10.55. Not realizing
she had one more lap to run, Amaral stopped near the finish line
and placed her hands together as she knelt to the track. An
official gently informed Amaral she was not done, and she took one
more lap to rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
   The last marathoner on the course, Sirivanh Ketavong of Laos,
finished to a standing ovation from some fans in 3:34.27 -- more
than an hour behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, defending champion Allen Johnson
ignored a hamstring injury that still requires regular treatment
and breezed to victory in his first-round heat in 13.50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was joined in the second round by U.S. teammate and 1996
Atlanta silver medalist Mark Crear, who won his heat in 13.44
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to the second round was the third American in the
event, Terrence Trammell, as well as world champion Colin Jackson
of Britain and medal contender Anier Garcia of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning world champion Anthony Washington and U.S. teammate
Adam Setliff advanced to the final of the men's discus throw, but
John Godina was eliminated in the qualifying round. Godina won a
bronze medal in the shot put two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After five events of the heptathlon, 1996 silver medalist
Natalia Sazanovich of Belarus led with 4,910 points and 1996 bronze
medalist Denise Lewis of Britain was second with 4,853. Dedee
Nathan of the United States was ninth with 4,547.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning world champion Eunice Barber of France was in 10th
place. The president of the French athletic federation, Philippe
Lamblin, said Barber withdrew from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Jan Zelezny's historic triumph was a mere footnote
on a night dominated by sprinters Marion Jones and Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   While the American speedsters won their first Olympic medals,
Zelezny became the only person to capture three straight Olympic
javelin titles. And he did it by breaking his own Olympic record
with a throw of 295 feet, 9&AMP;frac12; inches (90.17 meters).
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Steve Backley ended up with the silver medal and
Russia's Sergei Makarov won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Michael Johnson and Cathy Freeman easily won
second-round heats in the 400 and advanced to Sunday's semifinals.
World record holder Stacy Dragila qualified for the final of the
first Olympic women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400, Johnson won his heat in 45.31 seconds. For the
second straight round, Alvin Harrison had the best time -- he won
his heat in 44.25. Also reaching the semifinals was the third
American, Antonio Pettigrew.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 800 semifinals, Hazel Clark advanced to the
final. Older sister Joetta Clark-Diggs and sister-in-law Jearl
Miles-Clark both were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were shut out in three other events.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Deal, a silver medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Games and the
grand old man of U.S. hammer throwing, failed to advance out of the
qualifying round. So did teammates Jud Logan and Kevin McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   All three American men in the 800 meters -- Mark Everett, Bryan
Woodward and Richard Kenah -- were left behind in Saturday's first
round.
</P>
<P>
   And the two U.S. women left in the 400 meters, LaTasha
Colander-Richardson and Monique Hennagan, both were eliminated in
the second round. Michelle Collins was ousted in the first round a
day earlier.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Texas 48, Houston 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas scored three touchdowns on turnovers
and the Longhorns smothered one of the nation's best passing
attacks in beating Houston 48-0 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dakarai Pearson and O.J. McClintock returned interceptions for
touchdowns and Michael Ungar recovered a fumbled punt in the end
zone on a night when No. 15 Texas struggled to move the ball
offensively but dominated on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (2-1) managed just 349 total yards but it didn't matter as
the Longhorns sacked Houston quarterbacks nine times. Houston's
Jason McKinley, who came in leading the nation with 346.3 yards
passing per game, was just 14-of-34 for 173 yards and two
interceptions before leaving in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas held Houston (1-3) to 198 total yards, including just 13
yards rushing on 31 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Texas needed that kind of effort from its defense. Despite the
high score, the Longhorns had just 188 yards through the first
three quarters and racked up late yardage by throwing deep in the
final two minutes. Chris Simms and Major Applewhite combined to
complete 22 of 27 passes for 253 yards with one touchdown and three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Simms started and his first pass was intercepted when it bounced
off Montrell Flowers' hands. Houston had the ball on the Longhorns'
37 but failed to capitalize when Mike Clark's 39-yard field-goal
attempt was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson made it 7-0 in the first quarter when he stepped in
front of McKinley's pass and ran untouched into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite relieved Simms and led Texas to a 10-0 in the second
quarter on Kris Stockton's 30-yard field goal despite just 6 total
yards on offense. After a Houston fumble, Applewhite drove the
Longhorns 37 yards to Victor Ike's 1-yard touchdown run and a 17-0
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' defense, meanwhile, led by the bull rush of
tackles Shaun Rogers and Casey Hampton, consistently harassed
McKinley into quick throws and sacked him four times in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Redding snuffed Houston's only touchdown threat in the
third quarter when he dropped McKinley for a 12-yard loss and
pounced on the ball at the Texas 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' drive stalled at midfield but disaster struck the
Cougars again when punt returner Bachie McGruder fielded the kick
at the Houston 5 only to fumble it back into the end zone. Ungar
fell on the loose ball to make it 27-0.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hayter's 2-yard touchdown dive in the fourth made it 34-0
before McClintock intercepted McKinley's last pass and returned it
23 yards for a TD. Matt Trissel added a 6-yard scoring catch from
Simms with 3:11 left.

<HEADLINE> Takahashi Has Historic Marathon Win  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Naoko Takahashi danced to rock music
pulsating from her headphones just before the start of the race.
Then the beat went on for 26.2 miles in an impressive triumph in
the women's marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first track and field gold medal for a Japanese
woman, and it came in what many felt was the most impressive
marathon ever run by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, 28, was the 1998 Asian Games champion and a two-time
winner of the Nagoya Marathon. She finished the scenic, hilly
course on Sunday (Saturday night EDT) in an Olympic best 2 hours,
23 minutes, 14 seconds, far faster than anyone expected on the
difficult layout.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi said she benefited from her recent training in the
mountainous terrain of Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very tough course, but I trained on a much tougher
course,'' Takashi said through a translator, ''so I didn't feel it
was that tough.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled away from Romanian Lidia Simon with about 4&AMP;frac14; miles to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a lot stronger and that's what counted,'' said Simon,
who was sixth in the marathon at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 27, winner of the last two Osaka marathons and bronze
medalist at last year's world championships, won the silver in
2:23.22. Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya won the bronze in 2:24.55.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, Simon and Japan's Ari Ichihashi were together far
ahead of the rest of the pack for several miles, before Ichihashi
faded about two-thirds of the way through the race.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi started the race in sunglasses but took them off along
the way and tossed them to her coach. She hit a motorcycle with
them instead.
</P>
<P>
   She entered Olympic Stadium to loud cheers from the
near-capacity crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When she crossed the finish line, she looked as if she had
finished nothing more than a morning stroll. She stopped completely
a few steps later and raised both fists in the air in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Simon gained on the winner in the final lap in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I went into the stadium, I thought I would have the
strength to overcome her and obtain the medal that I wanted more
than anything else,'' Simon said, ''but it was not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   With two Japanese flags in hand, Takahashi rounded the track and
was handed two bouquets of flowers along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't really set in that I won the Olympic gold medal,''
she said. ''Sometimes I am a little bit sorry it is finished.
Sometimes I am relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Japanese contingent had figured to be a medal
contender, and Takahashi showed she was in top form earlier this
year when she won the Nagoya Women's Marathon in 2:22.19.
</P>
<P>
   The only other two Japanese medals in the event were won by Yuko
Arimori, a silver in 1996 and bronze in 1992. The first women's
Olympic marathon was run in 1984 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The race began in a misty 57 degrees in North Sydney and ended
in a humid 70 degrees in Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi bounced up and down and danced to the music, as she
always does before removing her headphones for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be thinking 'Oh, this is the Olympic
Games,''' she said. ''I was listening to the music, trying to be
upbeat and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The most moving moment came when Aguida Amaral of East Timor
entered the stadium. She stopped, went to one knee and bowed to the
cheering crowd. However, she still had a lap to go. When that was
pointed out, she jogged on and was the 45th of 47 finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral is running under the International Olympic Committee's
flag in Sydney because East Timor, the world's newest country, does
not yet have a national Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Renders of Belgium shot out ahead of the other 53
runners at the start and widened the margin as the runners crossed
the Sydney Harbor Bridge and ran past the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   But Renders soon faded and the trio of Takahashi, Simon and
Ichihashi pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi and Simon ran together up and down the hills on the
road to Homebush Bay and Olympic Park until Takahashi's long,
steady strides pushed her into the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Wanjiru of Kenya was fourth in 2:26.17. Fatuma Roba, the
1996 Olympic champion, was ninth in 2:27.48. One of the major
favorites, Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, became ill along the way
finished 13th in 2:29.45.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel sad for Tegla because she got sick at 10 kilometers,''
Chepchumba said. ''I looked back and could not see her. We have
trained together for a long time, and it has helped me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone U.S. runner in the race, Christine Clark, was 19th in
2:31.35, nearly two minutes faster than her previous personal best.

<HEADLINE> Indians 11, Royals 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Bartolo Colon allowed two hits in seven
shutout innings, extending his scoreless streak to 17 innings as
the Cleveland Indians beat the Kansas City Royals 11-1 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland remained one game back in the wild card race, trailing
Oakland and Seattle, who also are battling for the AL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (15-8), coming off a one-hitter against the New York
Yankees, gave up a third-inning single to Jorge Fabregas and
fourth-inning single to Carlos Beltran. He struck out eight and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar was 4-for-4 with three RBIs for Cleveland,
raising his his average to .301. The Indians, who had 16 hits,
scored in each of the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert (8-9) gave up seven runs and nine hits -- all
singles -- in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar hit an RBI single in the first, and made it 3-0 in the
second when third baseman Joe Randa misplayed Einar Diaz's grounder
for a run-scoring error and Kenny Lofton hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar hit into a run-scoring double play in the fourth, and the
Indians made it 8-0 in the fifth on Diaz's RBI single, which chased
Reichert, Alomar's two-run double off Kris Wilson and David Segui's
run-scoring grounder, which gave him a career-high 100 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was knocked down by Wilson's sharp grounder and left the
game with an injured heel. He was taken to a hospital for
precautionary X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton hit a sacrifice fly in the fifth off Chris Fussell and
Omar Vizquel added an RBI single for a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez homered off Fussell in the sixth -- Cleveland's first
home run in 50 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran hit a ninth-inning sacrifice fly off Tom Martin
to score the lone run for Kansas City, which had four hits.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The teams combined to use 29 position players (including
designated hitters). The Indians used 14 and the Royals 15. ...
With his single in the third, Ramirez extended his streak of
reaching base safely to 49 games, the longest streak in the major
leagues this season. ... The Indians improved to 40-27 (.597) since
the All-Star break, the best record in the AL. ... It was the 22nd
time this season the Royals have allowed 10 or more runs. They are
1-21 in those games. ... Rey Sanchez was removed for a pinch
hitter, Luis Ordaz, in the sixth inning, ending Sanchez' hitting
streak at 12 games.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Fight for Silicon Valley  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The dominance of ''The Industry'' in
this culturally left-of-center capital of high-tech has both
candidates taking some curious positions in a pivotal race in
determining which party will run the House of Representatives next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Honda, the Democrat hoping to succeed Tom Campbell -- the
longshot challenger for Democrat Diane Feinstein's Senate seat -- is
distancing himself from organized labor. GOP opponent Jim Cunneen,
meanwhile, is stressing the need and his support for preserving
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fight for the hearts and souls of the whole spectrum
of people who live and work in the valley,'' not just technology
workers, says Ruben Barrales, who heads a quality-of-life group
called Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network.
</P>
<P>
   A November swing of just six seats in the 222-211 majority now
held by Republicans could return the House to Democratic control
for the first time since 1994. And registration in this 15th
District tilts Democratic despite Republican Campbell's hold on it
for four terms.
</P>
<P>
   The race is so important to Democrats that when Honda was
wavering on whether to seek the seat, he got a call from President
Clinton. Run, Clinton, said, and I'll hold a fund-raiser for you.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, Clinton is making good on his IOU, flying in
here Saturday to help Honda collect about $500,000. Last week, Vice
President Al Gore dropped in at a rally for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended a Honda fund-raiser Saturday night at a San
Jose home. About 350 people were asked to contribute $1,000 each.
Hand-rolled sushi rolls, teriyaki barbecue chicken and green tea
ice cream were served.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd be introduced by a
Japanese-American wearing cowboy boots,'' Clinton said. ''You're
the walking embodiment of 'One America' right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed the importance of Democrats maintaining a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you how important I think it is for Mike and so
many of our other good candidates here to win these House races. I
have a so much greater appreciation than I ever did before I became
president of the importance of every single seat in the House,
every single seat in the Senate. Our economic plan in 1993 passed
by a single vote,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With the seat just as vital to Republicans, the GOP has
dispatched its celebrities here, too, including Arizona Sen. John
McCain, to boost Cunneen.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, 59, is a soft-spoken former teacher who was held in a
Japanese internment camp as a child during World War II. Cunneen,
39, is a former corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   Both are members of the California Assembly, and both are trying
to appeal to the moderate-liberal values of residents in the valley
just south of San Francisco. In the process, both have risked
alienating core constituencies of their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, for example, wrote legislation over the objections of
labor leaders to exempt many high-tech firms from requiring
employers to pay most workers for putting in more than eight hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen portrays himself as an environmentalist and, despite
support from sportsmen and gun advocates, voted for a measure last
year to give California the toughest assault-weapon ban in the
nation, as did Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Playing up his high-tech roots, Cunneen easily slips into the
tech-speak of Silicon Valley. In an interview, he fondly described
his old employer, chipmaker National Semiconductor, as ''a typical
high-tech company that leveraged people.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with government was among his team's ''food groups,''
Cunneen recalls. He drops names of the industry executives that
back him. ''It's a valley who's-who,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen points to legislation he has authored limited punitive
damages in Y2K-related cases, enhancing protection of company
secrets and expanding research and development tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a person who comes from the industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has signaled its preference for Cunneen through
political donations: Computer equipment and services company
contributions to Cunneen have outpaced those to Honda more than
5-1, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   But California's blanket primary last March suggested voters
were leaning toward Honda. He was preferred over Cunneen 40-33
percent in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Honda says he would be a vigorous advocate for the valley's
interests, while offering a broader set of credentials. His
detainment in Japanese internment camps during World War II left
him determined to have a voice in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being incarcerated without due process, being presumed guilty
rather than innocent, were two things that helped me understand we
have to preserve those two principles,'' Honda said. ''Absence is
not an option.''

<HEADLINE> Navarro Boxes Into Quarterfinals  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jose Navarro boxed his way into the
Olympic flyweight quarterfinals, and this time his father saw it.
</P>
<P>
   With his father and older brother, Carlos Jr., cheering him on,
the 19-year-old Navarro scored half of his points in the fourth
round for a 12-9 decision over Hicham Mesbahi of Morocco at 112
pounds Sunday afternoon (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   When the decision was announced, Mesbahi threw up his hands,
fell to his knees and pounded the canvas. There were boos.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro's father had missed his son's opening-round win because
he missed catch a plane in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro became the sixth U.S. boxer to advance to the
quarterfinals. He will box Jerome Thomas of France Wednesday
afternoon (Tuesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was behind by one point in the last round and I had
no choice but to go out there and just throw,'' said Navarro, who
trailed 7-6 after three rounds. ''I knew I had to step it up a lot.
It's just and experience for me. I'm going to learn a lot from this
fight, as I do from every fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Americans who boxed Saturday night advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Juarez, the 125-pound world champion from Houston,
outpointed Falk Huste of Germany 17-15 and set up a quarterfinal
showdown on Wednesday against Somluck Kamsing of Thailand, the
Olympic gold medalist at the 1996 Olympics. Kamsing beat Tulkunbay
Turgunov of Ubesistan, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jermain Taylor of Little Rock, Ark., pounded out a 23-9 decision
over Scott McIntosh of Canada at 156 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then super heavyweight Calvin Brock of Charlotte, N.C., became
the fourth U.S. boxer to lose. He took a standing out count, was
knocked down and stopped in the fourth round on the 15-point rule
(21-5) by Paolo Vidoz of Italy, a bronze medalist at the 1999 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Juarez, who beat Huste 12-6 in the quarterfinals
at the world championships last year in Houston, clinched his
victory this time with a scoring blow late in the fourth round for
a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez led by three points four times during the fast-paced four
rounds, but never for very long. Each boxer got a couple of points
for body blows. In some bouts judges have ignored punches to body.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Taylor clinched his match against McIntosh by
outscoring the Canadian 11-3 in the third round. He will box Adnan
Catic of Germany in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was simply outclassed in the last two rounds. After a 2-2
first round, Brock fell behind 6-3 after two rounds. Then he took a
battering in the third round when he took a standing 8-count and he
was knocked down with a body punch in the fourth. The fight was
stopped in the closing seconds.

<HEADLINE> Report: 40 States To Forfeit Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forty states may have to give up hundreds of
millions of dollars of federal money earmarked for health insurance
for children in low-income families because they haven't used all
their allotted funds, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 percent of the $4.2 billion provided in 1997 by
Congress hasn't been spent by the states, state and federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Any money left after a Sept. 30 deadline will be redistributed
to the 10 states that used their full allotments of federal money
under the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program created by
Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For Louisiana, that would mean giving up $63.7 million, or 63
percent of its allotment of $101.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas -- which together have 29 percent of the
nation's 11 million uninsured children -- stand to lose $590 million
and $446.3 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The states that have used all of their allotments -- Alaska,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- will have one year to
spend the extra money, after which it will revert to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program was designed to help
children in families with too much income to qualify for Medicaid
and too little to afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 committed to providing a total of $40 billion
for the program nationwide over 10 years. States had three years
beginning Oct. 1, 1997, to use the first year's installment of $4.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the program provides care to more than two
million children while stimulating improvements in Medicaid. But
spending has lagged behind expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in 20 states say they encountered major problems
implementing the program because in some cases it took more than a
year to start enrollment; some states couldn't find enough eligible
children, and others said the complex application procedure
deterred enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we enrolled every single eligible child in Colorado, we
still couldn't spend our full allocation of federal money. Our
economy is doing so well, there are fewer eligible kids than what
was estimated when the federal government did its initial
allocation of money,'' said William N. Lindsay, head of the board
that supervises the program in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Some states complained that the federal government administered
the program in such a rigid, inflexible way that it prevented them
from spending the money for children who might have benefited.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal law and regulations provided New Mexico with a lot
more money than we could possibly use,'' complained J. Barry
Blitzer, deputy secretary of the Human Services Department in New
Mexico. ''We have 30,000 uninsured kids, of whom no more than 1,000
are eligible for the new program.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Shortly after the Olympics suffered a
black eye from another drug scandal, marathon runner Naoko
Takahashi of Japan ran into Olympic Stadium and restored a smile to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis star Monica Seles and rower Christine Collins gave the
Americans a reason to smile, too.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi, on a sticky Sunday morning (Saturday night EDT), won
the gold medal in an Olympic-best 2 hours, 23 minutes, 14 seconds --
eight seconds ahead of runner-up Lidia Simon of Romania. Joyce
Chepchumba of Kenya won bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi crossed the finish line to become the first Japanese
woman to win an Olympic gold in track and field, then bowed to the
crowd in the 110,000-seat stadium. Waving a Japanese flag, she
added another leg to her 26-mile run -- a smiling lap around the
stadium, grinning widely as the crowd cheered and handed her
bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese flags greeted Takahashi along much of the marathon
course, which crossed the Harbor Bridge and wound through the
streets of Sydney before heading into the suburbs and the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   American Allen Johnson, the defending gold medalists in the
110-meter hurdles, ran through a hamstring injury to win his first
heat. The hurdler went directly from the track for more treatment
on his injured left leg.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in the second round by teammate and 1996 Atlanta
silver medalist Mark Crear, along with American Terrence Trammell.
Also advancing were world champion Colin Jackson of Britain and
medal contender Anier Garcia of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Americans reached the discus finals: reigning world
champion Anthony Washington and teammate Adam Setliff. A third
American, John Godina, was eliminated in the qualifying round just
two days after winning a shot put bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, an exultant Marion Jones won the 100-meter dash,
the first of what could be five Sydney golds. Teammate Maurice
Greene waxed the competition Saturday for gold in his 100.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who celebrated her first gold medal with a playful run
around the Olympic Stadium, posted the second-largest winning
margin in Olympic 100-meter history: 37 hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who zipped to his gold medal in 9.87 seconds, wrapped
his head in his hands after crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: Seles jumped all over Dominique Van Roost of Belgium
in a 6-0, 6-2 victory. Seles, now in the Olympic semifinals, needs
just one win now to capture her first Olympic medal. Her opponent
in the next round: the winner of the quarterfinal between
second-seeded Venus Williams and No. 5 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- ROWING: U.S. rower Christine Collins, four times a world
champion, took her first shot at an Olympic medal. She wanted gold.
She settled for bronze Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Collins and partner Sarah Garner took an early lead in the
lightweight double sculls, but dropped to third midway through the
race and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Collins patted her partner's back after the finish, then shared
hugs and handshakes with the champion Romanians and runner-up
Germans on the medals stand.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the only team to qualify in all 14 rowing
events, won just two bronze and a silver for its worst finish since
1972.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: With his father watching, U.S. 112-pounder Jose
Navarro punched his way into the Olympic quarterfinals with a 12-9
decision over Hicham Mesbahi of Morocco. Mesbahi, upset with the
decision, pounded the canvas when it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro's father, Carlos, had missed his son's first fight after
missing a plane in Los Angeles. Navarro became the sixth U.S. boxer
to advance to the quarterfinals.

   -- DIVING: China's diving dominance continued, with a pair of
Chinese teens leading in the 10-meter platform. Laura Wilkinson of
the United States was the top American in fifth place following the
semifinals, well behind 15-year-old leader Sang Xue and 16-year-old
runner-up Li Na.

   -- DRUG TEST: Latvian rower Andris Reinholds was kicked out of
the Olympics after testing positive for the steroid nandrolone.
Reinholds, who finished ninth in the men's single sculls, tested
positive during a random test during competition last week.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, three Bulgarian weightlifters and a Belarussian
hammer thrower were expelled for positive tests. At least 20 other
athletes were caught in pre-games testing by their sports
federations, national Olympic committees or the new World
Anti-Doping Agency.

   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: In a match where two Americans had to lose,
the U.S. team of Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana whipped the U.S.

winners to the semifinals and a possible medal.

   -- MEN'S BASKETBALL: New Zealand was a mere shrimp on the U.S.
basketball barbie. The Americans, after playing their worst game of
the Olympics in a nine-point win over Lithuania, shot 88 percent in
the first half to demolish the Kiwis, 102-56.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter and Kevin Garnett led the way in the beginning,
mixing jumpers with dunks to finish with 18 and 14 points,
respectively. The gold-medal favorites ran their record to 4-0.

   -- SOFTBALL: Staggered by three straight defeats, the U.S.
softball team regrouped to win two straight and reach the medals
round. Lisa Fernandez cracked a homer, while Christa Williams
pitched five perfect innings Saturday as the Americans defeated
Italy 6-0.

   The Americans, heavy favorites to defend their Atlanta gold, now
face China on Monday in the playoffs.

   -- MEN'S SOCCER: Unlikely. Improbable. But not impossible. The
U.S. soccer team, playing in its first Olympic quarterfinal, scored
a goal in the 90th minute to tie Japan before advancing toward a
medal with a 5-4 shootout victory.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. substitute Sasha Victorine blasted his penalty kick past
the desperate dive of goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki to propel the
Americans into the semifinals. The Americans had tied the game 2-2
on Pete Vagenas' penalty kick in the final minute of regulation.

   -- WOMEN'S WATER POLO: In a wild ending to the first-ever women's
Olympic water polo tournament, Australia's Yvette Higgins scored
with 1.3 seconds left to beat the United States 4-3 in the gold
medal game.
</P>
<P>
   The shocked Americans stood in the pool after the goal, waiting
in vain for a reversal that never came. Just 25 seconds earlier,
American Brenda Villa's goal had tied the contest -- but the
silver-medal winning U.S. squad never made it to overtime.

<P>
   -- BASEBALL: Winning easy applied to the Cubans, too. Jumping out
to a 4-0 first inning lead, the Cubans whipped the United States
6-1, and kicked the Americans around a bit, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, winning pitcher Jose Ibar drilled Ernie Young as
both benches emptied onto the field. In the eighth, catcher Pat
Borders was spiked on a play at the plate as tempers continued to
run high. Both teams now have a 5-1 record, and both are headed for
the medals round.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Vaclav Varada and Dave Andreychuk scored
goals 38 seconds apart early in the third period and goalie Tom
Askey made four key saves down the stretch as the Buffalo Sabres
defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-3 in exhibition action
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Varada swept in his own rebound just 56 seconds into the final
period, then Andreychuk beat goalie Frederic Chabot to the short
side on a two-on-one and the Sabres (5-0) had a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The quick offensive spurt came seconds after Askey kicked away a
point-blank shot by Steve Maltais that could have tied the game
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jackets pulled within 4-3 on a pair of late power-play
goals by Brett Harkins at 14:26 and Rostislav Klesla at 15:37.
</P>
<P>
   Askey, a native of suburban Buffalo, stopped 13 of 15 shots in
relief in his debut with the organization. He is signed to
minor-league contract after spending the past four seasons in the
Anaheim organization.

<HEADLINE> Seles Wins Olympic Quarterfinals  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Monica Seles needs one more win for her
first Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   Easing the memory of a disappointing performance at the Atlanta
Games, Seles advanced to the semifinals by beating Dominique Van
Roost of Belgium 6-0, 6-2 on Sunday (Saturday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Seles, seeded third, has lost only 10 games in four matches. Her
next opponent will be the winner of the quarterfinal between
second-seeded Venus Williams and No. 5 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a very tough match, but that's how it should
be -- it's the semifinals of the Olympics,'' Seles said. ''Obviously
it would be fun to play Venus. We're teammates. At least that way,
we know one of us would go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Unseeded Jelena Dokic, the only Australian still in singles,
beat No. 7 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-1, 1-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   In men's play, No. 6 Alex Corretja of Spain lost to Tommy Haas
of Germany 7-6 (7), 6-3. Corretja was the last seeded player in his
half of the draw. Haas' next opponent will be Max Mirnyi of
Belarus, who beat Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina 7-6 (4), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Seles was denied a medal four years ago when she lost a 2&AMP;frac12;-hour
quarterfinal match to Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of the toughest loses of my career,'' she said.
''Definitely I thought about it this morning when I woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Roost, seeded eighth, gave Seles little trouble. The Belgian
became dispirited after a 14-point second game, when she hit a
series of errant groundstrokes and double-faulted twice to lose
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Van Roost double-faulted on break point for the second time to
fall behind 4-0, then shanked an overhead on set point. In the
second set she had six break-point chances but lost them all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a fantastic score, but I don't feel I played that
well,'' Seles said. ''I tried not to give her any free points, and
I was successful at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles hit with her typical power and consistency from both
sides. When Van Roost managed to stay in a long rally, Seles almost
always won it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the first set she didn't make one mistake,'' Van Roost
said. ''In the second set she got a little tired, but the first set
was too good for me.''

Finance Ministers Discuss Oil, Debt
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- The world's richest nations signaled Saturday
they would intervene in foreign exchange markets if necessary again to help
Europe's ailing currency -- but they ruled out the idea of pushing oil prices
lower through a tax cut. After staging Friday's surprise concerted strike to
bolster the euro, which fell this week to record lows against the U.S. dollar,
the so-called Group of Seven industrial countries said they would keep an eye on
the euro and ''cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate.''

Transit Talks Resume in L.A.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Transit officials and union negotiators agreed to return
to the bargaining table on Sunday to try to resolve a week-old strike that has
affected nearly half a million commuters. About 4,300 bus drivers and rail
operators walked off the job Sept. 16, and about 650 MTA clerks were honoring
their picket line. The two sides remained far apart after talks broke off Friday
on ways to address what the MTA says will be a $438 million operating deficit
over the next 10 years if expenses aren't cut.

Panama Nixes Peru Asylum Request
</SUBHEAD>

   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama rejected a request Saturday to give asylum
to Vladimiro Montesinos, a shadowy former spy chief suspected in a bribery
scandal that quashed President Alberto Fujimori's plans to remain in power in
Peru. Panama has provided asylum to some of Latin America's most disgraced and
reviled former leaders, but apparently drew the line at accepting Montesinos,
whom Peruvian opposition leaders want tried in that country. ''After studying
the request, the cabinet recommended that this petition not be accepted,'' read
a terse press statement issued by the Office of the Presidency. The unusual
decision was made in an urgent meeting between Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso and her cabinet officials Saturday.

Gore's direction reflected an overall tightening of the race. The CNN-USA
Saturday-Gallup tracking poll had Gore at 48 percent and Bush at 45 percent,
within the poll's 4 percentage point error margin. A Newsweek poll also showed
the race within the margins, at 47 percent for Gore to 45 percent for Bush.

Report: 40 States To Forfeit Funds
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forty states may have to give up hundreds of millions of
dollars of federal money earmarked for health insurance for children in
low-income families because they haven't used all their allotted funds, The New
York Times reported Sunday. About 45 percent of the $4.2 billion provided in
1997 by Congress hasn't been spent by the states, state and federal officials
said. Any money left after a Sept. 30 deadline will be redistributed to the 10
states that used their full allotments of federal money under the Children's
Health Insurance Program, a program created by Congress in 1997. The states that
have used all of their allotments -- Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South
Carolina -- will have one year to spend the extra money, after which it will
revert to the Treasury.
