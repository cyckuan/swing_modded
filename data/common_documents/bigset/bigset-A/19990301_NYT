SMITH MULLED DEAL FOR FLAMES STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Coyotes say they were in the  &UR; Theo
Fleury sweepstakes close to the end, but General Manager  &UR; Bobby
Smith said he would not give the Calgary Flames what they kept
asking for.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, the Flames' all-time leading scorer, was dealt Sunday to
Colorado along with  &UR; Chris Dingman for role players  &UR; Rene Corbet,
 &UR; Wade Belak and future considerations, which likely will include a
prized prospect or an NHL player depending how far the Avalanche
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked along those same lines,'' Smith said, ``with
compensation increasing as the team won playoff rounds. But I don't
think the deal we talked about was a good deal for us. We looked at
a couple different things, but they were pretty adamant in what
they wanted from us, and I wasn't going to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith would not say which players Flames General Manager  &UR; Al
Coates had his eye on, but he said the Coyotes definitely had
interest in Fleury, a right wing who is set to become an
unrestricted free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Colorado definitely becomes a stronger team,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix players weren't happy to hear the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is strong, and everybody around us is obviously
making their teams better,'' said  &UR; Keith Tkachuk, the Coyotes'
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely doesn't help our chances,'' assistant captain
 &UR; Jeremy
 &UR; Roenick said. ``Fleury's a dynamic hockey player and he only makes
Colorado a stronger, more dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   Added  &UR; Rick Tocchet: ``Colorado was already a contender to win
the Cup. Getting Fleury just makes them the top favorites. But we
can't worry about that. . . . We've got to get our own problems
sorted out.'' &QL; 
Sullivan out again
</P>
<P>
   Left wing  &UR; Mike Sullivan went on injured reserve for the third
time this season on Sunday, this time with a separated right
shoulder suffered during the first period of Friday's 3-0 loss to
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt the last couple of days (leading up to Friday), and
then I went to hit a guy in the Rangers' game and it just got
worse,'' said Sullivan, who earlier this season missed three games
with a broken toe and 12 games with a broken rib. ``I thought I
could play with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he didn't bother telling trainer &UR; Gord Hart about
it until the next day, after he had trouble sleeping. Now he'll be
sidelined for at least seven days. &QL; 
The mighty lucky Quint
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period of Sunday's 4-1 loss to the Devils,
New Jersey enforcer  &UR; Krzysztof Oliwa skated hard from the red line
to body-slam Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint into the corner
boards. The hit was so big, it knocked a whole sheet of glass into
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that had been seamless glass, it would have killed me,''
Quint said. ``I'd have had no shoulders left and they'd be peeling
my face off the glass. Fortunately for me, it had some give to it.
He's a big man. It was a great hit.''

   CHANDLER, Ariz. - Believe it or not, a victorious  &UR; John Force
was nearly speechless after stepping to the podium to collect a
71st career National Hot Rod Association Funny Car trophy Sunday in
the Checker Schuck's Kragen Nationals at Firebird International
Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tongue was stuck,'' said Force, who is not only terrificly
fast on wheels, but talks a mile a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Force blamed the temporary condition on a flu bug he's been
fighting all week.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Force didn't need his mouth to reach the winner's circle. Just a
keen reaction eye at the starting line and a powerful Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stay away from taking some medication (Sunday), but
I finally had to take some stuff,'' said Force, who visited a Tempe
physician Friday and received a shot of antibiotics. ``I was
worried about my reaction time. My bones even tingled.'' &QL; 
All in the family
</P>
<P>
   With reigning Pro Stock champion  &UR; Warren Johnson sidelined after
losing in the second round, son  &UR; Kurt  &UR; Johnson carried the family
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Johnson, in a Chevy Camaro, prevented  &UR; Jeg Couglin from
posting a second straight win in an Oldsmobile Cutlass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the points leader for the first time in my career,''
Johnson said. ``I feel like (NASCAR Winston Cup's)  &UR; Mike Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep going down the track that we did (Sunday), I think
we've got a hot rod that will be a contender for the rest of the
season.'' &QL; 
Valley fever
</P>
<P>
   Valley racers fared well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keith Manogue of Glendale beat Glendale neighbor  &UR; Tim Landis in
the super street final.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Larry Marshall of Tempe won in super gas, and  &UR; Tom Yancer of
Chandler was runner-up in super comp. &QL; 
Speed demon
</P>
<P>
   Now that Top Fueler  &UR; Tony Schumacher has become the first driver
to surpass 330 mph, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher didn't dare guess at what drivers might reach before
the season is over, but Goodyear's tires are believed capable of
withstanding speeds upwards to 350 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (innovative) five-disc clutch is a godsend,''  &UR; Eddie Hill
said. ``It's what is allowing us to go this fast.'' &QL; 
Pit stops
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's racing was tape delayed and will air next Sunday on The
Nashville Network. It also will be replayed March 14.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jim Epler of Phoenix lost to  &UR; Jerry Toliver in Funny Car's
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Several San Diego Padres players, including  &UR; Wally Joyner, were
guests of Top Fuel winner  &UR; Joe  &UR; Amato.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four years, Pro Stock's  &UR; Jim Yates failed
to make Firebird's finals. &QL;

GIULIANI VISITS MIAMI BEACH FOR FUND-RAISER AND SPEECH ON
EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ In a brief but lucrative visit, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York City raised about $75,000 for his political
action committee at a fund-raising luncheon here on Sunday, then
called for more school choice programs in a speech to a Jewish
group.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides explained his trip last week by saying that the
group, Friends of Lubavitch, had invited him to speak at a dinner
for a yeshiva here. But the Republican mayor said on Monday night
that he had also come for the fund-raising luncheon, which cost
$1,000 per person, and for private meetings with people eager to
raise money for him if he decides to run for the U.S. Senate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not receive any money for his evening speech, his
aides said. But the proceeds from the luncheon, which drew about 75
people and was held at the home of Russell W. Galbut, a real estate
developer, will go to Solutions America, a political action
committee that Giuliani created last year to raise money for travel
and potential campaigns for higher office. The mayor has frequently
hinted in recent months that he would run for the Senate seat that
Daniel Patrick Moynihan will relinquish next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani has been careful not to confirm that he would
run, he has appeared especially excited about the prospect since
Hillary Rodham Clinton announced last month that she, too, was
considering running for the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has traveled out of state several times in recent
months to tout his record in speeches that have summarized his
accomplishments in New York City, including the drop in crime, the
reduction in the number of welfare recipients and his tax cuts. But
Monday night's speech was different because it focused on only one
concept, school choice, which he called ``the most important thing
that has to be done with education in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too many children in New York and all throughout
America who go to a school that they don't want to go,'' Giuliani
said on Sunday night to a group of 400 people, many of whom send
their children to the private yeshiva that the banquet was raising
money for. ``We are going to have a great public educational system
in America again, like we used to have 30 or 40 or 50 years ago,
when children are in the school that they want to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 15-minute speech, Giuliani told reporters that he had
held three meetings on Saturday with ``people who were very
interested in raising money for me if I run for the Senate.'' All
of the potential donors _ whom the mayor would only describe as
``very strong supporters of the Republican party'' _ hoped that
Giuliani would run against Mrs. Clinton, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe they can raise a lot more money if she does enter
the race,'' Giuliani said. ``They would be very interested in
giving me a significant amount of support if Hillary ran for the
Senate.''

SWEDE WINS TUCSON `MATCH PLAY'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ He is not ranked among the top 200 players in the
world, and hardly anybody can pronounce his name. Gabriel
Hjertstedt couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week some guy tried (to pronounce it) on the 10th tee at
Riveria (Country Club),'' the Swede said, referring to the Nissan
Open in Los Angeles. ``I felt sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They butchered it a few times this week, too. But that's all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hjertstedt _ pronounced Yet-stet _ knows how to roll with the
punches, as well as the pats on the back. He experienced both
during the final round of the Touchstone Energy Tucson Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up all the way, then I went straight down,'' he said of
Sunday's sudden-death victory over Tommy Armour III. ``I was
thankful to get a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The same hole that nearly cost Hjertstedt the tournament _ the
465-yard, water-lined 18th at Tucson National _ turned out to be
his personal winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   The first time around, he suffered a double-bogey 6, blowing a
2-shot lead and certain victory when he 3-putted from 18 feet _ the
second putt lipping out from 2 feet. But in the one-hole playoff,
Hjertstedt bounced back to beat Armour with a 25-foot birdie that
found the cup on its last rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit three perfect shots,'' said Hjertstedt, who set up the
winning putt with a 2-iron from 226 yards into a crosswind.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the conclusion basically came down to a match-play
situation. Earlier in the afternoon, the more prestigious WGC Match
Play Championship, which bumped the Tucson tournament to satellite
status, also concluded in overtime when Jeff Maggert edged Paradise
Valley's Andrew Magee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was just a good week for PING,'' said Hjertstedt,
who, like Maggert, represents the Phoenix-based equipment
manufacturer on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hjertstedt, who shared the lead after the second round but
started the day 3 shots behind Armour and Barry Cheesman, closed
with a 4-under 68. His winning total of 12-under 276 was worth
$495,000 _ or $5,000 less than Magee received for his second-place
finish in the Match Play.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would be back next year to defend his title
even if his world ranking eventually gets good enough to qualify
for the the Match Play, Hjertstedt offered a contrary opinion to
David Duval, who won this tournament last year but skipped out on
his defense for the $5 million jackpot in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to come back and defend a title. This event
deserves that kind of support,'' said Hjertstedt, 27, who splits
his time between homes in Helsingborg, Sweden, and Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Armour was philosophical after his 35-foot birdie attempt in
sudden death scooted 3 feet above the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play golf for the money,'' said the grandson of the
legendary Silver Scot. ``But when you miss that many birdie putts _
and I made some good putts _ what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Armour, who collected $297,000, did have his chances. Five times
he had birdie opportunities inside 15 feet on the back nine but
could not connect.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Reid (69) and Scottsdale's Kirk Triplett (69) tied for
third, 1 shot out of the playoff. It was especially frustrating for
Triplett, who has yet to win in 10 years on the tour. He also had
it to 12 under down the stretch before bogeying the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesman was the victim of back-to-back bogeys on the final two
holes and ended up in a tie for fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The real hard-luck story on this day, however, was Steve Lowery,
who ended up in a tie for 20th place. After completing his round,
the Florida pro raced from the course in a panic after learning his
home in Orlando had burned to the ground. His family was not
injured, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Hjertstedt, whose only previous victory was the 1997 BC Open,
gave a share of credit to his strength coach, Boris Kuzmic, and his
brother/caddie, Henric, for pumping him up for the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of hard work into the off-season, practicing
with Vijay (Singh), Jim Furyk and Duval. Boris has helped me add
about 25 yards off the tee, and I'm not tired anymore when I get
done playing,'' Hjertstedt said. ``I'm just trying everything I can
to get an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hjertstedt said Henric ``was working for free'' and would not
receive the usual 7 percent caddie fee. In fact, he wasn't even
going to buy his little brother a beer, even though Sunday was
Henric's 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not old enough,'' Hjertstedt deadpanned, showing that
some Swedes do have a sense of humor, even if most Americans can't
pronounce their names.

SWIFT OUT TO PROVE HE'S STILL A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Stan Williams gave up too soon. It was 1972, the
dying days of ownership's choker hold on players' salaries, and he
was tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams still loved the game, but he felt he had to leave it to
make a decent living. Though he went 17-6 in his final two full
seasons, Williams never threw a pitch after his 32nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams spent one year in misery as a stockbroker. When he came
back to baseball as a Class AA manager, it was his most enjoyable
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I wish I had stayed with it and pitched
longer,'' said Williams, the Mariners' pitching coach. ``I miss it
today. I still miss the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams' pupils on the Mariners is Bill Swift, who
decided this winter to avoid such regrets. A 37-year-old
right-hander with a history of injuries, Swift attracted minimal
interest on the free agent market. Most teams said they'd get back
to him if they didn't get the pitchers they wanted most. It was an
invitation to retire.
</P>
<P>
   But Swift wasn't ready to leave. He was pleased with his 1998
season, in which he went 11-9 and made 26 starts, his most in five
years. So he accepted a minor-league contract from the Mariners on
Jan. 11, the last day the team could sign him before losing its
rights to him for months.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling my wife about it,'' Swift said. ``How many guys
retire after having a good year? It's not that many. It's just in
you. When you do good, you just want to keep going back. Finishing
on a high note like Michael Jordan, he's an exception. But in
baseball, most of the guys retire once they stop getting guys out
or they can't hit anymore. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift is in camp as the leading candidate for the fifth spot in
the Mariner rotation, the oldest of six pitchers vying for the job.
He is eager for the exhibition games to begin because he wants to
find out how much he has left.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by last year, Swift should be useful. He grew tired at
the end, pitching only four innings in September, but he stayed
healthy all season for the first time since 1993. Swift went 21-8
that year for the San Francisco Giants, fulfilling the promise he'd
shown in Seattle before being dealt in the Kevin Mitchell trade
after the '91 season.
</P>
<P>
   Swift was on the disabled list seven times between 1994 and '97,
mostly with shoulder problems. The injuries robbed him of his best
stuff: the good, hard sinker that was his out pitch, and the
low-90s fastball he could throw with confidence when behind in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, his former self comes back to visit for a
pitch or two. But Swift has learned to adjust, and it's the reason
he's still pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still missing that zip that I used to have,'' he said.
``It makes a big difference. I'm able to locate the stuff I have
now, but you lose that little extra that you can jam a guy with or
throw by somebody. It's not there, so I have to work on my other
stuff to counter that. I can tell it's just not the old Bill Swift,
but I'm getting older and it's not quite there.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift threw more than 103 pitches only once last year and never
worked past the seventh inning. Opposing hitters batted .306 off
him, and his ERA was 5.87. Still, he gave the Mariners more than
they hoped for when they signed him after a five-minute audition
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have expected him to do what he did?'' said Woody
Woodward, M's vice president of baseball operations. ``He did an
excellent job for us. We didn't expect him to be that strong.''
</P>
<P>
   If the workout hadn't gone well, Swift said he likely would have
retired. The Dodgers wanted to see him pitch, but with a home in
Arizona, Swift didn't want to go to a team that trained in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to return this year to the Mariners, where coaches
know him and know he's effective when used regularly. Swift was 6-1
when pitching on four days' rest last year, and if he makes the
rotation, the M's will try to keep him on a set routine.
</P>
<P>
   The question, Swift knows, is health, and he does as much as he
can to keep fit. The Mariners administer a stress test in spring
training to measure what kind of shape each player is in, with
scores directly related to the amount of training a player does.
Swift trailed only Alex Rodriguez and Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Billy's age, that's even more remarkable than Alex,''
trainer Rick Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Swift will go only as far as his shoulder allows. He will
pitch if he's healthy, but he doesn't intend to finish his career
on a training table, constantly being worked on to keep pitching.
After making up his mind to continue his career, Swift wants the
game to tell him when he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is to go out in the games here and get people
out, show them I can still do that,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm out there and I'm struggling, then obviously I'll be
home when these guys go north. It's in the back of my mind, but I
don't worry about it. If I do retire, it's over and you start a new
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition season starts Thursday.

QUESTIONS MOUNT FOR HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the matter of a month, the Huskies have gone
from exclamation points to question marks.
</P>
<P>
   Winning eight of nine Pac-10 men's basketball games during one
stretch, they were compared to the conference's best teams.
</P>
<P>
   You used to watch Washington in wonder. But the Huskies have
lost four of their past five games. Now you watch and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Are they this bad? Were they that good? Will they make the NCAA
tournament? The NIT? Or will Saturday's game against Washington
State be their final game of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Washington has provided the best answers in the locker
room. On the court, the responses have been inaudible, inexplicable
and, to coach Bob Bender, inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, you never know which team is going to show up, the A
team or the B team,'' said reserve guard Bryan Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the B team clashed with USC and UCLA and
committed 53 turnovers, shot horrendously and looked like strangers
to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, though, is still 16-11 overall and 9-8 in Pac-10
play. Everyone involved with the team seems to be banking on a
fourth-place finish being enough to sway the NCAA tournament
selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington must first beat WSU on Saturday. The factors that
favor the Huskies are these: they are playing at Edmundson
Pavilion, and the Cougars are the Pac-10's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential problems: In their first meeting, WSU
stunned Washington 72-71 in Spokane. The Cougars should be loose
and the Huskies tight, with everything to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Even if WSU wins, ESPN analyst Digger Phelps said Saturday
night, Washington deserves to go to the NCAA tournament if it
remains in fourth place. But Oregon or Cal, both 7-9, could still
tie the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington wins, UCLA coach Steve Lavin believes UW will
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten-and-8 in the premier conference in the country should be
enough to get to the tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As baffling as the Huskies seem to be, the Bruins simplified the
take on Washington. It's not lack of effort, ballhandling and
perimeter shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a much better team at home than on the road,'' said
Travis Reed, who scored 10 points off the bench in UCLA's 79-62
victory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Of Washington's last four losses, three were on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're at home, they're more confident with their
shooting,'' Lavin said. ``All teams in our conference struggle
playing on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies shot 54.5 percent when they beat UCLA 93-83 on Jan.
31 at Hec Ed compared to 39.6 percent Saturday at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown offered another theory _ complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got too comfortable,'' he said. ``We made a run and thought
we would coast right in. Obviously, that's not happening. We've got
to play through the whole season. Hopefully we'll come back and put
the punishment on Wazzu.''
</P>
<P>
   A trend is developing that is troublesome for Washington.
Opponents are crowding center Todd MacCulloch, preventing the
nation's leading field-goal percentage shooter from catching the
ball or attempting a shot. After scoring 26 points and hoisting 14
shots against UCLA at Hec Ed, MacCulloch was limited to 10 points
and five attempts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are collapsing on MacCulloch and conceding outside shots.
Washington is not retaliating, Deon Luton and Donald Watts only
sporadically foiling the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking good shots,'' Bender said. ``They're just
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers are something else. Washington can't cope with
full-court pressure. Bender drills his team, shows his players how
to break the traps. Some teams beat the pressure and create easy
buckets. Not Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The offense starts with point guard Senque Carey. He accepts the
challenge and responsibility but is struggling lately, unsure
what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get other people involved early,'' he said.
``Maybe I'm not as aggressive. I'm getting tired, but that's not an
excuse at all. I'm going to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Washington must do now. Ultimately, these problems
could be beneficial if, for instance, they figure out how to
counter the MacCulloch defensive tactics. Also, Bender has been
searching for contributors _ reinserting Thalo Green into the
starting lineup, getting quality time from Greg Clark against USC
and Brown against UCLA. These discoveries will lengthen the
rotation and strengthen the team if the Huskies advance to the
NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, looking like his father, former Sonic Fred, hit three
3-pointers and had two spectacular assists. He brought Washington
back from a 21-point deficit and nearly helped the Huskies make a
game of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he hit a couple, I was like: `Who's that?''' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make the scouting report,'' Lavin said. ``But I knew
through the genes he was a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has many, according to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 is rough,'' he said. ``They're still a legitimate
Sweet 16 team if they get on a roll, if MacCulloch starts to
destroy, if Luton and Watts start hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   So many ifs, so little time.

KITNA ITCHING TO PROVE HE IS HAWKS' MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Jon Kitna is pumped.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new, of course. The only remaining quarterback on
the Seahawks' roster was born fired up, and it is the excitement he
can generate and his own excitability that make it so easy for
fans, teammates and coaches to like him as a person and a player.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different, because so much about the Seahawks has
changed with the arrival of new general manager and head coach Mike
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new offense, one that plays to Kitna's strengths.
There's renewed optimism that this team finally can make the
playoffs after a 10-year absence, the longest drought in the NFL.
There's the opportunity to be the starter that Kitna has longed for
since signing with the Seahawks in 1996 as an undrafted free agent
from Central Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been this excited about football since probably
going into my junior year in college,'' Kitna said. ``I can't wait.
I cannot wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the season started today,'' he added. ``I think I'd
have a pretty good chance to be the starter if it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna punctuated that statement with a burst of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is funny how things have worked out. When veteran
quarterbacks Warren Moon and John Friesz were released last month,
it left only Kitna. That will change. Holmgren is looking to sign a
young veteran in free agency, select one quarterback in the draft
and then add a fourth by signing another college passer after the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren doesn't want to simply anoint Kitna the starter. It
could create too much pressure for a player who was a Seahawks fan
while growing up in Tacoma and has started all of six games in his
first three seasons _ the final five in 1998 and one in 1997. It
also isn't the way Holmgren does things. He wants Kitna to win the
job with his performances in minicamps and his play in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I know I'm going to have a chance to compete and
that's all I've really asked for since the start _ just an open
chance to compete,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna has come a long way. Just three years ago, he was
preparing to be a high school math teacher and had to be talked
into going to a workout with the Seahawks. Two years ago, he led
the Barcelona Dragons to the World League championship. Six months
ago, he was No. 3 on the depth chart behind Moon and Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking about it the other day. I remember my
first interview in training camp (in 1996) and I was, like, `Why
are these guys interviewing me?' You know how thankful I was just
to be in that situation?'' he said. ``Now, it's more than that. I
know I'm going to have to take advantage of things and guys are
expecting me to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna also is excited about meeting that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that helps me,'' he said. ``The last couple of years,
while I worked hard, I don't think I've worked as hard as I can,
especially in the offseason. I worked hard, but not as hard as I
could because I knew in the back of my mind, `Hey, they're not
expecting much out of me this year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now the voices Kitna hears are those of his teammates and new
coaches saying they expect big things from him next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Kitna can play. He proved that this season,'' said running
back Ricky Watters, who played for Holmgren when the Seahawks' new
coach was offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers.
``That's when Mike is probably at his best _ getting young
quarterbacks ready to be stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon already has a lot of confidence. He already has a lot of
poise. He already has a good field presence,'' Watters said. ``But
anything that's missing, Mike will fill in those gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The process already has begun. Kitna has been working out with
new strength and conditioning coach Kent Johnson, and meeting with
new offensive coordinator Mike Sherman and new quarterbacks coach
Mike Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just meeting with those guys and seeing the confidence in
their eyes, not in me, but just in themselves, it gets you fired
up,'' Kitna said. ``And just talking with coach Sheppard about
changing little things here and there that he thinks will help, I
can't say how excited I am. I hope we have five, six minicamps. As
much as I can absorb and learn, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's interest in free agents Doug Pederson (who signed
with the Philadelphia Eagles) and Gus Frerotte (who visited the
Seahawks last week) does not mean he is dissatisfied with Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Kitna has a lot of the good stuff,'' Holmgren said. ``I
like Jon's throwing motion, and he's got a good enough arm. In a
perfect world, I'd like him to get a little more juice on the ball
in some throws ... and you can work with a guy's hips and his steps
and his body mechanics to help that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create a competitive situation, and Jon knows
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna does understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely interested because those are the guys I'm going
to be working with,'' Kitna said of the team's ongoing search for a
free agent quarterback, ``but I don't rush to get up in the morning
to look at the paper and see who might be coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is focusing his energy elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is my chance, I'm definitely looking forward to it and
planning to make the most of it.''

UW BASKETBALL SQUADS TESTING SELECTORS' GRACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is extremely tough to be tough on the University of
Washington basketball programs. Girl Dawgs. Boy Dawgs. Whatever.
Former underdawgs still have a way of getting to you. The dangers
of sentimentality run amok.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, because of the Billy Joe Hoberts, the sanctions,
the Don James quitting, the Jim Lambright firing and Rick
Neuheisel's stinky little messes, we could dig at the football
program from now until the monsoons stop _ which could be never,
considering the downright Biblical hail storm that swept through
Seattle on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the UW football program can take it. It makes all
the money, packs the 72,000-seat stadium on Montlake, brings ABC to
town for key college football Saturdays, and generally, Husky
football stands as tall as any of this town's pro sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Winter and spring at Washington, though, have been all about
trying to get somewhere remotely close to football's feverish
pitch. And certainly there is more than enough reason to extend
lofty expectations to basketball. Or so we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Husky basketball coach Bob Bender is seen as Superman, able to
resuscitate the respectability of the Marv Harshman years. UW
women's coach June Daugherty is bent on creating a run-and-gun
sequel to Chris Gobrecht's era of defensive prowess _ an 11-year
reign in which Washington was one of the NCAA's early leaders in
women's basketball popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Bender's arrival six years ago, the men's and
women's programs have been the Little Engines That Could, chugging
up the national RPI power rankings and giving us basketball junkies
hope that March, if not mad, certainly won't be a bust.
</P>
<P>
   So, then, what are we to make of all this disappointment this
season?
</P>
<P>
   The women (14-12, 10-7 Pac-10), who have for more than a decade
been trying to break through to a new level _ wasn't it just a few
years ago that Washington was aspiring to be an Elite 8 or Final
Four program? _ might have played themselves back into the good
graces of the NCAA tournament selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Husky women's 96-85 win Saturday over UCLA was good and
important, except that it put dreaded Oregon on top of the Pac-10
standings _ something no good Husky can claim as a laudable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it should not be this close of a call for the women
Dawgs.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get to the NCAA tournament with seniors Jamie Redd,
Amber Hall, Malinda Lynch and Molly Hills, what are Daugherty's
prospects next season?
</P>
<P>
   Redd, despite a rocky few years during the coaching change that
saw Husky women's basketball do a 180-degree turn in philosophy and
personality, is a gifted offensive player who can break open a
game. Hall, who has played through knee and ankle pains that would
have sidelined most NBA stars, made rebounding and junk points an
art form.
</P>
<P>
   But these women Dawgs are backing into March. Same for the men
(16-11, 9-8 in the Pac-10).
</P>
<P>
   If you can't breeze into the NCAA tournament with seniors Todd
MacCulloch and Donald Watts, what are Bender's prospects for
1999-2000?
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch is a unique commodity. He is the national leader in
field-goal percentage. He's got the soft paws, as TV analyst Bill
Raftery marveled last March, when the Huskies got so inexplicably
hot, making it all the way to the NCAA Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, despite lapses in scoring, is as skilled a guard as
Washington will ever get, even though he was one of the Dawgs who
suffered third-degree burns in Los Angeles Saturday as Bruins
sensation Baron Davis went slam-crazy in a highlight festival of
sidewinders and behind-the-back passes to himself on eye-popping
fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   All this at the expense of the poor Huskies, who finished the
weekend 0-2 in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few ugly questions to ponder as March dawns and the
only sense of madness we've got is why the Husky men or women
didn't do a better job of arriving at tournament time with more
solid ground under their feet?
</P>
<P>
   During this strange season, the men beat Arizona and UCLA, but
lost to Cal, Washington State and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The women got in good jabs against Stanford and the Bruins, but
lost to Cal and Arizona State and twice to Arizona and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Coming down to the final week of Pac-10 action, the Husky men
and women each have one game left against Washington State. As long
as they beat the Cougars, the two Dawg teams probably have just
enough star power to squeeze out gracious nods from the selection
committees.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch and Watts are good TV, although now they might be
dealt to Carolina to take on Duke in some lambs-to-the-lions
first-rounder. The women, with their luck, will be in the region of
the No. 1 Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting in, by the skins of their teeth, is not what anyone
around here had in mind for the Dawgs, who should not be such
underdawgs anymore.

A FOX CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Rick Fox gave up guaranteed millions and
guaranteed minutes to return to Los Angeles, and what did he get
for his trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Bad shoe insoles. Bone spurs in his foot. A $71 million phenom.
A multipierced, multitattooed rebounder. All of them conspiring to
make an endangered species out of Fox, or at least his playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was Sunday, healthy but glued to the bench for the
entire first half _ a dubious first in his year-plus as a Los
Angeles Laker _ a victim of a sudden oversupply of big men. Buried
but not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Fox made a late debut midway through the third quarter, then
scored 21 points in the final 16 minutes to lead the Lakers to an
impressive 106-90 victory over the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   And in an imperfect season for himself and his team, Fox was
perfection embodied: 7 for 7 from the field, 5 for 5 on 3-pointers,
and you could overlook the one missed free throw in three tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did an absolutely fabulous job,'' said Lakers coach Kurt
Rambis, whose team won its third straight and second since Rambis
took charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous isn't the way Fox would describe the year so far. He
opened the season with sore feet caused by new athletic insoles,
developed bone spurs in his right foot, then was felled by the flu.
In the meantime, $71-million man Kobe Bryant blossomed into a
bigger star and Fox lost the position where he started all 82 games
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dennis Rodman arrived, and to unclog the power-forward
glut, Rambis moved Robert Horry to small forward. Suddenly, Fox was
third on the depth chart and a DNP for the first 29 minutes of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   And then he was the best weapon on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt at that time, and I don't know if there was any
logic to any of it, but it was just a feeling that I needed a punch
from Rick scoring,'' Rambis said. ``He had struggled earlier (in
the season), but as of late we spent some time working on his shot
and he feels very good about himself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As do the Lakers, who continue to push the three-game losing
streak and the tumult of last week's coaching change behind them.
After a pair of gimme victories against the Clippers, they needed a
win against a legitimate power to legitimize their apparent
progress.
</P>
<P>
   And they needed Fox to regain his shooting touch and confidence
to get it. The Rockets had a 64-59 edge when he checked in for
Bryant, and the Lakers responded with a 10-0 run that included a
three-point play from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Then he nearly beat the Rockets singlehandedly in the final
frame, scoring 15 of the Lakers' 29 points and helping hold Scottie
Pippen and friends to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said of Fox's
performance. ``With another threat besides Kobe and Shaq (O'Neal),
that's what they need, that's what we all need.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his foot is a concern and he understands if Rambis uses
him judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play 48 minutes or five minutes or two minutes or
just sit there and cheer for the team, really,'' Fox said. ``I know
what I'm capable of doing and whenever he asks me to go out there
and perform, I'll be ready. . . . I wasn't sure if I was going to
get to play. I was more or less watching the game and being ready,
and I kept telling myself to keep mentally in the game because a
lot of strange things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging for the Lakers: a rejuvenated fast break that
scored 23 points, another double-figure rebound outing from Rodman
and a team shooting percentage of 54.8 despite Bryant's 8-for-20
day. And the Lakers won a Sunday NBC game for the first time in
four tries.
</P>
<P>
   The bench also had one of its best games, with nine points from
Derek Fisher and seven from Sean Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I felt as confident as I have all season _ really
more,'' Fisher said. ``Today was a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for the entire team.

NEW CAST PUTS ON SHOW FOR JORDAN AND FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ He got his Hollywood ending, but it was in
Utah. So Sunday afternoon Michael Jordan returned to the Forum for
the fond farewell the Lakers had effectively denied him by
imploding against Utah in last spring's Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   He got his standing ovation and a reunion of sorts with former
teammates Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. The Lakers got a look
at what might have been, if only last spring could have been
re-shot, like in the movies, with the new cast that Jerry Buss and
Jerry West have assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley is going to hate us for saying this, but if the
Lakers had displayed as much energy and selflessness against the
Jazz as they did in their nationally televised matinee against
Houston, it very well could have been Jordan's Chicago Bulls
against the Lakers for all the 1998 NBA Finals ratings records.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers flew by the Rockets 106-90 with the help
of someone who spent three seasons in the trenches in Chicago
playing Edward Burns to Jordan's Tom Hanks. Rodman led the team in
rebounding for the second time in as many games as a Laker and was
even spotted doing something rarely seen while he was helping the
Bulls to three consecutive NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   That would be talk to Jordan. Their exchange took place with a
minute left in the first half and the Lakers ahead by four. Rodman
was stretched out in front of the scorer's table, a few feet to the
left of Jordan's courtside seat alongside Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation, Rodman said, went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan: ``Man, I thought you'd never get married.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who recently wed actress Carmen Electra: ``Yeah, bro,
well, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   What, you thought they'd talk about L.A.'s golf courses?
</P>
<P>
   Now, Barkley and Jordan, that's another story. The last time the
two best buddies graced the same piece of California real estate
was during the Bob Hope Desert Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, Barkley looked like he was having a lot more fun
playing very bad golf in Palm Springs than pretty decent basketball
in his first game back since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his
left knee on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley finished with six rebounds and 14 points. His best shots
came before the opening tipoff when he sat in street clothes in the
visitors' locker room and spoke of the Lakers as though they were
the NBA's emperor with no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC thinks just because they show the Lakers on TV every week
that it makes them good,'' Barkley barked. ``I'm sick of the L.A.
press telling Kobe that he's Jordanesque so much that he's
believing it. Well, they're not and he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that in Year One A.M. (after Michael), the Lakers have
been as much a fixture on Sundays as ``60 Minutes.'' This was their
fourth nationally televised Sunday game in as many weeks. They lost
the other three, but that was before Kurt Rambis got the Lakers'
undivided attention and Rodman became something other than a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   All the preaching about playing hard-nosed defense and making
the extra pass on offense that fell on deaf ears when Del Harris
was at the pulpit suddenly is drawing hallelujahs all around.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Harris get booted from the building, the players
don't need a charismatic speaker to move them. Rambis could
communicate in sign language right now and get positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys don't want to seem like it's them that's the problem,''
said guard Eddie Jones, so ``guys are making the extra effort.''
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true on defense. The Lakers had four blocked
shots (to the Rockets' none) and outscored the Rockets on the fast
break 23-8.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led the parade to the basket with 22 points,
but on this day unlike so many others, there were ample scoring
options when he was being double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox came off the bench in the second half and made all five
3-pointers he tried on his way to 21 points. Jones had an
all-around solid game, with 13 points, four rebounds, three steals
and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant missed eight of his first 12 shots on the way to 18
points but was a burr in Pippen's side defensively from the start,
just like in the first game of the season. In the end, Bryant
outscored Pippen 18-16.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal stated what was self-evident to anyone in the crowd of
17,505 when he said: ``We're having fun and playing a lot looser.
We are going to more options instead of doing what everybody
expects us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing, though, to play with energy and emotion when
Michael Jordan is in the building, a national-television audience
is tuned in and their most outspoken critic is on the court. A
truer test for the Lakers than the game just played are the four
that follow: tonight and Wednesday against Phoenix, Friday against
Seattle and Sunday in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention the Lakers' game against the Jazz will be
televised on NBC?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Barkley doesn't see why the network can't fall in
love with Portland. Nothing he saw on this day from the Lakers
moved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't show me anything,'' Barkley said with a sniff,
``except that Rick Fox needs a raise.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's always embarrassing when one of the world's
most sophisticated law enforcement agencies _ a k a the LAPD _ gets
scammed at the very highest levels, but that's exactly what
happened, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   And from a public appearances standpoint it could hardly be
worse, police acknowledged last week.
</P>
<P>
   William Patrick Bentley, 38, of suburban Tarzana so impressed
the top brass with his volunteer work over the years that one of
the department's charity arms, the Los Angeles Police Memorial
Foundation, never questioned a recommendation to pay him about
$60,000 to act as the first coordinator of its 28th annual
Police-Celebrity Golf Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And what an event he supposedly lined up: Actor Tom Cruise was
to be host of the May 15 tourney, and Fox Sports was to broadcast
it live from the Rancho Park course in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Only it wasn't true, according to court records and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley was arrested and charged with three felony counts Feb.
12, including a grand theft allegation that he took about $30,000
in payments under ``false pretenses,'' and two forgery counts.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Friday with the Daily News, Bentley said he
has been unfairly accused and that his former supporters, Chief
Bernard C. Parks and Parks' wife, Bobbie, have ``cut me loose like
a red-headed stepchild.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he established a solid three-year track record as a
volunteer with the foundation and had arranged numerous celebrity
appearances in the past. He said the tournament agreement only
required him to get a host but did not state who the host had to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a case of getting on several people's bad side,
and the chief and his wife are afraid to do anything about it
because of how it would look later on,'' Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   While both the Parkses said they know Bentley, the chief said
the central issue was his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is that when you try to be open and to encourage
volunteerism, you, like other people, can get duped,'' Parks said.
``We weren't as astute as we could have been either in looking into
his background.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation that agreed to hire Bentley is made up of about
20 LAPD top commanders and civic leaders, with Parks its second
vice president, according to records and interviews. It has raised
over $6 million since 1972 to help the widows and orphans of slain
officers, as well as to provide crisis assistance to sworn and
long-term civilian employees.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was not present at last summer's meeting when the
foundation's current executive director, Alan Atkins, recommended
Bentley for the job, and the matter was decided without a formal
vote, said Atkins, a retired Los Angeles Police Department
sergeant. There was no contract, according to Atkins, but Bentley
disputes that, saying the contract was signed but that he never got
a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley, whom police subsequently discovered had a Georgia
arrest record, is free on $20,000 bail, pending a March 12
arraignment in Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   His Los Angeles lawyer, Cathe Caraway, said Bentley's past brush
with the law was of no consequence and that the charges against him
were dropped almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more to this story,'' she said, declining
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said his prior arrest was in connection with a bad
check, which had been cleared up prior to the arrest _ and that the
misunderstanding was cleared up in a matter of hours, with an
apology. He said he even told the LAPD about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defense attorney Ira Chester of Los Angeles, who has
spoken with Bentley but has not yet been retained, suggested an
LAPD investigation of alleged crimes involving its own memorial
fund _ laden as it is with emotional meaning for police officers _
is on its face improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What police officer could investigate the widows and orphans
fund in an unbiased manner?'' Chester said. ``Then they present the
investigation to the DA, who they work with all the time. There is
an inherent conflict of interest, tainting the whole thing from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Gregson Somes said the decision to file
felony charges stemmed from the extent of the alleged deception and
amount of money involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the totality of the circumstances,'' added
Detective Steve Kirby, who handled the case in the LAPD's financial
crimes division. ``He deceived the people he was reporting to as to
what he had accomplished. It was theft under false premises and two
forgeries. This was not just some little slap on the hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkins and others said Bentley had a convincing style, both
personable and friendly. He made an effort to know police officers
and their families, and paid particular attention to Bobbie Parks,
one police source said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Atkins, ``Patrick was a very likable person, and there was
nothing to indicate it wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said he and Atkins crossed paths over the golf
tournament but that he considered Bobbie Parks to be a ``good
friend, until this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley added he spent innumerable hours volunteering on ``a
whole cadre'' of jobs for the LAPD. As such, he was a common
presence at downtown's Parker Center, where he helped coordinate
events with department officials, police said.

</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   His background wasn't checked because the law limits such checks
to a ``need and right to know,'' usually reserved for more
sensitive police positions, said Cmdr. Dave Kalish, department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to run to the computer on everyone who
volunteers,'' Parks said. ``And he seemed to have decent
credentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said he was so trusted by the chief's wife that she
asked him to run the Major Cities Chiefs Winter Conference, which
was held at Universal City on Feb. 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way, I cleared everything with the chief,
Mrs. Parks or (deputy) chief Moore,'' Bentley said. ``The boss was
Mrs. Parks. This was her event.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Parks, who was on the conference-organizing committee,
said that while she knew Bentley and his wife, she did not know how
Bentley became involved with the conference nor to what extent he
participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew him; you had to know him if you were in the Police
Department,'' Bobbie Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Maurice Moore, special assistant to the chief and
the department's point person overseeing the conference for
Canadian and U.S. law enforcement officials, said it is unclear
whether Bentley had a formal contract to do conference work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some involvement, but whether it was a formal contract
or not, that has yet to be resolved,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said he raised $48,000, of which his share was to be
about $10,500. He said that since he's been terminated _ which
occurred at the outset of the golf tournament investigation _ he
hasn't been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, the detective in charge of the case, said some of
Bentley's other activities in connection with the LAPD have been
reviewed but that no other criminal activity has been alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Public affairs personnel began to suspect something was wrong
because Bentley's ``progress reports'' on the golf tournament
seemed too good to be true, especially when he promised Tom Cruise
as the top draw, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley declined to discuss the Cruise situation, except to say
the contract did not call for a particular celebrity and that in
past years substitutes have been made when the keynote star could
not make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns raised within the department and carried up the
chain of command to Parks, and a decision was made to turn the
matter over to financial crimes division, Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   The golf tournament, which last year assisted 96 families, has
been patched together with Dennis Franz from the television series
``NYPD Blue'' as the headliner, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the last-minute shakeup has left them shaken at what,
left undetected, might have jeopardized the golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a good experience,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley agrees, but for far different reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not,'' he added, ``a con man.''

GARDNER MISS SINKS PEPPERDINE

<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jelani Gardner missed a potential tying
3-pointer with six seconds left and the Pepperdine men's basketball
team lost 58-54 to Santa Clara in the semifinals of the West Coast
Conference Tournament on Sunday night at Toso Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (19-12) was bidding for its first WCC
Tournament-final appearance since 1994. The Waves were burned by
hot 3-point shooting by the Broncos, who shot 77 percent (10 of 13)
from beyond the arc in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, which advanced to tonight's championship against
top-seeded Gonzaga, improved to 14-14. The Broncos took the lead
for good, appropriately enough, from behind the arc. Delano
D'Oyen's 3-pointer made it 55-52 with 2:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves could only manage two free throws the rest of the way.
Gardner, a two-time All-WCC pick who could have played his final
college game, finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs led the Waves with 17 points and seven rebounds. He
was a force offensively in the paint to start the second half,
scoring the Waves' first 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine came out better defensively than it did in its
first-round win over San Francisco. USF only had nine turnovers the
entire game on Saturday, but Pepperdine forced Santa Clara into
exactly that many in the first half and 17 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Marc McDowell's 15-footer with five seconds left gave the Waves
a hard-fought 30-29 halftime lead. Despite the turnovers, the
Broncos led most of the half thanks to 3-point shooting; six of
Santa Clara's eight field goals in the half were threes.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara was 6 of 9 from beyond the arc in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, as it did against USF, jumped out to a quick
first-half lead. Gibbs scored the first five points of the game and
the Waves eventually took a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who sat on the visitors' bench in their home arena,
didn't have much offense in the game's first 7{ minutes: two
3-pointers from Nathan Fast.
</P>
<P>
   Fast, a junior guard and the Broncos' leading scorer in the
regular season, had a team-high 19 points. D'Oyen had 15, all on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara was playing without second-leading rebounder Todd
Wuschnig, who experienced an irregular heartbeat in Saturday's
first-round game against Loyola Marymount. The Broncos still
managed to outrebound the Waves 29-23.
</P>
<P>
   In the other WCC semifinal:
</P>
<P>
   __ Gonzaga 70, St. Mary's 57: The top-seeded Bulldogs (24-6)
built a 37-22 halftime lead and held on to eliminate the Gaels
(13-18), who got a tournament-high 31 points from guard Frank
Allocco.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 Gonzaga players scored, led by Matt Santangelo's 15.

Sequel to Rodzilla makes big box office
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Fran Blinebury
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Charles Barkley's complaint is NBC has
fallen in love with the Lakers and is trying to turn them into a
weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   The last time the network gave a handful of off-balance,
self-centered egos a regular slot in the lineup, Seinfeld became a
big hit and everybody went home fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   So add Dennis Rodman to the most dysfunctional family this side
of daytime television, and the potential for weirdness could not be
quantified with the world's longest tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-dressing rebounders with bad memories _ today on the
Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   When his 26 minutes of action were completed with 10 rebounds,
two points and a bevy of elbows and shoves in the Lakers' 106-90
victory over the Rockets on Sunday, Rodman stopped for a chat at
midcourt with NBC's Ahmad Rashad that produced this sentimental,
post-Valentine keepsake:
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: ``I want to say hello to my wife uh ''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad: ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: `` uh yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the NBA in the post-lockout, play-it-in-fast-forward
schedule and in the dawning of the after-Jordan Era of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, these are the 21st century Lakers so desperate for
leadership and direction they have turned to the guru of goofdom,
which is like going to see Dr. Kevorkian for an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   These are the days when the old Lakers _ Magic, Kareem and
Worthy _ must wish they were dead, so at least they could turn over
in their graves.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers of five championships in the 1980s used to be
Showtime. Then they became the Lake Show. Now they are the Freak
Show.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hollywood, nothing sells like way-over-the-top excess.
Which is why the roll call of celebrities at the Great Western
Forum went well beyond regulars Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon, who
are as permanent a part of the place as the plumbing fixtures.
There was Penny Marshall down along the baseline and Greg Kinnear
in a midcourt seat. Jon Lovitz inexplicably found a comfy spot on
the floor at Kinnear's feet, and Lou Gossett Jr. stood behind one
basket and pumped his fist.
</P>
<P>
   What, no Monica Lewinsky dancing with the Laker Girls?
</P>
<P>
   But there was Michael Jordan himself, ensconced in the place of
honor next to Nicholson, the king returning to see how the peasants
have been getting on in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the circus was in town, and there might have been a
shortage of rings. Not counting, of course, those in Rodman's ears,
nose and navel.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Lakers team that seven days earlier was in turmoil at
6-6, having just lost a third consecutive Sunday game on NBC. So
they spent the week firing head coach Del Harris, replacing him
with former Clark Kent look-alike Kurt Rambis, signing the bearded
lady in Rodman. They now have won three straight games, including
two against the Clippers and this one over the Rockets, who are in
the getting-acquainted, always-mending stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers got 21 points in 19 minutes off the bench from Rick
Fox, a decent inside game from Shaquille O'Neal and always have had
raw individual talent coming out their ears. But what they have now
_ or at least believe they have _ is a tough attitude about how to
play the game. Brought to them by Rodman, of all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a good basketball team, you have to be
unselfish,'' said the Nutty Professor. ``You have to bite your
tongue and your pride and just go out there and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The sermon from the mount.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are what will become of both these teams by the
time the playoffs arrive in May. By then, the Rockets should at
least know each other upon sight and will be healthy or a pile of
old bones. The Lakers are a tougher riddle, because every day will
produce another set of problems in the NBA's high-profile
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers are still not a championship team,'' Barkley said.
``A week ago, they were .500 and firing their coach. Now they have
about the same record as us. So they have Dennis. He gives them
rebounding. He doesn't make them the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind playing against Dennis. I think he's funny the
way he plays everybody. The guy can cry on request. He's done it
before on Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Now though, only tears of relief from Hollywood, always starved
for a new wild act, convinced the freak show is for real.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any sense of nostalgia being back on the same court
with his former championship buddy Scottie Pippen in another
uniform or playing under the watchful eyes of Jordan, Rodman
wouldn't confess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no special feelings,'' he said. ``I knew (Jordan)
was going to be here. We are all grown men.''
</P>
<P>
   That solves another mystery.

SABERHAGEN IS SOX' MAINTENANCE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Aruba, that was nice. A week at the Super
Bowl with the likes of John Franco, Scott Erickson, J.T. Snow,
Trevor Hoffman, Bobby Bonilla, Kurt Abbott, and Mark Guthrie, not
bad. Pebble Beach, let's not forget that. And how about some time
in Vegas for golf and sun? Sounds pretty good, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, it was a very pleasurable offseason for Bret Saberhagen.
But it was distinguished not so much for what he did, but for what
he didn't do. It would have been a good offseason even if he had
spent his time doing nothing more than sitting around the house
watching Rosie, QVC, and Classic Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Rehab.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen is into maintenance now, not rehabilitation. He spent
the winter of 1998-99 as a viable major league pitcher, not as a
medical project. Only one who has been through the ordeal of
reconstructive surgery _ in his case damn near experimental
reconstructive surgery _ can appreciate what it means to live a
normal athlete's life that does not revolve around tedious and
painful rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been the most successful season of his 14-year
major league career, but it was the most satisfying. Before
defeating the Mariners on April 5, his last big league victory had
come Sept. 26, 1995. He was a Colorado Rockie then, and this was
before his right shoulder basically ripped apart and before the
radical reconstructive surgery of May 28, 1996, that finished him
for the rest of that season and that rendered him a question mark
in terms of ever becoming a major league pitcher again.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago Saberhagen spoke bravely of becoming a pitcher in
the rotation of the 1998 Boston Red Sox. He said he had very high
standards for himself, and that he wouldn't be satisfied unless he
could regain the ability that made him a two-time Cy Young winner
('85 and '89). He wanted to have the same kind of control he had in
1994, when he walked a microscopic 13 men in 177 1/3 innings. He
wanted to be more than just a marginal major league pitcher. He
wanted to be a great one. He said he would settle for nothing less.
You listened to it, you wrote it down, and you printed it. You
didn't have to believe it. You wondered if he did himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know. It was a personal pep talk, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accomplished more than I ever thought I would,'' he says.
``A year ago I had hopes, but I didn't know what would happen. I
would have been very happy if someone had told me I'd have the kind
of year I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was 15-8 with a 3.96 ERA. He was very much his old
self in the control department (100 strikeouts and 29 walks in 175
innings). He was a solid, dependable starter for a team that earned
a wild-card berth. He was the Sporting News American League
Comeback Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated like a fragile piece of pottery by manager Jimy
Williams and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who conspired to limit
his pitches and who cleverly juggled their rotation as often as
possible to give him an extra rest day, or even two, between
starts. At times he was unhappy with what he felt was their
overprotective ways. Now he'd like to say he is very grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of credit to my success last year goes to Jimy and
Joe,'' Saberhagen says. ``They didn't want to overuse me. There
were times I wanted to pitch more, and I let them know. One day Joe
sat me down and said, `Hey, we're in this for the long haul. Never
forget that.' I had to admit that made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   When you've been to the mountaintop, however, it is difficult to
accept stopping at the three-quarter point. Saberhagen has not
abandoned his dream of returning to his old killer status. He is
very much Old School. He was bred to be a nine-inning pitcher. He
was not bred on pitch counts. He will not rest until he is allowed
to shake his catcher's hand at the end of a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have any personal goals in terms of wins and
so forth last year,'' he says, ``but I can tell you I have a
personal goal this year. I want to pitch a complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan already has told him the plan is to allow him a dozen
or so more pitches than the basic 1998 allotment of 100. ``If I'm
going well,'' he says, ``that's at least one more inning. If things
fall into place, that could lead to a complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's his goal, it's a realistic one,'' concurs Kerrigan.
``Last year he averaged approximately 84 pitches a game. He could
throw a 102, 103, 104-pitch complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Saberhagen up close and personal was a very interesting
experience for the pitching coach. ``I was reading Bill Walsh's
book this winter,'' Kerrigan says, ``and in it he talks about the
athletes who have what he calls `functional intelligence,' giving
Joe Montana and Steve Young as examples. Bret Saberhagen very
definitely fits the description. Under times of stress, he knows
exactly what to do and where to go. His use of available pitches in
situations is analogous to a quarterback's ability to see alternate
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Kerrigan loves Saberhagen for his spirit. ``He is
really an old-timer,'' he salutes. ``He is dedicated to the game.
He belongs back in the '50s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen has different numbers in mind. He wants to be in the
100s. That's where the complete games lie.

PANEL TO CRITICIZE USOC 
</HEADLINE>
 OLYMPIC COMMITTEE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States Olympic Committee, already
tarnished by association with the Salt Lake City scandal, will face
criticism Monday from an independent ethics panel for failing to do
more to prevent the abuses that have rocked the Games, sources
familiar with the report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No major new disclosures of wrongdoing are expected in the
report being issued by a five-member commission headed by former
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine. But by calling for an overhaul of
USOC practices, specifically tougher oversight of US cities bidding
to host future Games, the report is expected to demonstrate ways in
which earlier action by the USOC might have spared the Olympics
from the biggest crisis in its modern history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concentrating on making recommendations which, if
adopted, will prevent the kinds of abuses we've seen from happening
in the future,'' Mitchell said Sunday in a telephone interview. He
said the report would not be finished until late in the evening,
and he declined to discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials said Sunday they had not yet seen the report, and
would have no comment until they could thoroughly review it.
Mitchell's commission, though independent, was assembled by the
USOC in December to provide an outside review. The USOC has
scheduled a news conference for Wednesday in Washington to respond
to Mitchell's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission's report comes three weeks after a
separate ethics panel detailed the lavish inducements and
aggressive efforts by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee to win
votes from International Olympic Committee members in its
successful pursuit of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   That 300-page report focused primarily on the actions of two
former Salt Lake Olympic officials, Thomas Welch and David Johnson.
But it also questioned USOC practices and internal controls.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Salt Lake ethics report detailed a 1995 e-mail
correspondence in which Alfredo LaMont, who at the time was
director of international relations for the USOC, discussed with
other senior USOC officials their ``debt to the Sudanese IOC
members.'' A later e-mail from LaMont said the debt was incurred
``to secure votes.'' Another top USOC official endorsed that
interpretation, writing an e-mail saying, ``Seems to me a deal is a
deal and Sudan delivered. . . . May need Sudan again in future.
Don't burn bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail exchange represented the clearest suggestion to date
that USOC officials were more than passive observers in offering
inducements to win the votes of IOC members. In their defense, USOC
officials stressed that the issue being discussed involved a
promise of training programs for Sudanese athletes; they said that
should be viewed far differently than the excesses of the Salt Lake
organizers, such as scholarships to IOC members' children, Super
Bowl excursions for them, and shopping trips for their wives.
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials also noted that they adopted new guidelines for
bid cities in November 1997 _ a year before the scandal surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake ethics report also described how LaMont, while
working for the USOC, entered into private consulting contracts
with the Salt Lake bid committee that funneled money to an IOC
member from Barbados. LaMont resigned from the USOC in January when
his private business dealings became known.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake ethics panel said the USOC should ``exercise
caution not to place bid cities in compromising positions. For
instance, it is clear that the USOC played a role in the (Salt
Lake) bid committee's commitment to train Sudanese athletes. While
there is nothing inherently improper about this kind of
expenditure, it may draw bid cities into . . . assistance programs
that are susceptible to abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   With regard to LaMont's consulting contracts, the Salt Lake
report also chided the USOC, saying the organization should
``ensure that its employees are not involved in private financial
transactions with bid committees,'' which it described as a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although LaMont's activities were covered by the Salt Lake
ethics report, Mitchell's report is expected to focus on them as
well. USOC officials have said they believe existing disclosure
requirements for employees are adequate, and they said they had no
way to prevent secret side deals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, reports also have surfaced about USOC members
accepting questionable gifts and hospitality from Salt Lake City
organizers before choosing the city as a candidate to host the 2002
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mitchell commission report has been eagerly
anticipated, Mitchell has sought to downplay its findings. Last
week, he cautioned the panel's job was made difficult by the
limited amount of time, as well as the refusal by some members of
the Salt Lake bid committee to speak with Mitchell's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Mitchell's report will kick off a month that
Olympic officials hope will mark the beginning of the end of the
turmoil that began in December. An IOC investigative panel spent
last weekend reviewing the Salt Lake City ethics report to decide
whether to recommend more expulsions of members at a March 17-18
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Already nine IOC members have
resigned or been suspended; 10 more were implicated in the Salt
Lake ethics report.

GROSS PROVES A FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ A man can take rejection only so many times.
Then he hops in his truck, slides in an AC-DC tape and cranks up
the volume, drives around for an hour, and decides to go to Japan
to be a Ham Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it worked for Red Sox pitcher Kip Gross,
who could have answered one more summons from the Los Angeles
Dodgers five years ago but had had his fill of such indignities as
this: Being called up to the big leagues to start the first game of
a doubleheader, winning that game against El Presidente, Dennis
Martinez, while collecting two hits, and then being handed a plane
ticket back to the minors between games, before the sweat stains in
his uniform had begun to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he was ready to give it one more shot. At least that's what
he told Rick Dempsey, his manager in Albuquerque, who had taken the
call from the brass back in LA and was waiting for Gross with yet
another shuttle ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Gross tells it, he walked into the clubhouse and
told Dempsey, ``Dude, get somebody else. I'm going to Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross can't remember who went up in his place. ``But that dude
was out of the clubhouse in a heartbeat. He thought I was going to
change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no going back. ``Best decision I ever made in my
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Gross didn't just wing his way to Tokyo without
adequate preparation. ``The Tom Selleck movie, `Mr. Baseball,' had
just come out,'' said Gross, citing the Hollywood treatment of an
American who went to Japan to play ball. ``Actually, Selleck had
invited me to the preview, but I didn't get to go. But you want to
know about Japanese baseball, that's it _ yes, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross, a righthander, said he'd always had a hankering to go to
Japan, especially when it became obvious the Dodgers would never
give him more than the yo-yo treatment. But he figured he'd go just
for two years, three years tops. Enough time to make a nice pile of
cash, then return to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he stayed for five years. Things happened. He won a
bunch of games, including consecutive seasons in which he led the
Japanese Pacific League with 16 and 17 wins. His wife, Jami, loved
it. What was there not to love? The club picked up the tab for a
great apartment right in Tokyo, and the meal money was $320 a day,
which will buy you plenty of whatever passes as the Japanese
version of Denny's Grand Slam breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The Yakota US Air Force base was nearby, a little slice of home
an hour outside of Tokyo. ``We went there all the time,'' he said.
``It was like being back in the States. We had a blast over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kip and Jami also had a daughter born in Tokyo, Harley Alexis,
whose name, Kip swears, has nothing to do with the chopper he keeps
in his garage. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   And perks? Hey, it isn't the same as the States _ imagine, over
in Japan a ballplayer had to polish his own shoes, carry his own
bag, and is lucky if his uniform was washed every other day. But
the team's sponsors couldn't shower Gross with enough gifts. ``Rice
cookers, rice, Cokes, beer _ the gifts were never-ending,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, he said, if you're going to say he played for the
Ham Fighters, then you might as well say Derek Jeter plays for the
York Yankees. ``The name of the team is the Fighters,'' he said.
``It's owned by Nippon Ham. Did they give us free ham? Sure, but
there's only so much ham you can eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the night on the road that some belligerent
passer-by apparently decided to inquire whether Gross was worthy of
his team's name. His idea of posing the question was by wrapping
his hands around the pitcher's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dude was really trashed, and he pushed me,'' Gross said.
``He said, `Get out of my way.' I said, `Cool.' Then he came back,
grabbed my neck, and started choking me. I couldn't breathe, so I
decked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for the American samurai? Not quite.
``Unfortunately, there were 10 more guys right behind him,'' he
said, ``and they just kicked my butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being up against a car trying to protect myself,
when I felt a toe connect right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross pointed to a spot in his rib cage. He found out later that
he'd sustained a broken rib, but for some reason his interpreter
never told the team's manager or trainer. ``Just scared to, I
guess,'' said Gross, who finally told an English-writing newspaper
reporter what happened.
</P>
<P>
   If that had been Gross's only injury in Japan, he'd probably
still be there. But in spring training last year, his arm suddenly
went numb. He had a bone spur in his elbow that was impinging on
the nerve. He had surgery to take out the spur and his first game
back, he figured he'd throw three innings. The team, which was in a
pennant race, asked him to throw six.
</P>
<P>
   He went nine up, nine down the first three innings and put on
his jacket. They asked him to go back out there. He returned to the
mound, and gave up seven runs without retiring a batter. He didn't
pitch badly the rest of the way, but when the season ended, Nippon
Ham decided not to exercise the option year on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   So at 34, Gross would have to earn his bacon elsewhere. Not that
he has ever balked at working for a dollar. Back in Nebraska, where
he grew up, he began working for his bricklayer dad at the age of
12, and was a hod carrier by 14, mixing mortar. ``I don't mind
work,'' he said. ``This is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Red Sox? Heck, he said, Dan Duquette has been after his
agent, Barry Meister, to bring Gross back almost from the time he
first went to Japan. ``I just wanted somebody to be honest with me,
what their plans for me were,'' said Gross, who signed a $350,000
deal with the Sox this winter. ``I don't worry about money in
baseball. I could flip burgers. I just want to come in and help a
team win, and pitch, however they want to use me. I know what I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Gross sees it, he has a shot at the No. 5 job if Pat
Rapp falters. If not, he could pitch out of the bullpen, where one
job appears open. The one thing he won't do is go back to the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen, not when I've got other options
around the corner,'' said Gross, who could wind up back in Japan if
things don't pan out here. Hey, it's not every gaijin (foreign)
pitcher who can speak Japanese with the skill he does.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime? ``I'm in Disneyland, man,'' he said.

UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION, CELTICS PASSING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ Some teams are born for fantasy basketball leagues.
They look great when they aren't playing games. They make you want
to fawn over the considerable skills of their talented players
(hello, Lakers). They make you want to declare them division champs
before they lace a sneaker or palm a basketball (hello, Nets). They
also transform active coaches into fired ones (goodbye, Del
Harris).
</P>
<P>
   No, talented teams don't always win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a situation like that in Dallas with the three Js,''
Popeye Jones said of former Mavericks teammates Jason Kidd, Jim
Jackson, and Jamal Mashburn. ``We had a lot of talent, but we
didn't know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are teams that simply handle tests well. We
aren't talking about the bar exam, SAT, LSAT or MCAS. We're talking
about the tests every NBA team faces in a season. They are tests
that let you know if a team is struggling simply because it doesn't
have enough talent or if it is struggling because it can't balance
talent with heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six days, the Celtics were presented with several of
these NBA examinations. Here's how they did.
</P>
<P>
   Test site: FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: Orlando Magic, Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Player should be able to disprove any theories
of team selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: A verbal confrontation between
Kenny Anderson and Antoine Walker in Washington Feb. 21. Walker had
demanded the ball from Anderson, leading a majority of fans to
reason that Walker was a selfish brat. The Celtics were 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Show your work.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics defeated the Magic, 111-79. They held the
Magic to 35 percent shooting. Penny Hardaway, an All-Star, was
scoreless. And the Celtics dominated the game's most selfless
category, assists. They finished with 32. Walker and Anderson had
eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: ``We had our best two days of practice
before that game,'' Anderson said. ``I was thinking about the
incident. We could have gone either way as a team after that. But
our practices were great, real energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: ``I kept hearing people talk about what was on the
radio and what was said about it in the paper,'' Anderson said,
``but I shelter myself. I don't listen to that stuff or read it.
Good or bad. I stopped being affected by that stuff in my third
year. Now if I pick up a paper, I just go to the business
section.''
</P>
<P>
   Test site: FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: New York Knicks, Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Player should demonstrate ability to win, even
if his shot is not going in the hoop consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: There will be some nights like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological bonus: Player should demonstrate ability to win
without a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for bonus: There will be some nights like that.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics defeated the Knicks, 94-80. They won even
though they shot a dismal 41 percent from the field. They sent a
load of 3-pointers to the rim (25) and watched 15 of them bounce
out and off. Starting shooting guard Ron Mercer did not play
because of a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: Two-tiered. The first unit was too tired
to press effectively, so it launched the 3-pointers. The second
unit, also known as The Bomb Squad, pressed and helped force the
Knick point guards into 11 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: The Knicks played an overtime game the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
   Test site: Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: New Jersey Nets, Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Players should demonstrate ability to handle
several tests simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: The Celtics would be playing for
the second night in a row; they would be playing on the road; they
would be playing without Mercer; they would attempt to take their
record over .500; eventually, they would have to see how rookie
Paul Pierce responded when his 3-point shot wasn't falling.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Multiple choice.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics beat the Nets, 101-92. They won their third
road game of the season after winning only 12 during 1997-98. They
trailed by as many as 14 points, but they took the lead for good in
the fourth quarter. Walker made a jumper to make it 81-80 and
Pierce, who had missed his first five 3-pointers, coolly took his
sixth and made it.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``Did I look nervous?'' _ Pierce talking about his
confidence on his final three.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: Self-preservation. The team had a
shootaround scheduled, but Rick Pitino wisely canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   Huddle talk: ``I've never seen him like that,'' Pitino said of
Walker. ``He wouldn't let us lose. He kept coming back to the
huddle saying, ``We're not going to lose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: The Celtics knew the Nets were entering the game
with a major Standings Complex. They were 2-9. There already was
speculation about coach John Calipari's job and already a player,
Chris Gatling, asking to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   So, do the Celtics have heart?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the heart in the world and still not be able
to make a jump shot,'' Anderson said. ``You can give 100, 200
percent and that shot still isn't going in. You've got to be
balanced. Do I think we have that? Yeah. We're young, but we've got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer will play Monday night against the Nets. So will
Walter McCarty, who will be activated from the injured list. Dwayne
Schintzius (nose, knees) most likely will take his place there.

BRUINS GETTING HEALTHY DOSE OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins are unbeaten in their last four games
(3-0-1). That run has helped them in their playoff race with
Florida (tied with Boston but with three fewer wins and one more
game played), Montreal, and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which the Bruins dispatched, 4-3, Saturday, is now 5
points behind Boston for the eighth spot.
</P>
<P>
   As badly as the Bruins have been hit by injuries (145 man
games), things have been even worse for the Capitals (343).
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's case, coach Pat Burns said a key to the team's
recent success has been its return to good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year it's been like that and now all of a sudden
they're starting to come back and things are starting to settle
down a little bit more,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns acknowledges every game now is crucial and it has helped
the Bruins' cause that they're beating teams in their own
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important, every point you get from now until the
end of the year no matter who you beat is going to be important
with the situation that we're in,'' said Burns. ``I've said that
for the last week, we're going to have to take a run at every
single game. If we do that, we have a chance. We're not going to
win every single one but we're going to have to win more than our
share if we expect to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their recent success, the Bruins were mired in a 2-9-2
stretch and appeared to be headed home for the playoffs. Now, they
are distancing themselves from some of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to put people behind you and keep putting them behind
you and that way you can look ahead instead of thinking, `Oh, no,
here they come,' '' said Steve Heinze. ``You start beating them and
stop looking in the rear-view mirror and instead you're looking
ahead to catch teams.''
</P>
<P>
   What has revved up the Bruins' offense is the play of the new
top line _ Jason Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and Anson Carter.
Carter has brought a new look in place of Sergei Samsonov, who was
given spot duty Saturday after missing two games with a sinus
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergei has great speed and is a great one-on-one player,''
said Allison. ``He can dangle. Anson has good speed too but he's
more of a stronger player down low and he can really come up with
those loose pucks and he has a great shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination has provided a much-needed jolt to the power
play (3 for 5 Saturday). Even more impressive was Byron Dafoe, who
had 33 saves, several in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we've got to get points every night,'' said Dafoe.
``(Washington) is a team that's vying for that eighth spot and it
was a chance for us to put them behind us a little bit as well as
gain ground on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game we have to treat like it's our last one because it
seems like every night we are playing for that eighth spot. Every
game is a playoff game. People might have thought we did better
than most people thought we would last year but our expectations
are a lot higher this year and missing the playoffs is definitely
not in the program. I definitely think we're going to be there at
the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that their confidence is back and they're healthy, the
Bruins are looking ahead rather than obsessing over who is on their
tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing teams and you see them starting to rise
and get closer to you, you want to keep them down as much as
possible,'' said Tim Taylor. ``The more teams below you, the better
chance you have of getting up to the seventh or sixth seeds. We put
ourselves in this situation 10 games ago by not playing real well.
Now we're starting to play better. We can't really worry about
anyone else, we have to worry about ourselves.''

BC LEAVES LASTING IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ At the beginning of the season, they made it
their objective to prove everybody wrong. Picked to finish last in
a preseason poll of Big East coaches, the members of the Boston
College men's basketball team set out to prove they were better
than that. But after Sunday's 78-59 loss to Notre Dame before a
Joyce Center crowd of 9,043, the Eagles wound up proving everybody
right by staggering across the regular-season finish line _ in last
place.
</P>
<P>
   Undermanned and overmatched for much of the season, BC wound up
6-20 _ its first 20-loss campaign since 1989-90 (8-20) _ and 3-15
in the conference to land the dreaded No. 13 seed in the Big East
tournament at Madison Square Garden. The Eagles will face fourth
seed Syracuse at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be a last-place team, but if we're healthy and if a
couple of breaks go our way, then it might be a totally different
scenario,'' said junior forward Michael Cotton. ``If we weren't as
beat up and weren't as tattered as we are, we would've had a better
showing today. But Kenny Harley, I mean he carried us the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cotton playing on a tender right ankle and freshman forward
Brian Ross battling foul trouble, and an aching back and ankle to
boot, sophomore guard Harley led the Eagles by tying his career
high with 21 points on 9-for-17 shooting, including 3 of 6 from
3-point range. However, it wasn't enough to overcome Notre Dame's
low-post tandem of 6-foot-9-inch freshman forward Troy Murphy and
6-11 senior center Phil Hickey, who combined for 38 points and 21
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Making his final home-court appearance on Senior Day, Hickey led
the Fighting Irish (14-15, 8-10), who had all five starters score
in double figures, by scoring 21 points and grabbing 9 rebounds.
Hickey's points matched his career high, set last Feb. 11 against
BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last game so it's pretty emotional,'' said Hickey,
who helped the Irish avenge a 78-67 loss at Conte Forum Jan. 27,
marking the first of BC's three consecutive conference victories
this season. ``You kind of enjoy things more since it's the last
time we get to run out of the locker room. You just sit back and
appreciate how lucky you really are. Coach (John MacLeod) wanted us
to go out on a winning note, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, however, it appeared to be a different story. The
Eagles went on a 10-0 run to rally from a 24-19 deficit to take a
29-24 lead on Harley's stop-and-pop jumper off a turnover. BC went
on to a 34-30 halftime lead and thrice increased it to 6 (36-30,
38-32, and 43-37) in the second half before going into a 4:52
drought between Jonathan Beerbohm's foul-inducing drive and
Harley's 3-pointer with 8:14 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we played a good first 20 minutes,'' said BC coach Al
Skinner. ``But fatigue was a problem and foul trouble was a
problem, but we also missed some shots. We missed an awful lot of
open looks.''

   It enabled Notre Dame to take the lead for good, 47-46, on
Antoni Wyche's breakaway basket with 12:04 left. The Irish extended
it to 56-46 before Harley's trey snapped BC out of its doldrums.
After Murphy (17 points, 12 rebounds) threw down a follow dunk and
Hickey scored back-to-back baskets, Dwayne Pina got it to 62-54
with a free throw. But that was as close as the Eagles got after
Hickey helped extend Notre Dame's lead to 68-54 by tying his career
high when he banked in a leaner just before the shot clock expired
with 2:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we're a 13th seed,'' Harley said. ``That's
why we're hoping to go to the Big East tournament and maybe get an
upset, because we don't play like a 13th seed. And we certainly
don't feel like it.''

   AMHERST, Mass. _ Another victory over a formidable adversary. A
triumph that closed out the regular season on a high note.
Normally, that would mean momentum for a team heading into its
conference's postseason tournament. Whether that is the case for
the University of Massachusetts, a 57-49 winner over Atlantic 10
rival Temple Sunday, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, these are the We-Beat-Kansas-But-Lost-to-Iona
Minutemen. This is the team whose final three contests include a
dramatic win over defending A-10 tourament champ Xavier and the
school's first loss to La Salle since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen (13-15, 9-7) will fare well in the tournament if
they give the effort they did Sunday against the 24th-ranked Owls,
who shot 10 percent from the floor in the second half. Monty Mack
had 18 points, Chris Kirkland 17 points and 7 rebounds, and Lari
Ketner 8 points, 13 rebounds, and 4 blocks for UMass, which is 2-1
against ranked teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen finished third in the A-10 East Division and will
meet Duquesne (5-22, 1-15), which finished sixth in the West
Division, Wednesday at 2 in the first round of the conference
tournament at Philadelphia. The winner meets Xavier, the West
runner-up, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UMass beat both teams this season, routing Duquesne, 69-55, in
Amherst for its third-most lopsided conference victory. But coach
Bruiser Flint said he is not anticipating anything with this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no gray areas with us,'' said Flint. ``Any time we
think we can play just well enough to win we lose. Look at last
Thursday against La Salle. We just have to go out there and
understand this is do-or-die. If we lose we come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple (19-9, 13-3) will have to adjust offensively to the loss
of reserve guard Quincy Wadley, who left the game with 6:14 left in
the first half with a broken ring finger on his left hand. With
6:55 left, Wadley sank a trey to tie the game at 18. Without him,
the Owls had no outside threat.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a trey by Mark Karcher with 1:28 left in the half,
Temple's points came from the inside. But in the second half,
Ketner stepped up an already aggressive interior defense.
</P>
<P>
   Starting guards Pepe Sanchez and Rasheed Brokenborough combined
for 2-of-19 shooting from the floor, including 1 for 16 from
3-point range. Despite the horrid shooting, the Owls trailed only
50-46 with 1:17 left, but the Minutemen made 7 of 10 free throws
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be physical with the big guys and play tough
defense,'' said Ketner, a senior whose last game at the Mullins
Center was one of his best.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen said after the contest they had a players-only
meeting to discuss how they can prevent an early exit in the
tournament. ``We just said that the coaches don't have anything to
do with it and the other team doesn't have anything to do with
it,'' said Ketner. ``If we play like this we'll do well down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Temple coach John Chaney tell it, all the Minutemen need
is continued strong play from Ketner to be the team most everyone
thought they would be. Sunday, the mentor analyzed the overall play
of the much-maligned Ketner with colorful, vintage-Chaney verbiage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not that many centers in the country better, but he's
got to play with his head and not his ass all the time,'' said
Chaney. ``I'm serious. That's his problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play with emotion. When you look straight ahead and
you can only see what's in front of you, you forget your ass has
eyes in it looking at what you just left. That's what happens to
kids. And Ketner's not that kind of guy. Someone has to take a
baseball bat and hit him across the (expletive) head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need him to play basketball if they expect to win games.
You cannot have a guy scoring 6 or 7 points and sit on the bench.
He sits on the bench and helps Bruiser coach all the time. I'm
quite sure he doesn't need any more coaches, especially one that's
7 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those comments, Flint, who played for Chaney in
summer leagues while growing up in Philadelphia, said, ``I've heard
that kind of stuff from him all my life.''

UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION, CELTICS PASSING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Some teams are born for fantasy basketball
leagues. They look great when they aren't playing games. They make
you want to fawn over the considerable skills of their talented
players (hello, Lakers). They make you want to declare them
division champs before they lace a sneaker or palm a basketball
(hello, Nets). They also transform active coaches into fired ones
(goodbye, Del Harris).
</P>
<P>
   No, talented teams don't always win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a situation like that in Dallas with the three Js,''
Popeye Jones said of former Mavericks teammates Jason Kidd, Jim
Jackson, and Jamal Mashburn. ``We had a lot of talent, but we
didn't know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are teams that simply handle tests well. We
aren't talking about the bar exam, SAT, LSAT or MCAS. We're talking
about the tests every NBA team faces in a season. They are tests
that let you know if a team is struggling simply because it doesn't
have enough talent or if it is struggling because it can't balance
talent with heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six days, the Celtics were presented with several of
these NBA examinations. Here's how they did.
</P>
<P>
   Test site: FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: Orlando Magic, Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Player should be able to disprove any theories
of team selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: A verbal confrontation between
Kenny Anderson and Antoine Walker in Washington Feb. 21. Walker had
demanded the ball from Anderson, leading a majority of fans to
reason that Walker was a selfish brat. The Celtics were 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Show your work.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics defeated the Magic, 111-79. They held the
Magic to 35 percent shooting. Penny Hardaway, an All-Star, was
scoreless. And the Celtics dominated the game's most selfless
category, assists. They finished with 32. Walker and Anderson had
eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: ``We had our best two days of practice
before that game,'' Anderson said. ``I was thinking about the
incident. We could have gone either way as a team after that. But
our practices were great, real energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: ``I kept hearing people talk about what was on the
radio and what was said about it in the paper,'' Anderson said,
``but I shelter myself. I don't listen to that stuff or read it.
Good or bad. I stopped being affected by that stuff in my third
year. Now if I pick up a paper, I just go to the business
section.''
</P>
<P>
   Test site: FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: New York Knicks, Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Player should demonstrate ability to win, even
if his shot is not going in the hoop consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: There will be some nights like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological bonus: Player should demonstrate ability to win
without a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for bonus: There will be some nights like that.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics defeated the Knicks, 94-80. They won even
though they shot a dismal 41 percent from the field. They sent a
load of 3-pointers to the rim (25) and watched 15 of them bounce
out and off. Starting shooting guard Ron Mercer did not play
because of a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: Two-tiered. The first unit was too tired
to press effectively, so it launched the 3-pointers. The second
unit, also known as The Bomb Squad, pressed and helped force the
Knick point guards into 11 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: The Knicks played an overtime game the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
   Test site: Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: New Jersey Nets, Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Test objective: Players should demonstrate ability to handle
several tests simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for this type of test: The Celtics would be playing for
the second night in a row; they would be playing on the road; they
would be playing without Mercer; they would attempt to take their
record over .500; eventually, they would have to see how rookie
Paul Pierce responded when his 3-point shot wasn't falling.
</P>
<P>
   Test format: Multiple choice.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The Celtics beat the Nets, 101-92. They won their third
road game of the season after winning only 12 during 1997-98. They
trailed by as many as 14 points, but they took the lead for good in
the fourth quarter. Walker made a jumper to make it 81-80 and
Pierce, who had missed his first five 3-pointers, coolly took his
sixth and made it.
</P>
<P>
   Pass/fail: Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``Did I look nervous?'' _ Pierce talking about his
confidence on his final three.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation technique: Self-preservation. The team had a
shootaround scheduled, but Rick Pitino wisely canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   Huddle talk: ``I've never seen him like that,'' Pitino said of
Walker. ``He wouldn't let us lose. He kept coming back to the
huddle saying, ``We're not going to lose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cheat sheet: The Celtics knew the Nets were entering the game
with a major Standings Complex. They were 2-9. There already was
speculation about coach John Calipari's job and already a player,
Chris Gatling, asking to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   So, do the Celtics have heart?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the heart in the world and still not be able
to make a jump shot,'' Anderson said. ``You can give 100, 200
percent and that shot still isn't going in. You've got to be
balanced. Do I think we have that? Yeah. We're young, but we've got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer will play Monday night against the Nets. So will
Walter McCarty, who will be activated from the injured list. Dwayne
Schintzius (nose, knees) most likely will take his place there.

BC WOMEN SENT PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ It's not as if the Boston College women's
basketball team cherished the thought of meeting the University of
Connecticut in the Big East tournament semifinals Monday night. But
the alternative _ packing their bags and boarding the bus to ride
back to Boston _ certainly was more distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had to settle for the latter, though, as Georgetown
defeated BC, 64-59, Sunday before 3,035 at Rutgers's Louis Brown
Athletic Center and eliminated the Eagles from the tournament. The
Hoyas will face UConn, who beat St. John's Sunday, 82-58.
</P>
<P>
   Things did not bode well for the Eagles (21-7, 12-7) before the
game as freshman Becky Gottstein hobbled to the bench on crutches.
On Friday she and teammate Brianne Stepherson were named to the Big
East all-rookie team; in Saturday's game she suffered a sprained
ankle in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese said the team definitely felt the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becky is one of those kids that what makes her so good is
she's so unpredictable,'' Inglese said. ``She gets rebounds and
goes after loose balls. We missed that the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all they missed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown (18-10, 11-8), which had lost to BC earlier this
season, went to work right away shutting down the Eagles' offense.
A 3-point shot by junior Alissa Murphy giving the Eagles a 7-4
lead. But it was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown sophomore Katie Smrcka-Duffy and freshman Sylita
Thomas went to work, and within two minutes the Hoyas had a 23-15
lead. When Georgetown wasn't hitting its first shots, it was
getting second and third shots, and BC shot just 29 percent for the
half. The Hoyas, who opened an 18-point lead, were led in the half
by senior Melba Chambers (15 points, including three treys), and
Smrcka-Duffy (12). No BC player scored in double digits and the
Eagles were down at the break, 41-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in this team,'' Inglese said. ``I
really felt we could win this ballgame, (but) obviously not playing
like we did the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   But confidence was not what BC needed, offense was.
</P>
<P>
   With the Eagles down by 18, Murphy hit a 3-pointer, followed by
a jumper by Jamie Cournoyer, and free throws by Nicole Conway and
Stepherson. BC had gone on a 8-0 run, but was still down by 10.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Georgetown had cooled off from its 49 percent shooting
in the first half. When Murphy fired in a 3-pointer with 1:12 to
go, the Eagles had closed within 60-55. Stepherson then scored a
layup, and the Hoyas' lead had evaporated to 3 with one minute to
go.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers charged the BC basket and her layup put Georgetown
in front by 5. Two more free throws would seal the win. ``Melba was
as hot as a firecracker today,'' said Georgetown coach Pat Knapp.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and Smrcka-Duffy each finished with 19 points, while
Thomas had 16 points and 13 rebounds. Murphy, who made four of
seven 3-pointers, finished with 18 points for the Eagles. Center
Whitney Steele added 12, Stepherson 11, and Cournoyer 10.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the Eagles were sent packing, their next
stop should be the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no way we couldn't be in it,'' Inglese
said, adding that Gottstein should be ready then.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoyas, meanwhile, have to face UConn Monday night. The
Huskies, led by guard Shea Ralph's 30 points, defeated St. John's
despite a season-high 28 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashja Jones added 12 points, Tamika Williams 10, and Svetlana
Abrosimova 8 and six assists as the five-time defending champion
Huskies (25-4) beat the Red Storm (13-18) for the 22d time in 23
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto now is defend, rebound, advance,'' said Knapp. But
Georgetown might need more than a motto; UConn soundly beat the
Hoyas, 106-49 and 82-59, in their two meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, No. 7 Rutgers shut down Miami for almost nine
minutes in a 79-53 victory.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Notre Dame took an 83-53 win over Villanova as Niele Ivey
hit two straight 3-pointers to ignite an early 16-3 spurt.

MAINE LATEST NEW ENGLAND FALL GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, Del. _ Now the fall is complete. On Friday night, Boston
University said an early goodbye in the America East tournament. On
Saturday, Hartford, Northeastern, and Vermont all made their
curtain calls for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was Maine's turn, completing a purge of New England
teams in three days, as the fourth seed Black Bears were blown away
by top seed Delaware, 90-73, at the Carpenter Center.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sends Delaware (24-5) into next Saturday's
conference final against Drexel, which got all of Mike DeRocckis's
game-high 16 points in the first half of a 55-37 defeat of Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the New England entries, Maine figured to have the best
chance to make it to the final. The Black Bears (19-9) were coming
off a strong win over Hartford in Saturday's quarterfinals and were
relying on the combination of former Boston College players Andy
Bedard and Nate Fox to pull off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears also carried a sense of confidence, brought on
by a 70-59 win over the Hens at Delaware during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But that was January, and now it is March, and Delaware showed
why it was the No. 1 seed in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all that disappointed with our effort,'' said Maine
coach John Giannini, who could only watch in frustration as the
Blue Hens shut down the inside game of Fox (12 points, 10
rebounds). Bedard scored 24 points, but only 5 in the first half
when Delaware took control. ``It probably had as much to do with
Delaware,'' said Giannini. ``We just didn't have an answer for what
they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, which has won 12 straight and nine straight by 13 or
more points, had lots of answers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It got them from league MVP Mike Pegues, who poured in a
game-high 32 points and dominated early; Maine transfer John
Gordon, who ran the offense and also scored 18 points; and center
John Bennett, who was instrumental in frustrating Fox all
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating was the best way to describe it,'' said Bedard,
who was unable to stop the constant Delaware attack that produced a
43-30 halftime lead that climbed to 30 before the Black Bears cut
it down to the final margin. ``I was just terrible in the first
half. We just made so many mistakes and got ourselves into a
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaware can do that. It has done that except for one stretch in
midseason when it lost three of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty good all year,'' said Delaware coach Mike
Brey. ``Today we were very ready to play again. We're pretty good
offensively. We know how to use our offensive weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Giannini was even more effusive. ``They play the game as well
together as any team in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Delaware is playing in its own building, at its own tempo, no
one could argue with that assessment.

infamous ``DNA-stained'' blue dress is just the latest scandal
artifact to be preserved in the National Archives' collection of
objects related to the Kennedy assassination, Watergate and the
various independent-counsel investigations that followed. As such,
the dress may come to be a part of the curious gallery of
anti-relics by which presidential fiascoes live on in glass cases
and the public imagination. By Thomas Mallon. From The New York
Times Magazine. 1,000 words.
________________________________________________________ 2. THE
PERSISTENCE OF POLYGAMY When 10,000 global journalists descend on
Utah to cover the 2002 Olympics, they may well be attracted to the
story of a heritage quite apart from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir
and the lovely snow - the existence of a kind of polygamy in which
women are the alleged victims of sexual crimes and the virtual
property of men - often uncles, cousins and other family members -
who openly boast of numerous wives and virtual impunity from the
law. By Timothy Egan. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length
(3,700 words) + edited article available. 3. NEWT'S SHADOW The
Republicans in Congress, by and large, remain spellbound by the
GOP's right-wing base. This is the true end of Reaganism, the real
legacy of Newt Gingrich - and Speaker Dennis Hastert's everyday
nightmare. By James Traub. From The New York Times Magazine.
Full-length (4,000 words) + edited article available. 4. BLACK
MARKET ANTIBIOTICS AND RESISTANT GERMS When a Hong Kong woman who
entered hospital recently with a fever died weeks later despite
treatment with antibiotics, it sounded an alarm in the medical
community there and elsewhere. The indiscriminate use of
antibiotics and their easy availability on the Hong Kong black
market have raised fears that bacteria are becoming dangerously
resistant. Experts, however, say that a larger problem comes from
hospitals, where patients are sometimes left on antibiotics for
weeks at a time. From Der Spiegel. 650 words. (English translation
available.) 5. FOUND IN TRANSLATION An English version of Eugenio
Montale's work leads readers through the labyrinthine paths of
Italy's greatest modern poet. Reviewed by Nicholas Jenkins. New
York Times Book Review. 2,000 words.

   A. THE FASHION FORMULA Why are there just a handful of knots in
everyday use for knotting a tie? The answer has now emerged - not
from a fashion house, but from the physics department of the
University of Cambridge. By Karen Southwell. 500 words. B. HOW TO
TICKLE A T-CELL Over the years, immunologists have been gradually
filling in the picture of how the immune system recognizes viral
infection and conveys this information to killer T cells. Now a
particularly useful and intriguing piece has been added to the
picture. By Eleanor Lawrence. 1,000 words. C. SPANISH FLU KEEPS IT
SECRETS Frozen tissue from a victim of the worldwide influenza
pandemic of 1918 who was buried in the Alaskan permafrost is

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BRIGHT ANGEL TIME &LR;  By Martha McPhee. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$13. Set in the 1970s, this first novel is narrated by a thoughtful
8-year-old girl who struggles to make sense of her family's chaotic
life on the road after her abandoned mother is lured to Big Sur by
an itinerant therapist to the well-to-do. The result is ``a hard
and shining artifact of personal and social upheaval,'' Walter Kirn
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC: DISPATCHES FROM THE UNFINISHED CIVIL
WAR &LR;  By Tony Horwitz. Vintage Departures, $14. A former Wall Street
Journal reporter and Civil War buff takes up with a troop of
hard-core battle re-enactors, toughing it out in the field and
tracking down secession-related controversies and die-hard keepers
of the faith throughout the South. Last year the reviewer Roy
Blount Jr. found this to be a ``splendid commemoration of the war
and its legacy'' as well as ``an eyes-open, humorously no-nonsense
survey of complicated Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY: JOSHUA CHAMBERLAIN, WILLIAM OATES, AND
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR &LR;  By Mark Perry. Penguin, $15.95. This
focuses on the eventful careers of two rival commanders at
Gettysburg _ one from Maine, the other from Alabama _ who started
as poor farm boys and wound up in politics. The result is ``an
ambitious ... history of the North and South from before the war to
the end of Reconstruction,'' Frederick Allen wrote in 1998. ``The
author reaches far beyond their own lives to capture the complex
spirit of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST &LR;  By Iain Pears. Berkley, $7.99.
This intricate literary thriller about the murder of an Oxford don
in Restoration England _ and the far greater crime to which it is
linked _ unfolds through the voices of four very different
narrators. ``Pears, with a painstaking, almost forensic attention
to detail, constructs his world like a master painter of trompe
l'oeil,'' Andrew Miller wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EDGE OF THE SEA &LR;  By Rachel Carson. Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, $14. Seven years before the classic ``Silent Spring,'' the
author turned her formidable gaze on the narrow strip of sea bottom
that ebbs and flows with the tides, and the rich web of life
thriving along the Atlantic coastline. ``Carson's book is
beautifully written,'' Jonathan N. Leonard wrote in 1955. ``People
who get bored by too much lolling on beaches should read it as a
guidebook.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RACHEL CARSON: THE WRITER AT WORK &LR;  By Paul Brooks. Sierra Club,
$18. This book uses hefty selections from Carson's published and
unpublished writings to track her career as both a pioneering
environmentalist and a dedicated writer. In 1972 the reviewer
Josephine Johnson called this a ``rich and readable work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A PATCHWORK PLANET &LR;  By Anne Tyler. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95.
Barnaby Gaitlin is a chronic underachiever who is estranged from
his family and driven by a hunger to peer into other people's
lives. Yet his inner turmoil is accompanied by sudden attacks of
clarity. Last year the reviewer Carol Shields called this a
``wonderful novel ... that repays our always delighted attention.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TENDER AT THE BONE: GROWING UP AT THE TABLE &LR;  By Ruth Reichl.
Broadway, $13. In recalling how a life of eating, waitressing and
cooking led her to become a food writer, the departing restaurant
critic for The New York Times (soon to be editor in chief of
Gourmet) focuses on the characters of those she loves: mainly her
flamboyant mother and her mild-mannered father. Praising this
``effortlessly entertaining'' memoir last year, Paul Levy wrote
that ``Reichl is ... witty, fair-minded, brave and a wonderful
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT LETTERS &LR;  By Robert Dessaix. Picador USA, $13. In a hotel
room in Venice, a middle-aged Australian with a terminal illness
writes to a friend about his meandering journey through Europe and
his search for meaning. Last year the reviewer Patrick Farrell
admired ``the wry, chatty, surprisingly cheerful voice in which he
discourses on heaven and hell, seduction and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DAY OF CREATION &LR;  By J.G. Ballard. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13. In a parched central African nation, an obsessed British
doctor fulfills his dream of creating a ``third Nile.'' ``Ballard
constructs a moody and well-modeled landscape with as fine a
writerly intelligence as we might hope for,'' Samuel R. Delany
wrote in these pages in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAR FEVER &LR;  $10. In this collection of Ballard's short fiction
reissued by the same publisher, Beirut becomes a laboratory for the
study of warfare and Ronald Reagan is recalled to the White House,
only to have news reports about his health overshadow World War
III. ``Far more rigorous and fastidious than Jorge Luis Borges or
Italo Calvino, Ballard keeps impeccably cool,'' Ursula K. Le Guin
wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BONOBO: THE FORGOTTEN APE &LR;  By Frans de Waal. Photographs by
Frans Lanting. University of California, $24.95. A primatologist
explores the striking differences between these so-called pygmy
chimpanzees, who freely use sex to resolve tension, and their more
familiar cousins. In 1997 David Papineau called this an ``elegant
photo-essay.''

THEN AND NOW: HOW TO PASS A GREAT BIG LAW

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Ronald Reagan and Congress joined
forces in the mid-1980s to overhaul the nation's income tax code,
the political circumstances were similar to the situation now:
divided government (then there was a Republican president and
Senate and a Democratic House), a lame-duck president, an
ideological gulf separating the parties, little public consensus
about the proper legislative course and no particular crisis that
required the president and Congress to take immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was adopted anyway. Tax rates
were cut almost in half. Popular deductions were scrapped. Tax
shelters were abolished. The taxes of virtually every person and
business in America were affected by the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is relevant today because the monumental tax
measure was the only law enacted in the last generation that
approaches the sweeping scope of the Social Security legislation
President Clinton and Congress are considering.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the lessons from the odyssey of the tax law
that politicians who are now working on the Social Security system
might consider:
</P>
<P>
   Real Bipartisanship Is More Than Just Talk.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, the genial Republican patriarch, and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the bare-knuckle brawler from the Chicago
Democratic machine, had little in common and no use for one another
personally. But they shared the conviction that the tax system was
out of whack and needed revision.
</P>
<P>
   The evening that Reagan announced his tax plan in a nationally
televised speech, Rostenkowski, then chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, went on the air to praise the president and urge
viewers to ``write Rosty'' if they agreed. Not once in the 18
months between then and the day the measure was signed into law did
either man publicly criticize the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, when the tax measure seemed to unravel totally,
it was put back together again, outside the public eye, by a small
group consisting of the president's agent, Richard Darman, and
seven senators _ four Republicans and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the bad blood and mistrust may be insurmountable, even
though President Clinton and Republican leaders have proclaimed
their fealty to bipartisanship almost every day since the
impeachment trial ended.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already accusing the White House of dishonest
accounting practices. Clinton supporters have been quick to charge
the Republicans with wanting to jeopardize retirement benefits by
giving tax cuts to the wealthy. Badly burned every time they have
touched Social Security in the past, Republican congressional
leaders worry that the president would rather have a campaign issue
than a law.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, called the White House recently to ask to see the
president one-on-one to talk about Social Security, he was told the
time was not ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Political Leadership Can Mean Wheeling and Dealing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, at the outset of the tax debate, Reagan transferred
James Baker and Darman, the two most talented political maestros on
the White House staff, to the Treasury Department, made them
secretary and deputy secretary and put them in charge of the drive
for tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Darman developed what he called ``the principle of binary
choice.'' If a few key politicians had a personal stake, he
reasoned, and if the rank and file in Congress were given only ``a
binary choice between tax reform and no tax reform,'' a sweeping
tax bill could pass against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened. Over and over between early 1985
and late 1986, when the most thorough revision of the tax code in
at least 40 years was enacted, the legislation itself was
essentially dead. But each time it was revived because central
figures like Reagan, Rostenkowski and Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
and Bob Packwood, R-Ore., were personally committed and because
other lawmakers had no alternative but to vote for whatever measure
was before them at the time or to kill altogether the idea of
changing the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rostenkowski was in total command. On the morning
of the House vote, he was on the telephone in his committee's
library calling lawmakers and lining up their votes. He promised,
for instance, special tax breaks for a stadium in Cleveland, a
parking garage in Memphis, a convention center in Miami and dozens
of other projects. ``Politics is an imperfect process,'' he
explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one in the Clinton administration has nearly the
political skill and influence in Congress that Baker and Darman
had. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has not taken a leading role
on Social Security, and in any event, he may leave his post by this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the iron-fisted rule and conspicuous logrolling for
which Rostenkowski was famous is out of fashion. It makes for
cleaner g, but legislative accomplishment is harder.
</P>
<P>
   If Goals Are Agreed Upon, The Details Can Be Worked Out
</P>
<P>
   The individual pieces of the tax law that was eventually enacted
bore little relationship to what Reagan proposed or, for that
matter, what came out of Rostenkowski's committee. The tax brackets
were different. Investors lost their tax break on capital gains.
Deductions of state and local income taxes were permitted, but
those for medical expenses were restricted. Real estate tax
shelters were ended. On balance, taxes on businesses went up, and
those on families went down.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal battles were fought over such details. But the basic
goals were never in dispute: lower tax rates, fewer deductions, no
change in the amount of revenue raised, no shift in the relative
tax burden on the rich and the middle class. At issue was who the
winners and losers would be within that framework.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Social Security, both sides agree on the basic
goal: sufficient money must be found to provide an acceptable
standard of living to baby boomers when they retire. But so far,
neither Clinton nor the Republicans who control Congress have
conceded that reaching that goal will result in losers as well as
winners. Some workers will pay higher taxes; some retirees will get
reduced benefits.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate so far has been over details like whether
income-tax revenues should be used to pay retirement benefits and
who should control payroll taxes invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Those are important questions. But even if they are resolved,
the basic goal will remain elusive.

THE MONEY'S A MANTRA, GREED'S A NEW CREED

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Holly stays conservative,'' reads the Charles Schwab ad
featuring real customers and their stock portfolios. ``Howard makes
a move.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if Holly, identified as a part-time teacher who also
teaches investing to her daughter's fifth-grade class, shows
$6,560.71 in her account and Howard shows $2,438,665.95? They are
both in the game, both part of a profound transformation in
American life _ the way the aspirations, fears and machinations of
the world of finance, once the province of the wealthy few, have
become indelibly interwoven into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's noisy sideshow fades, millions of Americans are
refocusing on the thing that most defines their lives, the upward
and downward ticks of interest rates, the gyrations of their mutual
funds, the achingly palpable lure and temptations of wealth. What
this is doing to the country _ from money to values _ is one of the
most intriguing questions about American life at the century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed is not a new thing,'' said Roger Shinn, a professor
emeritus of social ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in New
York City, who has also taught business ethics at New York
University. ``But I think the present situation is different in
many respects. Money is less tangible. It used to be property or
gold. Now it's a blip on your computer screen. It appears and
disappears. It becomes more a way to keep score, more a game in its
own right, the way athletes compete with each other to make the
most millions, when each additional million can't possibly matter
to the way they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, true wealth for most Americans seemed as distant
as Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a stroll through any bookstore gives a crash course on what
they want, whether it is ``Simple Abundance'' or ``More Than
Enough'' or ``How to Retire Rich.'' They know that ``It Takes
Money, Honey.'' They want to be ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' They
read Money and, to be safe, Smart Money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of wealth is as old as the Bible. And from the robber
barons of the 19th century to the Wall Street tycoons of the 1980s,
striking it rich has been part of the American myth. But, in at
least four ways, money is woven into the fabric of daily life today
in a way it never was in the past:
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of 78 million baby boomers, whose needs,
wants and fears dominate American culture. Faced with looming
financial needs for their children's college and their own
retirement, many find themselves confronting the kind of saving and
investment they had neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the relentless march of the bull market, which has
made millions wealthy and millions more think they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Third is the credit revolution, with more tempting cards
arriving in the mail every day, which has made it possible for
people without money to spend and live like the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth is the way marketing suffuses the culture from the
toy-of-the-moment on Saturday-morning cartoons to the disparate
images of seniors as either on-the-go consumers or near invalids.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, of course, the goal is getting by, not
getting rich. Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist and
author of ``Luxury Fever'' (The Free Press, 1999), says half of the
respondents in a recent survey reported life savings of less than
$3,000 and another 40 percent said it would be ``a big problem'' if
they had to deal with an unexpected bill for $1,000. Meanwhile,
more than 35 million Americans, or 13.3 percent, live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But almost half of American households now own stock either
directly or through pension or retirement plans, compared to less
than a third at the beginning of the decade and less than 1 in 10
in the 1960s. This comes at a time when a hot stock like Dell
Computer can rise by 4,200 percent in three years and then lose
nearly 20 percent of its value in four days as it did in February,
making the riches and risks of the market gut-wrenchingly
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the current bull market, who could have imagined that
newsstands would feature a gaggle of glossy magazines with cover
articles trumpeting one or another Ultimate Mutual Fund Guide, as
if the subject has the sex appeal of supermodels in bikinis on
Polynesian beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop of financial books blends the language of money
with the spirit of the human potential movement. ``I have come to
think that money is very much like a person,'' writes Suze Orman in
``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (Crown Publishers, 1997),
``and it will respond when you treat it as a cherished friend _
never fearing it, pushing it away, pretending it doesn't exist or
turning away from its needs, never clutching it so hard that it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' by Thomas J. Stanley and William
D. Danko (Longstreet Press, 1996), has been on the best-seller list
since January 1997, with its comforting message that the rich are
just like the rest of us, only cheaper.

   ``Holly stays conservative,'' reads the Charles Schwab ad
featuring real customers and their stock portfolios. ``Howard makes
a move.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if Holly, identified as a part-time teacher who also
teaches investing to her daughter's fifth-grade class, shows
$6,560.71 in her account and Howard shows $2,438,665.95? They are
both in the game, both part of a profound transformation in
American life _ the way the aspirations, fears and machinations of
the world of finance, once the province of the wealthy few, have
become indelibly interwoven into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's noisy sideshow fades, millions of Americans are
refocusing on the thing that most defines their lives, the upward
and downward ticks of interest rates, the gyrations of their mutual
funds, the achingly palpable lure and temptations of wealth. What
this is doing to the country _ from money to values _ is one of the
most intriguing questions about American life at the century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed is not a new thing,'' said Roger Shinn, a professor
emeritus of social ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in New
York City, who has also taught business ethics at New York
University. ``But I think the present situation is different in
many respects. Money is less tangible. It used to be property or
gold. Now it's a blip on your computer screen. It appears and
disappears. It becomes more a way to keep score, more a game in its
own right, the way athletes compete with each other to make the
most millions, when each additional million can't possibly matter
to the way they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, true wealth for most Americans seemed as distant
as Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a stroll through any bookstore gives a crash course on what
they want, whether it is ``Simple Abundance'' or ``More Than
Enough'' or ``How to Retire Rich.'' They know that ``It Takes
Money, Honey.'' They want to be ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' They
read Money and, to be safe, Smart Money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of wealth is as old as the Bible. And from the robber
barons of the 19th century to the Wall Street tycoons of the 1980s,
striking it rich has been part of the American myth. But, in at
least four ways, money is woven into the fabric of daily life today
in a way it never was in the past:
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of 78 million baby boomers, whose needs,
wants and fears dominate American culture. Faced with looming
financial needs for their children's college and their own
retirement, many find themselves confronting the kind of saving and
investment they had neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the relentless march of the bull market, which has
made millions wealthy and millions more think they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Third is the credit revolution, with more tempting cards
arriving in the mail every day, which has made it possible for
people without money to spend and live like the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth is the way marketing suffuses the culture from the
toy-of-the-moment on Saturday-morning cartoons to the disparate
images of seniors as either on-the-go consumers or near invalids.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, of course, the goal is getting by, not
getting rich. Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist and
author of ``Luxury Fever'' (The Free Press, 1999), says half of the
respondents in a recent survey reported life savings of less than
$3,000 and another 40 percent said it would be ``a big problem'' if
they had to deal with an unexpected bill for $1,000. Meanwhile,
more than 35 million Americans, or 13.3 percent, live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But almost half of American households now own stock either
directly or through pension or retirement plans, compared to less
than a third at the beginning of the decade and less than 1 in 10
in the 1960s. This comes at a time when a hot stock like Dell
Computer can rise by 4,200 percent in three years and then lose
nearly 20 percent of its value in four days as it did in February,
making the riches and risks of the market gut-wrenchingly
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the current bull market, who could have imagined that
newsstands would feature a gaggle of glossy magazines with cover
articles trumpeting one or another Ultimate Mutual Fund Guide, as
if the subject has the sex appeal of supermodels in bikinis on
Polynesian beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop of financial books blends the language of money
with the spirit of the human potential movement. ``I have come to
think that money is very much like a person,'' writes Suze Orman in
``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (Crown Publishers, 1997),
``and it will respond when you treat it as a cherished friend _
never fearing it, pushing it away, pretending it doesn't exist or
turning away from its needs, never clutching it so hard that it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' by Thomas J. Stanley and William
D. Danko (Longstreet Press, 1996), has been on the best-seller list
since January 1997, with its comforting message that the rich are
just like the rest of us, only cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ramsey, who has a syndicated financial-counseling show on
44 radio stations, mostly in small and medium-sized markets outside
the Northeast, mixes biblical proverbs and self-help in his ``More
Than Enough: Proven Keys to Strengthening Your Family and Building
Financial Peace'' (Viking, 1999), which begins with a woman sobbing
at her ``point of rebirth'' as she comes to terms with her
attitudes toward money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spiritual aspect of personal finance, learning to control
the guy in the mirror, is more important than doing the math,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the focus on finance is pulling Americans in opposite
directions. On the one hand, there have never been so many
temptations to spend. As a result, nearly 20 percent of American
households have more debt than assets. When real estate is factored
out, the bottom 40 percent of Americans have more debt than assets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, books like ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' or
the success of Warren Buffett's plain-folks investing and personal
style are creating at least talk of a new ethic of frugality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lawyer friend who says, `Why would anyone want to
spend money when it's so much more fun to count it,''' said Shad
Rowe, who heads an investment firm in Dallas. ``Warren Buffett has
made it respectable to be a miser again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie Lowry, a Boston College sociologist and longtime
advocate of socially responsible investing, said the focus on
wealth primarily reflects fears that the current prosperity will
not last. With 24 percent of household wealth now invested in
stocks, up from 10 percent at the time of the 1987 crash, Americans
may be right to feel financially vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that prosperity and the current vogue for finance
has its perils, too.
</P>
<P>
   John Maynard Keynes once looked forward to an era when the task
would be managing prosperity ``which science and compound interest
will have won'' to live wisely and well. In that era, he said,
excessive lust for money would be seen as ``a somewhat disgusting
morbidity.''
</P>
<P>
   That may come to pass, and the current prosperity has its
inspirational tales, like the example of Donald and Mildred Othmer,
who lived quietly in Brooklyn, and after investing with Buffett
left behind three quarters of a billion dollars for favored
universities and charities.
</P>
<P>
   But Shinn said American culture has always been wildly
conflicted about wealth, particularly when great affluence coexists
with bruising poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is full of condemnations of wealth in the face of
poverty,'' he said. ``In Jesus and the Prophets and elsewhere,
there's a bias in favor of the poor. There's the Sermon on the
Mount. Luke said: `Blessed are you, poor. Woe unto you that are
rich.' The Catholic popes call this the epistemological privilege
of the poor, that the poor are spared the arrogance that comes with
wealth and power. So we're very mixed up on this. We're uneasy
about wealth. But we're sure getting over the unease in a hurry.''

STOLEN FROM THE GRAVE FOR THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) 
 (ATTN: La., Ohio, Mass., Fla., Texas, Ga.)   (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Perhaps only in New Orleans could the dead be a special interest
group. Their influence was recently illustrated when the City
Council passed an ordinance requiring antiques dealers and auction
houses to report to the police within 24 hours any cemetery
artifacts that come their way. The law is a response to thieves
plundering the historic ``cities of the dead'' and selling caches
of marble angels and blessed mothers to local antiquarians.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were several well-respected antiques
dealers who, police say, knowingly purchased ornaments stolen from
the graves and may even have placed orders, as if history were an a
la carte menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pawnbrokers have always had reporting requirements,'' said
Louise Fergusson, executive director of Save Our Cemeteries, the
most venerable of the city's three cemetery preservation groups.
``Now that antiques dealers are dealing in stolen artifacts they
are going to have to deal with the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of historic family tombs, most of them from the
19th century, robbed in broad daylight has raised the profile of
those dedicated to preserving cemeteries and protecting the dead.
Their worst enemies may be decorators and antiques dealers pushing
the necro-politan look for the garden, the more mouldering the
statuary the better.
</P>
<P>
   The look was in full flower in New York last week at the
Gramercy Garden Antiques Show, where several weeping angels _ one
with an $875 price tag _ were spotted amid the rusting garden
benches and freshly spritzed topiary. And that may just be the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theft is not limited to architectural objects, gates and
statuary,'' said Katie Karrick, a historian in Lyndhurst, Ohio, who
publishes Tomb With a View, a newsletter for cemetery enthusiasts
(http://members.aol.com/TombView/twav.html). ``My latest pet peeve
is the use of metal detectors on grave sites to find lost or
intentionally placed coins, jewelry and other objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karrick works as a historian at the Wade Memorial Chapel in
Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. The chapel is famous for its
Tiffany lamps, pews and mosaics. Five years ago, two bronze statues
from the 1920s were stolen and have yet to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, Save Our Cemeteries recently completed a
digitized tomb-by-tomb data base for Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, one
of the most alluring and storied of the city's 31 cemeteries.
Neglect remains a problem, particularly at St. Louis Cemetery No. 1
and No. 2 on the fringes of the French Quarter, where street crime
deters many families from regularly visiting ancestral tombs.
</P>
<P>
   The mobility of families and churches has taken a toll. ``We are
trying to locate families who have some relationship to the
deceased and who will take an interest in restoring the tombs,''
said Michael Boudreaux, director of the New Orleans Archdiocesan
cemeteries, which include the St. Louis cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where graveyards have long been plagued by
thieves, those who own or curate historic cemeteries are breaking
their silence, alerting antique buyers to tell-tale funerary
motifs: winged hourglasses (the swiftness of time), garlands
(victory in death), willows (mourning), scythes (Father Time) and
leaning tree trunks (short interrupted life).
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the New England Cemetery Association, based at
Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, encourage families to photograph
and document tombs. The private Art Loss Register, based in New
York City, tracks stolen artwork for a fee and played a major role
in retrieving a $50,000 fountain stolen from a Missouri cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida and Texas, state agencies are surveying rural
cemeteries, including plots of the poor simply marked by river
rocks or seashells. ``Families move, local memory becomes fuzzy and
the next thing you know the lot is for sale,'' said Jim Miller, the
Florida state archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Georgia and elsewhere in the South, the tradition of
placing pottery on graves has made black burial grounds especially
vulnerable to theft as the collectors' market for Southern folk
pottery flourishes. These fragile, out of the way places, often
unmarked except for depressions in the earth, have become
``incentives for illegal activity,'' said Dr. John Burrison, a
curator at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the ``death care industry,'' as it is known, are
finding creative ways to attract people, in keeping with the
prevailing wisdom that ``neglect begets neglect,'' as Ms. Winslow
put it. Lovers of bass can now go fishing at Michigan Memorial Park
in Huron Township, Mich. Others can enter contests like the one at
Lake View where the prize was a four-star dinner for two at the
James A. Garfield monument serenaded by the Ohio Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldest idea may be at the historic Congressional
Cemetery in southwest Washington, where $100-a-year memberships for
dogs have turned the 1807 cemetery into a 32-acre dog run that
``provides us with people in the cemetery all day long,'' said
Susan Olsen, a board member of the Association for the Preservation
of Historic Congressional Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Within the antiques world, laws that require dealers to report
suspicious statuary are likely to remain controversial. ``If there
are a billion tchotchkes in the world, only a fraction of them have
been stolen,'' said John Sare, an attorney with Milbank Tweed
Hadley &AMP; McCloy in New York, who represents museums and collectors.
``So it makes more sense to register thefts than objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the most secure cemetery artifact may well be Bird
Girl, the bronze funerary cover girl of John Berendt's ``Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random House, 1994), who for
generations watched over the Trosdal family at the Bonaventure
Cemetery in Savannah, Ga. An instant celebrity, the statue was
removed for safe-keeping by descendants and now resides at the
Telfair Museum of Art, where attendance has doubled since her
arrival.

IN DENIAL: MANAGED CARE'S OTHER PROBLEM _ IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman suffering from breast cancer asks for a bone marrow
transplant. Her health plan says no. A paraplegic needs a special
wheelchair to achieve adequate mobility. The plan says no.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week goes by without a health maintenance organization
getting hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for
the care of a gravely ill patient. Clearly, the anecdotal evidence
suggests, the scandal of managed care is rampant denial of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But guess again. The media, courts and consumer advocates are
overlooking a problem that is precisely the opposite of the one
everybody's complaining about. That problem is too many medical
treatments rather than too few.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons _ fears of consumer backlash,
legislative intervention or large jury awards _ managed-care plans
appear to be denying little care, notwithstanding all the
well-publicized horror stories and growing complaints as HMOs
become commonplace in American society.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cost savings that HMOs have already achieved
are in jeopardy. Managed care also is not meeting its stated goal
of improving the quality of treatment by second-guessing physicians
who fail to follow the best medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at figures on care denial that New York and other
states are just beginning to collect. While incomplete and
problematic, they suggest that there have been few denials over the
objections of enrollees or their doctors, raising the question of
whether the persistent reports of callous behavior by HMOs provide
a distorted picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New York for the first time in 1997 required health
plans to report each time patients or their physicians appealed a
plan's denial of reimbursement for a physician-approved treatment.
The plans reported a small number of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Health Plans, covering more than a million New
Yorkers in managed care, reported fewer than 1.5 appeals for every
1,000 enrollees. The six largest managed-care plans in the state
averaged about 2.5 appeals per 1,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the HMOs denied coverage for specialists not part of the
plan's network of physicians; treatments deemed unnecessary for a
patient's recovery, and procedures that the plan deemed
experimental _ lacking scientific evidence of safety or
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A similar picture emerges from reports in other states. New
Jersey and Connecticut, for example, keep track of appeals that are
not resolved by the internal procedures of managed-care plans _ a
smaller category than that reported for New York. For 1998, New
Jersey reported 69 such appeals from about 2.5 million enrollees in
managed care. Connecticut reported 39 appeals from about a million
enrollees. Appeals are rare even in managed-care plans serving
Medicare, despite the fact that appeals are automatic once the
enrollee has exhausted the plan's internal review. Managed-care
patients in general win between a quarter to a third of their
appeals to federal and state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be too  &UR; few &LR;  denials? Don't snicker. A presidential
commission recently concluded that excessive procedures _
procedures that lack scientific justification _ could account for
as much as 30 percent of the nation's medical bills. Surgeons
perform mastectomies rather than breast-preserving surgery on
Medicare patients 35 times more often in some parts of the country
than in others, for no apparent medical reason. Roughly a quarter
of the surgeries to implant tubes in children's ears are
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   There is, says Professor Alain Enthoven of Stanford University,
an ``urgent need for managed care to second-guess decisions by
physicians to subject patients to needlessly risky surgery and
needlessly costly tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismiss the self-reported New York data as unverified
and unreliable. It is true that plans use different definitions of
appeals and other grievances. Nor did some of the plans submit
internally consistent or complete reports.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not entirely clear how to interpret the low number of
reported appeals. Most enrollees are healthy and present no
occasion to deny care. Many denials never get appealed because
patients give up easily or are unaware of legal options.
</P>
<P>
   But before dismissing the data, take a close look at Empire Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of New York. It reported twice as many
appeals, about 38 per 1,000 patients, as any other plan, and about
15 times as many appeals as the largest plans. Upon re-examination,
Empire has determined that it exaggerated the actual number because
its accounting system tossed in non-medical complaints like
protests of premium increases. When corrected, Empire says, its
reported appeals will plummet. But is even its exaggerated estimate
_ 7,300 appeals for about 200,000 patients _ an excessive figure?
</P>
<P>
   A number of medical directors of large health plans say in
private that fear of consumer and legal backlash has scared them
from denying reimbursement even when they are convinced the
treatment is ill advised. Dr. Gordon Norman of PacifiCare of
California, a large managed-care plan, points to another problem:
``Doctors often prefer to bend to the wishes of patients, agreeing
to request diagnostic tests or procedures that they may not feel
are truly necessary.'' The doctors put the onus on the health plan
to deny their requests, leaving them ``in good graces with their
patients, but making the plan look like the bad guy.''

IN DENIAL: MANAGED CARE'S OTHER PROBLEM _ IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman suffering from breast cancer asks for a bone marrow
transplant. Her health plan says no. A paraplegic needs a special
wheelchair to achieve adequate mobility. The plan says no.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week goes by without a health maintenance organization
getting hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for
the care of a gravely ill patient. Clearly, the anecdotal evidence
suggests, the scandal of managed care is rampant denial of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But guess again. The media, courts and consumer advocates are
overlooking a problem that is precisely the opposite of the one
everybody's complaining about. That problem is too many medical
treatments rather than too few.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons _ fears of consumer backlash,
legislative intervention or large jury awards _ managed-care plans
appear to be denying little care, notwithstanding all the
well-publicized horror stories and growing complaints as HMOs
become commonplace in American society.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cost savings that HMOs have already achieved
are in jeopardy. Managed care also is not meeting its stated goal
of improving the quality of treatment by second-guessing physicians
who fail to follow the best medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at figures on care denial that New York and other
states are just beginning to collect. While incomplete and
problematic, they suggest that there have been few denials over the
objections of enrollees or their doctors, raising the question of
whether the persistent reports of callous behavior by HMOs provide
a distorted picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New York for the first time in 1997 required health
plans to report each time patients or their physicians appealed a
plan's denial of reimbursement for a physician-approved treatment.
The plans reported a small number of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Health Plans, covering more than a million New
Yorkers in managed care, reported fewer than 1.5 appeals for every
1,000 enrollees. The six largest managed-care plans in the state
averaged about 2.5 appeals per 1,000 patients.
</P>
<P>

   Aetna U.S. Healthcare identifies another way health plans keep
the number of denials and appeals low. Dr. Arthur Leibowitz,
Aetna's medical director, calls it a ``sentinel'' effect, by which
his staff keeps physicians well informed about Aetna's standards.
Critics might call this bullying physicians to cut costs. That is
no doubt part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But Leibowitz defends Aetna's practices by pointing to a side of
managed care that the public rarely sees. It is the side that
focuses on raising quality. It often tells doctors to do more, not
less.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pointing out ways doctors do too much, research also
exposes ways they do too little. Physicians often fail to prescribe
life-saving beta-blockers for heart attack victims or proper
inhalers for asthma patients. Aetna issues reports to its doctors
tracing how their care stacks up against their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Empire made available short accounts of appeals for the first
eight months of 1998. The names of the patients were stricken,
though Empire contacted a random sample of the patients to ask
whether they would take follow-up phone calls from a reporter. The
picture that emerges is murky.
</P>
<P>
   Empire refers appeals about experimental treatments like bone
marrow transplants to outside panels of independent experts. That
has virtually eliminated contentious legal challenges of this type
of denial, raising the possibility that external review might blunt
some of the consumer backlash over managed care. But Empire's other
denials trigger a tug-of-war between a plan that tries to control
costs and supervise care, and patients who demand the freedom to
get the care they want.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Empire's cases lie in a gray zone. Empire tells of
financially strapped patients who skip paying premiums, then get
hit with crushing medical bills. Employers switch health insurers,
forcing employees to switch to Empire's doctors _ a traumatic
experience for many chronically ill patients. One parent refused to
take her child, who suffered from speech and other development
problems, to a doctor who had once screamed at her, triggering
nightmares. Empire agreed to let the child see any other doctor in
the same medical office, but the parent balked. In another case, a
patient insisted on seeing a physical therapist who, she decided
for unspecified reasons, was uniquely qualified to treat her back
problems. Empire overturns about 30 percent of its initial denials,
often after physicians produce better evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that managed care does not make callous medical
decisions and aggravate patients. Even if appeals are infrequent,
complaints to state officials about managed care are rising, though
some of the trend can be explained by rising enrollment in
managed-care plans, and many of the complaints involve nuisances
like not answering the phone quickly or paying claims on time.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care plans sometimes deny care when they should not, and
sometimes pay for care when they should not. Both mistakes pose
dangers. Enthoven offers a caution. ``The country risks making a
terrible mistake if it overreacts and treats every denial as an
assault on patients,'' he said. ``Denials are a necessary feature
of a well-run plan.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: War on drugs needs a new battle plan
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A motley of would-be drug policy reformers clustered under an
umbrella called the Network of Reform Groups will issue a report
Wednesday in which they will propose, shockingly, that we stop
simply fighting the war on drugs and start instead trying actually
to win it.
</P>
<P>
   They would do that by up-ending current, manifestly failed
priorities, cutting the 66 percent of the anti-drug budget that
goes to law enforcement to 33 percent and splitting the rest evenly
between treatment and strategies against youth drug use. As matters
stand now, only 22 percent of the effort goes to treatment and only
12 percent is targeted against drug use by the young.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, these are the usual suspects, long-time drug policy
critics from a variety of angles (stop forfeitures, decriminalize
pot and all that), but they make a strong, very sober case.
</P>
<P>
   It deserves a hearing. Alas, we seem instead about to go
rampaging off again into more of the same, with the drug czar, the
vastly unimaginative Barry McCaffery, telling Congress just last
week that by turning up the heat, he'll cut drug use in half by
'07. You read it here first: no he won't.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Dennis Hastert is setting up a GOP Drug-Free
America Working Group. Do not expect enlightenment. Expect calls
for more cops, more firepower, more and longer mandatory sentences
and more prisons _ in a nation that already trails only Russia in
the percentage of its own people that it locks up.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless criminalization of drugs has mainly served _
surprise _ to create a huge, deadly criminal subculture around
drugs. Despite already draconian sentences, ugly interventions in
drug-producing and drug transfer nations and a deeply corrupting
quasi-war along the Mexican border, drug use among adults has
diminished only slightly in the '90s and use among teens has gone
up a tick.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices are going down and purity up _ sure signs that
supplies are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   We are fighting this war mainly by taking ourselves prisoner.
Drug convictions produced 85 percent of the huge increase in the
federal prison population between 1985 and '95, in all a
twelve-fold increase since 1980. The result is a comparable
increase in unemployables and devastated family formation. And
because the most vulnerable drug activity is the indiscreet street
traffic among and by the poor _ and because poverty still
disproportionately conflates with race _ we are carefully
assembling a social timebomb.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, lock up the big traffickers, but for most of the
rest, a decriminalized, more medicalized model that emphasizes
prevention and treatment would lower the social damage and, happy
news, save money. A RAND Corporation study finds that alternative
strategies buy more drug-use reduction per dollar than law
enforcement does.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, even the dippiest fool figures out that he can't
get through a brick wall by running into it harder each time he
tries. Just how badly are we willing to bruise ourselves before we
start looking for a way around this brick wall?

MONICAS GRIN WANLY AND BEAR IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID WALLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These haven't been the best of times for Monica L. Tripp of
Columbus, Ga. ``It's been an awful year _ I now hate telling people
my name,'' said Ms. Tripp, who happens to have a 7-year-old
daughter named Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monica S. Lewinsky and her loyal friend Linda L. Tripp
became household names, Monica Tripp, 33, a 911 dispatcher, has had
to endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes,
sexual innuendo and brazen leers. ``Even my co-workers give me
flak, always asking, `Where's your blue dress?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many a Monica and a lot of Lewinskys have been accidental
victims of a scandal that has produced few heroes. ``Monica
Lewinsky has actually cost me money,'' complained Marisa Lewinsky _
no relation _ a psychology student from Florida. To thwart obscene
phone callers, Ms. Lewinsky now subscribes to caller ID. ``Not a
week goes by without someone making a crude comment,'' added Ms.
Lewinsky. ``People have even told my boyfriend: `Hey, you're set.
You must get a lot of oral sex.' The first joke was funny. It gets
old fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Monica Barrett, 38, a paralegal in Wisconsin,
doesn't own a dry-cleaning business. (Wacky Monica jokesters will
often ask about this.) ``I used to answer the phone at my law firm:
`Hello, this is Monica speaking. How may I help you?''' Ms. Barrett
said. ``Nearly every time I did that, I'd receive some sarcastic
comment, mainly from men. They don't realize that what they're
saying is hurtful and demeaning. I mean, I'm not Monica Lewinsky.
We just share a first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-scandal, the moniker Monica enjoyed a pristine, even pious
standing, having been long associated with St. Monica, the devout,
overbearing mother of St. Augustine. The New Dictionary of Baby
Names concludes, rather arbitrarily, that the name Monica evokes a
``frighteningly healthy, pig-tailed girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. ``Giving a Monica'' and ``the full Monica'' have
become part of the vernacular, stigmatizing, perhaps permanently, a
perfectly upstanding name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a moratorium on baby Monicas for the next 30 years,''
said Anne Bernays, co-author of ``The Language of Names.'' The
numbers seem to back her up. In 1997, Monica was the 73rd most
popular girl's name; it had fallen to 97th place a year later,
according to the Social Security Administration. Still, Ms. Bernays
offered encouraging words: ``Hold your heads up high, Monicas.
Anyone, even Adolfs, can transcend a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the gibes at Monicas' expense? ``The name makes all
sorts of lights go on in the head,'' explained Steven Stroessner, a
social scientist at Barnard College. According to Stroessner, the
Lewinsky scandal lurks in the memory, poised to erupt whenever
discipline flags. ``We have so many associations about Monica that
you almost can't help but have thoughts activated,'' he said.
``Whether we blurt them out or not is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean L. Cohen, a professor of politics at Columbia University
and author of a forthcoming book on sex and the law, judges
anti-Monica outbursts as aggressive, sexist behavior. ``Sexual
jokes and comments are rarely good, chummy fun,'' argued Ms. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional gender roles have been destabilized,'' she
added. ``The real Monica couldn't be cast as innocent victim or
evil seductress. She was an agent of her own sexuality. That makes
men uncomfortable. How do they deal with that uneasiness? They
can't attack Monica Lewinsky, so they express their discomfort by
putting down some random Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, two lawyers in Milwaukee _ neither named
Monica _ recently founded Monicas With Attitude, a
consciousness-raising group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women named Monica will band together,'' declared its mission
statement, ``celebrate their names in a positive way and develop
activities that will preserve and promote the good reputation that
so many earlier Monicas have enjoyed.'' The organization's latest
campaign: a boycott of ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' which it
accuses of misogynistic Monica-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lewinsky namesakes have devised their own strategies for
coping with wisecracks. Marisa Lewinsky smiles broadly before
revealing her name to strangers. ``It disarms people, makes them
less prone to be rude,'' she said. Since taking her husband's last
name when she married five months ago, the former Monika Lewinska,
a 24-year-old from Poland, has cut her grief in half.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Monica interviewed for this article has seriously
contemplated changing her name legally. Monica Monica, an
ophthalmologist from New Orleans, is running for the Republican
nomination in the upcoming special election to fill the House seat
of Rep. Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate who resigned, a
casualty of the Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Monica considers her double
moniker an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the campaign trail it has evoked curiosity and attention,''
she noted. ``It's a wonderful way to open doors. There are many
Monicas, from Monica Seles to Monica, the singer, to Monica, the
character on `Friends,' who love the name. If a negative perception
exists, we are going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scandal lingering on life support, some Monicas expect
the unwanted attention to die down. ``In a few months,'' mused one
Monica from New Jersey, ``Monica won't be a thought in people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. Charles (call me Chuck) Manson, a
customer-service representative at a New York computer company,
still endures frequent taunting, even though his namesake-nightmare
began 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people my name, then follow it up with, `No
relation,' or, `I've never killed anyone,''' he said. ``Monicas are
going to have a tough time. It helps that my namesake was a
murderer. That usually scares the hell out of people.''

   These haven't been the best of times for Monica L. Tripp of
Columbus, Ga. ``It's been an awful year _ I now hate telling people
my name,'' said Ms. Tripp, who happens to have a 7-year-old
daughter named Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monica S. Lewinsky and her loyal friend Linda L. Tripp
became household names, Monica Tripp, 33, a 911 dispatcher, has had
to endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes,
sexual innuendo and brazen leers. ``Even my co-workers give me
flak, always asking, `Where's your blue dress?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many a Monica and a lot of Lewinskys have been accidental
victims of a scandal that has produced few heroes. ``Monica
Lewinsky has actually cost me money,'' complained Marisa Lewinsky _
no relation _ a psychology student from Florida. To thwart obscene
phone callers, Ms. Lewinsky now subscribes to caller ID. ``Not a
week goes by without someone making a crude comment,'' added Ms.
Lewinsky. ``People have even told my boyfriend: `Hey, you're set.
You must get a lot of oral sex.' The first joke was funny. It gets
old fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Monica Barrett, 38, a paralegal in Wisconsin,
doesn't own a dry-cleaning business. (Wacky Monica jokesters will
often ask about this.) ``I used to answer the phone at my law firm:
`Hello, this is Monica speaking. How may I help you?''' Ms. Barrett
said. ``Nearly every time I did that, I'd receive some sarcastic
comment, mainly from men. They don't realize that what they're
saying is hurtful and demeaning. I mean, I'm not Monica Lewinsky.
We just share a first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-scandal, the moniker Monica enjoyed a pristine, even pious
standing, having been long associated with St. Monica, the devout,
overbearing mother of St. Augustine. The New Dictionary of Baby
Names concludes, rather arbitrarily, that the name Monica evokes a
``frighteningly healthy, pig-tailed girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. ``Giving a Monica'' and ``the full Monica'' have
become part of the vernacular, stigmatizing, perhaps permanently, a
perfectly upstanding name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a moratorium on baby Monicas for the next 30 years,''
said Anne Bernays, co-author of ``The Language of Names.'' The
numbers seem to back her up. In 1997, Monica was the 73rd most
popular girl's name; it had fallen to 97th place a year later,
according to the Social Security Administration. Still, Ms. Bernays
offered encouraging words: ``Hold your heads up high, Monicas.
Anyone, even Adolfs, can transcend a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the gibes at Monicas' expense? ``The name makes all
sorts of lights go on in the head,'' explained Steven Stroessner, a
social scientist at Barnard College. According to Stroessner, the
Lewinsky scandal lurks in the memory, poised to erupt whenever
discipline flags. ``We have so many associations about Monica that
you almost can't help but have thoughts activated,'' he said.
``Whether we blurt them out or not is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean L. Cohen, a professor of politics at Columbia University
and author of a forthcoming book on sex and the law, judges
anti-Monica outbursts as aggressive, sexist behavior. ``Sexual
jokes and comments are rarely good, chummy fun,'' argued Ms. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional gender roles have been destabilized,'' she
added. ``The real Monica couldn't be cast as innocent victim or
evil seductress. She was an agent of her own sexuality. That makes
men uncomfortable. How do they deal with that uneasiness? They
can't attack Monica Lewinsky, so they express their discomfort by
putting down some random Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, two lawyers in Milwaukee _ neither named
Monica _ recently founded Monicas With Attitude, a
consciousness-raising group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women named Monica will band together,'' declared its mission
statement, ``celebrate their names in a positive way and develop
activities that will preserve and promote the good reputation that
so many earlier Monicas have enjoyed.'' The organization's latest
campaign: a boycott of ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' which it
accuses of misogynistic Monica-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lewinsky namesakes have devised their own strategies for
coping with wisecracks. Marisa Lewinsky smiles broadly before
revealing her name to strangers. ``It disarms people, makes them
less prone to be rude,'' she said. Since taking her husband's last
name when she married five months ago, the former Monika Lewinska,
a 24-year-old from Poland, has cut her grief in half.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Monica interviewed for this article has seriously
contemplated changing her name legally. Monica Monica, an
ophthalmologist from New Orleans, is running for the Republican
nomination in the upcoming special election to fill the House seat
of Rep. Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate who resigned, a
casualty of the Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Monica considers her double
moniker an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the campaign trail it has evoked curiosity and attention,''
she noted. ``It's a wonderful way to open doors. There are many
Monicas, from Monica Seles to Monica, the singer, to Monica, the
character on `Friends,' who love the name. If a negative perception
exists, we are going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scandal lingering on life support, some Monicas expect
the unwanted attention to die down. ``In a few months,'' mused one
Monica from New Jersey, ``Monica won't be a thought in people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. Charles (call me Chuck) Manson, a
customer-service representative at a New York computer company,
still endures frequent taunting, even though his namesake-nightmare
began 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people my name, then follow it up with, `No
relation,' or, `I've never killed anyone,''' he said. ``Monicas are
going to have a tough time. It helps that my namesake was a
murderer. That usually scares the hell out of people.''

   WASHINGTON _ Mercifully, the impeachment vote was at hand,
acquittal was already a certainty, and that new thing with
feathers, ``closure,'' seemed a cheery possibility for the nation.
Yet in the final hours of the Senate's trial of President Clinton,
Republicans were still proposing more subjects for investigation.
Rumors of presidential tape recordings were gravely cited along
with an 11th-hour affidavit from a reporter allowed to intrude
Pirandello-like into the story. ``We don't want any grassy-knoll
theories or dangling questions left in case someone like Oliver
Stone ever tries to make a movie about this,'' a ranking Republican
staffer explained straight-faced in announcing fresh kindling for
the 13-month-long conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be set in Oliver Stone's Amerika or the Marx
Brothers' Freedonia, the very idea of remilking the mass
entertainment aspect of the &QL; 
debilitating Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr saga seemed the year's ultimate
obscenity. For, as the Senate prepared to vote, a
stake-in-the-heart ending of the thing was at hand by all the
Constitution's sacred writ and the public's smoldering
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Less than two weeks after his acquittal, Clinton once
more has had to gingerly decline elaboration on his latest flat
denial of a Jane Doe story of sexual allegation flaring up from the
oily residue of his impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scandal escapists should be warned that juicy bits
from Monica Lewinsky's oath-free television interview with Barbara
Walters _ a prelude to The Book _ have already been strategically
leaked to stoke viewership for this week's next episode of a story
most people claim to be sick of.
</P>
<P>
   And, lest justice not be endlessly served, ground rules are
being negotiated for a new investigation, this time of the fairness
of the investigation of the president's investigator, Kenneth
Starr. And, of course, Starr will have an extra year's jurisdiction
to investigate Clinton, private citizen, once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ends,'' exults Matt Drudge, the Internet
scandalmonger who served up the Lewinsky story and led America to
its groaning board feast upon sex and mendacity. ``I did hope the
Senate would keep Clinton: I needed the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   And here we all are looking for something fresh and wholesome.
President Clinton's Arbor Day speech, perhaps, or a regained perch
on that bridge to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Webster Hubbell's next fraud trial by Starr's Whitewater
_ remember Whitewater? _ prosecutors begins in late spring. And
Hillary Rodham Clinton may be called as a witness, just when she's
somehow tempted by the idea of electoral office in her own right as
her husband's career slowly closes out. Closure? No, the story goes
forward, by limp and squiggle. When all else fails, there's always
nostalgia on CNBC and Fox-TV with nether-night reruns of the
flinching Betty Currie footage, the beret rope-line tableau and,
evermore, the wagging finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it take to make it end?'' Mark Russell, the
capital's resident political humorist, asks of the scandal story.
``Saddam Hussein at Camp David. Or  &UR; John &LR;  Doe No. 5. Fifteen
percent unemployment by the Easter recess? Jane Doe Nos. 5 through
26 on `20-20.''' Russell pauses, as if at wit's end about it all.
``How about at the Academy Awards, Elia Kazan names Charlton Heston
as a communist?''
</P>
<P>
   But it becomes harder to laugh at the story that wraps around
itself, at ``this daily mud-slide into the nation's living rooms,''
as House Democratic Whip David Bonior described it last fall. He
failed to defeat impeachment, but he left a ringing question: ``Do
we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky? Two more years of
Linda Tripp?'' That now seems an existential question. (Political
comedian Al Franken comments, ``I think the next phase of the story
will be articles like yours.'')
</P>
<P>
   For sheer durability, the story is beginning to resemble a toxic
waste dump of fetid ingredients and methane energies. The news
media cannot afford not to see the story through. The president's
enemies, naturally, stand ready to continue feeding the pile. And
then there are the sorry deposits offered by Clinton himself, whose
search for historic legacy seems increasingly overwhelmed by vapors
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboling in the unsensational agenda of yore, House Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt was fairly trilling his way last week through
a masterful riff on the looming Social Security issue when he was
suddenly asked, ``What's your reaction to the Juanita Broaddrick
allegations?'' A heartfelt sigh was his purest reaction to the Jane
Doe No. 5 story about the emergence of apparently unprovable rape
charges against Clinton. ``Boy, the frustration I sense out there
among people about continuing all of this dialogue is palpable,''
Gephardt began, patiently observing what the nation now well knows,
that the legal system has ``all kinds of mechanisms'' for dealing
with this latest tangent in the unending story.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists should note that House Republicans, the main force
behind impeachment, are reported scandal weary. ``There's a death
rattle from a few people still calling my office, the kind who
think the Clintons killed Vince Foster,'' said Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y., who was inundated with critics' complaints two months ago
when he opposed impeachment. ``But there was silence _ not even a
hint about the impeachment _ at this week's Republican
conference,'' he related approvingly. ``The specter's out there.
But there's a feeling that maybe if we don't talk about it, it
won't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers find the body politic scarred with media needle
tracks. ``It really is like a narcotic,'' says Bill Kovach, curator
of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.
``You can't just go cold turkey if you're all-Monica,
all-the-time.'' He finds the latest twist, the long-rumored rape
allegation, troublesome because it reached mainline newspapers
after the acquittal when the staunchly anti-Clinton Wall Street
Journal editorial page provided an outlet. Such a polemical spark
could muddy traditional journalism, Kovach worries.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, one of the president's defenders from
impeachment, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sees progress in the
Jane Doe postscript. ``If Jane Doe 5 emerged a year ago, there
would have been far wider acceptance,'' he says. ``The Lewinsky
experience has made the media more careful and people more
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe more inured, in the view of Mark Shields, a political
analyst whose normal spirit of relishing knockabout politics is
notably absent from this story that will not die. ``I think this
thing is going to be with us,'' he estimates, wary as a character
in those movies about the hockey-mask fiend. ``Maybe not in the
sense of the consciousness of the country, of people talking about
it. But it will manifest itself in what we look for in a potential
president the next time _ someone with  &UR; no surprises &LR; .''

 &HT;    Journalists struggle with how to cover a could-be crisis
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ ``Maddening.'' ``Frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists struggled to find words to describe their feelings
about covering the great enigma: the year 2000 computer flaw, also
known as Y2K. At a seminar last Tuesday at the Media Studies Center
in midtown Manhattan, about 70 reporters from around the country
tried to figure out how to better cover what may turn out to be one
of the most significant events in modern history _ or one of the
biggest yawns in media history.
</P>
<P>
   Unless reporters get the story straight soon, ``we're going to
have supply riots in the fall'' as confused citizens scramble for
food and batteries, one expert thundered. Victor Porlier, author of
the book ``Y2K: An Action Plan for January 1, 2000,'' accused the
press of providing so little accurate information on the computer
bug that most people's behavior will be governed by ignorance and
panic later this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, The Washington Post ran a front-page story about a
leaked draft copy of a special Senate committee study on Y2K.
According to the draft of the report scheduled for release next
Tuesday, the senators also accuse the press of blowing the Y2K
story: ``Reports in even the most reputable news sources fall prey
to polarization _ either overemphasizing the handful of Y2K
survivalists or downplaying the event as a hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't the mainstream media just provide the simple
facts?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that although all journalists are trained to
interview people and examine public documents, we are not taught
how to inspect software for, say, a nuclear power plant. How can we
possibly tell whether a plant's computers have Y2K bugs? We have to
rely on experts for information about potential software foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But experts with similar levels of education and experience in
computer programming offer wildly differing assessments of Y2K
problems. The only point of agreement is on the bug's origin:
millions of computers and computer chips embedded in equipment were
programmed to read only the last two digits of a year, so that 1999
is understood as ``99.'' When the year turns to 2000, or ``00,''
these computers may misread the date as 1900, causing many of them
to malfunction or shut down in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these malfunctions will have major consequences is a
mystery because so many computers are in so many varying stages of
being repaired or replaced. Old computers that might have caused
catastrophes are being tossed into the trash. Embedded chips are
being tested and updated. But at what pace? Are government
officials and corporate executives solving the problem, as most
insist they are? Or are they lying to avoid panics?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel's report itself provides another
head-scratching dilemma for journalists. Should headlines trumpet
the encouraging news when the report is released next week? Or
should headlines focus on the frightening warnings about
electricity blackouts and other problems?
</P>
<P>
   Y2K will be ``one of the most serious and potentially
devastating events this nation has ever encountered,'' the leaked
draft reads. ``In some cases, lives could even be at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy shamoley. That sounds terrible.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft report also says banks and other financial-service
firms are well prepared to handle Y2K and predicts that a national
power breakdown won't happen. It also claims Social Security checks
will not be interrupted and predicts no major disruptions in
air-traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   So how should journalists cover this report, as good news or
bad?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popular image of ``the media'' as being made up of
cocky reporters who ``just want to sell newspapers,'' those who
were gathered at the Media Studies Center, a research institute,
were a quiet bunch, humbled by the difficulty of trying to provide
solid information when the fundamental fact about Y2K is that no
one really knows the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hope that what you report is right,'' said Alan
Wechsler, a reporter for the Times Union in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This is a regular report by Atlanta Constitution editorial
writer Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hezbollah volunteers for Netanyahu's campaign
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   However horrid it might sound, the offensive by Hezbollah
guerrillas against Israeli soldiers in Southern Lebanon is the best
thing that could happen to Benjamin Netanyahu at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is in the political fight of his life, besieged to his
right by radical Israelis who detest any peace plan with the
Palestinians, reviled on the left by those in favor of the peace
process but who see Netanyahu as an obstructionist toward that end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hezbollah _ sensing retaliatory Israeli reaction
to any attack on its people or troops _ is running Israel's
political machine and, likely, its next election.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis already have struck back and will continue to do
so, tit-for-tat. Any thought of Israel withdrawing from Southern
Lebanon, an issue between the Israeli right and left, would appear
to be put on hold; Israelis don't run from a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, while klutzy in some of his domestic and foreign
stances, is firm on one issue: Israel makes no peace under duress.
</P>
<P>
   While the action in Southern Lebanon is not Palestinian
connected so much as it involves the hands of Iran and Syria,
Netanyahu will be judged by how he handles the Hezbollah activity.
And, likely, he will handle it with force and with public
statements that Israel will not and cannot pull out of Southern
Lebanon as long as there exists a danger to Israel's northern
border.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the radicals of right and left in the Israeli
electorate lie the masses, turned emotionally by each and every
event in the Middle East. The Hezbollah attacks in Southern Lebanon
were designed to effect them, to bring them over to the Netanyahu
side, as that is the side that will not execute a peace plan with
the Palestinians or Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Hezbollah and its sponsors want: a continued
stalemate in the peace process, one so frustrating that Yasser
Arafat, despite U.S. urging not to do so, will declare an
independent Palestinian state, thereby enraging Netanyahu and
bringing to a close any hope of Israel carrying out the Wye River
peace accords brokered by Bill Clinton and Jordan's late King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   So delicate is the Middle East that a single act of terrorism or
warfare can turn Israel's malleable center into a revenge-demanding
mass that will stand behind Netanyahu's fist-clenching insistence
that no peace can be sought until all attacks upon Israel
terminate.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Iran knew this about Netanyahu and the Israeli center
all along. What has happened in Southern Lebanon in the past few
days was calculated to be part of Israel's election campaign, not
that the Syrians and Iranians were invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But now that they are deeply involved. The glib Netanyahu will
take advantage of it, not only from his rostrum, but militarily as
well. He really has no other choice. Syria and Iran want Netanyahu
re-elected, not because they love him, but because they know that
as long as he serves as Israeli prime minister, there likely will
not be an accomplished, meaningful peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu felt pressured by Clinton to sign the Wye River peace
accords and, upon returning to Israel, had second thoughts about
it, especially when he met stiff resistance from his own Likud
party which, like the hard-line Arabs, have a too-expensive price
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   He easily can mount his platform and call for Arafat to stop the
Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon but he knows that Arafat has little
to no power over the Hezbollah. Arafat's albatross is the Hamas,
and he's not done well in slowing them down.
</P>
<P>
   It all points to a continued heating up in the Middle East, a
situation that will turn many of the dovish in Israel back into
Netanyahu's hands as he cries out against terrorism against his
people. That, and Netanyahu's military responses to Hezbollah, will
help him immeasurably in the coming election.

NUMERICALLY SPEAKING, Y2K WILL BE TERRIBLE FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh-dear-oh-dear-oh-dear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's the way all this alarming Y2K stuff has me feeling. The
world's going to end. And if it doesn't, then at least we'll all be
plunged into endless darkness and cold. And if that doesn't happen,
why, maybe we won't get to see our favorite shows on TV or
something. It'll be awful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what's worse, it's all inevitable because it's in the
numbers. I can't see how we can avoid catastrophe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just recently this was all driven home to me when a friend sent
along a frightful column by one Gershom Gorenberg in a publication
called ``The Jerusalem Report.'' Gorenberg writes that a
prophet-like fellow named Jacob Oved stopped by recently to tell
him that the world will start coming to an end in the Jewish year
5760, which begins in September of this year, 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oved says he used clues found in an ancient Jewish mystical text
to learn that ``240 years before the seventh millennium (that is,
in 5760), the waters will rise and cover the earth, and only the
Land of Israel will remain, like Noah's Ark.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Gorenberg learned from a letter writer to his magazine, an
old Jewish mystical text says the purification of the world will
begin in 5760 because a ritual bath must contain 40
(ital)se'ahs(end-ital) of water, each made up of 144 ``eggs,'' a
traditional unit of volume. And 40 times 144 is 5760. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways of arriving at 5760, says Gorenberg. In
fact, he says, ``5760 is a multiple of so many numbers that anyone
who has sent in two boxtops for a junior kabbalist's kit can make
it mean anything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kabbala, or cabala, refers to a religious philosophy developed
by certain rabbis in the Middle Ages based on a mystical
interpretation of scripture. It's become so trendy lately, in fact,
that even Madonna (and lots of other entertainment industry folks)
busies herself nowadays studying this matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gorenberg, in fact, goes on to demonstrate his point about how
easy it is to come up with 5760 by predicting the return of Babe
Ruth and Jesus Alou to baseball in 5760 (1999 or 2000). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He points out that when the name Babe is translated into Hebrew
it has a numeric value of 24. Ruth hit 60 homers in one season,
which puts him at No. 4 on the all-time charts, behind Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Roger Maris. So 24 times 4 times 60 equals
5760. See? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's all clear to me now. The reason the world is so
nervous about the Y2K arrival (which would be Y5.76K in Hebrew) is
that all signs point to its being simply momentous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, for instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 212.73 points. If you multiply that by my precise age when I
first bought mutual funds (27.076575), you come up with _ what
else? _ 5760. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not yet sure why a semi-decent Presbyterian like me should
be turning up personal end-of-the-world predictions that conform to
the Jewish calender, unless it has to do with the Jewish roots of
my faith, but there you are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's more worrisome to me is that these predictions also are
showing up for the year expressed as 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, through the end of the previous paragraph I'd
written 553 words in this column. If you multiply 553 times the
number of cookies I ate for breakfast time morning (3.6166365) you
get 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's uncanny. All signs point to disaster. But if I'm wrong and
the world doesn't end in 2000 (or 5760), I'm cashing in my mutual
funds and buying a pizza. If I have to wait around for the end, I
don't want to do it hungry. &QL;
</P>
<P>

PRESIDENTIAL TAPES: NIXON WANTED TO SHOW UP JFK

   WASHINGTON _ President Richard M. Nixon was a man obsessed.
Ample illumination of this comes in new transcripts of tapes
secretly recorded in the White House between 1971 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The following bits of conversation, previously withheld from the
public on grounds of national security, show Nixon and his aides
trying to directly implicate the late President John F. Kennedy in
the November 1963 assassination of South Vietnamese President Ngo
Dihn Diem.
</P>
<P>
   With that killing, South Vietnam's weak civilian leadership died
and ``U.S. policy in Vietnam plunged into the unknown,'' in the
words of the authors of the Pentagon Papers, the secret government
history of the Vietnam war published by The New York Times in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nixon discussed how to pin the murder on the man who
defeated him for the presidency in 1960, in a vote that Nixon
always considered a stolen election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not even the president was able to compel the
national-security bureaucracy to declassify secrets. The public
record available today shows that while U.S. officials, including
Kennedy, approved of the military coup in which Diem was
assassinated, they did not directly order his death.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were released last week by the National Archives, and
transcripts of them were prepared by the privately financed Nixon
Presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif.

everything that's 10 years old, and declassify the whole Bay of
Pigs, plus the Diem thing. Goddammit, you know, that's _ that can
only be helpful. Now you say, ``Well, it'll stir things up in
Vietnam.'' The hell with it. You don't like that, huh?

considered. ...

looked at the Bay of Pigs stuff, but I know there's stuff in there
that makes ((McGeorge)) Bundy ((Kennedy's national security
adviser)) look like a goddamn _ uh, you know, terrible. ...
Goddammit, you know what happened is, they set in motion a chain of
events which resulted in the murder of Diem.
</P>
<P>
   Haig: Oh, there's no question about that. None. ... In fact, you
know, the vice president's aide was there. He was Lodge's assistant
((when Henry Cabot Lodge was ambassador to South Vietnam)). I
talked to him some years ago about that.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: What'd he say?

said, ``They're going to kill me, for God's sake, send some Marine
guards up here.'' &QL; 
Nixon: This is a good juicy thing to get out. ... I mean, that was
what Hunt was looking into, you know, and screwed it up. But the
point is, there's a hell of a record there. Now, somebody _ have
you got some trusted person that can look at that goddamn thing,
and let's declassify it. It's 10 years old, huh?
</P>
<P>

declassified, and I want it done in 48 hours. Now you tell Haig
that. It'll drive him up the wall, too. But I want it done. Do you
understand? This is 10 years old! Declassify it. We've got a couple
of ((expletive)) working on this thing. Do you see any reason why
it shouldn't be declassified, Ron?
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Ziegler, press secretary: No, I see no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: I want them to get off _ now, Haig is disturbed because
of the ironies involved in the murder of Diem. Now listen, this
government murdered him. I know it and you know it, too.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The recent capture of Kurdish guerrilla
leader Abdullah Ocalan has focused new attention on the war he has
waged against the Turkish army for 14 years. In recruiting fighters
and supporters, Ocalan has fed on the resentment many Kurds feel
for what they consider the government's unjust discrimination
against them. But he could never have built such a potent force
without great amounts of help from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Ocalan found foreign supporters for
his bloody rebellion against Turkish rule, and why Turkey has
resisted his rebellion so fiercely. Some are to be found in
history, others in psychology, and still others in geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind them all, however, is water.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade until last October, Ocalan lived
semi-clandestinely in Syria, and the Syrian government gave him
money, arms and political cover. Iraq also helped him, allowing him
to build bases along the Iraqi-Turkish border. Neither Syria nor
Iraq were embracing his cause out of any love for Kurds; on the
contrary, governments in both countries have fiercely repressed
their own Kurdish populations.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria and Iraq want water from rivers that spring from
Turkish soil. Turkey has given them what it considers ample amounts
of water, but rejects what it calls their ``unacceptable claims.''
They have supported Ocalan's fighters as a way of applying pressure
on Turkey to give them more water.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers created the ``Fertile Crescent''
where some of the first civilizations emerged. Today they are
immensely important resources, politically as well as
geographically. Through a system of dams in its southeastern
provinces, Turkey controls their flow and is determined not to give
up its control. That is one important reason that Turkish leaders
have so resolutely refused to grant any autonomy to the Kurdish
region, which straddles both rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any countries understand the growing importance of water
as fully as Turkey does. In one of the world's largest public works
undertakings, Turkey is spending $32 billion for the huge Southeast
Anatolia Project, a complex of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants.
Its centerpiece, the Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates River, is already
completed. In the reservoir that has built up behind the dam,
sailing and swimming competitions are being held on a spot where
for centuries there was little more than desert.
</P>
<P>
   When the project is completed, perhaps in the next decade, it is
expected to increase the amount of irrigated land in Turkey by 40
percent and provide one-fourth of the country's electric power
needs. Planners hope this can improve the standard of living of 6
million of Turkey's poorest people, most of them Kurds, and thus
undercut the appeal of revolutionary separatism. It will also
deprive Syria and Iraq of resources those countries believe they
need _ resources that Turkey fears might ultimately be used in
anti-Turkish causes.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Turkey where Kurds predominate is more or less the
same region covered by the Southeast Anatolia Project, encompassing
an area about the size of Austria. Giving that region autonomy by
placing it under Kurdish self-rule could weaken the central
government's control over the water resource that it recognizes as
a keystone of its future power.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways also, Turkish leaders are using their water as a
tool of foreign as well as domestic policy. Among their most
ambitious new projects is one to build a 50-mile undersea pipeline
to carry water from Turkey to the parched Turkish enclave on
northern Cyprus. The pipeline will carry more water than northern
Cyprus can use, and foreign mediators like Richard Holbrooke,
deeply frustrated by their inability to break the political
deadlock on Cyprus, are hoping that the excess water can be sold to
the ethnic Greek republic on the southern part of the island as a
way of promoting peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is a
water engineer by profession and entered public life as director of
the State Waterworks Administration. His background and that of his
classmate in engineering school, the late President Turgut Ozal,
have done much to make Turkey so water conscious. Both men
vigorously supported the Southeast Anatolia Project in the 1980s
even though Western countries, including the United States, refused
to provide loans or credits for it because they did not want to
alienate Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important developments in the Middle East in the
last 20 years has been the emergence of a strong partnership
between Turkey and Israel. Both countries have much to gain from
it; for Israel water is among the greatest potential benefits.
Israel is thirsting for water, and Turkey is overflowing with it.
Intensive studies are now under way to see whether tankers,
pipelines or other means can be used to send Turkey's water to its
new Israeli friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the basis for the Turkey-Israel partnership
was laid when Demirel headed the Turkish government and another
water engineer, Yitzhak Rabin, was in power in Israel. ``If we
solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not
satisfactorily resolve the water problem, our region will
explode,'' Rabin once said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Middle Eastern leaders have agreed. The late King Hussein
of Jordan asserted that conflicts over water ``could drive nations
of the region to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey may be the world's most water-conscious country, and the
Middle East the region where water issues are most urgent. But
competition for water, and for the power that control of water
represents, is intensifying from Africa and Central Asia to Los
Angeles and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's population of 5.9 billion will double in the next
40 to 90 years,'' former Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., has written in a
new book titled ``Tapped Out'' that examines global water problems.
``Our water supply, however, is constant,'' he wrote, as ``per
capita water consumption is rising twice as fast as the world's
population. You do not have to be an Einstein to understand that we
are headed toward a potential calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries that control water are likely to be the big winners of
the future. Turkey is among them. Its policies have for years been
shaped by a desire to use water to achieve political aims, and the
policies are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water has been used as a means of pressure, for example the
Syrians sponsoring Kurdish separatism because they want more
water,'' said Ishak Alaton, a visionary Turkish businessman whose
company has won the contract to build the water pipeline to Cyprus
and is conducting a feasibility study for a pipeline to Israel.
``It can also be used for peace, as we are hoping in Cyprus. You
can't overstate its importance. I firmly believe that just as the
20th century was the century of oil, the 21st century will be the
century of water.''

   LONDON _ Most dramas have their sub-plots, and the talks that
stalled last week over Yugoslavia's torn province of Kosovo were no
exception. While the big theme was war and peace in the Balkans, a
lesser-noted coda was the complicated bond between Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Britain and continental Europe that, just weeks ago,
promised a new hope of containing conflagration on the continent's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, has always been an ambivalent European,
seeking to mold the continent's affairs _ often from the sidelines
_ even as it holds onto a special relationship with Washington that
long predates European integration.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this dual vision seems seeded with conflict.
But the course of the Kosovo talks may, in fact, have validated
Blair's desire to keep his options open as he tries to make the
case that Britain is a major player.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the negotiations on Kosovo until March 15 was
first of all a severe blow to the prestige of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who placed her influence on the line for
three straight days in a vain attempt to emulate the U.S.
diplomatic success at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   But her very presence at the negotiations _ and the use of the
threat of U.S.-led NATO bombing to get the talks started _
illuminated another reality. Once again, the Americans had taken a
leading role in the negotiations because Europeans, acting by
themselves, could not do it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but
their dominant role at the end was not in the original script,
certainly not as seen from here.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and
Britain _ the two countries that would provide the bulk of a
NATO-led ground force (along with U.S. Russian and other troops) to
police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to
commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's
frustration at past U.S. diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans,
but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders
of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to
see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the
Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European
Reform, a research group regarded as close to Blair's New Labor
government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a
departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the
breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its
diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations
flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was
being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including
France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro.
This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its
relationships to the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Blair nudged his country closer to eventual
adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for
joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political
caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to
abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly
would be the last of the four hold-outs to enter the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   The broader implications of that hesitancy had long been
apparent to Blair. As the advent of the new currency approached, he
sensed that Britain might wind up on the sidelines. But he had an
alternative strategy: to emphasize Britain's military and
diplomatic leadership, building on what Britain sees as a
privileged position in Washington that enhances its ability to mold
Europe's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That was one element in the decision to offer a new European
initiative in the Balkans. When Blair traveled to the French town
of St. Malo late last year to meet Lionel Jospin, his French
counterpart, he was ``frustrated that the Americans were running
the show on Kosovo and the Europeans were not,'' said Grant. The
result was the so-called ``St. Malo initiative'' _ an effort to
forge a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a French diplomat remarked the other day, it seems that
the initiative's first tests came a little too soon. Not only did
the Americans turn out to have played a larger role than
anticipated in the Kosovo talks, but Britain made it abundantly
clear that its European commitment was intended to complement, not
replace, the time-tested ties to Washington that some British
critics depict as a slavish readiness to do Uncle Sam's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among its supposed European partners, Britain sent its
warplanes to bomb Iraq last December, while the rest of Europe _
France in particular _ looked on disapprovingly. And while Blair
and Jospin foresaw the creation of a pan-European defense industry
as part of their initiative, two of Britain's biggest defense
contractors went their own way last month, announcing a merger that
left potential French and German suitors smarting.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Britain seems to be carving out its own role _ European
by trade and geography, but not in its soul, an island only 22
miles from France that feels closer in strategic and economic
philosophy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fundamental political and historical differences in
the perception of security'' separating Britain and its European
partners, said Col. Terence Taylor of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies. ``And because of these fundamental
differences, Britain can stand with the United States where others
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after last month's British defense merger, Josef Joffe,
a German newspaper columnist in Munich, remarked that the deal
``will keep Britain going as a global player, which in some
respects is more important than being a European power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is doing well on economic integration, but it will not
be a strategic partner for some time to come,'' he said.

themselves, could not do it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but
their dominant role at the end was not in the original script,
certainly not as seen from here.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and
Britain _ the two countries that would provide the bulk of a
NATO-led ground force (along with U.S. Russian and other troops) to
police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to
commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's
frustration at past U.S. diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans,
but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders
of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to
see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the
Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European
Reform, a research group regarded as close to Blair's New Labor
government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a
departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the
breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its
diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations
flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was
being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including
France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro.
This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its
relationships to the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Blair nudged his country closer to eventual
adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for
joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political
caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to
abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly
would be the last of the four hold-outs to enter the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   The broader implications of that hesitancy had long been
apparent to Blair. As the advent of the new currency approached, he
sensed that Britain might wind up on the sidelines. But he had an
alternative strategy: to emphasize Britain's military and
diplomatic leadership, building on what Britain sees as a
privileged position in Washington that enhances its ability to mold
Europe's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That was one element in the decision to offer a new European
initiative in the Balkans. When Blair traveled to the French town
of St. Malo late last year to meet Lionel Jospin, his French
counterpart, he was ``frustrated that the Americans were running
the show on Kosovo and the Europeans were not,'' said Grant. The
result was the so-called ``St. Malo initiative'' _ an effort to
forge a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a French diplomat remarked the other day, it seems that
the initiative's first tests came a little too soon. Not only did
the Americans turn out to have played a larger role than
anticipated in the Kosovo talks, but Britain made it abundantly
clear that its European commitment was intended to complement, not
replace, the time-tested ties to Washington that some British
critics depict as a slavish readiness to do Uncle Sam's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among its supposed European partners, Britain sent its
warplanes to bomb Iraq last December, while the rest of Europe _
France in particular _ looked on disapprovingly. And while Blair
and Jospin foresaw the creation of a pan-European defense industry
as part of their initiative, two of Britain's biggest defense
contractors went their own way last month, announcing a merger that
left potential French and German suitors smarting.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Britain seems to be carving out its own role _ European
by trade and geography, but not in its soul, an island only 22
miles from France that feels closer in strategic and economic
philosophy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fundamental political and historical differences in
the perception of security'' separating Britain and its European
partners, said Col. Terence Taylor of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies. ``And because of these fundamental
differences, Britain can stand with the United States where others
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after last month's British defense merger, Josef Joffe,
a German newspaper columnist in Munich, remarked that the deal
``will keep Britain going as a global player, which in some
respects is more important than being a European power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is doing well on economic integration, but it will not
be a strategic partner for some time to come,'' he said.

   Taking Hostages in the War on Drunken Driving
</P>
<P>
   Having chased away (or at least forced underground) murderers,
burglars, robbers, drug traffickers, car thieves, muggers,
panhandlers and squeegee men, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has turned his attention to drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has seldom met a crime pattern he thinks he cannot
smash, ordered police to begin seizing the cars of nearly anyone
arrested for drunken driving, whether hard-core repeaters or
first-time offenders. And to make sure that New Yorkers understood
that he was very, very serious, the Mayor said that even for those
acquitted in criminal court of driving while intoxicated, the city
might still pursue the permanent confiscation of their cars in
civil court.
</P>
<P>
   That led The Financial Times, hardly a journal of the left, to
say that New York was ``fast becoming the Singapore of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's goal, of course, was to shock people into changing
their behavior. If you want to drink, he said, just make sure you
don't drive. Have a sober friend drive you home, take a cab or try
out New York's subways.
</P>
<P>
   While the political impact of the move was unclear, its legal
underpinning seemed firm. The Supreme Court has generally upheld
the use of forfeiture by federal and state prosecutors, who have
tried to inhibit the drug trade by charging traffickers with
criminal violations while also seizing their assets in civil
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are legal questions. Is it appropriate to
confiscate a car upon arrest rather than conviction? Is it fair to
seize the cars of drivers with unblemished records? Is the
punishment too varied, since one motorist could lose a car worth
$40,000 while another might forfeit one worth $1,000?
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these will no doubt keep the courts busy over the
next few months.

   On television, wrestling sells, sells big. Monday night's ``WWF
Raw'' on the USA Network is a top-rated cable program with millions
of viewers each week. But are viewers drawn to precision maneuvers,
artful pins, athletic excellence? Uh, not exactly. Turn on the show
for 30 seconds and you'll see behavior far more, well, indelicate:
crotch-grabbing, obscene gestures and on down the ladder of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Far too indelicate, it would seem, to be a fit subject for
statistical analysis. But as living, gut-crunching proof that
nothing is safe from scholarly probing, the small-screen tabloid
``Inside Edition'' commissioned an Indiana University study of a
year's worth of ``WWF Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're titillated by pro wrestling, gape on. If you're
disgusted, keep surfing. If you're a parent, worry. A third of
viewers are 17 and under, and many schoolchildren imitate the
obscene behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a data freak, a feast awaits, including the exact
number of times a crotch was grabbed, incidences of satanic
activity, scenes of wrestlers appearing to urinate as well as
categories too offensive to list. Plus the number of minutes out of
a two-hour telecast typically devoted to wrestling: 36.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not, by the way, say how many former pro
wrestlers have been elected governor (1) or how many times Garrison
Keillor, on his weekly radio show, ``Prairie Home Companion,'' has
poked fun at that governor, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.

   A Guilty Verdict In Texas Dragging Death
</P>
<P>
   John William King helped write himself onto Death Row. Until the
24-year-old white supremacist from Jasper, Texas, wrote a letter to
a local newspaper claiming that he had been in the pickup truck
with two other white men charged with dragging a black man to his
death in 1998, authorities had no direct evidence linking King to
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Then police found a trove of King's racist writings at his
apartment. Several young Jasper women stepped forward with letters
King wrote them while in prison on a burglary charge. And finally,
while awaiting trial, King tried to smuggle out a letter to another
defendant in which, prosecutors said, he all but confessed to the
murder of the man, James Byrd, a 49-year-old Jasper resident.
</P>
<P>
   King's weeklong trial ended with a rapid guilty verdict, and
three days later the jury wrote the final line: death by lethal
injection. The two other defendants are awaiting trial.

Clinton Legal Expense Trust, Clinton's supporters announced last

all, you don't have any plans to break into houses. Now that there
are real _ if sometimes overblown _ security risks on the Net, you
need to know a little about hacking in order to understand how to
protect yourself against it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start by saying that some old-line computer veterans hate
the notion of calling folks who break into computers hackers. The
term hacking was once more commonly used for a person who was good
at writing programs and computing in general. But nowadays, a
hacker is a person who enjoys learning about ways to break into
computer systems and networks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best primers on that type of hacking is comprised of
the information and links you'll find at the Mining Company's
Internet/Network Security site at http://netsecurity.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You'll find, for instance, the Modern Hacker's Desk
Reference, a fairly easy-to-understand tutorial on hacking. Once
you've read that, you'll understand the lingo. Then you can follow
one of the dozens of links on this page to sections that explain
some of the programs used to invade other computers and networks.
Some of the material is fairly advanced, but none of it should be
totally incomprehensible once you've learned the lingo. Pay special
attention to the links that take you to areas devoted to protecting
your computer against invasion.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the jargon you learn at that site because one of the
rules of hacking seems to be that any self-respecting hacker speaks
in technobabble. You'll sure find plenty of that at the next site,
but it is based on a print magazine that was one of the first
widely circulated periodicals for hackers: 2600.
</P>
<P>
   The site of that same name is located at http://www.2600.com
</P>
<P>
   /mindex.html. And there's no use mincing words, the viewpoint
here is definitely pro-hacking. You'll find a list here, for
instance, of Web sites that have recently been invaded and
conquered by hackers. There's a little bit of an attitude here,
too. But if your only exposure to hackers in the past has been ones
you've seen in movies or read about in books, it should be an
interesting visit.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there are good witches and bad witches in the old
storybooks, there are good and bad hackers, too. Some hackers _ at
least in their public philosophy _ avoid illegal break-ins and
study hacking as an art. A good hacker, for instance, feels obliged
to let a company know if he discovers flaws in a network, site or
program that make invasion easy. These hackers are best represented
by a group called Happy Hackers. If you go to http://
</P>
<P>
   netsecurity.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/weekly/aa052598
</P>
<P>
   .htm you can read an interview with Carolyn Meinel, the founder
of the group's Web site. (You can find a link on the same Web page
with the interview. The Happy Hacker site was working sporadically
last week.)
</P>
<P>
   One warning. Even though the group itself seems to be a good
one, some of the language in the interview is not. So parents
should preview the interview for suitability before suggesting it
to any young hackers in the family.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to keep up with what's new in hacking, you can
subscribe to a free publication from the Happy Hackers (just go the
Happy Hacker Web site) to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   None of these sites will turn you into a hacker. But that
probably isn't a career goal, anyway. You will learn enough to know
that (1) the threats from hackers are overblown, but (2) there are
some real dangers out there in cyberspace.

 &HT;    A little lying is part of the online culture
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among its other pluses is an occasional minus: The Internet is a
haven for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be full of lies, which is part of its appeal. In a
Web chat room, a short, lumpy unemployed person can become tall,
svelte and gainfully employed. And no one knows the difference.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good if you're just making small talk. But it's
hardly a way to start something real. Then again, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently some of us do. The March issue of Yahoo! Internet
Life takes a look at the tendency to lie online.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a wake of a year that was all about lying, it's easy to
pick up the habit. While the president was being pilloried for his
peccadilloes ... millions of people were practicing the art of
deception every day on the Internet,'' reads the cover story.
</P>
<P>
   But Web users seem to like the lie. The article cites Georgia
Tech's census of Web habits, considered by the magazine the ``most
prestigious general census of Web habits.'' According to the
article, privacy has replaced censorship as the issue most
important to Web users. More than 40 percent of Web users gave
false personal information occasionally, and 10 percent said they
lied at least half the time.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue also ranks America's top wired cities for 1999.
Atlanta placed ninth, behind San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Seattle;
Washington, D.C.; Boston; San Jose, Calif.: San Diego; and
Minneapolis. Atlanta was ahead of Dallas-Fort Worth, Raleigh-Durham
and Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta placed ninth in percentage of adults using the Web at
home and seventh in the number of sites per capita. Atlanta did not
crack the top 10 in two categories: percentage of adults using the
Net at work, which was led by Austin, and Web hosts per capita, led
by San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were compiled with help from Matrix Information
and Directory Services, an Austin firm that tracks Internet usage
</P>
<P>
   E-stickers
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Television Workshop, the people who bring us
``Sesame Street,'' are taking the stick out of stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Its site, http://www.ctw.org
</P>
<P>
   /stickerworld/1,2614,26265,00
</P>
<P>
   .html, features e-stickers, electronic images you can put on
your Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The Sticker World site is part of the Children's Television
Workshop Kid City site, at http://www.kidcity.org. Kid City is an
online site geared to those between the ages of 6 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets kids vote on whether they like television shows,
cartoons, bands and celebrities, and offers running tallies of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sticker World site lets kids build their own Web pages and
decorate them with the e-stickers, electronic images that come in
the form of graphics to interactive games and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Television Workshop is a nonprofit company that
uses television, the Internet, CD-ROM, print, film and product
licensing to entertain and educate kids.
</P>
<P>
   Online historic preservation
</P>
<P>
   An organization focused on preserving the past has taken a firm
step into the future. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation
has launched a Web site, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .georgiatrust.org.
</P>
<P>
   On the site is a monthly calendar of events and information
about the various preservation funds, as well as conferences and
tours. The site also offers links to properties for sale and
photographs of the trust's house museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia trust, founded in 1973, is the largest statewide
nonprofit preservation group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation operates three
historic houses, sells endangered properties, offers design
assistance to 30 Main Street communities in Georgia, and lobbies
for money and laws to help preservation efforts.

 &HT;    Trojan horses may be running wild, tapping into your hard drive
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to be an Internet celebrity? People all over
the world would know what you think and who you think about. Your
private e-mail correspondence would be widely read and admired.
Your financial records could be examined and discussed. Even the
text of letters you send through the U.S. mail _ as long as they
were created on your PC _ could be circulated around the Net like
an old-fashioned chain letter.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is you wouldn't like that kind of fame at all.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you who are reading this column right now _ not very
many, but some of you _ are already Internet celebrities. I know
this sounds a little fantastic, but there's a virulent form of
hacking growing in popularity that allows almost anyone to invade
your computer and read files, delete them or add new files ... all
from a remote computer while you are on the Internet. They don't
have to be a genius hacker to do it. Instead, they can download a
program from one of the many hacker sites on the Net and follow the
directions _ as easy as reading a cookbook to bake a cake.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works, once the hacker has the spying program. You
receive an e-mail with an attachment. Maybe it's supposed to be a
funny little program, or an electronic greeting card, or even a
video or photograph designed to be read from a file called
funny.exe or maybe porno.exe. It could have almost any name.
</P>
<P>
   When you open the attachment, it may work just fine. But along
with the picture or the card, your computer receives a tiny hidden
virulent program called a Trojan horse. The reason for the name is
fairly obvious _ the bad program comes disguised inside an
innocuous program.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many of these programs _ called backdoor programs
by some _ to name them all. Once transferred to your computer, they
allow it to be operated by remote control while you are on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   New programs like this _ and increasingly better ones more
difficult to find and remove _ are created every day. But two of
the best known are called Back Orfice and Master of Paradise. These
programs turn your computer into the equivalent of an Internet
server accessible by any other computer on the Net. So the bad guy
who sends the trojan horse can sit somewhere miles and miles away
and do almost anything he wishes with your data.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you pull the plug on your Internet connection, let me
explain most of you don't need to worry about programs like this.
To enter your computer _ even if you have a Trojan horse hiding
inside it _ the bad guy needs to know your address on the Internet.
This address isn't readily apparent when you log on to check your
mail or browse the Web. The real risk from these hidden spy
programs comes when you are logged on to one of the Internet chat
groups such as IRC. A simple command, while you are on IRC, will
reveal your address. Then, while you are logged on and chatting
away, another IRC user can invade your computer.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you aren't a regular on the chat channels, or one of the
game sites where your opponent connects to your computer using the
IP address of your machine, you are perfectly safe. And, even then,
you're still safe if you've never accepted an attachment from
someone you don't know and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if you spend more time chatting than my Aunt
Sally, you're probably still safe. Most of these backdoor programs
I know about rely on your computer having a setting called
``sharing.'' Unless you are using your home computer on a network
with other machines in your home, make sure that setting is turned
off. Just open the icon in your Control Panel called Network. Then
click on the button called File and Print Sharing. Make sure the
two checkboxes are blank. If they are checked, click on the
checkmarks to disable sharing.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I didn't want to interrupt your chat. You just needed to
know you may be talking louder _ and to more people _ than you
figured.

   COMMENTARY: COLD BRINGS A NEW VOICE, A NEW LIFE
</P>
<P>
   By MARK LANE
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I didn't always sound this way.
</P>
<P>
   My voice generally is a more uncertain instrument. On bad days,
it wavers into tonalities that have been explored by Mr. Rogers,
Barney Fife, the pizza-delivery boy on ``The Simpsons'' and many of
your finer hand-puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, it does not. Today, it is a rich baritone. To
put it in starkly '70s terms, I went to sleep sounding like the Bee
Gees and woke up sounding like Barry White.
</P>
<P>
   (Yehhhh. Can't get enough of your love, bayhbe.)
</P>
<P>
   Upper respiratory infection was never so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The February cold that settled in my chest lowered my voice a
good octave. Gave it resonance. New authority.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs obey me. Children fear me. Telemarketers apologize for
calling. Secretaries put my calls through. Women casually mention
their marital status in the course of conversations. Mechanics tell
me everything will be ready today. Waitresses refill my coffee cup
before its half empty. Cats carry out my commands and teenagers
listen respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the last sentence is a lie; nonetheless, it captures the
promise of this new condition. It is like having a whole new kind
of life. Like waking up and being someone else, someone familiar
but just a little shinier, a little better, a little easier for the
world to take.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice is no overnight sensation, either. It started
unbelievably low. Luke,-I-am-your-father low. Then it rose to Barry
White levels and then to an Elvis pitch. Even after I stopped
hacking like a seal, my chest cold lingered and with it my
new-found timbre.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer sounded sick, yet I stayed low. It was wonderful. I
started re-recording my answering machine and voice-mail
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Great Oz with his artificially low voice booming
through speakers, I now tell callers I cannot speak to them at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave your insignificant message at the beep. The Great Oz
will then decide whether to take up your petition. Pay no attention
to that man you called last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Too cool.
</P>
<P>
   I had never before suspected how much my voice, the old voice,
may have damaged my life fortunes. Diminished my prospects. I found
people treat you better when your voice sounds resonate and
radio-ready.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who writes for a living, I have always thought that
words speak for themselves. You put them on paper and they mean
pretty much the same thing whether read out loud by Don Knotts or
James Earl Jones. That the right word means more than the right
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   No way. Well chosen words sound too clever to believe when
spoken high and reedy. Poorly chosen words sound too dumb to
believe. But in my new voice, I am utterly believable all the time.
I can read menus and sound like a philosopher. Read the fine print
on ant poison and sound like a poet.
</P>
<P>
   In my usual voice, I could recite the Gettysburg Address and
people would suspect I was selling time-share condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful this spell would wear off any moment, I started calling
friends out of town. I hoped to convince them that I was far
smoother and charming than they remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Lane?'' answered a distant redhead. ``I have no earthly
idea why you'd want to claim to be that guy, but you can just keep
on talking as long as you like. You don't sound at all like the
kind of guy who disappears from the table when he sees a waiter
coming with the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the next best thing to plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Like all good things, this is bound to pass. Already some of the
old squeakiness is returning. Fortunately, the first flush of warm
weather and its attending molds and pollens are just around the
corner. If my sinuses do their work. I can move seamlessly from
cold season to allergy season. I just may have a chance to ride
this out for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   I'm good until summer. After that, I'm just hoping medical
science come up with a breakthough. Vocal Viagra. I should ask
about it now. While doctors will still listen to me.

 &HT;    Apple says new software titles are in the pipeline, but where?
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent trade conference in Tokyo, Apple announced more than
1,500 new software programs for the Mac have been released.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news, I guess, except where do you find all these
new titles?
</P>
<P>
   They aren't showing up yet in stores, online sites or mail-order
catalogs. In fact, I'm still seeing a decline in titles for the
Mac. That's especially true for business software. There's now only
an electronic dictionary, and I see only three personal information
managers _ Act!, Consultant and InTouch _ advertised in the
mail-order catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Some titles that have gone by the wayside in the last year or
two include WebArranger, Claris Organizer, Random House Electronic
Dictionary and Claris Emailer.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect, long the biggest challenger to Microsoft Office, is
debating whether to continue developing for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping this gap between new software releases and what I see
for sale merely reflects a crossroads. Software production for the
Mac had nearly shut down last year, and then came the iMac. Its
success is sparking new interest in the Mac platform.
</P>
<P>
   I know it sounds like a stretch, but there is some evidence to
support such an argument. For one, some big developers that had
been on the fence about releasing new Mac titles have now decided
in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   Maxis is developing a Mac version of its new ``SimCity 3000,''
and Blizzard is doing the same for its popular war strategy game
``Starcraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Japanese developer has released a Mac-only title,
``Yoot Tower,'' which is an updated version of ``SimTower.'' When
was the last time you heard a game developed first for the Mac
rather than the PC?
</P>
<P>
   The development of these games is not fun and games when it
comes to the Mac. It helps decide the Mac's future.
</P>
<P>
   With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will
thrive again. It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one
wants to write software for the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor,
all dressed up with nowhere to go.

 &HT;    COMMMENTARY: Nature of playing has changed
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Long before Edison screwed in his first light
bulb, or Don Ameche invented the telephone, the word ``virtual''
meant that something was almost the same as the real thing, but not
quite. Today, ``virtual'' has become reality for a lot of solitary
kids tapping out life in front of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer need parents or playmates to have fun. Thanks to
high-tech genius, they can now join virtual people visiting a
virtual amusement park, and even go for a virtual ride on a
rollercoaster. Then, if they're still lonely, they can boogie on
down to the local toy store and buy a ``virtual family'' or a
``virtual friend'' with whom they may interact.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of generations ago when a few of us neighborhood kids
headed for a vacant lot and chose up sides for a ballgame, the
inevitable bickering over foul balls and stolen bases was our idea
of interaction. Today, the word has taken on an entirely new
meaning. Contemporary youth ``interact'' with computers and toys
designed for a single player. One toy company is introducing a
football that's flat on one end so a kid can throw it against the
wall and play catch with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Do-nothing dolls like the ones I used to cuddle and play house
with have been displaced by models that sing, tell jokes, and
pretend to be the young owner's best buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagination has given way to wires and batteries, and the idea
of calling a friend to come out and play now seems an antiquated
notion. Too bad. Toys, like ideas, were meant to be shared,
otherwise they're not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Tootie and I knew all about that. We shared our play
just like we shared the puffy cinnamon rolls her mom used to bake
on Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   On warm days, Tootie and I would set up housekeeping on a
blanket spread under the old pear tree in my back yard. Often, we
spent more time setting up than we did playing. Out would come the
toy stove and the sink with real
</P>
<P>
   running water (as long as we kept the reservoir on the back
full). Tea sets, pots and pans, cribs and carriages - nothing was
overlooked in our quest to turn a collection of mismatched toys
into two little girls' dream home.
</P>
<P>
   It took both of us to move my round table and chairs under the
grape arbor. We set up the kitchen beside the sandbox since that
was where we ``cooked'' moist sand in miniature muffin tins.
Tootie's blue tin telephone would be conveniently wedged in the
crotch of the tree for when make-believe friends called inviting us
to pretend tea parties.
</P>
<P>
   The darkened garage the at the end of the driveway was our
``theater'' where we sometimes took the dolls for a Blondie movie.
Other days it was where we trod the boards as famous actresses and
invited neighborhood kids to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Rainy days drove us inside and to the dining room floor where we
built entire cities from the Lincoln Logs and assorted blocks I
kept in the huge cardboard box my father's new G.E. radio (the one
with the green tuning eye) had come in.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed in a project, we'd build for hours, swapping blocks and
sharing a vision. It made no difference to us that log cabins and
castles were incongruous neighbors on the adjoining squares in the
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Late afternoons, just about the time we'd be roofing a cabin or
finishing up a moat, the inevitable would happen. Mother would haul
the empty box over and tell us to pick it all up so she could set
the table for dinner. Naturally, we'd complain we weren't finished
playing with it yet, but as we groused, we tossed. I remember the
sound of the blocks bouncing against the cardboard sides.
</P>
<P>
   Some days Tootie and I argued. Our spats never lasted long
because we needed each other. There was no retreat to a solitary
room to seek companionship in a hand-held virtual life. The
reality, whatever it was at the moment, was just
</P>
<P>
   too good to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, our batteries never ran down.

 &HT;    A little lying is part of the online culture
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among its other pluses is an occasional minus: The Internet is a
haven for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be full of lies, which is part of its appeal. In a
Web chat room, a short, lumpy unemployed person can become tall,
svelte and gainfully employed. And no one knows the difference.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good if you're just making small talk. But it's
hardly a way to start something real. Then again, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently some of us do. The March issue of Yahoo! Internet
Life takes a look at the tendency to lie online.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a wake of a year that was all about lying, it's easy to
pick up the habit. While the president was being pilloried for his
peccadilloes ... millions of people were practicing the art of
deception every day on the Internet,'' reads the cover story.
</P>
<P>
   But Web users seem to like the lie. The article cites Georgia
Tech's census of Web habits, considered by the magazine the ``most
prestigious general census of Web habits.'' According to the
article, privacy has replaced censorship as the issue most
important to Web users. More than 40 percent of Web users gave
false personal information occasionally, and 10 percent said they
lied at least half the time.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue also ranks America's top wired cities for 1999.
Atlanta placed ninth, behind San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Seattle;
Washington, D.C.; Boston; San Jose, Calif.: San Diego; and
Minneapolis. Atlanta was ahead of Dallas-Fort Worth, Raleigh-Durham
and Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta placed ninth in percentage of adults using the Web at
home and seventh in the number of sites per capita. Atlanta did not
crack the top 10 in two categories: percentage of adults using the
Net at work, which was led by Austin, and Web hosts per capita, led
by San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were compiled with help from Matrix Information
and Directory Services, an Austin firm that tracks Internet usage
</P>
<P>
   E-stickers
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Television Workshop, the people who bring us
``Sesame Street,'' are taking the stick out of stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Its site, http://www.ctw.org
</P>
<P>
   /stickerworld/1,2614,26265,00
</P>
<P>
   .html, features e-stickers, electronic images you can put on
your Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The Sticker World site is part of the Children's Television
Workshop Kid City site, at http://www.kidcity.org. Kid City is an
online site geared to those between the ages of 6 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The site lets kids vote on whether they like television shows,
cartoons, bands and celebrities, and offers running tallies of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sticker World site lets kids build their own Web pages and
decorate them with the e-stickers, electronic images that come in
the form of graphics to interactive games and puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Television Workshop is a nonprofit company that
uses television, the Internet, CD-ROM, print, film and product
licensing to entertain and educate kids.
</P>
<P>
   Online historic preservation
</P>
<P>
   An organization focused on preserving the past has taken a firm
step into the future. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation
has launched a Web site, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .georgiatrust.org.
</P>
<P>
   On the site is a monthly calendar of events and information
about the various preservation funds, as well as conferences and
tours. The site also offers links to properties for sale and
photographs of the trust's house museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia trust, founded in 1973, is the largest statewide
nonprofit preservation group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation operates three
historic houses, sells endangered properties, offers design
assistance to 30 Main Street communities in Georgia, and lobbies
for money and laws to help preservation efforts.

 &HT;    CompuServe2000 enters the present
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was an online service called CompuServe.
It was ugly, clunky and hard to use. Pricing varied across the
service, so a few hours on CompuServe could cost a fortune if you
ventured into certain areas or forums. To top it off, CompuServe
didn't give its users screen names _ it gave them numbers, numbers
randomly assigned and impossible to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Then came America Online, which was easier to use, offered
uniform pricing and allowed users to have names instead of numbers.
To make a long story short, AOL blew CompuServe out of the water
and eventually acquired the company in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   AOL immediately set to work giving CompuServe a makeover
designed to make it more appealing, more sophisticated _ and more
like AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Now called CompuServe2000, the revamped service launched this
week. It's sleek, it's cheap ($9.95 a month for 20 hours) and it's
jam-packed with news from brand-name partners like The New York
Times, CNet, Marketwatch and WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe2000 looks like AOL's bookish older brother. If you
can find your way around AOL, you'll have no trouble with
CompuServe. The familiar AOL menu bar retooled for CompuServe is in
cool green-and-blue tones with slick pull-down menu bars. News
pages are packed with links to national and international articles
from a variety of sources. Members get to select screen names
rather than receive a randomly assigned number.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is a mass market, family-oriented site. CompuServe is more
adult, more business-oriented,'' says CompuServe Chief Operating
Officer Audrey Weil, one of the executives brought over from AOL to
drag CompuServe into the 21st century. ``The CompuServe user
doesn't surf the Web,'' Weil says. ``They want to find information,
get on and get off.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is not the place to be if you just want to send
instant messages to your friends after school or talk about
Leonardo DiCaprio in a chat room. Instead, the talk is more
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place for colleagues to chat with each other,'' Weil
says. The service is aggressively pursuing users with specific
specialities such as physicians, pilots, lawyers, journalists and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weil, CompuServe2000 will not compete with AOL but
will complement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things for AOL Inc. is to have multiple brands
in cyberspace,'' she says. For all its great success _ the one
thing AOL has never been able to do well is attract business users
and the pocket-protector set who have been fans of CompuServe for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe is confident its new look will also attract new
users, who need and want information but don't want to bother with
search engines, URLs, portals, pornography, hackers and other
perceived hazards of the Web. Weil says of the 17 million new users
logging on every year, more than half are adults looking for an
online service that's customized, easy to use and offers high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe is an inexpensive alternative delivered in a format
many users are already familiar with and has content partners that
are already big-name Web players anyway. CompuServe is a kind of
``Web lite,'' offering novice users instant access to information
and community. However, the service does have Web access for users
who do want to venture onto the Web just as AOL does, and
CompuServe's portal, http://www.compuserve.com will also be the
start-up page for MCI WorldCom's new Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe2000 does offer a flat-rate pricing plan for unlimited
use, but Weil says most users _ 80 percent _ prefer to use the
``pay as you go'' plan and only 20 percent have the unlimited usage
plan. ``Twenty hours of use is one hour every business day,'' she
says. And with 2 million professional users as opposed to AOL's 16
million general users, discussions and forums are likely to be more
focused and free of the ``age/sex check'' messages that plague many
AOL discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Film critic) Roger Ebert loves the forums,'' says Weil of one
of CompuServe's celebrity members. ``He says he loves the level of
communication and discussion.''

logging on every year, more than half are adults looking for an
online service that's customized, easy to use and offers high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe is an inexpensive alternative delivered in a format
many users are already familiar with and has content partners that
are already big-name Web players anyway. CompuServe is a kind of
``Web lite,'' offering novice users instant access to information
and community. However, the service does have Web access for users
who do want to venture onto the Web just as AOL does, and
CompuServe's portal, http://www.compuserve.com will also be the
start-up page for MCI WorldCom's new Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe2000 does offer a flat-rate pricing plan for unlimited
use, but Weil says most users _ 80 percent _ prefer to use the
``pay as you go'' plan and only 20 percent have the unlimited usage
plan. ``Twenty hours of use is one hour every business day,'' she
says. And with 2 million professional users as opposed to AOL's 16
million general users, discussions and forums are likely to be more
focused and free of the ``age/sex check'' messages that plague many
AOL discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Film critic) Roger Ebert loves the forums,'' says Weil of one
of CompuServe's celebrity members. ``He says he loves the level of
communication and discussion.''

 &HT;    Silicon Valley managers buck tradition
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes Silicon Valley companies so successful? Writer Karen
Southwick thinks she's figured it out in her new book, ``Silicon
Gold Rush.'' The book, published by Wiley, says tech entrepreneurs
have succeeded by turning traditional management structures upside
down. It profiles 23 companies as examples. Among them are 3Com,
Cisco Systems, Yahoo! and Novell. Southwick says any entrepreneur
can take the lessons of these companies and apply them to an
organization of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be? Microsoft has released a new version of software
that, according to the March issue of Windows magazine, is actually
streamlined. The magazine says Web browser Microsoft Explorer 5.0,
now in a beta version, is ``lighter'' and easier to use. The
article features lots of graphic illustrations of how the latest
version of Explorer is trimmed down. You'll be able to download the
software at http://www.microsoft.com.

   War gamers, take note. Microsoft has released the latest in its
line of real-time war simulations.
</P>
<P>
   This one is called ``The Russian Front'' and features the Nazi
invasion of Russia in World War II. Part of the ``Close Combat''
series, ``The Russian Front'' offers command of units on the
ground.

   You follow every soldier's fortune and can play either the
Germans or the Nazis. Parents beware. The game features graphic
violence.

that end, National Poet Laureate is sponsoring a Web site called
``My Favorite Poem.''

 &HT;    Let software do its job in helping you do yours
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we talked, my computer was beset by the Happy99
virus/worm, which was being passed back and forth on one of my
mailing lists like a cold in a grade school class.
</P>
<P>
   If you just tuned in, and don't spend much time on the Internet,
Happy99 is a relatively benign virus in that it doesn't destroy
anything. It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins
every message you send as an attachment. You, however, are unware
of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Like any virus, it is an executable program, and isn't supposed
to work at all unless you execute it. To the best of my knowledge,
I never did that, but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand
grenade; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of
e-mail, as soon as it was downloaded, it caused the computer to
seize up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I erase it by any normal means; only Norton AntiVirus
was able to get rid of it. And I had to use a painfully slow
Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out.
Eventually, it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch
the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there.
</P>
<P>
   So, going into the Norton configuration program, I changed a
couple of settings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was
ordered to delete the thing on sight. And instead of examining only
.EXE files, it was told to examine everything.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure which of these changes did the trick _ maybe both
were required _ but upon downloading a group of messages which I
knew contained the virus somewhere, everything went fine. No
lockup. Upon examining the messages, the Happy99.exe attachment
brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X.
</P>
<P>
   I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do
something you think it ought to be able to do. It doesn't always
work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many
user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer. It wasn't
presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had
graphics. A quick check showed it was set to refuse graphics to
speed up operations. This, however archaic, was apparently the
default setting.
</P>
<P>
   If incidentally, you have executed the Happy99 virus, it's not
hard to get rid of. There are lots of places on the Web with
instructions, among them http://www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /SiliconValley/Heights/3652
</P>
<P>
   /SKA.HTM.
</P>
<P>
   During all the unHappy furor, I installed the latest upgrade to
Eudora Pro, the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm. I
had been using Version 3.0; the latest is 4.1. It's a very
worthwhile upgrade. The program hasn't changed drastically, but
lots of things work better. The main screen is divided into two
windows now. The top window shows a list of your mail, and merely
by bringing the cursor to any message, the text appears instantly
in the lower window. No more tiresome double-clicking, and the
presentation is much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Eudora now makes the mail available in batches. If
you have 200 messages waiting, it gives them to you 20 or so at a
time so you don't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download
so you can begin reading. I have yet to see a mail program I like
as well.

   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ Journalists struggled to find words to

Media Studies Center in midtown Manhattan, about 70 reporters from
around the country tried to figure out how to better cover what may

many of your finer hand-puppets. Today, however, it does not.
Today, it is a rich baritone. To put it in starkly '70s terms, I

Barry White. (Yehhhh. Can't get enough of your love, bayhbe.) Upper
respiratory infection was never so sweet. (Lane, Daytona Beach

 &HT;    CONSUMER Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: A recent episode of ``Ally McBeal''ncluded a
scene where someone rented a blimp. Wouldn't that be a great way to
send a very special ``I Love You'' to my wife for her birthday? How
much would something like that cost? Is there an enterprise in
Central Texas that would rent out a blimp on an hourly basis?
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert St. John
</P>
<P>
   A: Once again television raises the bar a bit too high.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lockhartof Blimp Photo &AMP; Video Services in Austin comes the
closest to a blimp message. The shape is the same; the message is
back-lit. Lockhart has a minimum price of $600 (plus $125 or so for
every banner). After the deed, the banners are yours. The $600 buys
you as much as six hours of air time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I find out what my father's Social Security number
was? He passed away nine years ago, and I would like to have it in
case I need it when applying for college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carla Helm
</P>
<P>
   A: To initiate a records search for an assigned Social Security
number you must present identifying information: your father's full
name, date and place of birth, and his parents' full names.
``Generally, the information may be disclosed in the case of a
deceased individual,'' says Social Security spokeswoman Sandra
Talbot. For further information call (800) 772-1213.Q: To what
address should I send condolences to the families and friends of
the firefighters who died fighting the church fire in Fort Worth?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Send letters to: River Oaks Volunteer Fire Department, 4900
River Oaks Blvd., River Oaks, Texas 76114. A fund for the families
has been set up at Firefighters' Memorial Fund, c/o NationsBank,
River Oaks Banking Center, 5351 River Oaks Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas
76114-3302.Q: I purchase semisweet chocolate out of state in a
10-pound slab to dip chocolates. Are there shops in Austin to
purchase the slabs?
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Schroeder
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Miss Janette's Cakes &AMP; Supplies (836-4826) to order
10-pound slabs of semisweet, milk or white chocolate. She will have
it in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Many cooks prefer the slabs to the more convenient chips because
family recipes call for them. A tip from Miss Janette's: Real
chocolate must be tempered (handled delicately) to succeed in
dipping.Q: All of the ``mechanical'' parking meters in Austin have
been changed to ``electronic'' meters. The reason for these new
meters is that they are able to accept not only coins but
convenient, prepaid debit cards. Have you ever seen a prepaid card
for sale or tried to find out where to buy one? No one knows what
you're talking about _ including the people I have been passed
around to at the city. What is the great secret?
</P>
<P>
   _S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Parking meter debit cards are sold at one location only _ 701
W. Fifth St. (Public Works entrance _ look hard), Monday to Friday,
8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., in amounts from $5 to $50. Cash or checks _ no
stamps, no credit cards. These debit cards are rechargeable, so do
not toss them when you have used their dollar value. Warning:
Public Works spokeswoman Celeste Cromack says these cards do not
work on meters in the state complex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am an avid fan of jazz musician Oscar Peterson.Can you
locate a source or an address to get an autographed photograph?
</P>
<P>
   _Lowell J. Bethel
</P>
<P>
   A: Peterson is an adjunct music professor in Canada. Write to
him at: York University, McLaughlin, Room 130, 4700 Keele St.,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada M3J 1P3.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several of my friends and I wonder about Ricky Williams'
hair. Who is his hairdresser? Is it real hair? Is it really dyed
orange?
</P>
<P>
   _Virginia W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Believe it or not, the NCAA's all-time leading rusher does
not think about his dreadlock hairstyle nearly as much as fans
apparently do. The slight orange tint? Simple case of sun bleach.
Hairdresser? His mom braids the back when it gets long.
</P>
<P>
   The style does not require a lot of maintenance _ could be why
he likes his signature locks so much.Q: I have a Chatty Cathy doll
of my daughter's that does not chat anymore. Are there any new (or
working old) voice boxes? Or who could restore mine for my daughter
by next Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   _Donna B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most silent Chatty Cathys suffer from a brittle (albeit
original) rubber band or a broken pull string. If your Cathy has a
hexagon-shaped speaker on her chest, craftsman Donald Eliason is
the man for you.
</P>
<P>
   Call him at (360) 403-0260. Eliason can rebuild or replace the
voice box in many Chatty Cathys. There is a $25 minimum (including
a replaced rubber band or string), plus parts and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have information on how to get tickets for the Masters
Practice Rounds or the tournament itself?
</P>
<P>
   _L. Valdez
</P>
<P>
   A: Tickets to the 1999 Practice Rounds are sold out.
Applications for these tickets from Augusta National Golf Club were
due July 15, 1998.Tournament tickets are bought by those on the
patron list, which has been closed since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any federal, state or local agency/law that
obligates the owners or operators of public phones to upgrade, so
that the phones would give back change?
</P>
<P>
   _ A. Medina
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but there might be soon.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 83, relating to change due for payment made to a
public telephone, has been filed and referred to the Committee on
Economic Development. To support this bill sponsored by El Paso's
Norma Chavez, write your state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Currently a public-telephone owner may charge whatever the
market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you find out how many people were murdered in Texas in
1998?
</P>
<P>
   _ I. H.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Department of Public Safety has figures for 1997 (1,328
murders).
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do you go about applying for a hardship driver's license
for someone under 16? How hard does your hardship have to be to
acquire a license?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pretty hard, as in an unusual economic hardship, a
death-related emergency (``I'll kill him unless he drives himself
to practice'' is not what that means), illness or disability in the
family, or enrollment in a vocational, educational program
requiring a license.
</P>
<P>
   A Texan must be at least 15 years old to apply for a hardship
license and have completed an approved driver's education course
(includes the parent-taught one). This is occasionally waived and a
temporary license is issued, which is renewable every 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants must pass the driving exam (written and road). After
completing the basic license application and the minor restricted
application, an applicant interviews with an examiner _ a walk-in,
but wait in line like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that many hardship licenses are issued _ only 8,156 in the
last fiscal year,'' says DPS's Tela Mange. It is the applicant's
responsibility to prove a hardship exists. Bring proof _ a
physician's statement, a letter from a school principal, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter is getting married and I want to give her a
seasoned cast iron skillet. Since my well-seasoned one is more than
30 years old, I don't remember how I seasoned it.
</P>
<P>
   _D.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before Teflon, there were seasoned cast iron skillets. Call
(888) 881-TRAV to order from Lodge Manufacturing Company, maker of
cast iron cookware. Lodge recommends a four-step process.
</P>
<P>
   Wash, rinse and dry the skillet over a low flame to remove all
moisture. Use a paper towel to coat the entire surface of the pan
(inside and out) with vegetable oil (not butter). Bake the skillet
upside-down in a preheated, 350-degree oven for one hour. Place
aluminum foil on the oven floor to catch drips. Cool the skillet
completely in the oven before removing to wipe clean.
</P>
<P>
   When a pan is newly seasoned, avoid acid-rich foods like
tomatoes. It may be necessary to re-season the skillet at some
point. Several cooking gurus recommend a 325-degree oven, but all
agree abrasives are not good for a seasoned cast iron anything.
When storing the skillet, place a paper towel inside to absorb any
excess moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know what the rules are about food handling
in restaurants. Every time I go to a certain McDonald's, I notice
that employees who handle the food don't wear gloves. They put
burgers together and food into boxes with their bare hands. It
seems to me that all food handlers are required to wear gloves. I
couldn't find the Department of Health on the Web, so I defer to
your vast resources!
</P>

   A: Not all food handlers are required to wear gloves because
gloves get dirty, too. Austin/Travis County Health Department
spokesman Dan Pickens notes that gloves sometimes can be
counterproductive because they lull some food handlers into
thinking gloved hands are clean hands.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new food safety code, workers who deal only
with food items (the guy who slaps lettuce on burgers all day long,
for example) do not need to wear gloves. However, those at the end
of the assembly line who wrap or box the food must use gloves,
tongs, utensils or a hand sanitizer. It's the combination of food
and non-food items, which could result in cross-contamination, that
causes concern, Pickens says.
</P>
<P>
   A sink is required in food preparation areas to encourage
frequent hand washing (at least 20 seconds per wash). Restaurant
workers with open sores or cuts must not handle food without
wearing protective gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Call the manager's attention to the problem or report suspected
violations in Austin or Travis County (469-2015).Q: I've been
trying for seven months to get a missing street sign replaced. I
call the city's missing sign number, and the same guy answers
``sign shop.'' I tell him my story, he checks some resource and
then tells me they have no record of my request. Then he says he'll
record it and they'll get right on it.
</P>
<P>
   I've made four of these phone calls since August and nothing
happens. Is there some secret I don't know about getting the city
to respond ?
</P>
<P>
   _P.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: The secret is Kenny Moses, supervisor of the sign shop
(457-4879). He is the man with the master list. Moses says
currently there is a four- to six-week backlog of sign
replacements, although he is aiming to reduce that to one week.
Your request is in his capable hands _ with a bullet. Moses
supervises over 500,000 signs in Austin and annexed areas. Yikes!Q:
We're quite fond of an oven (Whirlpool RVE 455) that we believe
dates to 1952. Recently the door became a bit recalcitrant and
refused to open all the way, which made it difficult to get cookie
sheets and casseroles in and out.
</P>
<P>
   With the best of intentions and a very large hammer, my husband
sprang into action. The oven door now opens all the way but has an
interesting warp that prevents it from closing. I called some
service centers but the model has not been manufactured in decades!
Any ideas where to get the door replaced?
</P>
<P>
   _A.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad you are keeping the husband. Ask him to lose the hammer.
Contact used appliance stores and let them know what you are
looking for. An old Whirlpool might come in and your troubles are
over!

 &HT;    Silicon Valley managers buck tradition
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes Silicon Valley companies so successful? Writer Karen
Southwick thinks she's figured it out in her new book, ``Silicon
Gold Rush.'' The book, published by Wiley, says tech entrepreneurs
have succeeded by turning traditional management structures upside
down. It profiles 23 companies as examples. Among them are 3Com,
Cisco Systems, Yahoo! and Novell. Southwick says any entrepreneur
can take the lessons of these companies and apply them to an
organization of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be? Microsoft has released a new version of software
that, according to the March issue of Windows magazine, is actually
streamlined. The magazine says Web browser Microsoft Explorer 5.0,
now in a beta version, is ``lighter'' and easier to use. The
article features lots of graphic illustrations of how the latest
version of Explorer is trimmed down. You'll be able to download the
software at http://www.microsoft.com.

</P>
<P>
   War gamers, take note. Microsoft has released the latest in its
line of real-time war simulations.
</P>
<P>
   This one is called ``The Russian Front'' and features the Nazi
invasion of Russia in World War II. Part of the ``Close Combat''
series, ``The Russian Front'' offers command of units on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   You follow every soldier's fortune and can play either the
Germans or the Nazis. Parents beware. The game features graphic
violence.

   Valentine's Day is long gone, but you can still hear love poems
recited daily on the Web.

   It's part of a national program to promote a love of poetry. To
that end, National Poet Laureate is sponsoring a Web site called
``My Favorite Poem.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features people reciting poems, especially love poems.
To hear these amateur poets and learn more about how you could

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ A motley of would-be drug policy reformers

shockingly, that we stop simply fighting the war on drugs and start
instead trying actually to win it. (Teepen, Cox News Service).

   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ Journalists struggled to find words to
describe their feelings about covering the great enigma: the year
2000 computer flaw, also known as Y2K. At a seminar Tuesday at the
Media Studies Center in midtown Manhattan, about 70 reporters from
around the country tried to figure out how to better cover what may
turn out to be one of the most significant events in modern history

in his first light bulb, or Don Ameche invented the telephone, the
word ``virtual'' meant that something was almost the same as the
real thing, but not quite. Today, ``virtual'' has become reality
for a lot of solitary kids tapping out life in front of a computer.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I didn't always sound this

days, it wavers into tonalities that have been explored by Mr.
Rogers, Barney Fife, the pizza-delivery boy on ``The Simpsons'' and
many of your finer hand-puppets. Today, however, it does not.
Today, it is a rich baritone. To put it in starkly '70s terms, I
went to sleep sounding like the Bee Gees and woke up sounding like
Barry White. (Yehhhh. Can't get enough of your love, bayhbe.) Upper
respiratory infection was never so sweet. (Lane, Daytona Beach

 &HT;    Computers breathe life into taxes
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the computer age, and your taxes have just been colorized.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the traditional image the act of filling out your
tax forms by hand brings to mind: endless black and white forms.
Liquid Paper for your mistakes. Worries that you won't get a refund
_ you want to be in the black because being in the red is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are opening up a much easier and friendlier way of
doing your taxes, with help available even if you still prefer
working out the forms with your trusty No. 2 pencil and a
calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Tax software and Web sites have become more useful as they've
evolved and, short of hiring an accountant, they're some of the
best resources for up-to-date tax information. And they've become
increasingly user-friendly: even the official IRS Web site has
become a colorful, photo-filled place to find information.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some resources to help make that April 15 deadline seem
a little less precipitous:
</P>
<P>
   Software
</P>
<P>
   Software that does your taxes for you used to be little more
than a fancy calculator. Now, software suites such as TurboTax and
Kiplinger's TaxCut do it all _ you can print tax forms, file
electronically, find current tax code information and look for
hidden deductions, depending on your financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   TurboTax has long been the favorite, but basic versions of both
are available at software stores for less than $20. This year's
version of TurboTax includes an interview feature that asks you
questions about your tax year and then fills out your forms
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   For those with simple returns, such a software package even gets
the seal approval from a local accountant. Ron Lievens, a certified
public accountant, said he recommends software to clients who may
not need specialized help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend it to people all the time,'' Lievens said. ``If
they feel they can do it themselves, I recommend TurboTax.''
</P>
<P>
   More complex versions of TurboTax and TaxCut _ for business
owners or for those who have to file state taxes _ are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, this may also be a good time to start
tracking your finances using your computer. The latest versions of
Quicken and Microsoft Money are good ways to keep track of your
accounts and each program has features for online banking.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS' Web site also has a two-CD software set that includes
current tax forms and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best Web sites I've found for tax information provide
you with information on preparing your taxes as well as links to
other resources that may be more specific if you have additional
questions.
</P>
<P>
   1040.com (www.1040.com) is a basic, no-nonsense site that
features updated news, federal and state tax forms, addresses for
filing and a preparer's database. The site is good for general
information and is handy for quick answers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS' own site (www.irs.gov) has gone through a massive
redesign that has made it easier on the eye and much easier to sort
through. Made to look like a daily newspaper (''The Digital
Daily''), the IRS site contains daily news stories, tax statistics,
filing instructions, tax information for businesses and links.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic filing
</P>
<P>
   The IRS site also has a list of recognized partners it has for
electronic filing. Included are well-known tax preparation
companies like H&AMP;R Block Inc. and Jackson Hewitt as well as
software makers. You can use TaxCut or TurboTax to file
electronically. Filing your return this way costs between $9.99 and
$19.99. However, if your refund is small, you may want to forego
electronic filing, especially if you're not in a hurry to save the
few weeks longer it might take to mail in your return.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current state of the federal tax code, filing your
taxes has never been easier. Just boot up, log on and get yourself
on the road to getting another tax year behind you.

 &HT;    Cut the filthy language from TV, videos
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When people who design electronic devices for a living find out
how TVGuardian works they tend to slap themselves on the forehead
and ask how they missed such an obvious idea, said J. Richard Bray,
TVGuardian's inventor.
</P>
<P>
   TVGuardian, The Foul Language Filter, monitors television
programs and videotapes and mutes the sound when profanity appears
on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Bray said most engineers who asked him about the product assumed
it had some kind of sophisticated sound recognition software
coupled with a system that would delay the sound and picture long
enough for the device to mute the sound before the offensive word
could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, TVGuardian simply reads the closed captions that
accompany most broadcasts and videotape programs. When it
recognizes a word on its banned list, the TVGuardian turns off the
sound for a second or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to overlook the obvious sometimes,'' Bray said.
``It's a problem a lot of people have been trying to deal with, but
nobody made the connection that they might be able to use the
closed captions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bray, 39, of Rogers, Ark., said he studied accounting in college
but discovered soon after graduation that he was more interested in
computers than in doing other people's income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the software business in 1985 and eventually
developed his own software products to be used in real estate
closings. His software did things like preparing deeds, calculating
trust account balances and preparing other documents associated
with the sale of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I was good at, but not something I enjoyed
that much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Bray, who has children 11 and 13 years old, said he
had been frustrated for years by foul language in movies and
television programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be watching a video that had content that was fine for
the family, but we would be surprised by the language that would
pop up,'' he said. ``My wife and I both were taught there were some
things you didn't say, and we tried to pass that value to our kids.
But then we'd rent a video and language we wouldn't let them use
was on there. It was like we were sending a mixed message.''
</P>
<P>
   One day a few years ago after watching another irritating video
while on vacation, Bray said he started thinking about coming up
with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't like the idea of a V-chip, which would block
children from watching an entire program rated for older children
or adults. He wanted a system that would cut out the objectionable
language while letting the child see the rest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bray noticed that closed captions spelled out the profane words
he wanted to keep his children from hearing, and that the caption
flashed on the screen at the same time the words were spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew enough about software that I knew if I could read it, a
computer could read it and react to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Confident that he was onto something, Bray sold the rights to
his real estate software to raise capital and dived into his
language filter venture full time.
</P>
<P>
   Bray started researching the idea on the Internet and was soon
convinced a device that blocked profanity by reading closed
captions was possible. But he didn't have the engineering expertise
or equipment to build the device he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to the Internet looking for companies that could
build a prototype. He also did Internet research and bought some
books on intellectual property rights so he would know how to
protect his rights to profits from his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he had in hand a prototype that did exactly what
he expected it to do _ it monitored closed captions and blocked out
foul language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Bray said. ``I watched movie after movie after
movie just so I could watch it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Today a market version of TVGuardian is available in Blockbuster
video stores in the Southwest and is spreading to other video
stores and Bible stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It also sells for $149.95 by telephone order at (888) 799-4884or
via several Internet retailers. Information is available at
tvguardian.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The market version has two settings: strict and tolerant.
TVGuardian has an internal list of words it looks for in closed
captions, and the list on the tolerant setting pinpoints words
commonly considered profane.
</P>
<P>
   The strict setting catches profanity and other potentially
objectionable utterances such as ``sucks'' or ``butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   The device also is able to use context clues to decide if words
like God or Jesus are being used as expletives rather than as
names.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a profane word is needed to understand the
meaning of what is being said, TVGuardian will flash a less
offensive substitute word of similar meaning through the closed
caption system.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release from the company, TVGuardian was
used on a videotape of the movie Speed and reduced offensive words
from 93 to four. E.T's 13 offensive words were reduced to one.
</P>
<P>
   The release said the device reduces profanity in many movies to
zero while muting less than 60 seconds of an entire PG or PG-13
movie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love it,'' Bray said. ``Movies we wouldn't let them
watch before, like Men in Black, they get to see now. It gives them
more choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bray has a patent pending for TVGuardian, and it's the only
product his company Principle Solutions Inc. markets.
</P>
<P>
   TVGuardian won a ``Best of Show'' award at the International
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really sink in what we had done until we got to the
electronics show and saw the competition,'' Bray said. ``There were
more than 20,000 products on display and only 13 were chosen for
best of show.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 products to win top prizes at the Consumer Electronics
Show, several were made by international corporations like Marantz,
Philips Electronics and RCA's parent company Thomson Consumer
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But just as many were virtually unknown companies such as Terk
Technologies, Axlon Electronics, Replay Networks and Bray's
Principle Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys can pour a lot of money into high-tech projects
like building a better high-definition television,'' Bray said.
``We little guys can't compete in research, but we can compete when
it comes to innovations, new ideas.''

   PARENTS-SEX (San Francisco) _ Even in this era of deadly
sexually transmitted diseases, parents still are so reluctant to
discuss the facts of life with their children that they leave them
wanting more. By DIANA WALSH.
</P>
<P>
   SURF-FORECASTING (San Francisco) _ Surf forecasting has become a
booming business, and some forecasters claim better than 90 percent
accuracy in predicting the big waves. The forecasts are so
reliable, in fact, that when a respected surf- caster forecasts a
big swell for Fiji, Hawaii, Peru or Tahiti, well-heeled
surf-seekers fly there to catch the wave. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-SPILLS (San Francisco) _ California may soon burn oil spills
from wrecked vessels as a way to save wildlife and prevent fouled
beaches. The state expects to adopt a policy by June that would
allow burning instead of trying to mop up tar-like spills that kill
seabirds and marine mammals and spoil the fragile coast. By JANE
KAY.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GOP (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Despite calls to take a more
moderate path, state Republicans ended their convention here by
electing the most conservative anti-abortion candidates to lead
them and hosting a keynote speaker who said, ``Killing children is
the essential issue facing our nation today.'' By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-HOMETOWN (Park Ridge, Ill.) _ Voters in this
conservative, affluent suburb of brick homes and tree-lined streets
on the outskirts of northwest Chicago didn't vote for President
Clinton in 1992 or 1996. They did, however, vote for Rep. Henry
Hyde, the chief prosecutor in the impeachment trial. But Park
Ridge, it seems, is very much Hillary Rodham Clinton country. It's
where she grew up, and, should she choose to run for the U.S.
Senate in New York, many residents would put aside politics and
wish her well. By PHIL BROWN.
</P>
<P>
   MATH-CONTEST (San Francisco) _ They looked like typical middle
school kids _ baggy jeans, mouths full of metal and impossible to
quiet down in the cafeteria. No pocket protectors or taped-up
glasses. But watch out if you sit them down in front of a math
problem. By JULIE CHAO.

<P>
   MEXICO-BUTTERFLIES (Angangueo, Mexico) _ Peasant farmer
Francisco Ambrocia Martinez appears a little uncomfortable with his
new role as environmentalist. ``We've made the decision to protect
this place, so that it will still be here for our children,'' he
says. Ambrocia is standing in what is perhaps one of the most
unique places on Earth _ the winter home of Monarch butterflies. By
MICHAEL RILEY. (Photo available on NYT database.)

<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TELEWORK (San Francisco) _ Telecommuting has become an
acceptable mode of work for millions of Americans. Since its
inception in the 1970s, many employees have found working from home
a flexible alternative to traveling to an office. At the same time,
more companies are beginning to allow regular telecommuting, hoping
to boost employee productivity and morale. By WENDY TANAKA.
</P>
<P>
   HIRED-GUN (Houston) _ Got an ex-wife demanding a little extra
cash in the child support payments this month? If a contract
killing is the only way out, then Gary F. Johnson might be the
right person to contact. But there's a catch _ Johnson is a senior
investigator for the Harris County, Texas, District Attorney's
office who specializes in the undercover art of posing as a hit
man. By STEVE BREWER.
</P>
<P>
   BIRD-NAME (Houston) _ Almost three years after a Texas
naturalist discovered it in Brazil's Amazonian rain forest, the
colorful little bird with the big voice still lacks a name. Soon
that is expected to change. On Friday the Texas Audubon Society
will mark its 100th anniversary by auctioning off rights to name
the new-found antshrike. Bidding starts at $200,000. By ALLAN
TURNER.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBARIUM (San Francisco) _ His business card says Caretaker &AMP;
Historian, but he's more than that. Much more. ``I'm the painter,
the gardener, the maintenance man, the inurment man,'' said Emmitt
Watson. Inurnment? ``I put the ashes in the urns,'' he explained.
Some would say Watson is the San Francisco Columbarium, the
101-year-old building that is home to the ashes of about 30,000
people. By JULIE CHAO.

<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GAY-HOTEL (Galveston, Texas) _ The first hotel catering solely
to gay and lesbian visitors in this tourist city is scheduled to
open in the spring. The 21-room inn is called Hollywood at
Galveston, and each room will recall legends of entertainment such
as Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, owners
Sherman Houck and Bob Wilkins say. By KEVIN MORAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The signs told the story. In
the lobby of the convention center where Republicans gave standing
ovations to a strident anti-abortion speech by Sen. Bob Smith of
New Hampshire, a sign outside the restrooms said: ``Women to left,
men to right.'' The majority of American women probably will be
heading leftward in the 2000 election, given the fact that all the
Republican presidential hopefuls oppose women's right to abortion.
By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Two supporters of Sen. Charles E.
Schumer of New York got hassled by police officers while they were
trying to get the new senator to autograph some campaign posters.
That's not surprising. There are a lot of people in upstate New
York who are none too happy with Schumer's supporter of the Brady
Bill. By DAN LYNCH.

KIDNAPPERS FREE CHECK-CASHING WORKER FOR $40,000 IN RANSOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An employee of a check-cashing store in Brooklyn was
kidnapped on Friday evening and held overnight until her husband,
who works at another check-cashing store, paid a $40,000 ransom to
her abductors, the police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old woman, whose name was withheld by the police
because her abductors remained at large, was kidnapped at 5:45 p.m.
Friday as she left work at a check-cashing store, said Detective
Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police gave this account of the kinapping: The woman was pulled
from her car by two men and taken to another car where a driver was
waiting. The three men drove off with the woman and then called her
husband to say that they had kidnapped his wife and children. In
fact, the couple's children were safe with a relative who regularly
picks them up from school.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers arranged a rendezvous, ordering the husband to
meet them at a White Castle hamburger restaurant. The kidnappers
met him there and forced him to take them to the check-cashing
store where he works. Once there, they forced the husband to give
them $40,000 in cash from the till. It was not clear Sunday whether
the store was open for business when the kidnappers and the husband
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers then told the husband to return to the White
Castle to wait for his wife and children. But the woman was
released unharmed at an intersection in Cypress Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The check-cashing stores that the husband and wife work for are
among eight in Brooklyn owned by Avilda Associates, a
Brooklyn-based company, according to state banking records. No one
at Avilda Associates could be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, and the investigation is continuing,
the police said.

SCHUMER FANS STAY LOYAL DESPITE POLICE ROUGHHOUSING

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The phone rang. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, senator,'' I said. ``How is everything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is good,'' he said. ``I'm in Newburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad. You have my sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no. Newburgh is nice. Anyway, here's why I called: I
read your column ... I just wanted to let you know that I spoke to
Bubbles this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Schumer told me that it had all been a mistake _
that he hadn't known a thing about the shameful treatment accorded
my friend Bubbles and his bride, Mrs. Bubbles, when they'd gone to
see Schumer during one of his swings through upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   I'd told the story in a recent column. The Bubbleses were big
Schumer backers in last November's election _ about the only ones
in a tiny village called Burdett, a few hundred miles west of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Burdett is a bend in the road in Schuyler County. Saying that
the place tilts Republican is like saying that Mike Tyson is moody.
When Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in office in the midst of World
War II, one Burdett resident went roaring up and down the main
street blasting his car horn in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   When that guy died, somebody pulled a car into his driveway and
blasted the horn. Bubbles didn't live there then. If he had, he
would have been everybody's prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles and Mrs. Bubbles operate a fine gourmet food business
that involves weekend trips to New York City to sell their
mustards, jams and other good stuff at the Union Square Green
Market in Manhattan and at the market at Grand Army Plaza in
Brooklyn. They'd met the senator at the Brooklyn market back when
he was a congressman, before he'd knocked off Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles had taken an intense interest in that race. He'd gone to
Syracuse University with D'Amato. His dislike for D'Amato dates
back to when Jack Paar was the biggest thing on television. So
Bubbles and Mrs. Bubbles had transported Schumer posters from New
York City to Burdett, displayed them prominently and, generally,
done whatever they could to promote Schumer's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, basking in victory's glow, they'd gone to Elmira
to see the new senator. They'd wanted his autograph on a few of
their posters and, incidentally, to give the senator a jar of Mrs.
Bubbles' really out-of-sight Ebbets Field mustard. But after they'd
approached the senator as he toured downtown Elmira, the local cops
had chased the Bubbleses out of town _ and rather rudely, too.
Schumer told me when he called that he hadn't had a clue that had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubbles came up to me,'' Schumer said, ``and he had all these
posters. He said to me, `I'd like you to sign some posters.' I
said, `Sure, I'd love to.' And, immediately, these police officers
came over and said, `No, no, no, we've got to do that later.' I was
being followed around by them. So, I said, `Fine.' And then I had
no idea that they kept him away from me the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his phone call to Bubbles, Schumer made arrangements to sign
the posters. He feels terrible that Bubbles got such grief from the
cops. Bubbles, on the other hand, feels pretty good after the
senator's phone call. He always knew that Schumer was a good guy,
and Bubbles did take the occasion to offer Schumer some sage,
detailed advice on a wide variety of public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbles isn't even that mad at the Elmira cops any more. After
all, he told me, upstate New York contains a good many people who
might strike cops as a bit suspicious when they're guarding a U.S.
senator who backed the Brady Bill. Bubbles fully understands that.
</P>
<P>
   Those are his neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler
who campaigned as the only man capable of holding together this
vibrant and fractious country, on Sunday scored an overwhelming
victory to become the first elected president here in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, Olu Falae, a former finance minister,
immediately disputed the fairness of the vote, held on Saturday
after years of promises by military dictators to move Nigeria, the
most populous country in Africa, toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Sunday night, however, whether Falae would
formally contest the results, particularly since they showed him
trailing by almost 7 million votes, with the margin widening in
Obasanjo's favor as more returns came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if General Obasanjo won a free and fair election I
would congratulate him but clearly this is not a free and fair
election,'' Falae told journalists before leaving for the capital,
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Obasanjo would cap a tumultuous period in the
history of Nigeria, ruled until last June by a callous dictatorship
that had turned the country, the world's sixth-largest oil producer
and the biggest military power in West Africa, into an
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be the culmination of an extraordinary personal
journey for Obasanjo, who was released from prison just eight
months ago after serving three years for criticizing the military
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, an anxious nation waited for officials to formally
declare the winner of the election that many hoped would fulfill
the promise of a nation whose seemingly boundless potential has
been squandered by years of misrule.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo had yet to make any public statement, apparently
waiting for election authorities to give him the official nod on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before that announcement, reaction to the results was muted in a
nation that has often seen its democratic aspirations thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors, led by former President Jimmy
Carter, said they had witnessed fraud by both sides and other
irregularities, but probably not enough to have swayed the outcome,
which was substantially in Obasanjo's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Official results on Sunday night showed that the retired general
had garnered 62 percent of the votes, compared to 38 percent for
his opponent, from 33 out of 36 states, plus the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials are scheduled to announce final results on
Monday when they will also formally declare the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who led a team of American election monitors, praised
the current military government's commitment to the transition to
civilian rule and the conduct of officials at the Independent
National Election Commission, which oversaw the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute said in
a report on the elections that there was ``no evidence indicating
that electoral abuses would have affected the overall outcome of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a pattern of nationwide fraud or
irregularities,'' Carter said in an interview. But he said that
monitors had observed fraud and irregularities in a number of
states, including ballot-boxes that were stuffed, vote tallies that
were inflated and results that were manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Nwankwo, chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of Nigerian organizations that dispatched
thousands of observers on Saturday, said that Obasanjo would have
to win over the public, because the irregularities had been serious
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner must immediately embark on popular measures to deal
with the severe economic problems of this country and build popular
support for himself,'' Nwankwo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Falae contests the results, he will have to appeal his case
to a tribunal, which can decide to hold elections again in certain
areas or throughout the country. The new president is scheduled to
take over on May 29.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most significant for Obasanjo might be the effect of a challenge
by Falae on people in the south. According to the results released
Sunday night, he performed according to expectations by winning
most of the north. But Falae won the southwest, which is dominated
by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria,
along with the Ibo in the southeast and the Hausa-Fulani in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are Yoruba. But because of Obasanjo's close ties to the
North, many of his fellow Yoruba distrust him and consider him a
candidate imposed by the northern-dominated military.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba have been angry especially since one of their own,
Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman, had his apparent
victory in the 1993 presidential elections annulled by a northern
general. That led to five years of brutal dictatorship under
Abacha, which ended only with his sudden death last June. After
Abiola also died unexpectedly a month later, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the current president, announced a timetable for
elections and handover to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Falae was the candidate of the Alliance for Democracy, which is
essentially a Yoruba party with little reach outside the southwest.
The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, joined
forces with the Alliance for Democracy and presented Falae as their
common candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong campaign period, Falae attacked Obasanjo as a
soldier in civilian disguise and described an Obasanjo presidency
as a continuation of military rule. The theme resonated among many
Nigerians weary of the military, which has ruled Nigeria for all
but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960. But Falae was
unable to spread his message because of poor organization and the
shakiness of the alliance that backed him.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo tried to use his military past to his
advantage by arguing that he was the only one close enough to
military officers to prevent them from snatching back power, as
they have done in the past. He would serve as a bridge, his
campaign argued, to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
   His party, the People's Democratic Party, enjoyed the most money
and the backing of the retired military elite. The party dominated
in elections since December for local and statewide government
seats, as well as the national assembly.

THE GRAND OLD DYSFUNCTIONAL PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The signs told the story. In the lobby of
the convention center where Republicans gave standing ovations to a
strident anti-abortion speech by Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a
sign outside the restrooms said: ``Women to left, men to right.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of American women probably will be heading leftward
in the 2000 election, given the fact that all the Republican
presidential hopefuls oppose women's right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Past the restroom signs was a large room devoted to the oddities
of last weekend's California Republican Party convention. There
were booths where you could buy Clinton pinatas, bumper stickers
like ``Lorena Bobbitt for White House intern'' and matchboxes
containing tiny berets, cigars and blue dresses. There also were
women like Beth Rogers of the Seneca Network who try to give money
and visibility to Republican women candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Seneca, N.Y., is where the women's suffrage movement got its
start in 1848 and, said Rogers, ``Our motto is that women's
suffrage is not complete when women get the vote, but when they are
at the policy table.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd like to have some say in the abortion debate within the
Republican Party, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The Seneca Network booth was right behind the fellow with the
Clinton pinata, a guy who still believes Vince Foster was murdered.
It was as if activist Republican women had been marginalized with
the wackos.
</P>
<P>
   Another booth had materials by a group called Republicans for
Choice, but when I visited it, no one was there.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of hard times for Republicans, signs that
they are behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   This was a party divided by a lot of talk about unity. Two lapel
stickers distinguished moderates from conservatives: ``It's the
women, stupid'' and ``I'm conservative. Is your tent big enough for
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Both were really pathetic, each in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans should have discovered women were important
decades ago, and realized that a pro-life position would never get
them more than a third of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   When conservative Republicans sardonically use the ``big tent''
metaphor of inclusion, asking if it's big enough for the
traditional rulers of the party, it sounds like a whiny version of
``My way or the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   It is their way or the highway when it comes to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   You can't make it in the party unless you swear you're pro-life,
and you'd better mean it because a lot of fanatics will be checking
up to see if you're a secret baby killer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidates for president run the gamut from N to
O on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona says he's personally pro-life, but
thinks there's room in the party for those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher, seems to have found
religion on the issue, calling for a ``national dialogue'' on
abortion, and making it a bigger part of his spiel than last time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer says that ``mere words aren't
enough,'' and if a Republican is elected president, he or she
should actually work to make abortion illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want presidents of the United States dabbling in
uterine politics? The Grand Old Party would do better to
concentrate on starting a national dialogue on traditional
Republican issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move on to educational issues and tax issues,''
said Julie Schaefer, a member of a conservative group called Soccer
Moms with a Brain. ``They've got to lighten up and liven up.''
</P>
<P>
   John McGraw, a pro-lifer, beat moderate Nicholas Bavaro in the
election for head of the state party. Bavaro was ecstatic to get 40
percent of the vote, though, and took this as a sign of hope that
Republicans could sit down and talk about beating Democrats instead
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an amiable personality, and want to get out the message
that happy days are here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is amiable, and there are many good people in the
Republican Party on both sides of the abortion battle. But how can
I say this? A very un-Reaganesque bitterness and meanness kept
bubbling to the surface at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, a flier was found under delegates' hotel
doors, attacking Brooks Firestone, the moderate tire fortune heir
and winery owner who ran for vice chairman of the party. The flier
showed an old woman walking toward a bunch of grapes and said:
``Firestone's Hispanic Outreach: Pick My Grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic delegates were outraged. Tim Sanchez, an Oakland
delegate who is president of the Republican National Hispanic
Assembly, said: ``The tent of this party is large, but the tent is
not big enough for the bigots who put out this kind of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   The souvenir vendors hawked all too many T-shirts, hats and
bumper stickers with ugly slogans about Bill and Hillary Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky. One delegate foamed at the mouth about
Democratic rapists, and when a Republican woman tried to calm him
down he brusquely dismissed her.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of dissing going on in the Republican Party. Make
that ``dyssing,'' for dysfunctional.

 KARACHI: ... Mother Teresa.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I see a contradiction in many ways. She was educated in modern
ways, but has a typically feudal outlook and autocratic behavior,''
said Abid Hasan Minto, president of Pakistan's Supreme Court Bar
Association. ``She thinks all organizations are outfits for the
purpose of keeping her in power. . . . Although she is a product of
the struggle against martial law, she has not learned democratic
ways at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So who has remained loyal to Bhutto? Hard-core party workers or
``jiyalas'' _ the ``shirtless masses'' _ form the backbone of her
party. Her members of parliament, reduced to a small minority in
both houses, represent liberal voices and some of the country's
brighter intellects. But even some loyalists concede they stay not
because they think she is clean, but because the alternative _ the
ruling party _ is both corrupt and reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of her star appeal pales next to her stature in
1986, when millions lined the roads to welcome her from exile in
the biggest outpouring in Pakistan's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to idolize her, and now I feel so stupid,'' said Amir
Mateen, former chief reporter of The Nation newspaper. ``We were so
forgiving. She was given a second chance. There was so much hope.
But in a matter of months, she was back to the same things, even
worse. She didn't learn any lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bhutto era, he said, was ``a great betrayal of her promise.
Intellectual betrayal is a luxury. But think of all the physical
betrayal: people who went to jail, were lashed, thousands who died
in the struggle against dictatorship. And for what?''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps her most idealistic supporters who feel most
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her biggest failure is that she never really conceptualized
what she could do for this country,'' said one disaffected adviser.
``She stood for modernism, liberal Islam, democracy, social
welfare, care for the poor and dispossessed. But there's no major
policy success of either of her administrations. I'm not even
talking about corruption. I'm talking about bad governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto was once the darling of liberal governments the world
over. Now her image is also sullied among the diplomatic corps in
the capital city of Islamabad. ``It's hard to understand her hold
on the party when she seems like tainted goods,'' said one senior
Western diplomat. ``Even if you ignore the charges against her,
look at her record. Promising talk, but little delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   But liberals here have nowhere else to go. Asma Jehangir,
chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, criticized
Bhutto when she was prime minister for arresting Sharif's relatives
and allowing extrajudicial killings in the crime-ridden city of
Karachi. ``By no means is she ideal,'' Jehangir admitted. But
``without a doubt I can say Benazir Bhutto is better for this
country (than Sharif) as far as respect for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jehangir recounts tales of a compassionate Bhutto who took
interest in domestic violence victims, banned whipping of women,
and supported the crusade against bonded labor.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, Bhutto is the most important symbol for women in
this male-dominated society. At a recent legislative conference,
ruling party Cabinet minister Goyar Ayub Khan stood next to Bhutto
and spoke condescendingly of a tendency to elect widows and
daughters of martyred leaders out of ``sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear what he said?'' Bhutto fumed afterward on her way
to a rally for press freedom. ``I'm a woman leader who broke male
taboos. There's a lot of male rage against me and my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, she smiled sweetly and waved as crowds chanted,
``Benazir is our prime minister! We want Benazir!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inshallah, by God's grace, we shall win!'' an admirer shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inshallah,'' she replied with a Mona Lisa smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto contends that the case against her is politically
motivated, and it is true that Pakistan has a history of
governments persecuting their political opponents. But her
supporters concede that she did the same to her rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto says that documents alleging that she profited by fixing
contracts for customs inspection, tractors, gold, and submarines
are ``fabricated, forged, or taken out of context.'' Ali Sibtain
Fazli, chief prosecutor of three cases, scoffs at such talk. ``That
would mean the Swiss government was involved in forgery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers say they have been kidnapped, arrested, and
harassed. Some defense documents, they say, have been stolen. Cases
have been lodged against her mother, father-in-law, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, political secretary, hairdresser, even the man who
serves her tea.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto accuses not only Sharif, but Saifur Rehman, the senator
running the government's Accountability Bureau, of tax evasion,
loan defaulting, and graft, and there is plenty of evidence to
support those claims.
</P>
<P>
   Even if her trials are politically motivated, Azmat Saeed,
another prosecutor, says, ``That doesn't mean a crime hasn't been
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances have changed since the charges were filed in 1997.
Despite piles of evidence, the government has had problems proving
the source of many of her supposed assets. And it has not been able
to convict her.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Zahid Hussain, senior editor of Newsline magazine,
``Domestic political developments in the last year and a half have
worked in her favor. She's no longer totally isolated. It doesn't
mean people have started liking her. They are disappointed with
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Pakistanis blame themselves for the system that fostered
the Bhutto disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem in Pakistan is the elite, and I am a member
of that class,'' said Ahmed Kapadia, director of Evernew Studios, a
leading film agency. ``They control everything, and in their
short-term thinking, they believe if they disturb the status quo,
they will lose. They don't know that eventually, it will change and
they will be destroyed.''

BUCHANAN, BACK IN N.H., FACES A TOUGH THIRD RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N. H. _ This old mill town is ground zero for
Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican who trounced Bob Dole in 1996
and embarrassed former President George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Buchanan's ``peasants with pitchforks'' massed
on the hill, and here that Buchanan declared that the establishment
in Washington ``is shaking in its boots.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be trouble ahead this time. When Buchanan returns
Tuesday to announce his third run for the presidency, he will see
that many of his key lieutenants have decamped to Steve Forbes, Dan
Quayle, and Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   And with so many conservatives running for the nomination in
2000, Buchanan cannot be sure whether there are enough ``peasants''
to propel him to victory, or if the crowded field will splinter his
winning coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem for Buchanan is economic prosperity,''
said John J. Pitney, a political scientist at California's
Claremont McKenna College who closely observes conservatives.
``Most of the peasants with pitchforks are sipping cappuccinos at
Starbucks. Things are going pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's message in 1992 and in 1996 was hot and inciteful,
directed at foreign trade, the export of jobs, and general economic
distress. His message struck a chord in New Hampshire, with the
state's struggling economy and the residents' penchant for a strong
conservative message. Today, however, the national unemployment
rate is 4.3 percent, and the New England rate is even lower, at 3.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Krueger, a state senator who represents this
working-class and increasingly conservative city, was a delegate to
the Republican convention in 1996 for Buchanan, and voted for him
in 1992, too. But this time around, her support is not guaranteed.
She says she wants a candidate who will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if his time has come and gone,'' Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate this time because there are a whole lot of
conservative candidates out there,'' she said. ``One thing I'm
certain of, I'm definitely backing a winner this time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear whether Buchanan, a television commentator
and columnist, will receive the continued support of the Manchester
Union-Leader, a newspaper with a powerfully conservative voice. In
1996, Buchanan's strength came in the areas where the Union-Leader
has the widest circulation.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 of Manchester's 12 wards, Buchanan beat Dole by margins of
2 to 1 and 3 to 1. Similarly, Buchanan overwhelmed Dole in the
surrounding towns of Hooksett, Goffstown, Londonderry, Auburn, and
Candia.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, many political observers say the newspaper
seems to be leaning toward Quayle, the former vice president. And
Quayle is gunning for Buchanan voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them agree with Dan Quayle's message, particularly on
strengthening the family and middle class values, and I think we're
experiencing quite a bit of success in those areas,'' said Jonathan
Baron, Quayle's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, of course, is not the only candidate appealing to voters
who were once with Buchanan. Forbes has spent the last couple of
years blending his economic message with socially conservative
themes to attract Buchanan's followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would like them, everyone would like every vote,''
said Paul Young, an adviser to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The other campaigns have also been scooping up Buchanan's former
advisers, hoping they might bring along a little of the magic that
propelled Buchanan's candidacy. Peter Robbio, Buchanan's New
Hampshire executive director, is working for Forbes. So is Greg
Mueller, who served as Buchanan's communications director. Connie
Mackey, a Buchanan strategist, has gone to work for Bauer. Ovide
Lamontagne, the former candidate for governor, is chairing Quayle's
campaign in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scattering of staff and volunteers, Buchanan's
success has been attributed to a force of personality, rather than
the product of a highly efficient campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Uscinski, the chairman of New Hampshire's Christian
Coalition and a past Buchanan delegate, said Buchanan will have to
return with a message that can overcome similar conservative
messages from his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the social conservatives who are running _
George W. Bush, Gary Bauer, Bob Smith, Steve Forbes _ it's going to
take a lot of discernment among conservative people of faith as to
who they're going to go with,'' said Uscinski.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan could not be reached for comment. But a call to his
toll-free hotline finds that he is sticking to many of the issues
he ran on the last two times: opposition to abortion, keeping
American jobs on US soil, and restoring the manufacturing base.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duprey, New Hampshire's Republican chairman, said he hears
Buchanan voters scrutinizing his candidacy more critically than
they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are asking, `Do I like what this candidate stands for
and do I think he or she can win?' '' Duprey said. ``I hear a lot
of Buchanan supporters say, `I love Pat, but he leaves New
Hampshire and then folds.' ''

A NEW SPIN ON AIR PASSENGERS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Year weekend's snafu at Detroit Metropolitan Airport has
spawned more than horror stories about passengers imprisoned for
hours on snowbound Northwest Airlines jets, unable to take off and
unable to return to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   It has given rise to a seeming stampede of politicians trying to
enact legislation ensuring that passengers on commercial airlines
will be treated with a modicum of respect. And that political
frenzy has caused considerable angst in airline boardrooms, and in
lobbyists' offices in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would put this in as a shot across their bow and
it may go nowhere,'' says US Representative Bud Shuster, a
Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure and the author of the so-called
``Airline Passenger Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, boy, we struck a raw nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   While high-ranking federal aviation officials say privately that
the so-called passenger rights movement smacks of demagoguery, and
airline officials say it offers simplistic _ and expensive _ fixes
to a very complex system, it has resonated with the millions of
Americans who have had, at one time or another, a less than
pleasant experience dealing with airlines.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, never have so many Americans been angry at the
airlines; consumer complaints rose 25 percent last year. Of course,
never have so many passengers been flying. Last year, some 608
million people flew, up from 275 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to how consumers are treated, ``There are
practices tolerated in the airline industry that are not tolerated
in any other American industry, and that is quite odd because this
is supposed to be a service industry,'' says Paul Dempsey, a
professor of law and director of the Transportation Law Program at
the University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   At least three bills _ two of which are already slated for a
hearing next month _ have been introduced; the Senate version is
sponsored by US Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, and John
McCain, an Arizona Republican, who is the powerful chairman of the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. There is
Schuster's bill, and a second House bill, sponsored by US
Representative John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is a ranking
member of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While they vary somewhat, the three bills would give consumers
protection against common problems ranging from getting bumped from
oversold flights to having baggage lost for days. The two House
bills would impose penalties on airlines for flights delayed more
than two hours, raising concerns that some safety issues may be
overlooked in order to avoid a hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bills would legislate some ticket pricing by
permitting the use of splitting two round-trip tickets that include
a Saturday night, to avoid paying higher midweek fares. They would
also provide better information about airline frequent-flier seat
availability (something airlines tend to consider proprietary) and
about why planes are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that hearings are scheduled on the bills suggests that
``this is not some frivolous thing,'' says former US senator Alan
Simpson, director of Harvard's Institute of Politics at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw they could put together a Taxpayers Bill of Rights
with the IRS, and this may take a while _ nothing may happen this
session _ but there is enough real stuff out there to create honest
interest in this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of celebrating just completing a year in which there
was not a single fatality on a commercial airline, the industry is
sweating over a looming battle that many believe will lead to
higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   While the Air Transport Association, the trade group
representing the major airlines, has yet to take a position on the
bills, spokesman David Fuscus says, ``I don't think you really want
the government in customer service, and pricing is probably not a
good place for them to be in. Tickets are 36 percent less expensive
than they were 20 years ago,'' he says. (The industry was
deregulated in 1978).
</P>
<P>
   And at least one major passenger group agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicans are trying to attack indirectly what they
should attack directly _ the lack of competition and the
alternatives for passengers,'' says David Stempler, president of
the Washington-based Air Travelers Association. ``Secondly, we are
fearful that when the heavy hand of government comes in, we, as
passengers, will end up paying for it at the end of the day. The
law enacted most frequently in this town is the law of unintended
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Stempler says much of the hostility directed at the airline
industry these days stems from airplanes being more crowded. The
days of having the middle seat empty and a lunch or dinner served
on a flight to Chicago seem like a pleasant memory.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Dempsey, unlike other purchases, buying an airline
ticket does not give someone the opportunity to inspect the product
before purchasing it. ``You don't know until the plane leaves, if
it will depart on time; you don't know if it will be clean, if the
food will be edible, whether the flight attendants will be surly,
or if you will be seated in the middle between two obese human
beings in palm tree T-shirts and poor hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stempler notes that ``airlines are not immune from the
environment that we are all generally experiencing in the '90s _
the pressure and tension of time. Everyone is under pressure, that
is why there is so much road rage, and then you have this crowding
of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only time I can remember as much discontent was in the
days of air traffic control when planes were circling over cities
waiting to land. We resolved that with flow control, and hopefully,
the marketplace will solve some of the current problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FAA, nor the Department of Transportation, which
have oversight over the airline industry, have taken positions on
the proposed legislation. The department tracks passenger
complaints regarding airlines on everything from problems with the
flight to smoking. And although complaints in 1998 were up 25
percent over 1997 _ a fact politicians like Shuster use to bolster
their arguments _ the number of passengers who file complaints is
still relatively small. Of the 608 million passengers who flew last
year, 9,606 of them took the time to file formal complaints with
the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bills are just not well thought out,'' says Darryl
Jenkins, executive director of the Aviation Institute at George
Washington University and a professor of airline management. He
says he's never seen a time when so many people are angry at the
airlines, and ``the airlines need to do something, but these bills
are not a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says all the bills indicate a lack of understanding of
the complexity of the airline industry as well as the flexibility
it requires. Something as seemingly innocuous as the requirement to
announce to would-be passengers that a flight is oversold is
fraught with difficulty. Most flights are not oversold until the
day before the flight. Sophisticated computer programs record the
flight history and can predict quite well how much a flight can be
technically oversold _ but still, on the day of travel, have enough
room for everyone, because some people don't show up at the gate.
Such practices help keep prices down, by helping ensuring that all
seats are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, says Jenkins, if a flight crew going to Asia
realizes on the day of its departure that a storm in the Pacific
will increase the amount of head winds the flight will encounter, a
plane that is not technically oversold, but simply full, becomes
oversold because it will have to use more fuel and weigh less to
arrive safely.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the causes of delays seems to be a good idea, Jenkins
says, because about 65 percent of all delays are caused by the
antiquated air traffic control system. ``If they inform passengers
accurately and truthfully about delays, the pilot will say, `This
delay is brought to you by the US Government,' maybe then Congress
will finally update the air traffic control system.''
</P>
<P>
   But fining airlines for delays raises troubling safety concerns,
according to aviation specialists. Take the case of a flight that
has gone through de-icing, and then has to wait 30 minutes before
it can take off. By that time, the pilot might well think it is
prudent to pull out of the takeoff queue and get de-iced again. But
if the airline has to pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines to
passengers because of the delay that causes, will the crew gamble
with the flight's safety?
</P>
<P>
   ``We never argue about the blacks and whites of safety,'' says
Stempler. ``It is the gray area in the middle that you have to
worry about. And you can't legislate against stupidity or bad
decisions, and that is really what happened in Detroit. They made
bad decisions.''

STUDY SAYS WORKING MOTHERS DON'T CAUSE CHILDREN HARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mothers who work outside of the home during the first three
years of their children's lives do not harm their youngsters'
behavior, mental development, or self-esteem, suggests a new study
involving thousands of families followed for years.
</P>
<P>
   And the two small negative effects that the study found in some
3- and 4-year-olds whose mothers went to work _ a tendency not to
comply immediately with instructions, and slightly lower
achievement test scores _ disappeared by the time they turned 5 or
6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working mothers have a lot of guilt. I hope this study will
alleviate some of that guilt,'' said Elizabeth Harvey, assistant
professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst and author of the study in the current Developmental
Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first to look at this often-controversial issue
with as many families over as long a period of time, until some of
the children reached age 12.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey compared the children of women who worked outside the
home within the first three years of giving birth, to those whose
mothers did not go to work until after three years, if at all. She
also looked at whether fathers' employment status and working hours
have a negative effect on children, and found no significant
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have found conflicting results about children
whose mothers work outside the home, and this one certainly won't
be the last word. ``This study alone doesn't solve it,''
acknowledged Harvey, who was at the University of Connecticut when
she conducted the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While the study's follow-up and its sheer size _ more than
12,000 people _ are among its strengths, its limitations include
the fact that it is based on a long-term national survey and not on
in-depth, face-to-face interviews, and that it does not take into
account the quality of child care.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of child care, whether provided by parents,
grandparents, or outside day-care providers, is considered a
significant factor in children's development. Harvey's study could
not assess variations in childen's development based on the quality
of care because it was based on surveys, not in-depth visits.
</P>
<P>
   An ongoing National Institute of Child Health and Development
study, which assesses child care and uses in-depth interviews, has
also found no measurable difference between children whose mothers
work outside or stay at home _ as long as the quality of child care
is good, whether provided by an outside day-care center or the
mother herself _ said Kathleen McCartney, a University of New
Hampshire professor and director of the UNH Child Study and
Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more research we have on the hours of employment, the more
we're finding no effects,'' said McCartney, who along with Nancy
Marshall of Wellesley College is following about 130 children in
Greater Boston as part of the NICHD study.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the NICHD study, and author of some of
the earlier research finding that a mother's absence from the home
has negative effects on children, reserved judgment, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Belsky, professor of human development at Pennsylvania State
University, said that even though Harvey's study found that the two
minor negative effects disappeared by age 5 or 6, and didn't
reappear by age 12, ``Does that mean they won't ever be evident
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Belsky said, the study sounds ``exceedingly
meritorious.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over mothers who go to work and place their
children in day care or with other caregivers seems almost as
American as motherhood and apple pie. A 1997 Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey showed that 64.8 percent of mothers with children
6 years old or younger worked outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have a profound ambivalence about child care in
our culture,'' said UNH's McCartney, while in places like western
Europe day care is more accepted and the main question is over how
society can make it better.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said the findings support either child-rearing decision.
``I think the take-home message is that there's no one right way to
do it. Being employed during the early years (of a child's life)
and being at home during the early years can both be good choices
and can lead to healthy development for children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions of Boston-area mothers to the study reflect the
range of opinions. For three mothers who work outside the home and
leave their children at Bright Horizons Family Solutions Child Care
Center in Quincy, the study supports what they already feel is the
right decision for them and their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news,'' said Janet Page, 37, of the study's
findings. Her 15-month-old daughter, Kristen, is cared for at
Bright Horizons, and her 5-year-old daughter, Kathryn, at Meeting
House Montessori in Braintree, while she works as a CitiBank
accounts manager and her husband as a Turner Construction projects
manager. ``I feel comfortable with our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Rosemary Ruggles, a 37-year-old single mother who runs a
medical management company at Quincy Hospital and drops off her 2
1/2-year-old daughter, Paige, at Bright Horizons: ``I've had no
regrets at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gail Schroth, 42, sees her 5-year-old son, E.J., developing
new social skills since he started going to the day-care center.
``This is the best thing for him, without a doubt,'' said Schroth,
who works as a hospital financial services director, and whose
husband is an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   But for one stay-at-home mother of four, who is trained as an
obstetrician/gynecologist, the study can't answer all the questions
about possible long-term effects on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of problems I would look for, not that I'm saying
there are those problems: How they do in their marriage, the rate
of teen pregnancy and drug use, all those things that are much more
complex and subtle,'' said Dr. Amy Tuteur, who has three boys and a
girl, ranging in age from 4 to 11 1/2, and whose husband works as
an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In describing her decision to stay at home, Tuteur said: ``I
feel like it's my obligation. I couldn't stand the feeling of guilt
like I was missing something, that there'd be a school play and I
wouldn't be able to be there.''

FIDGETING YOUR WAY TO FITNESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately I been reading books about exercise in the hope of
inspiring myself to actually do some because I have reached a point
in life when a harsh choice must be made, i.e., get moving or die.
</P>
<P>
   You might think this would be motivating, but it's not that
simple. The specter of untimely death must be weighed against the
prospect of getting my rear end in gear and walking or swimming or
biking at a fairly swift pace three or four times a week for a
minimum of 40 minutes. I am weighing the pros and cons. Meanwhile,
I gather from my reading that in order to truly appreciate being
fit you should first be unfit. So in a sense I'm already halfway
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday I came across another piece of good news: The fatter you
are the more calories you burn when you exercise. A chart in
Tamilee Webb's ``Workouts for Dummies,'' recommended to me by a
fitness professional, for obvious reasons, indicates the number of
calories burned per hour by body weight for various activities. For
example, a 198-pound person burns 960 calories per hour jogging, a
110-pound person burns just 535.
</P>
<P>
   The chart lists more than 40 activities, among them the usual _
running, swimming, tennis, etc. _ and the unusual _ sailing,
horseshoe pitching, croquet, golf (with cart), among others. I find
it difficult to believe that some of these activities burn the
stated number of calories.
</P>
<P>
   Archery, for example. According to the chart, a 154-pound person
burns 210 to 280 calories an hour engaging in archery, which I
happen to know firsthand is slightly less strenuous than deep
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   And fishing. The chart claims a 154-pound person burns up 140 to
280 calories per hour fishing. Maybe, if she's in the water
wrestling a man-eating shark.
</P>
<P>
   But I shouldn't be too quick to discount these figures, because
a recent study revealed that moderate exercise, even doing
housework or walking the dog, can be just as effective as the more
strenuous variety. The survey said nothing about cats, which
surprised me because I know that cleaning up after them constitutes
a workout. Lifting 20-pound sacks of litter off the supermarket
shelf, heaving them onto the checkout counter, wrestling them into
the car, lugging them into the house. And that's before I even
think about changing the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The semi-weekly total change of two separate litter boxes could
be an Olympic event. Empty used litter into plastic bags. Scrape
boxes. Carry plastic bags to trash. Sweep up surrounding area.
Scrub boxes with Lysol-laced hot water. Drag 20-pound bag of cat
litter to boxes. Lift. Pour litter. Smooth and distribute litter in
attractive manner to please highly critical cats. I'd be willing to
bet this whole routine burns more calories than the most strenuous
game of croquet.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent study found that people who are naturally fidgety
burn more calories than those who aren't. According to this study
there is no way to train yourself to be fidgety if you're not
inclined to be, although I suppose that won't stop somebody from
writing a bestseller, ``Fidget Your Way to a New You!!!''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not exactly clear, the fidgeting finding
leads me to wonder if negative emotions rev up the metabolic
engine. That's been my experience. For instance I'm sure that in
the last week I've burned off hundreds of calories envying a friend
who invested $2,000 in Amazon.com two years ago and is now skiing
in Italy, expending thousands of dollars and calories on the
slopes, while I sit here trying to figure out if there are any
circumstances under which unloading the dishwasher could possibly
be construed as an aerobic exercise. It's got to be as strenuous as
golf (with cart), no?

ROTH IRA IS THE BEST BET AGAINST HIGHER TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The Roth IRA is being promoted on the basis of reduced tax
liability. This tax structure raises my concern about the Roth IRA
at the time of retirement. Is there anything in the legislation
preventing government from changing the rules in 40 years? My
concern arises from the following example: Consider $1 of taxable
income and a 28 percent tax bracket. Suppose I invest in something
that grows tax-deferred by a factor of 100 over some investment
period. With the traditional IRA, my dollar eventually grows to
$100, and upon withdrawal I get to keep $72 while giving the
government $28. With the Roth IRA, I give away 28 cents upfront and
invest only 72 cents. With the same growth rate, I have the same
$72. However, with the Roth I have given the government only 28
cents in taxes, instead of the $28 it would have received if it had
invested its share along with mine. Wouldn't this leave me as
vulnerable to additional taxation as semi-employed FICA recipients
are today? I like the traditional IRA because the government gets
its $28 when I get my $72, and there is less chance for a rule
change by Congress if the government hasn't already consumed its
share.
</P>
<P>
   G.S., Lynnfield, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suppose you can argue that anything is possible in
Washington, but I think that the prospects of Congress reneging on
the Roth IRA are very dim _ simply because changing these rules
would represent such a spectacular breaking of a promise that it
would likely constitute political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But much more important is another factor that you don't
mention.
</P>
<P>
   The rules for the traditional IRA specify simply that money
stashed away in a traditional IRA accumulates on a tax-deferred
basis, and the rules say nothing about the tax structure upon
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The popular theory is that when the money is saved, the owner is
working and is in a relatively high tax bracket, whereas when it is
finally withdrawn the owner is likely to be retired and in a lower
bracket. If it works out that the person is in the same bracket at
both times, as you point out, the eventual amount of taxation is
the same.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if tax rates in general are higher in the
distant future? Suppose you defer paying a 28 percent tax now, only
to face a 38 percent tax levy 30 years from now when you withdraw
money from your IRA?
</P>
<P>
   If you think a 38 percent tax is unthinkable, reflect on the tax
rates in many European economies. Also reflect on the
much-discussed problems with Social Security and other entitlement
systems that are projected to be very real at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose the situation is critical enough so that something
has to be done. It seems to me most likely that Congress would find
it easier to gradually crank up tax rates in general, rather than
break the promise that is inherent in the Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I consider a major attraction of the Roth IRA
the fact that it represents an insurance policy against possible
higher tax rates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 50-year-old divorced woman and I have only been in the
work force for the past seven years because I was at home for 15
years raising my children. I have money invested in the following:
Scudder Massachusetts Tax-Free Bond fund, $1,646; a Fidelity
rollover IRA with $5,531 in Puritan, $11,709 in Fidelity Growth and
Income, and $4,633 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock funds; and a 401(k)
program begun last July with my current employer, containing $866
in a common stock fund, $200 in money markets, $416 in a balanced
account, and $623 in an aggressive stock fund. I have 10 percent of
my salary withheld for the 401(k) each week, and my employer also
contributes, adding $356 last year. I also have some money in a
previous employer's 401(k) that I will need to put in the Fidelity
IRA and need to know where to invest it. I don't know if I am
investing wisely, especially in the Fidelity IRA. I need to know if
I should shift some of the money to other funds. If I do so, will
it cost me money? Am I having enough withheld from my paycheck? Am
I on the right track?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., Winthrop, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think in general you're doing pretty well. I'm not
enthusiastic about that $200 in the money markets, and while $200
isn't a whole lot of money, it's nearly 10 percent of the 401(k),
and as the account builds, further contributions there will create
a substantial drag on the account's growth.
</P>
<P>
   I'd move that money to the balanced account, and if you are
making ongoing contributions to the money market account, I'd move
those either to the balanced or the common stock account, depending
on how aggressive you want to be.
</P>
<P>
   I have less concern about the Fidelity funds, all of which are
excellent performers. You don't specify how big the 401(k) account
from a previous employer is, but you don't want to add the proceeds
to the rollover IRA _ you want to start a separate rollover IRA for
that money.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this is that the only advantage of a rollover IRA
is that it allows you to transfer the account into a future
employer's 401(k) or another qualified retirement plan, should you
desire. Once you add funds, though, you can no longer make such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   I can see no good reason to make such a move at this time, but
you'll want to keep your options open, which is easily done simply
by opening another rollover IRA account with Fidelity and putting
the money there.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Select Health Care would be a good choice for this
money, provided that it amounts to less than $3,000 _ in which case
such an investment might represent too large a bet on that risky
but potentially very rewarding sector. If the amount is more than
$3,000, why not divide the rollover account between Fidelity Select
Health Care and Fidelity Overseas funds?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't cost you anything to diversify the money in the
Fidelity IRA, but I think you have it nicely allocated and don't
think you'd gain much by changing.
</P>
<P>
   Are you saving enough? Well, I did some backward calculations _
which included some guesses _ and came up with an estimate of an
annual salary of about $30,000 and monthly contributions to the
401(k), including those of your employer, of $308.33. Now, if we
assume average 10 percent annual growth throughout the portfolio,
those contributions over the next 15 years would take you to
$230,028. This calculation doesn't include the unspecified amount
of money in that old 401(k) account.
</P>
<P>
   Should you save more? You'll have to look at your budget and
your likely needs in retirement. Here are a couple of projections,
though, just to give you a sense of how the numbers would work.
</P>
<P>
   If you added $50 a month to your 401(k) contributions, the
account would grow to $249,972. If you added $100 a month, the
projection would be $269,916.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, if higher contributions on your part would
trigger higher contributions on the part of your employer, the
numbers would be even higher.

NEW FIGHTING WORDS ON THE POLITICAL FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lamar Alexander calls them ``weasel words.'' Dan
Quayle says he has ordered his staff ``never, ever'' to utter such
language. Even Al Gore mocks the notion.
</P>
<P>
   What is this controversial idea that so many presidential
hopefuls find appalling? Something to do with drugs and violence?
Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a concept labeled ``compassionate conservatism'' by Texas
Governor George W. Bush, in some polls the front-runner for the
Republican nomination. The debate over what is being called a
philosophy is taken so seriously by Republicans that many believe
the outcome could determine the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it may seem bizarre that a fight would break out
over a concept intended to sound as American as apple pie or the
Statue of Liberty. Many Republicans are conservatives, so that part
is not controversial. But when it comes to compassion, temperatures
rise. ``Compassion'' is interpreted as a code word for
``moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the attacks on the language clearly are preemptive strikes
at Bush's still-unannounced candidacy, the controversy can be best
understood by remembering the words of Bush's father, the former
president.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1988 when George Herbert Walker Bush, then the vice
president, said at the Republican National Convention that he would
be a ``kinder, gentler'' president, an implicit criticism of
President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The line got a lot of applause from the party's moderates and,
outside the convention hall, from many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives suspected that Bush's kinder, gentler America
actually meant a bigger, more regulatory government. After a couple
of years of the Bush administration, conservatives believed that is
exactly what had happened, with the passage of the Clean Air Act,
the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the president's broken
``no-new-taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Now some rivals think Bush's son has merely found a kinder,
gentler way to say he, too, is a, well, kinder, gentler Republican.
The controversy started when Bush made the following statement
after his overwhelming reelection victory in November: ``A leader
who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender gap,
open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and voices, and
win without sacrificing our principles.''
</P>
<P>
   To Governor Bush's supporters, this sounded like a centrist
formula cooked up to win the presidency; it was the ``big tent,''
redux.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why some of Bush's potential opponents
promptly cried foul. They haven't come right out and called Bush a
``wimp,'' as Newsweek once tagged President Bush in a cover story,
but the implication coyly has been put into play.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, Bush's vice president, who says he follows the party's
``11th Commandment'' never to attack a fellow Republican, appeared
to have done just that in a fund-raising letter that implicitly
attacked Governor Bush. ``I have ordered my staff to never _ ever _
utter the words `compassionate conservative,' '' Quayle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee and secretary of
education under President Bush, and whose best chance for winning
the nomination (in his second attempt) may lie in portraying
himself as the most moderate member of the field, said the words
were ``empty shells . . . cleverly and deliberately put together to
confuse people by meaning nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan aide Gary Bauer, a social conservative who also is
running for the nomination, took a different tack, saying the words
were ``redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   These potshots have revived memories of why President Bush was
unpopular among many Republicans. He was accused of lacking a
vision, of not ``getting it'' when confronted with the problems of
ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Governor Bush hopes to avert such problems by declaring
himself to be a compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if anyone has benefited from the controversy, it may be
Governor Bush. Those who complain about compassionate conservatism
may be unintentionally sending a signal that they are
uncompassionate, which hardly seems like a theme for a presidential
resume.
</P>
<P>
   It was Joseph J. Jacobs who helped popularize the phrase with
his 1996 book, ``The Compassionate Conservative: Seeking
Responsibility and Human Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they attack the words `compassionate conservative?' ''
Jacobs says in an interview. ``Do they want to be known as
conservatives who are not compassionate? It is a silly obfuscation.
It is truly because they are worried George W. Bush has touched an
important factor among conservatives. All of us thoughtful
(conservative Republicans) resent the fact that we are not
considered compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, chairman of the Jacobs Engineering Co. in Pasadena,
Calif., has never spoken with Governor Bush, but Jacobs's friends
in Congress and elsewhere have discussed the book with Bush.
Jacobs's own view of compassionate conservatism is instructive. He
runs a family foundation which, instead of providing grants to poor
people, makes interest-bearing loans to inner-city entrepreneurs
who want to start a business.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Jacobs's book is that a government giveaway can do
more harm than good if it strips away initiative from the intended
beneficiary. Jacobs says that his belief in sparking initiative,
instead of creating dependency, is more compassionate in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leaves these two questions about Governor Bush: Is
he truly a compassionate conservative? And what does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, described a philosophy
that mirrors the one outlined in Jacobs's book. ``It is
conservative and compassionate to move people from welfare to
work,'' she said. ``It helps welfare recipients to have better
lives. That is a compassionate philosophy. We are perplexed about
why fellow Republicans would criticize a popular conservative
governor about a winning philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that philosophy has similarities to the view that
President Clinton espoused when he supported a bill to overhaul
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, however, is prepared to argue that Bush is
anything but compassionate. A political aide, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Gore's associates have researched a number of
areas where he believes Bush should be attacked for being less than
compassionate, such as his position against abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to challenge him to explain where he differs from Pat
Robertson,'' the Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, in what was considered a kickoff for his
presidential campaign, Gore told the moderate Democratic Leadership
Council: ``Some now say that we need a `compassionate
conservatism.' I wonder where they got that from? Let us be clear.
We welcome all who truly want to join us in this vital center. But
there is a difference between using the rhetoric of the center, and
actually governing from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore followed up by announcing a philosophy he called
``practical idealism,'' which he defined as ``strengthening the
bond between progressive goals and responsible government.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's anthem prompted more than a few snickers among the
audience, partly because the concept seemed even more vague than
Bush's theme. Alexander, for example, has said Gore's words are as
empty as Bush's. But behind the rhetoric, there is hope that a real
debate is in the making for Campaign 2000: What will be the role of
government in the next millennium?
</P>
<P>
   After the scandals and controversies of the Clinton presidency,
the public just might be ready for candidates who talk earnestly
about compassion and idealism.

AUTHOR ASSERTS THAT TELECOMMUTING WILL GROW IN POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since the 1970s, more and more employees have
found working from home a flexible alternative to traveling to an
office. At the same time, more companies are beginning to allow
regular telecommuting, hoping to boost employee productivity and
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Managing Telework: Strategies for Managing the Virtual
Workforce'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc., September 1998), author and
scientist Jack Nilles explains why more workers will telecommute in
the future and how workers will use increasingly more technology to
accomplish their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Nilles (pronounced NIL-ess) is president of Jala International,
a Los Angeles-based company that helps others set up telecommuting
programs. He spoke recently about working from home:
</P>
<P>
   Q: By now, we all understand what telecommuting is. What is
telework?
</P>
<P>
   A: Telework is doing information technology work from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is a form of telework. Telecommuting specifically
concentrates on eliminating that daily commute to the office from
home. In practice, most of the telework that's going on in the
United States is telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your estimates for the number of telecommuters in
the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Around 19 million workers telecommute today. That's about 13
to 14 percent of the U.S. work force ...
</P>
<P>
   There will be somewhere between 20 million and 24 million by end
of 2000. By 2030, it may reach somewhere over 50 million _ or about
25 to 30 percent of U.S. workers will be telecommuting at least
some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is this mode of work growing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Telecommuters are more productive. I have estimated they are
5 to 20 percent more productive than workers who don't telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   This is because in a telework situation, the responsibility to
do the work shifts from the employer, or manager, to the employee.
If you, the employee, don't produce, you'll be sent back to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What percentage of the telecommuting population uses
technology to do the job?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a non-high-tech organization _ your standard business _
up to 30 percent of telecommuters don't use anything more
complicated than a phone or fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage will get smaller as people use personal
computers for all sorts of work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What jobs are best suited for telecommuting?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fundamental classification is information jobs. This
could range from a data entry clerk to the CEO of a big
corporation. It's any job where workers don't have to be in a
specific physical location to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost easier to say what isn't suitable. A hamburger
flipper at McDonald's, a gardener or a construction worker would
not be suitable. Today, information workers constitute about 60
percent of all U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How often do workers telecommute?
</P>
<P>
   A: The average number of days telecommuting is two or fewer days
per week right now. Less than 10 percent of workers telecommute
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much do companies spend to outfit their teleworkers with
computers, software and furniture for home offices?
</P>
<P>
   A: On average, companies may spend about $500 on each
telecommuter. So if you take 19 million telecommuters at 500 bucks
apiece, that comes out to $950 million. But that's not just in one
year, so it's not a huge bill.
</P>
<P>
   Companies tend to pay for computers, telecommunications
equipment and software for the simple reason they want it to be
compatible with what's in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do companies see any returns on those capital outlays?
</P>
<P>
   A: What companies spend to set up teleworkers, they save in
office space rent. Companies also get increased productivity from
teleworkers, and telecommuting tends to reduce the employee
turnover rate. Teleworkers tend to be more loyal because they are
happier.
</P>
<P>
   I have estimated that companies save between $6,000 to $12,000
per telecommuter every year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the years to come, what technologies will companies spend
money on to outfit their teleworkers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Technology itself won't be a big factor in the equation. The
biggest factor will be in telecommunications charges. The biggest
additional expenses will be getting Internet access, (high-speed
modems such as) ISDN lines for lots of data transfer, video
conferencing, etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Internet does a couple things. It changes work hours. It
makes schedules more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Communication has gone from memos to e-mail. As video technology
gets better, workers will send video snippets to co-workers instead
of having meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also allows teamwork to become more available to
workers in different divisions who are thousands of miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet clearly enables whole new organizational forms to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we headed toward a complete virtual work society?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's important for social reasons for people to talk to
other people every now and then.

THE WORLD INTRUDES ON MINISTERIAL ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EVENSONG 
By Gail Godwin. Ballantine. 
407 pp. $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its trails marked by the shadows of the past, the world of
Gail Godwin's fiction is usually a place where love and memory
collide _ where a daughter can forgive, just barely, a parent's
former wrongs, and that act of mercy can lead to her own
transformation. These interstices between obligation and charity
(or even, you might say, between a moral life and a happy one) are
the deepest concerns of Godwin's novels; though she belongs to the
school of what I call somber realism, those day-by-day studies in
family portraiture are mostly intent upon delivering their
characters from the inside out. One of the best of these stories
was the 1991 novel, ``Father Melancholy's Daughter,'' in which a
beloved, sorrowful Episcopal priest, raising his young daughter
alone, shared his heaven-bound petitions with her each night.
``I've had my lows,'' he says to God and girl alike one evening.
``God knows I've had my lows, but together we have held the fort.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was Margaret Gower, and by the end of that story she
was a young woman on the verge of seminary. That she was also
reading ``Middlemarch'' seems prescient as well, because in
``Evensong'' _ a sort of sequel to ``Father Melancholy's
Daughter,'' though a story that easily stands alone _ she has
married a benign version of Casaubon. Now the Reverend Bonner, head
of an Episcopal parish in the North Carolina mountains, Margaret is
a thoughtful, funny, headstrong woman in her early 30s: what you
might call a good woman, whether you met her in the hardware store
or in the receiving line after Sunday services. Adrian Bonner, 20
years her elder and an associate of her father, is her devoted but
remote husband, a former Jungian who's the chaplain at High
Balsam's Fair Haven School, where wayward youth go to thrive.
Together, the Bonners minister to the sick and deprived or depraved
with equanimity and courage, but when ``Evensong'' opens, they're
having more luck with their constituencies than they are with each
other. This is a marriage warmed by God and a mutuality of mind,
but somewhat cool to its own touch. That lonely paradox is the
emblematic center of the novel, which will travel through half the
individual sagas in High Balsam before its journey is complete.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with its name, ``Evensong'' is a deeply considered,
even dignified novel, and it admirably limns the actual workings of
a godly inner life _ how Margaret perceives the world and her place
in it through the daily, overlapping narratives of prayer and
thought. But the novel also creaks from its opening pages:
Stylistic grace and delicacy are not part of Godwin's assets, nor
is unobtrusive dialogue. What she can do is set up an old-fashioned
story with a cast of intriguing and screwball characters, and
``Evensong'' provides that with much ado, from a young delinquent
in Adrian's charge to a couple of mysterious strangers at the door.
One stays engaged with the story for sheer narrative hook: As with
story lines from Dickens to ``Guiding Light,'' you simply want to
find out who does what to whom.
</P>
<P>
   The tacit disarray of Margaret and Adrian's marriage belongs
mostly to wounds of the past, and the novel dips between their
courtship and the present to heighten the consequences of both.
Thrown into an orphanage when he was 6, Adrian had a youth shaped
by cruel taskmasters and too little love before he put his trust in
God and the acrobatics of the mind, both of which could leave
earthly pains behind. Raised by her father after her mother fled
the trials of marriage and children, Margaret understands firsthand
her husband's early loss, but their shared heartache doesn't always
make them closer _ common injury rarely guarantees rescue. What
each of them possesses is the sustenance at the end of the day
provided by good works: Her enduring ability to stand tall in the
face of other people's pain; his sweet authority with the troubled
students at the school. Thanks to Godwin's intensity of focus upon
their quotidian emotional life, you can feel the way these bonds
and advances help the Bonners to survive _ the way a prayer in the
morning, which may have felt as though it were falling in a desert,
can give you a little rain when you'd all but given up.
</P>
<P>
   Through these daily trials march a number of well-drafted
characters with their own lots to contemplate: Tony, a sweet
octogenarian who shows up from a neighboring monastery, carrying
handrolled cigarettes and an uncertain past; Chase, the Peruvian
teenager whom Adrian loves and who has just left alcohol rehab;
Margaret's best friend, Gus, a strong-hearted architect who's
trying to figure out, in her middle 40s, how to share her life with
somebody else. Least appealing but most demanding is a ``freelance
apostle'' named Grace Munger, wrapped in a formidable red cape (and
God's will, or so she believes), organizing a Millennium Birthday
March for Jesus through High Balsam in this Advent week of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the millennium has to rear its head in contemporary
fiction, but its presence here serves little purpose _ like Grace's
parade, it feels like a contrived effort to manipulate the unruly
elements of human happenstance. In fact, for all its fine attention
to the presence of God, a number of dei ex machina crash around
onstage in ``Evensong,'' which ought to have just taken its chances
with the secular unfolding of time and space. As it is, the
atmosphere of High Balsam _ its class tensions and human frailties
_ are introduced with peripheral melodramas (a shooting over a
parking place) and villainous characters (a reporter who, in real
life, would never be given a job). These devices make ``Evensong''
feel heavy-handed and overly determined, when the emotional ballast
and simplicity of its central story would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   For, as Margaret or Adrian either one could tell you, all you
really need is faith in the power of narrative _ the rest is all so
much external trappings, which only clutter things up. What's
lovely and lasting about ``Evensong'' is that straightforward
knowledge: Adrian's belief that God appears in ``the answering
silence,'' Margaret's beautiful description of prayer to a young
lost girl: ``The amazing thing is, this constant accounting of
yourself to an unseen other does make you change and grow.'' The
final beauty of ``Evensong'' is its ability to address God _ to
address the mystery of faith _ by comprehending, then embracing,
this premise of uncertainty itself.

THE TRIALS OF BENAZIR BHUTTO 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI _ What happened to Benazir Bhutto?
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after being swept to power on the hopes of
millions, she spends more time these days in courtrooms fighting
corruption charges than in parliament battling for her people.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the beautiful young Bhutto embodied the struggle
against military dictatorship and championed the poor, illiterate
majority of her 130 million people. In 1988, she became the first
female leader of an Islamic nation, only to be dismissed two years
later for graft and abuse of power. She was acquitted and reelected
in 1993, but drummed out again in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , accusations that were largely discounted in 1990 are
widely believed. Courts in Pakistan and Switzerland are
scrutinizing documents from overseas firms, banks, and alleged
front men that purportedly map a trail of $1.5 billion in kickbacks
to Bhutto and her family. A guilty verdict on any of six cases
against her could mean fines, prison, and a ban from politics.
</P>
<P>
   The fall from grace of Benazir Bhutto, or ``BB'' as she is known
here, is in many ways a tale of squandered promise. It is betrayal,
say disillusioned followers, of her tremendous potential to change
this impoverished nation and of the near-religious faith people had
in her.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto, head of the People's Party of Pakistan, maintains that
she is the victim of a conspiracy by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to
eliminate his only serious opposition. She also attributes her bad
name to ``the unhealthy relationship between the mass media, the
public, and elected representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Clinton, Princess Di, and I have been the
most tragic victims of that in the last decade,'' Bhutto concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In court appearances, rallies, closed-door party meetings,
public engagements, and interviews with the Globe over five days,
the 45-year-old Bhutto was by turns charming and arrogant,
convinced she will prevail in court and determined to regain the
prime minister's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusation that I stole even one cent is false,'' she said
indignantly when asked about documents admitted in court linking
her and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, to bank accounts and lavish
properties in the United States, Britain, France, and Switzerland.
``One may or may not have a house, a bank account, or money. But
there must be a link to corruption. Where is the link?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know kings and presidents and prime ministers and first
ladies and human rights people and women leaders who respect me and
admire me,'' she declared, her voice thick with outrage. The
current government ``had no right to drag my name in mud and say .
. . I'm a common criminal!''
</P>
<P>
   So who is the real Benazir Bhutto?
</P>
<P>
   Along the stairs in one of her homes hangs a yellowing set of
drawings from the 1980s by a Pakistani political cartoonist. Bhutto
is shown gazing at a portrait of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a
charismatic prime minister who was hanged in 1979 by military coup
leaders. She spent four years in prison under military rule.
Another sketch shows her late father's home, where she lived while
campaigning for democracy, with the caption: ``Liberty has still a
house to live in. Wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   A more prescient drawing shows the future leader gazing in a
mirror, with the warning below, ``Caution: Fame is a magnifying
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Fame would put the life of any two-time prime minister under a
microscope. But detractors _ and there are more now than defenders
_ say that power and a cabal of self-serving sycophants corrupted
the promising young leader.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of two daughters and two sons of an affluent
landowning family, Bhutto was her father's favorite. The elder
Bhutto did not bow to the male chauvinism of a Muslim society, and
tapped his daughter as his protege. He may have also been intrigued
by the father-daughter team of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi
in neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Harvard and Oxford, the aristocratic BB was feted by
politicians from Cambridge to Capitol Hill and canonized by the
Western media. Before serving as principal speaker of Harvard's
1989 commencement ceremony, the woman known as an undergraduate as
Pinky was hailed by Harvard friend _ and future US ambassador _
Peter W. Galbraith as a liberator of women and political prisoners
who ended her nation's death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, she was embraced as a liberal who triumphed over
tragedy and could lead a poor nation out of its feudal past.
</P>
<P>
   The real Bhutto is full of incongruities. She preaches
democracy, but insiders say she won't take advice or criticism. She
espouses modern values, but wears a headscarf in public _ rare
among educated women. She agreed to an arranged marriage her mother
pushed, to a man with a shady reputation. And she has stood by him
even when advised that a divorce would clear her name.
</P>
<P>
   Though her reputation has undoubtedly been sullied, Bhutto still
enjoys movie-star status here. She is thronged by bone-crushing
mobs wherever she goes. Yet she seems to take her popularity for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   She can also switch instantly from sweet to imperious if anyone
dares criticize her. She is hailed as a champion of the poor, yet
her regal bearing and the fawning attention of her inner circle
strike more parallels with the Queen of England than Mother Teresa.

TOP STUDENT, NOW SUPREMACIST, DENIES HIS PAST

<P>
   WESTWOOD, Mass. _ Before his dark transformation, he was Andrew
Britt Greenbaum, a crackerjack student who drove too fast, played a
mean game of chess, and spent long hours reading alone in his room.
</P>
<P>
   Like high school kids do everywhere, his classmates labeled him:
Greenbaum was a brainwave, or a nerd, or a radical. He played with
swords. He took Civil War history a little too seriously. He did
not hang out at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Only the few who knew him better than casually caught glimpses
of something more chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd talk about how other races were inferior and all that
crap,'' said Tarleton Hill, a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of graduation from Westwood High School in 1996,
Greenbaum drove down Route 109 to Dedham, walked into the busy
probate court there, and began the process that would legally
change his name to Davis Wolfgang Hawke. It was a more fitting
appellation, he believed, and it helped complete the transformation
of what he had become: a hatemonger, a pariah, a disciple of Adolf
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really despise Massachusetts,'' said Hawke, now a junior at
Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C. ``It's a very liberal state.
It's a very Jewish state. It's a very black state. There's nothing
in that state for me. And I'll never be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hawke is the leader of the Internet-launched Knights of
Freedom, a neo-Nazi organization he operates from a dorm-room
computer at a school that is horrified and embarrassed about a hate
group that is testing the limits of free speech and drawing close
attention from human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kid had the potential to be a real leader,'' said
Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which
tracks hate groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white supremacist movement in this country in general is
very much seeking out the leadership cadres of tomorrow,'' he said.
``There is a real interest in looking for kids with charisma like
Davis Wolfgang Hawke.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights leaders say he is now under suspicion among
white supremacist groups because of the name he had hoped to bury
in the dense files of a Dedham courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Greenbaum-cum-Hawke's journey from this
well-groomed, affluent Boston suburb to a Deep South dormitory room
decorated with swastika flags and authentic-looking Nazi uniforms
is the tale of squandered promise, icy intolerance, and the irony
of an anti-Semite haunted by the Jewish name on his birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to engage in violence to cause pain and to
cause harm,'' said Leonard Zakim, executive director of the
Anti-Defamation League's New England office. ``The quicker you blow
him out of the water, the better. This is a guy who should be
exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum was born Oct. 21, 1978, in Newport, R.I., the son of
Hyman Andrew Greenbaum, a Georgia native, and the former Peggy
Amber Davis of New Mexico, according to a copy of his birth
certificate on file at the Dedham courthouse. The family moved to
Lakeville, Mass. when Andrew was still a toddler and he attended
grammar school in southeastern Massachusetts before the Greenbaums
resettled into a neat, modest home here.
</P>
<P>
   The tidy blue house with cream trim backs onto a cemetery and is
just a short walk from the local high school. School officials
would not be interviewed for this story, but his classmates
invariably mention two things about Greenbaum's high school days:
He was remarkably bright, and he was more than a little bit
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loner is a good word for it, but he had a little crowd,'' said
Arthur H. Ellis Jr., who graduated with Greenbaum. ``He was smart
but everyone knew he had a little weird thing going on _ kind of
like an intellectual radical.''
</P>
<P>
   What his classmates saw as loneliness, Greenbaum called
determined reflection. There was no single trigger, no defining
moment, no epiphany that propelled him toward hatred. It was, he
said, an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gradual evolution,'' he said, one that occurred in
the stacks of the local library and under the reading lamp in his
bedroom. He read and re-read Hitler's manifesto, ``Mein Kampf,''
and studied the tenets of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much kept to myself, but I'm not an introvert,''
Hawke said last week. ``I'm a leader and a leader can't be an
introvert. I'm interested in being a leader, not being someone's
friend. In any social relationship, I have to be the superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, who ran unsuccessfully for class president his junior
year, said if his Westwood classmates were uncomfortable with him,
the feeling was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Jewish town,'' he said. ``Not only was it Jewish, but
they felt the need to bus in a large number of Negroes from
inner-city Boston. Every teacher there was a radical left-wing
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   His high school yearbook said Greenbaum held the top spot on the
chess club: ``That came as no surprise since he's the best in the
state.'' Hawke said he found chess ``a good metaphor for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a skull-adorned T-shirt and a dark cowboy hat, Greenbaum
posed for a yearbook picture in his neighborhood's cemetery
standing over a gravestone etched with the name Sherman _ an
intended reference to the Civil War Union general's march through
the South, which still draws Confederate scorn. Beneath the photo,
where other students would have inscribed silly nicknames and tales
of sporting triumphs, Greenbaum wrote: ``The rock, the vulture, and
the chain; all that the proud can feel of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Westwood handed diplomas to its class of 1996,
Greenbaum never showed up. Within days he was in the Dedham
courthouse, seeking to bury his past.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed to support his application for a change of
identity, Greenbaum was asked to state his reason for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always responded to a different name and I wish to
formalize my name prior to attending college in the fall as to
avoid confusion,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is not that benign.

 WESTWOOD, Mass.: ... that benign.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the court granted his request, Greenbaum had already
been detected by the Anti-Defamation League, which spotted him on a
Norwood street corner handing out Knights of Freedom fliers,
decrying rising immigration, US financial support for Israel, and
gays in President Clinton's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke acknowledged handing out hate literature in his high
school as well as in ``mainly blue-collar'' neighborhoods near
Westwood. And Hawke knew the credibility of his views, including
sterilization for Jews, was undermined by his surname. ``I didn't
want people to think I'm Jewish, when I'm not Jewish,'' said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Hawke's parents were not successful. Telephone
calls, knocks at their door, and notes left at their address,
seeking comment, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke said they oppose his activities. ``But what can they do
about it? It's my life, not theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke insists Hyman Greenbaum is his stepfather. He said he is
the ``illegitimate'' son of a man his mother did not marry and he
does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no Jewish blood in me,'' he said. ``I can't help the
fact that my stepfather is a quarter Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of his lineage, when Davis Wolfgang Hawke
arrived in South Carolina for his freshman year at Wofford, an
expensive and mostly white college affiliated with the United
Methodist Church, he left Andrew Britt Greenbaum behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is very conservative, so I thought it would be
more receptive to my beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He kept largely to himself, accumulating a 3.8 grade-point
average studying German and history. College officials said he has
complied with authority and, until recently, presented no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say hello and he'd always returned the greeting,'' said
Dan Maultsby, Wofford's dean. ``But I never had a personal
conversation with him. That embarrasses me now. I wish I had. It's
an embarrassment to a small college that he's been here for 2 1/2
years and now we find out about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Knights of Freedom, a fledgling outfit with about 20 followers
until it blossomed via the Internet last summer, became a campus
flashpoint earlier this month when the Spartanburg Herald-Journal
newspaper ran a story about Hawke's dorm-room operation. Three
hundred students turned out for a recent candlelight vigil
condemning Hawke and his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a considerable amount of fear by people who
thought it might escalate into something violent,'' said Kris
Neely, a Wofford sophomore who organized the vigil. ``We're working
to answer questions about whether we need to be a more diverse
student body.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, however, is enjoying the attention. He's posted a press
release on his Web page that states: ``Remember that all coverage
is good coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   On that Web page, Hawke, a soft-spoken and articulate
20-year-old, uses florid prose to denounce ``Jewish tyranny'' and
federal taxes, and to espouse an Aryan homeland and the confinement
of minorities to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis puts everything on the line,'' said Matthew O`Connor,
who identified himself as a Knights of Freedom member from southern
New Jersey. ``Basically, he's our last chance. And I truly believe
that. I'll follow him right down to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   For $5 a month, Hawke's members _ estimated at about 200 despite
his claim of many more _ receive a newsletter, videotapes, copies
of hate speeches, a certificate of rank, an armband, a picture ID,
and a mail-order catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He talks grandly of an upcoming march on Washington, the
imminent influx of about $700,000 from an unnamed source, and the
planned purchase of a party ``compound'' in Wyoming or Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States of America, we have something called the
First Amendment, which gives me as much right to express my beliefs
as anyone else,'' said Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, say Wofford officials who are monitoring his
activities. They agree that Hawke is abiding by the letter of the
school's student code: He uses his personal computer linked to a
commercial Internet provider, and the address on the Web site is
listed as Walpole, Mass., a commercial postal box where he said
letters are collected and forwarded to him.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity Hawke so dearly covets will be his undoing,
hate-speech specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kid who thinks because he has fairly good SAT
scores, he's going to rule the universe like some character out of
a Batman comic book,'' said Potok, whose Montgomery, Ala.-based
organization reported last week that hate groups on the Internet
had grown by about 60 percent, from 163 in 1997 to 254 at the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wannabe fuhrer _ a boy who wants to be a big man,''
Potok said. ``But his darkest secret, that he is the son of Hyman
Greenbaum, is very likely to destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tom Metzger, leader of the California-based White Aryan
Resistance, said Sunday, ``If he were, in fact, a product of Jewish
parents, and he was a Jew, he would not be eligible to lead any
struggle we're involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kaiman, southeast regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League, said it is chilling that Hawke has gone unnoticed for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want him hiding in his dorm room in an SS uniform,''
Kaiman said. ``We want to out him. We want to get him out of his
dorm room and then let him stand up and say what he believes. He's
a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   And an unfitting symbol for this town and a school known for
hockey heroics and stellar scholarship, residents here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously a kid with a lot of problems. Pretty messed
up,'' said Lindsay Rose, president of Westwood High's Class of '96.
``It's so unbelievable that he came out of such a nice town. You
just never know what's going on in some people's head.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Come the new millennium, the number of
African-American adults behind bars will hit the million mark for
the first time, according to an analysis of Justice Department
statistics. That represents nearly an eight-fold increase from
three decades ago, when there were 133,226 blacks in prison.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2000, roughly one in 10 black men will be in prison
_ a statistic with major social implications because prisoners
don't have jobs, pay taxes, or care for their children at home. And
because many states bar felons from voting, at least one in seven
African-American men will have lost the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are staggering,'' said Laurie Levensen, a former
federal prosecutor and associate dean of Loyola Law School in Los
Angeles. ``We're incarcerating an entire generation of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Why blacks constitute about half of all prison inmates when they
are only 13 percent of the US population is subject to much
speculation. Some specialists blame poverty or lack of opportunity.
Others say police concentrate in poor urban areas because street
crimes such as drug dealing and armed robbery are more visible, and
residents there demand more police protection.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that crime policy has become a substitute for
public policy, said Jerome Miller, president of the National Center
on Institutions and Alternatives, an Arlington, Va., legal reform
group that analyzed the Justice Department data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 20 years, there has been a terrible propensity
on the part of politicians to deal with difficult economic, social,
family, and personal problems with a meat ax _ the criminal justice
system,'' said Miller, a former commissioner of the Massachusetts
Department of Youth Services.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five decades, the disparity between races has
widened dramatically as minorities have replaced whites in the
prison population, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, whites made up about 65 percent of all state and
federal inmates, while minorities made up 35 percent. Today, the
opposite is true, with 35 percent of the prison population made up
of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face of crime to white Americans is now that of a black
man,'' said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the Center
for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank that specializes
in black community issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means 10 percent of (black men) are not productive,'' said
Massachusetts state Representative Byron Rushing, a Boston
Democrat. ``Not only are their talents not available for
development of the community, but the community spends a large
amount of time dealing with their absence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people in the community going to prison you
start to have the welfare effect, where it becomes acceptable _ a
right of passage _ for African-American men to go to prison,'' said
Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the mass disenfranchisement of
African-Americans. According to an October 1998 report by The
Sentencing Project, a Washington-based legal research and services
organization, in a dozen states, 30 to 40 percent of the next
generation of black men will permanently lose the right to vote if
current trends continue. As it is, in nine states, one in four
black men can never vote again because they were convicted of a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   This massive loss of voting rights not only highlights the
eroding political power base of blacks, but it also calls into
question the notion of democracy in America, Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists say the explanation lies in high rates of
poverty. African-Americans are more likely to end up with a prison
term because they can't afford a good legal defense team, or a
``sentencing consultant'' who can help reduce time spent locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of opportunity plays a role as well, they say, pointing out
that the vast majority of inmates are functionally illiterate,
which means they can't even fill out a job application.
</P>
<P>
   More money for alleviating poverty, however, is not the answer,
said Robert L. Woodson Sr., president of the National Center for
Neighborhood Enterprise, a nonprofit group working with low-income
black communities. He said the key is money for programs that reach
into the community to help build character and values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason young men engage in criminal behavior is not just
for money, it is to make a name for themselves, to have some
expression of worth, even if that expression is self-destructive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson also said he believed blacks are not discriminated
against by the criminal justice system. Rather, he said, there is a
greater concentration of police in African-American communities
because the residents there insist on more policing to deal with
street crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the prison population through the race lense is a
flawed project, agreed Robert Pambianco, chief policy counsel at
the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk about race and statistics is a red herring
thrown in by people who want to return to the '60s,'' said
Pambianco. ``It is an attempt to undermine efforts to keep violent
offenders in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, he said, is whether the individual committed the
crime. And if so, was race a factor in how the individual was
convicted or sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer, some criminologists say, is that often it is.
Evidence of prejudice in the criminal justice system is
overwhelming, they say.
</P>
<P>
   First, criminologists such as William Chambliss, professor of
sociology at George Washington University and past president of the
American Society of Criminologists, point to law enforcement.
Police, he says, admit that they focus their resources on black
communities, particularly when enforcing drug laws and in spite of
the fact that studies show whites consume more drugs than blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much easier to go into a black community and pop someone
selling drugs on the street corner than to go into a suburb where
drug use happens behind closed doors,'' said former prosecutor
Levensen.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are also more frequently viewed as suspects, pulled over,
and targeted by raids, noted Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of traffic stops in Volusia County, Fla., for instance,
showed nearly 70 percent of those stopped were black or Hispanic,
according to Georgetown University Law professor David Cole, author
of ``No Equal Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Police look for crimes in the ghetto, and that's where they
find them,'' Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists say sentencing guidelines were imposed in part to
rid the criminal justice system of sentences that varied
dramatically because of prejudicial factors such as race, gender,
individual circumstance, or geography. But African-Americans still
received sentences an average of six months longer than whites for
committing the same crime, according to a 1998 University of
Georgia study.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cole, blacks also are harder hit by the ``War on
Drugs,'' which ushered in a set of tougher, longer drug sentences
imposed in the late 1980s. Cole writes that mandatory sentences for
crack cocaine offenses are roughly 100 times more severe than
powder cocaine offenses. More African-Americans than whites have
been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, whereas more whites have
been convicted of powder cocaine offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a drug charge might have landed someone in prison
for 60 days, Chambliss points out. Today, it could mean a mandatory
sentence of 10 years _ or even life, if a ``three strikes and
you're out'' provision applies that permanently incarcerates repeat
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, studies show that the number of African-Americans
imprisoned for drug offenses shot up in the mid-80s. Between 1986
and 1991, the number of incarcerated blacks increased 465 percent,
according to The Sentencing Project.

YOU WANT SERVICE WITH YOUR SMILE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the age of chain-store blandness, when every stretch of Route
1 wears the same colors and stripes from Boston to Baton Rouge, the
``personal touch'' is making a suspiciously timed comeback in
retail stores and service outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the young teenager, uniformed in a red shirt and
floating black pants, who addressed the tired crowd filing out of
Loews Nickelodeon Cinema the other evening: ``Thank you for coming
to Loews,'' he croaked, as if hoping to swallow the words.
</P>
<P>
   The ``thank you,'' repeated robotically to each customer, seemed
insincere on its face: The clerk's expression never wavered from
person to person _ not if the customer was dazed, annoyed, or
slumping with fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only recognizably human aspect of the entire
exchange was the embarrassment of the clerk, commanded by his
corporate employer to present a facade of friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   From taco stands to muffler stores, chains seem to have resolved
in unison to take on one of the conundrums of the service economy:
The lowest paid, least trained workers are the ones who interact
with the consumer. But instead of raising their workers' status, or
training, or pay to make them either more capable or more inclined
to impress the public, they've simply asked them to repeat certain
sugary phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of `Stepford Wife' quality about it,'' says
Ralph Whitehead, a social critic and professor of at the University
of Massachusetts at . ``Twenty years ago it was enough to get these
people to put a button on their shirt with a happy face. Now they
have to be the happy face.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead believes that companies simply want a leg up on their
competitors, and that they think courtesy is the key to brand
loyalty: A warm hello from a McDonald's clerk on the highway in
Pennsylvania keeps customers from going to Burger King once they
get home to Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   Still, can it be a coincidence that employee ``friendliness'' is
on the rise at just the moment that chain-store ownership has
washed any mark of local color or distinctiveness from the service
landscape? And is the true competition not between chains but
between the entire chain-store mentality and customers' memories of
the individual stores now vanished?
</P>
<P>
   Like the actors who play that loving, long-married couple
shopping for their grandchildren in those ubiquitous Wal-mart TV
ads, many employees have become props in a campaign to pretend that
today's retail marts are just as homey as the mom-and-pop stores
they drove out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for instance, moviegoers of a sufficient age remember
the original Nickelodeon Cinema or its predecessor, the Abbey
Cinema, the quirky art house near the Boston University campus that
was a distinctive part of the local movie scene, linked in memory
to the masterpieces of the early '70s: ``Mean Streets,'' ``The
Conversation,'' and many others.
</P>
<P>
   They might also remember the Nickelodeon in its second
incarnation, as part of the Boston-based Sack chain. When the
theater moved to new quarters and shifted to more conventional
fare, many locals directed their displeasure toward the home-town
mogul who controlled Sack cinemas, A. Alan Friedberg. The operative
presumption, at least, was that Friedberg, who was active on the
local social scene, cared what his customers thought.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, however, the Nickelodeon has worn the logo
of the multinational Sony chain and now carries the Loews tag.
There is no local ownership, no face, no name other than the
corporate moniker.
</P>
<P>
   And yet despite, or perhaps because of, its corporate parentage,
Loews is anxious to persuade people it cares.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, explains Marc Pascucci, senior vice president of
marketing, ``When we open a new theater, we have a team of
corporate trainers who come into a marketplace. We also have
training manuals, videos, that type of thing to be read or watched
by an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Thank you for coming to Loews'' is called ``an exit
greeting,'' Pascucci explains. ``There are four factors that are
part of our training, to make people feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we train to do is, at the ticket booth, say `Welcome to
Loews.' And then you come to the concession stand and they say,
`Welcome to Loews Theaters. Would you like a super bucket combo
special?' And when you reach the ticket taker, it's `Welcome to
Loews. Your theater is on the left.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pascucci says the training regimen draws only occasional
complaints from the employees. ``I think you might have an employee
who's shy, and might have trouble getting used to it,'' he says,
adding, ``It's a small thing to ask. We're in an interactive
business.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a flaw in the program, however: Nonstop friendliness
isn't natural or engaging. No one remembers the old Nickelodeon for
the happy grins of its employees. Rather, it was what they gave to
the place that lingers in memory: The individual sensibility behind
the choice of movies, the animated conversations that went on
behind the counter, the sense of community that was built when
people who loved movies ran a theater for customers who loved
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the enforced good will of the Loews employees is as
implausible as the satisfied faces of the gray-haired druggists in
the CVS ads, who ask viewers to believe that they're just as happy
punching the computer at a chain store as they were when they ran
their own pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, friendliness doesn't equal good service.
</P>
<P>
   At Staples, the office-supply giant, employees are strictly
assigned, corridor by corridor, to a particular part of the store.
Store rules restrict them to their own zones. In baseball, the left
fielder can sometimes sprint into center to make a play. But not at
Staples, where employees explain that they can't leave their posts
even when no customer is in sight in their zone, to help someone in
the department six feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in an area Staples store on a recent Saturday, about a
half-dozen customers waited in frustration in the area selling
office chairs, while workers in the adjacent sections looked on
numbly.
</P>
<P>
   Once a customer finally got served, and made his way to the
counter, the young woman behind the register repeated her own
``exit greeting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was everything all right?''
</P>
<P>
   No, he explained, it wasn't: It took forever to get help, while
workers stood by, listless.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman was taken aback, as if to suggest that ``exit
greetings'' aren't supposed to elicit responses.
</P>
<P>
   Then she whispered her response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said, in conspiratorial silence.

HOUSE NEEDS CAN-DO MEEHAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might seem a long stretch to try relating 29 miles of scenic
and fragile rivers in Massachusetts to the essence of reality in an
often unreal place called Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with the puny notice that accompanies most things
that happen on Capitol Hill, a decade-long effort to help protect
these 29 miles took a major stride forward.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the person who made it happen in the
post-Gingrich House of Representatives, Marty Meehan, should have
learned something about a situation he mistakenly views as a
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell Democrat is a chronic straight arrow, and he is not
mistaken to take seriously the fact that while campaigning for the
seat in 1992 he said that his intention was to hang around here for
no more than four terms.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be ridiculous for Meehan's constituents not to have
the chance to evaluate (at the ballot box next year) a change of
heart that is every bit as much in their own interests as in
Meehan's.
</P>
<P>
   The story of those 29 river miles is an instructive example of
why his style of work down here is going to be pivotal in a
Congress that is likely to be narrowly divided by party no matter
which one is nominally in the majority. Getting things to happen,
big and routine, is going to require congressmen who can work
across the partisan aisle, which in turn requires know-how,
patience, and extremely hard work in today's hothouse climate.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of work has become a Meehan specialty.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 miles refer to segments of the Sudbury and Assabet rivers
that come together at a place called Egg Rock to form the Concord
River. The area north and west of Boston is as well-known to
fishermen, canoers, and nature lovers as it is sacred in American
history and storied in literature.
</P>
<P>
   But it also lies in uneasy proximity to bustling modern life,
and protecting it has been the focus of activism in the surrounding
communities for years. The preferred mechanism is designation of
the three river segments as part of country's Wild and Scenic
Rivers system.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry, back in 1990, arranged
for the money that produced an Interior Department study strongly
recommending the river segments' inclusion in the system. Ever
since, actually getting it done has been a mini-classic example of
what it takes to move something through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election, Meehan has made the project a priority (as
it was for his predecessor and opponent in '92, Chet Atkins), and
last week his work bore fruit. Because the Republicans are in
control, the authorizing legislation, which passed with only 22
dissenting votes, needed a provision mollifying the property rights
champions of the conservative movement by forbidding use of the
government's eminent domain powers to purchase private property
along the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The designation would also permanently protect them from
federally licensed or other water projects that might affect their
free flow. And since the legislation establishes a joint
administration of the 29 miles between the Interior Department and
a council from eight affected communities, the leg up given to
conservation values is huge.
</P>
<P>
   The teeth-pulling work all this took is not for rookies or lazy
hacks. The chairman of the House Resources Committee, Don Young, is
a veteran oil industry supporter from Alaska. But the Republican
running the relevant subcommittee is Jim Hansen of Utah, who joined
with Meehan last year in sponsoring the House's legislation to put
a stiff tax on cigarettes and let the government regulate nicotine
as a drug; they plan a fresh proposal this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan's partnership with Hansen on tobacco is matched by a a
much better-known alliance with GOP neighbor Chris Shays of
Connecticut in the crusade for campaign finance reform that Meehan
has helped lead for five often lonely years. Against all odds, they
beat Newt Gingrich in his own House last year and refiled their
bill just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression left in one-dimensional press
acounts, Meehan did not run for Congress as a term-limiter. Unlike
so many Republicans elected in their revolution two years later, he
never embraced that movement, leaned on it for support or made
commitments to its goals of taking the question of length of
service away from voters and those who run for office.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say as that four terms was his plan, and he has
flirted with seeking constitutional office in Massachusetts in the
years since.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mistake in 1992, and Meehan admits as much now. If he
were some go-along mediocrity, he could stand or fall in an attempt
for a fifth term, and the result wouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan is different _ and has been from the beginning. Off
his record and potential, the only disappointment would be if were
not to make a real commitment to the House. If he does, I don't
think there's much question what the response will be.

NOT BETTER THAN HIS BROTHER JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The veterans committee of baseball's Hall of
Fame announces its choice for enshrinement at Cooperstown this
week. The panel has examined several good candidates, but none
better than Dominic DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   If DiMaggio isn't chosen, he probably won't complain, because he
is a typical member of what Tom Brokaw's book calls ``The Greatest
Generation.'' He turned 82 last month with no complaints about
losing three seasons to military service in World War II. In 1942,
when the draft rejected him because he wore eyeglasses, he found a
way to volunteer for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio's election would be a triumph for the other guy,
recognizing the millions who excel but are still overshadowed.
Dominic's brother Joe was the most celebrated athlete of his time,
rivaled only by Dominic's friend and teammate, Ted Williams. At 5
feet 9 inches, he was also smaller than many athletes and
bespectacled, thus earning the nickname ``the Little Professor.''
These circumstances would qualify him for round-the-clock
psychological counseling in today's alibi culture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, DiMaggio's life story is American pluck personified.
The son of an immigrant fisherman, he grew up in the North Beach
neighborhood of San Francisco, worked at odd jobs, and followed his
brothers Joe and Vince into Major League Baseball, hitting .301 in
his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   His lifetime batting average was .298, the same as Mickey
Mantle's. He was a lead-off batter and ``setting the table'' for
Williams meant that he led the league in runs scored in 1950 and
1951. In a rare feat for anyone in a Red Sox uniform, he also was
the league leader in stolen bases in 1950, just 15 in that
slugger's era.
</P>
<P>
   He was an All-Star seven times in his 11-year career, equaling
that of last year's choice of the veterans committee, Larry Doby,
whose lifetime batting average was .283. Statistics do not measure
fielding skills. Had Dom DiMaggio played his home games somewhere
other than Fenway's cozy confines, his fleet-footed catches might
have matched his brother's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway wrote about Joe in ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
Simon and Garfunkel sang about him in ``Mrs. Robinson,'' but for
heartfelt, if occasionally off-key, street chanting, nothing could
match the ode that New England urchins sang in the 1940s to the
tune of ``O, Tannenbaum'':
</P>
<P>
   He's better than his brother Joe,
</P>
<P>
   Dom-in-ic Di-Magg-io.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us really believed it, but being a Red Sox fan means
subscribing to a set of preposterous cultish beliefs for which no
successful deprogramming has been devised. Williams and Bobby
Doerr, both in Cooperstown, playing on the same field with two
great center fielder brothers formed a phalanx of greatness that
may explain why I never heard anyone boo Joe DiMaggio at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Dom wrote a memoir not of his own career but a salute
to the season when his brother hit successfully in 56 games and his
teammate hit .406, the last major leaguer to hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1941, for the fans and players, too, there was a reassuring
quality, a dependability about baseball,'' he wrote. ``We loved
baseball not only for itself but for the secure feeling of
continuity it gave to you. We felt a loyalty to baseball because it
was loyal to us.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his book ``Real Grass, Real Heroes,'' and Ted Williams
wrote the foreword, summing up his ``respect and fondness for Dom''
by saying, ``There is no finer person on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friends might also say that about Orlando Cepeda, Bill
Mazeroski, Mel Harder, and Gil Hodges, all being considered for
Cooperstown. If statistics matter, John B. Holway and Bob Carroll
argue in ``Total Baseball'' that ``Dom was about 90 percent Joe's
size and he was about 90 percent the player Joe was. But 90 percent
of Joe DiMaggio is better than 100 percent of most of the guys
who've drawn major league salaries.''

EDUCATOR STEERS HER OWN COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boys, boys, boys, settle down. Mary didn't mean to hurt your
feelings. She knows you hate being excluded, that you get cranky
when you feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   You're accustomed to making the rules and then along comes Mary
to say that everything is not about you, you, you. It's hard not to
sulk. She knows you're angry, that you've come to the simplistic
conclusion that she's guilty of reverse discrimination because she
refuses to teach you alongside her female students, that you think
she's somehow mistaken Boston College for Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Daly knows exactly where she is. Boston College hasn't
changed much since the Jesuits hired her in 1967. They let women
take classes other than nursing and education now, but the Heights
is in no danger of becoming what John Silber once called his
English Department at Boston University: ``a damned matriarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent of BC's 433 tenured faculty members are women.
Mary Daly is even one of them. But, truth be told, the 70-year-old
philosopher/theologian isn't that grateful. She thinks she earned
it.
</P>
<P>
   She's never known her place, this Mary Daly. Not when she
challenged the tenure game after her own bid was first denied. Not
when she confronted sexism in the Catholic Church in print. Not
when she declared her lesbianism. Not now, when she says BC's
demand that she integrate her classroom is just a ruse to placate
the right wing and get rid of a feminist thorn in its side.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the issues that might ignite a sex discrimination
complaint, isn't it curious the battlefield is a class on
``Feminist Ethics?'' Of all the lawyers that might represent an
aggrieved student, isn't it curious his cause is championed by the
Center for Individual Rights, which has fought affirmative action
policies at universities from Texas to Michigan?
</P>
<P>
   But to suspect a political motive is to be a conspiracy
theorist, says BC spokesman Jack Dunn, who equates Daly's class
with the institutional bias outlawed in Plessy v. Ferguson:
``Separate is inherently unequal. You'd think a professor of her
stature would relish the challenge of teaching men.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't welcome the chance to hear young men harrumph about
male-hating feminazis? Mary Daly does; she's even been known to
convert a few. She doesn't refuse to teach men; she assigns them to
a separate section. BC would have you believe that makes her a
bigot. To the contrary, she's a scholar; the empirical evidence is
on her side. The studies are clear: from grade school to graduate
school, males dominate the classroom. They demand more attention
from teachers and they get it.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that single-sex classes are a cure-all. How could
they be when fewer than 2 percent of college women attend women's
colleges? But there is no mistaking that more graduates of women's
colleges earn advanced degrees, especially in math and science,
than do women from co-ed schools. Even the US Supreme Court, in its
1996 decision in the Virginia Military Institute case, noted that
single-sex education could be legally protected if it serves a
compensatory goal, if its aim is to challenge gender bias, not
institutionalize it. The court could have been describing Mary
Daly's classroom.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the progress women have made in the last 25
years. There is, however, serious denial of how much inequity
remains. Daly's troubles were reported alongside news of a doctor
retaining his medical license despite accusations that he sexually
assaulted female patients; of two cavemen fighting over one
hospitalized woman in an argument that left one man dead; of the
struggle for pay equity in an economy where women earn 74 cents on
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive focus on women's gains ignores the gulf between
legal rights and daily realities. It is one thing to say women have
a right to abortion; it's another to find doctors willing to
perform the procedure in the face of terrorism. It's one thing to
note the number of women in the workplace; it's another to welcome
them into the board room. That gender bias is more subtle than it
once was makes it no less pernicious.
</P>
<P>
   It is Mary Daly's lot to be a radical in timid times. The same
week she stood tall, the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe capitulated
and opened to men what has been a rare academic haven for women for
39 years. It acted out of fear that someday, some man, backed by
some group like the Center for Individual Rights, might sue. Given
the choice, I'll stand with Mary Daly.

KERRY'S TIME IS NOT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; US Senator John F. Kerry's decision last week not to challenge
Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination may prove to
be one of the wisest of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he decided not to run because the impeachment
proceedings cost him precious time he needed in order to develop an
exploratory campaign and raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a fortunate one. For if Kerry had entered the
presidential sweepstakes, it could have been a repeat of another
presidential primary that, in the end, proved a difficult chapter
in Democratic Party history.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry might have found himself in a position similar to that of
fellow Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy, when President
Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection in 1980. Kennedy and his many
supporters saw Carter as vulnerable, if not severely weakened, by
what they considered a lackluster first term.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's supporters, relying on some polls, viewed him as a
sure winner over Carter. They thought Carter would have to pull a
``Lazarus'' _ that is, rise from the politically dead _ to even
have a chance against Kennedy. What they learned was that defeating
an incumbent for the nomination was not as easy as it looked.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did, indeed, resurrect himself that year. He had said of
Kennedy, ``I'll whip his ass'' in the primaries, and he delivered
on that promise. Unfortunately, the bitterness that developed
between the Kennedy and Carter camps _ between the Northern and
Southern Democrats _ contributed significantly to Carter's loss to
Ronald Reagan in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is not the incumbent president, he has many of the
advantages of incumbency. He has been a good and loyal vice
president during his two terms, and he has the strong support of a
still very popular president.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a scandal involving Gore erupts during the campaign, the
nomination is his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   So Kerry's decision not to run is good for both Kerry and Gore.
How former US Senator Bill Bradley's quest for the Democratic
nomination plays out remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley, Gore's only declared rival at this point, loses to
him, it is improbable that he will end up as Gore's running mate in
November 2000. If he makes a poor showing against Gore, he may end
up with nowhere else to go in elective politics. Kerry, on the
other hand, has a better political future in hand.
</P>
<P>
   By not engaging in a bitter primary battle with Gore, Kerry puts
himself squarely in the running to be on the ticket with Gore, and
maybe to be the next vice president.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore loses the 2000 election _ as he could, if he gets mired
in fundraising scandals, an area in which he's already vulnerable _
Kerry's decision not to run will seem even wiser. He, as well as a
host of other Democratic cotenders, will have a clear shot at
whomever is the Republican incumbent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Gore were to win two terms, Kerry, 55, will still be
a lot younger eight years from now than Ronald Reagan was when, at
69, he first won the presidency in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Although the GOP is expected to see several bitter primary
battles before its presidential nominee is finally chosen, the
Democrats cannot afford to lose any momentum with the electorate
between now and the election. They need a non-divisive primary and
a unified front in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats that year will have an opportunity to maintain their
hold on the presidency, recapture the House of Representatives, and
to at least close the gap on the 55-45 GOP majority in the Senate.
The best way to accomplish these goals is by ensuring a strong and
unified backing of the next Democratic nominee _ whether it's Gore,
as expected, or a dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kerry and other ambitious Democrats who have thus far
dropped out of the running for next year's primary, they knew it
was not their time. It may be another four years before they know
whose time it is.

WHAT MAKES GARLIC SMELL SO BAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does our breath smell like garlic days after we've eaten
it, no matter how many times we brush our teeth?
</P>
<P>
   T.A.S., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Eau de garlic emanates not from our mouths but from our
lungs, long after we've eaten the pungent herb and brushed our
teeth for the 15th time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Levitt, chief of research at the Minneapolis
Veterans' Administration Hospital, says he discovered garlic's
sneaky way around our toothbrushes and mouthwash when he developed
the standard test for lactose intolerance. That's the inability of
some people's digestive systems to break down the sugar, called
lactose, that is common in dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have an enzyme, lactase, that breaks down that
particular sugar. In folks who don't, the lactose is broken down
instead by bacteria that live in our digestive system. The
byproduct of that is hydrogen gas. Some of the hydrogen is emitted
as flatus. Some of it makes its way out on our breath.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's test measures the baseline hydrogen content of a
patient's breath before ingesting dairy foods. If the hydrogen in
the breath goes up after a glass of milk, it confirms lactose
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If intestinal gas can get into your blood and breath, why
doesn't your breath doesn't smell the way flatulence does?'' Dr.
Levitt asks rhetorically. He explains that of the various gases in
flatus, the tiny percentage that are offensive (less than 1
percent) are all sulfur-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all poisons if they get into the blood,'' Levitt
says. ``Hydrogen sulfide is one. It's as poisonous as cyanide.''
</P>
<P>
   If those gases got into the bloodstream, you can imagine the
results. So the lining of the intestines has evolved the ability to
metabolize those dangerous sulfurs out of the gas that diffuses
into the blood. Only the safe, non-smelly gasses like hydrogen,
carbon dioxide, and nitrogen can get through to our blood, lungs,
and ultimately our breath.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's garlic. It contains a unique sulfur compound,
allyl methyl sulfide. The body doesn't metabolize it as it diffuses
through the intestinal lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's apparently non-toxic,'' Levitt says. ``This particular
sulfur compound can get into the blood stream and up into the
lungs. That's why we still have garlic breath hours and days after
we've eaten it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does your stomach growl?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Several times a day your gastrointestinal system, triggered
by the hypothalamus in the brain, turns on and off. Eating turns it
on.
</P>
<P>
   Even seeing something you want to eat can get things going. But
at other times, even when you are sound asleep, your autonomic
nervous system is turning your gastrointestinal tract on and off,
so it can work on its four basic jobs: digestion (dissolving and
breaking down food), secretion (squirting out enzymes to help break
down the food), absorption (sending the molecules produced by
digestion into your bloodstream so the body can use them), and
motility (moving things through the system from one end to the
other. Those processes take hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the active state, the stomach muscles contract more
frequently and more powerfully. That causes things in there,
whether solid food, liquid, or even air taken in when you swallow,
to move around. The movement produces vibrations we hear as
growling, or rumbling, or gurgling.
</P>
<P>
   Some people associate a growl with hunger. According to Dr.
Barbara Nath, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital, that could be because we hear the growling sound when the
digestive system is active but the stomach is empty, making us
think the growl is caused by the hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be because during a meal, the stomach is going
through various contractions as it sorts through its contents,
sending liquids and small particles on to the small intestines but
larger particles back up into the stomach for further digestive
breakdown by gastric acids.
</P>
<P>
   But it's myth that the growl is caused by air in an empty
stomach. Dr. Steven Shields, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, says, ``We couldn't tell with a stethoscope
whether you're hungry or full. The noises only tell us whether the
intestinal tract is awake or asleep.''

RAPE? SOUNDS LIKE OUR BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Different reactions are possible to Juanita Broaddrick's
accusation that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978, but stunned
disbelief isn't one of them. No one is sputtering, ``Clinton? Force
himself on someone? Impossible!'' We know by now that with Clinton,
anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In its ``Conventional Wisdom'' box, the March 1 Newsweek gives
Jane Doe No. 5 _ Broaddrick _ a sideways arrow: ``Should have
leveled (unproven) assault charge in '78 or '92. But sounds like
our guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like our guy. Invite himself up to a married woman's
hotel room, shove her on the bed, bite her lip so hard it swells to
twice its size, rip her pantyhose? Yep, sounds like our guy. Agree
to meet Kathleen Willey when she's in a financial crisis, grope
her, force her hand to his crotch, mutter, ``I've wanted to do this
ever since I laid eyes on you''? Sounds like our guy. Send a
trooper to fetch Paula Jones, pull her to the couch, expose himself
and tell her to ``kiss it''? Sounds like our guy.
</P>
<P>
   The president is credibly accused of rape and nobody is shocked.
For more than six years, Americans have been pelted with nonstop
evidence of Clinton's depravity. By now his low character is so
taken for granted _ even by many of those who approve of the way he
handles his job _ that nothing he does retains the power to shock.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not quite true. Americans would be shocked
beyond measure if Clinton were to admit manfully that the latest
awful allegation is true.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, he never admits to the truth. He denies, he
lies, he obfuscates, he perjures himself, he wags his finger at the
TV cameras, he tells his aides and Cabinet secretaries that he is
being set up, he goes to court with meritless claims of privilege,
he goes on ``60 Minutes'' and bites his lip, he sends his wife to
blame it all on vast right-wing conspiracies, he says it depends on
what the meaning of ``is'' is. The truth comes out only as a last
and desperate resort. And not always then.
</P>
<P>
   After 21 years, Broaddrick cannot prove her story (though NBC
News researchers were able to corroborate key supporting details),
and Clinton has not offered an alibi to disprove it. His lawyer,
David Kendall, did offer this: ``Any allegation that the president
assaulted Mrs. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely
false,'' he said in a statement released Friday. ``Beyond that,
we're not going to comment.'' Is that a categorical denial, or one
of those slippery Clintonian dodges? Twenty years ago, you see, her
name was Juanita Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   If the president did rape Juanita Broaddrick in the Camelot
Hotel in 1978, he has every motive to lie about it now. If he
didn't rape her, she would seem to have no motive for falsely
saying he did. The statute of limitations ran out long ago, she is
not filing a civil suit, she disavows any interest in a book deal,
and she can hardly want the notoriety. It must be clear to her that
there is no possibility of Clinton's being punished. And she must
know that people who cross Clinton often get their reputations
slimed and their worst secrets leaked to the press. So what can she
hope to gain?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't hold it in any longer,'' she told NBC's Lisa
Myers. ``I didn't want granddaughters and nieces when they're 21
years old to turn to me and say, `Why didn't you tell what this man
did to you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick sobbed as she spoke those words. The media, by
contrast, have mostly yawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the American public has heard all they want to hear
about this and are saying, you know, `Next. Let's move on to the
next thing.' '' Thus Dan Rather, whose notion of what makes a story
worth covering has apparently changed from the days when he was a
White House correspondent tenaciously dogging Richard Nixon over
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Alter of Newsweek waved off Broaddrick's charge as a
story ``peddled by the same old right-wing enemies of Clinton in
Arkansas.'' Never mind that those old Arkansas enemies of Clinton
turned out to be right about the man's character. In this case, the
accuser was a Clinton supporter, who got in touch with him in the
first place because she thought ``he had a lot of good ideas for
Arkansas.'' The entirety of Newsweek's Broaddrick coverage to date
is the two sentences quoted in the second paragraph above.
</P>
<P>
   And where, in all this, is the feminist sisterhood that flew
into a frenzy when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas _ also after
many years, and with even less proof than Broaddrick has _ of
pestering her for dates and talking about a dirty movie? Where are
the cries of ``I believe Juanita!'' and the angry denunciation of
men who ``just don't get it''? Where are the demands for a
congressional hearing? The seething calls to talk shows?
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath waiting; when it comes to Clinton,
liberal feminists lost their virtue long ago. As long as he
supports their legislative priorities, they don't raise a stink
over his mistreatment of women.
</P>
<P>
   And neither, apparently, does anybody else. This
all-too-believable woman told her devastating story, and it went
straight down the memory hole. He raped you, Juanita? Yeah, sounds
like our guy. But what's your point?

GAS ADDITIVE DEBATED FROM TAHOE TO MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. _ Up here on top of the world, you'd
think it would be tough to spoil the environment. Nothing but
snow-capped granite cliffs surround the town and its famous lake,
with water so clear that you can see a white plate 75 feet
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   But this mountain resort community has become a pollution hot
spot in the rebellion against a new ingredient in gasoline that,
ironically, was supposed to improve the environment. Beneath the
ground, streams of foul-smelling MTBE from tank leaks and pump
spills at gas stations have forced the closure of a third of South
Lake Tahoe's wells, and the plumes are heading for the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, every week, every month that MTBE is in the gas,
our plumes get larger. It's as plain as the nose on your face,''
said Chris Strohm of the South Tahoe Public Utility District, which
is suing just about every company connected with bringing the
chemical additive MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, to town.
``We've been harmed, really harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   From Lake Tahoe to Litchfield, Maine, angry well owners are
cursing the day MTBE was added to gasoline to reduce air pollution,
in what some are calling a classic case of the law of unintended
consequences. Though MTBE is less toxic than the chemicals it
replaced, MTBE spreads more swiftly when spilled, giving water a
turpentine taste and odor at low concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   At least traces of MTBE have reached thousands of wells and
surface water supplies across the country, including 137 in New
Hampshire, 23 in Massachusetts, and more than 100 in Maine. Though
most contamination is low, some wells have had to close. A
Glenville, Calif., couple blame their flu-like symptoms, seizures,
and asthma attacks on MTBE in their well that is more than 250
times above the federal health advisory level.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a federal panel in Boston considers the future of MTBE,
horror stories such as Lake Tahoe's and Glenville's are providing
momentum to get rid of MTBE only four years after its debut in
cleaner-burning ``reformulated gas'' that is sold in 20 states,
including most of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Maine regulators decided last week to sharply reduce MTBE in its
gas this summer, and California Governor Gray Davis, pushed by
Tahoe politicians, is under pressure to phase out MTBE entirely. In
Washington, key senators in both parties are suggesting a two-year
waiver of the federal law that greatly increased the use of MTBE in
gas.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of MTBE say their product is a victim of hysteria,
such as irresponsible claims that the chemical causes cancer when
the evidence is limited to questionable animal studies. Reports
that MTBE fumes cause nausea or other symptoms have not panned out
in large-scale studies, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal view is . . . that MTBE is going to prove in
retrospect to have been a tremendous set of concerns over something
which in fact did not justify it,'' said Jonathan Borak, associate
clinical professor of medicine and public health at Yale University
who consults for the leading MTBE maker, Lyondell Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the exact toxicity of MTBE may not be the most important
issue _ everyone agrees it is toxic at some level. Daniel
Greenbaum, who chairs the federal blue-ribbon panel studying MTBE,
said most people speaking to his group seem most concerned that
``this is an unknown substance and, when it gets into the drinking
water, it has a foul odor and a taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said he thinks that promoters of MTBE _ he was one
when he was Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
commissioner _ helped create the controversy by introducing MTBE to
40 percent of US gasoline before its health and environmental
effects were widely understood.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Greenbaum said, MTBE may be remembered as ``the
perfect case study in how not to introduce a new product.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Lake Tahoe _ land of ruddy-cheeked skiers,
postcard views, and swank casinos just over the Nevada line _ is an
unlikely seat of environmental rebellion. At 6,229 feet above sea
level, Tahoe seems to be a playground away from the troubles of the
world below.
</P>
<P>
   But residents are aware of their fragile environment, attracting
President Clinton in 1997 for a forum on contaminants that reduce
the lake's clarity. When MTBE started reaching wells, people
displayed bumper stickers that read, ``Help Make Tahoe MTBE Free.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Tahoe was a sitting duck for MTBE, which
refiners began adding to South Tahoe gas in large quantities in
1996 as an ``oxygenate'' to boost the fuel's octane level. Unlike
the other ingredients in gas, MTBE dissolved in water, allowing it
to move swiftly in ground water.
</P>
<P>
   In South Tahoe, MTBE did not have to go far to reach wells. With
little land flat enough for development, gas stations were built
practically atop aquifers, which were not far underground to begin
with. By 1997, MTBE began reaching wells after even minor spills
such as over-filling a gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before MTBE, we had leaks at gas stations, but we really
didn't have any impacts to ground water,'' said Lisa Dernbach,
geologist at the state Regional Water Quality Control Board, who
now spends much of her time working with gas stations to control
the spread of MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   South Tahoe Public Utility District ordered wells closed as soon
as MTBE was detected rather than waiting for the concentration to
reach the federal health advisory level. But water manager Rick
Hydrick saw the 13 well shutdowns as a fire wall against an
escalating problem. Twenty of the 26 gas stations in South Tahoe
and neighboring Meyers have spilled MTBE into the ground water
already, and 11 MTBE plumes were bearing down on South Tahoe's
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of the best-quality ground water in the world,
but there's a million ways, it seems, that these releases can
occur,'' said Hydrick, who estimated the district has spent $2
million on MTBE cleanup and related costs. ``That's why the
district wants MTBE out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, concern over MTBE in Lake Tahoe spurred officials to
ban personal watercrafts and other boats with polluting two-stroke
engines. Though other chemicals in gas are a bigger health problem,
MTBE spreads most widely, showing up at drinking water intake
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE industry officials, led by Houston-based Lyondell, agree
that Tahoe's problems are real, but say they should not be used to
discredit their product, which has brought measurably cleaner air
to regions such as New England.
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell officials say the contamination of South Tahoe's water
has more to do with the national problem of leaking underground
storage tanks than MTBE itself, while polluting motorboats _ not
MTBE _ should be blamed for the lake pollution. Wherever MTBE shows
up, the industry argues, other chemicals in gasoline will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to educate the public that gasoline is a dangerous
substance that belongs in cars and doesn't belong in our ground
water,'' said Lyondell spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the petro-chemical industry pushed MTBE on the
nation, even though companies knew the risk to water supplies.
Several of the six lawsuits filed against the makers or
distributors of MTBE, South Tahoe's included, argue that the
industry knew by 1986 about the risk to water from MTBE, but
marketed the product as an environmental improvement anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry knew this was coming and yet did nothing to avoid
the problem,'' said South Tahoe's attorney Victor Sher, who is
seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages from MTBE makers,
refineries, and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE industry officials regard some of these lawsuits as little
more than harassment, especially a lawsuit filed on behalf of two
Maine well owners that targets industry representatives. MTBE is no
more defective than other ingredients in gas, argue MTBE makers,
and the refiners who bought MTBE were told of its water solubility.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say federal regulations, not industry coercion,
opened the door for widespread use of MTBE. Senator Thomas A.
Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat, led the charge for the rule,
not to help the oil industry but in hopes that a rival product made
from corn, called ethanol, would be widely used to increase the
octane of reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most refiners chose MTBE, derived from natural gas,
because it was less expensive and easier to transport.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if MTBE makers win the legal debate, they are
losing the political one. California has seen such a proliferation
of MTBE contamination cases _ and a major study suggesting MTBE is
not worth the cost _ that legislators say they can pass a ban on
MTBE if Governor Davis does not do it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick MTBE out of California now!'' demanded Senator Tim
Leslie, who represents Lake Tahoe, at a rally last week.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even ARCO, the oil company that invented MTBE, is
calling for its removal from gasoline, as long as the government
finds an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand where the public is coming from and the public
perception is that MTBE is bad and it's time to look for something
different,'' said ARCO spokesman Paul Langland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the blue-ribbon panel that meets at the Hyatt Regency
Harborside in Boston must decide whether cleaner air is worth the
water risk for the rest of the country. The issue could be tougher
in the Northeast than California, since cars need more of an octane
boost in cold weather, but the pressure for action on MTBE is
growing here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real challenge to figure out what is the right
answer,'' said Greenbaum. ``We're just starting to get our teeth
into that.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOJAVE, Calif. _ This morning, at the oversized airport of this
small desert town, the doors of a huge hangar will rumble open, and
an odd-looking craft _ picture a 63-foot-tall white megaphone _
will slowly roll into view before a crowd that should vastly
outnumber Mojave's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The craft is a test vehicle for a new kind of rocket that its
supporters hope will mark a dramatic advance in space-age history,
opening up the space frontier to regular, routine travel for
tourism and commerce in much the same way that the DC-3 opened up
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the innovative Roton rocket could turn out to be
more like Howard Hughes's famous 219-foot seaplane of 1947, the
Spruce Goose: a cutting-edge attempt to push the boundaries of
aviation technology that never quite got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is rocket science,'' said Edward Crawley, head of
the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. The Roton design is ``an interesting
concept,'' he said, but many aerospace engineers question whether
it is even possible to build a rocket that can make it into orbit
with a single stage, as the Roton is planned to do. ``The
detractors say you'll never be able to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Kyger, a spokesman for Universal Space Lines, a company
that hopes to operate a fleet of commercial, reusable spacecraft,
is much more optimistic. ``I think it's brilliant,'' he said of the
Roton design, adding that he thinks it is the likeliest to succeed
of the many concepts being touted for single-stage-to-orbit
rockets. His company hopes to use rockets built either by one of
its own subsidiaries or bought from another company. The Roton's
component parts, he pointed out, are ``all off-the-shelf or pretty
low-tech, but they're put together in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle unveiled Monday is not, in fact, a rocket at all.
It's really the world's most peculiar helicopter, designed to test
the structure and the landing system of the planned Roton rocket.
In that sense, it is like the original space shuttle Enterprise, a
test vehicle without rocket engines that was used to try out the
shuttle's landing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year or early next, a new prototype version that
includes the actual rocket motors will undergo its first tests. If
all goes well, the California-based Rotary Rocket company, builders
of the unique craft, hope to begin regular commercial
satellite-launching service to space by the end of next year _
without a dime of government funding.
</P>
<P>
   If they accomplish that feat, it will be the first launch
vehicle ever built entirely with private financing _ and the first
to reach orbit and return without discarding any parts.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the key to the hopes of this company _ and a few
others working on related plans _ to bring about a drastic
reduction in the cost of flying into space by building totally
reusable rockets. As Rotary Rocket's chief engineer, Dan DeLong,
put it, comparing the cost of throwaway rockets with that of
commercial aviation, ``the ticket is cheaper if you don't throw the
747 away after every flight.''
</P>
<P>
   While several other companies are also struggling to develop
totally reusable spacecraft, Roton is the only one that has raised
substantial private capital _ at least $30 million so far, $1
million of it from author Tom Clancy _ to develop a truly visionary
new craft. The company says it needs a total of $150 million to
inaugurate commercial service.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is strongly
supportive. Administrator Daniel Goldin has said that he aims for
the agency to get out of the rocket-building business and hopes
that new rockets will be designed and built by private companies so
that the national space program can simply order them like any
other customer.
</P>
<P>
   In a strong show of support, NASA's chief engineer was the
keynote speaker at the grand unveiling of the Roton ATV-1 test
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other companies with enough money to do
substantial development work on new types of rockets, and their
approaches are all very different. Aerospace mega-company
Lockheed-Martin won a $941 million NASA contract in 1996 to design
and build a test vehicle for another version of a
single-stage-to-orbit craft, but that project, called the X-33,
will not lead to a craft that can actually make it to orbit. That
would fall to a followup called VentureStar, which would cost at
least $5 billion more to develop _ money few observers think will
be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The other two companies, both startups, are aiming to develop
lower-cost alternatives. Kistler Aerospace, which has already spent
$250 million and says it needs $500 million more, plans to use
conventional two-stage throwaway rockets outfitted with parachutes
and airbags so they can be recovered and reused . And Beal
Aerospace, funded with $250 million from founder Andrew Beal's
personal fortune, aims to design simple, cheap throwaway rockets.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Roton as the only new rocket that aims to fly to
space and back in one piece. If it succeeds, space flight might
finally catch up to science-fiction's early visions, making it
possible to reach orbit inexpensively, routinely and on short
notice in a craft that, as in the old movies, takes off and lands
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about the only resemblance the Roton has to any other
rocket, real or fictional. Both its rocket engines and its landing
system are quite unlike anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The design is the brainchild of self-taught aerospace engineer
Gary Hudson, president of Rotary Rocket, who has been pushing the
idea of single-stage-to-orbit rockets for three decades. The
company's name is indeed apt: Both its takeoff and landing rely on
motors that spin furiously, like whirling dervishes.
</P>
<P>
   The takeoff is to be propelled by something like a huge
Catherine wheel: a disk of 72 small rocket nozzles spinning at 720
revolutions per minute. The disk will be spun up by a turntable on
the launch pad, and then will continue spinning as the rockets fire
because each nozzle is slightly tilted to the side.
</P>
<P>
   The spinning is an ingenious way around one of the biggest
engineering challenges of rocket design: pumping fuel to the
engines at a prodigious rate. Other rockets require high-tech,
expensive, heavy turbopumps, but in the Roton the fuel will be
pulled into the engine by the centrifugal force of the spinning
22-foot diameter wheel. In a sense, the whole engine is one big
pump.
</P>
<P>
   No, the pilot and passenger aboard the Roton won't be getting
hopelessly dizzy. The body of the rocket will not spin. It will be
connected to the spinning engines through an off-the-shelf
commercial thrust bearing, the same kind used to attach the
propellers of large ships.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the craft will open its payload bay doors and its
cargo satellite will slide out to be released in orbit. Then, the
rocket will fire small thrusters to begin its reentry.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the other unique rotating aspect of the flight: a set
of helicopter blades, until then folded snugly along the sides of
the rocket, will pop out into position, allowing the craft to make
a slow, gentle landing on the same pad where it took off. In an
emergency, it would be able to land on any convenient hard surface,
just like a helicopter _ only with its rotors powered by small
rocket thrusters at its tips.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is used to facing a lot of skepticism. From the
beginning, he said, many engineers doubted such a vehicle was even
possible, much less practical. But that has begun to change, thanks
to a combination of technical progress and various engineering
studies showing different approaches that could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1990, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rocketdyne, and General
Dynamics all proposed single-stage vehicles'' as part of NASA's
competition for its X-33 project to develop a prototype, Hudson
pointed out. And others, including Hudson, have done analyses that
show that even some present rockets and rocket engines, combined in
slightly different configurations, could make it to orbit in a
single stage right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it remarkable that engineers still argue about whether
single-stage to orbit is possible,'' Hudson said. ``I have very
little doubt that this vehicle, right out of the box, will make it
to orbit in a single stage,'' although possibly with less payload
capacity than the 3 1/2 tons the company now hopes to be able to
carry _ at a record low price of $7 million per launch. Additional
boosters could be strapped on to increase its capacity without
drastically affecting its costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lurio, a Boston-area aerospace engineer and longtime
booster of low-cost launch vehicles, thinks making the system work
as planned will be a definite challenge. But if it does work, he
said, it will revolutionize the space business.
</P>
<P>
   One strong point in Roton's favor is that its design lends
itself to a cautious, one-step-at-a-time development process during
which any obstacles can be worked out at relatively low cost.
``They're taking an excellent approach in terms of their
incremental development,'' Lurio said.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem, he said, is convincing investors it has enough
of a chance of success to be worth the gamble. Lurio is convinced
that new designs can achieve at least a tenfold reduction in the
cost of access to space _ but only if someone can break through the
logjam of skepticism and raise the needed funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gary succeeds, then the Gordian knot has been cut,'' he
said. ``But there are other alternatives if this one doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Crawley agrees that the potential impact of a new system
like the Roton is enormous. ``The economics of spaceflight are so
sensitive to the launch costs that whoever builds a system that
reduces the launch costs will immediately get almost all the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Roton or one of its competitors can achieve a significant
reduction, he said _ even if is far less than the company expects _
``everybody in the world would go to them.''

ON THE ROAD WITH PRISSY MR. FUSSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (With apologies to Roger Hargreaves, creator of Mr. Fussy, Mr.
Nonsense, Mr. Busy, and 42 other delightful children's book
characters.)
</P>
<P>
   Mr.Fussy is going on a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy is very upset, because he has been delayed. In Mr.
Fussy's ideal world, there would be no weather, not even any
sunshine. Because we now know that sunshine is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy made his airline reservations three months ahead of
time. When the lady on the phone inquired ``Where would you like to
sit?'' she said that the whole plane was still available. Mr. Fussy
was very happy to be ahead of the crowd, and booked his favorite
window seat.
</P>
<P>
   Since 10 weeks remained for the airline to prepare him a special
meal, the lady asked if he had any ``dietary concerns.'' Yes, I'm
too fat, he felt like saying, but he knew that wasn't what the lady
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy keeps his dozen or so Frequent Flyer membership cards
in a neat little stack on his bureau, and he had the 600-digit
number/letter/ideograph sequence ready when the lady asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mr. Fussy called the hotel. This was less exciting than it
might have been, a., because it was a Holiday Inn, and b., because
he remembered seeing it on previous visits, and it was shaped like
a stack of concrete pancakes. Was that ``architectural modernism''?
Mr. Fussy wasn't sure. The young man asked if he wanted a room that
smelled like tar, nicotine, and phlegm, or another kind of room.
Even for Mr. Fussy, that wasn't a hard choice.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion with the rental car agent was brief. Mr. Fussy
knew that even the fussiest of travelers get euchred by the rental
car companies. He got euchred.
</P>
<P>
   Nine weeks before leaving, Mr. Fussy decided to call some old
friends at his destination. ``Mr. Fussy! How nice to hear from
you!'' they said. They had no idea where they'd be nine weeks hence
_ they were Californians _ but if they were in town, they'd be
delighted to see him!
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy remembered Being Young. He recalled the time when he
had nowhere to go during spring break, so he and his college
roommates drove out to Oklahoma to see a friend. Straight through,
of course, on coffee and No-Doz. Then Mr. Fussy hitchhiked back to
Smoky Mountain National Park and climbed Mount Leconte in his
sneakers, which wasn't very smart. He woke up covered with snow. As
a grown-up, Mr. Fussy would have been better prepared _ had
sensible shoes! But, Mr. Fussy reflected sadly, as a grown-up, he
wouldn't have climbed a 6,600-foot-tall mountain just because he
felt like it . . .
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, eight weeks before leaving, Mr. Fussy
decided to set up a few interviews at his destination. Some people
just laughed. Some people didn't return his calls. Some people
said, ``Sure, I'll put you on my calendar, but give me a number in
case I get called away to Hawaii, ha, ha!'' These people didn't
lead orderly, planned lives, and deep down Mr. Fussy felt a little
bit contemptuous of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before leaving, Mr. Fussy started to pack. If only
weather reports functioned several weeks in advance, he would know
what to wear. So he packed for any eventuality. Mr. Fussy knew that
in some of their friends' households, the wife packed for the
husband. But Mr. Fussy didn't want his wife packing for him. (The
feeling was mutual.) Suppose Mrs. Fussy accidentally packed the
Gore-Tex-lined Glide floss, which didn't generate the necessary
friction against his tooth enamel, instead of the mint-flavored
waxed floss? Or put in Crest instead of Sensodyne? (Mr. Fussy was
very, very fussy about his teeth.)
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose Mrs. Fussy forgot to include his earplugs, or his
bewildering array of allergy pills and asthma medications? You
never know when you might encounter a barking dog, or a shedding
cat. Eight years previously, Finnair had lost Mr. Fussy's luggage
(vanished into Finnair!) and forced him to survive for a week in
St. Petersburg without his medicines. Oddly, Mr. Fussy did just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Thank heavens that Mrs. F. and the children were staying at
home. Especially the children. They weren't at all fussy about
packing. Sometimes they even left their toothbrushes and floss and
mouthwash at home, during an entire vacation! And when Mr. and Mrs.
Fussy called this to their attention, they didn't care! How strange
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Bon voyage, Mr. Fussy!

   TAKE-BOS  
 RIVIERA APUANA, Italy: ... and Mirandolese.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concordiese provides a difficult test in the opener. They seem
to have inherited some of the Count's ability to defend and present
paradoxes. Such teams are accustomed to confronting physically
superior opposition, and they retain their composure and
organization. Moore's perfectly placed free kick from 25 yards
decides the match in the 27th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mirandolese is reinforced by Giuseppe Accardi, who played for
Inter and Torino, and 43-year-old midfielder Carlo Trevisanello,
who had a 23-year career, mostly with Ascoli and Verona. A 0-0 tie
is sufficient for the Revolution to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, everyone returned to the Hotel San Silvestro for a
banquet. Former Inter player and Italian national team assistant
coach Sergio Brighenti and others pay tribute to Zenga and Ragazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great experience to watch these excellent athletes,''
Ragazzi said. ``I welcome you to this magic place, Emilia Romagna,
home of tagliatella, mountains, and beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, Zenga is arm-in-arm with the emcee and
Ragazzi in a rendition of a song by Nomadi (Nomads), accompanied by
an electric synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   Accardi, a Sicilian who now works in management for Torino
Sportivo, and Brighenti are surprised that Zenga has become a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined him more as a general manager than a coach,''
Accardi said. ``But goalkeepers can be very good coaches. Look at
(Italian national team coach) Dino Zoff. Yes, he can be a very good
coach. He can do everything, because he is very intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, he was a phenomenon. For 10 years, he was the
best goalkeeper in the world. He has incredible character, a great
personality. Athletically, he was a phenomenon, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, Italy was the best team in the world. The team lost
to Argentina. But they way (Zenga) played, and the way the team
played, they deserved to win. Why didn't they? Sometimes, soccer is
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   When Italy hosted the World Cup, the national team was expected
to take the title. The Azzurri players included some strong
personalities, such as Gianluca Vialli, who soon was excluded from
the team but continued to excel on the field and now has become a
successful player/coach in England. Zenga, also, soon was removed
from the team, though he continued to excel at the club level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to find a coach who also has interests outside
of soccer,'' Brighenti said. ``Vialli is also an excellent coach,
but to become this he had to change. And Walter also has had to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible for them to do this in Italy, because
you need a coaching license. You can't just become a coach like
that. I would say that in the US, soccer is a little more of an
amateur affair. In England, too, you do not need a coaching
license. But Vialli is an exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vialli was temperamental, a real battler with a lot of grit.
Walter also had a lot of personality as goalkeeper, like Dino Zoff.
But Zoff was taciturn, he allowed no distractions, was always
concentrating on soccer, always studying the opposition and the
game. Walter was the same, on the field. But off the field, he was
extroverted, always dreaming about affairs extra-calcistica
(outside soccer). I really didn't think either one would want to
become a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution players study the scene like cultural
anthropologists who have discovered an exotic species. They are
weary, and want to rest up for the next afternoon's match.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the audience, Julian Horbury is probably the most
unhappy. Zenga gave an unsatisfactory interview to Futbol Mondial
and, after the game in Mirandola, had the nerve to order away his
cameraman, said Horbury, a producer for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga is much more comfortable with Italian journalists. That
night, a television interview included some esoteric and inane
questioning about Modena's volleyball team. Zenga did not seem to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The next day's game is in Modena, home of balsamic vinegar,
Ferrari, Maserati, Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution midfielder Jesse Van Saun had played here seven years
ago, recruited by the Brooklyn Italians for the Enzo Ferrari
tournament, along with Giovanni Savarese's younger brother, Ugo.
They defeated Sampdoria's youth team and advanced to the
semifinals. And they had time to visit the Ferrari museum. The
Revolution settle for a plastic model Ferrari, a gift from the auto
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are joined on the bench by Giuseppe Galderisi, an
original member of the team. Galderisi seems to fit in well, a good
foil for Zenga, who is not only player/coach, but also tour
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Revolution need me, I would be happy to help them,''
said Galderisi, who is taking coaching courses at Coverciano,
headquarters of the Italian federation.
</P>
<P>
   Modena wins the match, 3-1, as the Revolution surrender a late
first-half goal on a mixup involving non-roster goalkeeper Anthony
Latronica, then fail to carry out their ``pressing'' tactics in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't into their season, yet, so their conditioning is
not at optimal level,'' said Modena's Fausto Pari, a former Zenga
teammate at Sampdoria. ``But the level of American soccer in
general is improving, judging from the play of the national team.
They need to have more professional teams, play more outside
competition, to improve their level of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the number of players you have, it can only grow. But
it's a different culture, and to arrive at the top, you have to
adopt the right mentality. It's a good level, as they showed here.
They did not win, but at this stage of training, it's normal. I
talked to Walter before the game, and he said he is using this
month away from the US purely as preparation for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation continues in Sicily this week. The Revolution
then return here, hopefully improved and prepared to face a higher
level of opposition. They return to Boston March 17.

STORYTELLER FINDS LIFE AMONG THE ASHES OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ His business card says Caretaker &AMP; Historian,
but he's more than that. Much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the painter, the gardener, the maintenance man, the
inurnment man,'' Emmitt Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Inurnment? ``I put the ashes in the urns,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is the caretaker of the San Francisco Columbarium, the
101-year-old building that is home to the ashes of about 30,000
people. For 12 years, he has not only kept the place looking good,
he has kept the stories of the dead alive and kept the living
feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak for the dead,'' he said. ``Nobody speaks for the
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 43, said his career as the columbarium storyteller began
out of curiosity _ who were all these dead people and who were the
people who came to visit them, he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when people come and I don't know them, I follow them
to see where they go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he waits until the next time they come and approaches them,
gets to talking and learns their stories _ why one man is contained
in a W.C. Fields piggy bank and another in a silver martini shaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bring a little life with death, instead of just a
tombstone with the name and date of death, which is so sad,'' he
said. ``Cemeteries are very cold and sad. This place would be the
same way if I didn't learn the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson has nicknames for his favorite occupants of the domed,
neoclassical building _ the Gambler, the Jazz Singer, the Ocean
Hero, the Greedy Man (inurned with his son, daughter, first wife
and second wife).
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is full of history,'' he said. ``All the streets
you see in San Francisco _ Taylor, Post, Folsom, Eddy _ they're
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The columbarium was once surrounded by a 167-acre cemetery. But
as San Francisco expanded, city planners decided they needed the
land for homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, a law was passed putting an end to cremations within
city limits. Nine years later, the city banned burials altogether.
Over the next decade, it undertook the slow process of transferring
the bodies to other cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   From 1934 to 1979, the columbarium was forgotten, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were raccoons running around, pigeons roosting in empty
niches, mushrooms growing out of cracks,'' he said. ``It was
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Neptune Society purchased it in 1980, Watson was hired
with a crew of men to paint the outside. The manager saw he was a
good worker and hired him to paint the inside. Then he hired him as
the maintenance man and he's been there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is married and has two sons, 18 and 22, who have both
worked summers at the columbarium. One quit when he couldn't get
promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The columbarium has been almost completely restored and its
6,000 or so niches are 90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   The most inexpensive rate is a flat fee of $1,600 for a
community niche, which fits about a dozen urns. Individual niches
cost up to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have grand plans for the landmark building. They have
broken ground for a new office and will build an 8-foot marble and
granite wall around the perimeter of the grounds to hold another
6,000 niches. They hope to complete work in about 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the restoration work is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has taken on the time-consuming task of painting the
architectural details and moldings in different color schemes using
a paintbrush ``the size you use to do your eyebrows.''
</P>
<P>
   He has put less time into the domed ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part is so far you can't see the ugliness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is so intimately familiar with the space that no detail
goes unnoticed. He knows he is unusual and he's an old hand with
the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done CNN, `Evening Magazine,''' he said. ``I've still got
``Dateline.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he was motivated to tell stories of the dead by the
smiles he brings to the living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I put somebody in the wall, I adopt them as part of
my family,'' he said.

A NEW SPIN ON AIR PASSENGERS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Year weekend's snafu at Detroit Metropolitan Airport has
spawned more than horror stories about passengers imprisoned for
hours on snowbound Northwest Airlines jets, unable to take off and
unable to return to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   It has given rise to a seeming stampede of politicians trying to
enact legislation ensuring that passengers on commercial airlines
will be treated with a modicum of respect. And that political
frenzy has caused considerable angst in airline boardrooms, and in
lobbyists' offices in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would put this in as a shot across their bow and
it may go nowhere,'' says US Representative Bud Shuster, a
Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure and the author of the so-called
``Airline Passenger Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, boy, we struck a raw nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   While high-ranking federal aviation officials say privately that
the so-called passenger rights movement smacks of demagoguery, and
airline officials say it offers simplistic _ and expensive _ fixes
to a very complex system, it has resonated with the millions of
Americans who have had, at one time or another, a less than
pleasant experience dealing with airlines.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, never have so many Americans been angry at the
airlines; consumer complaints rose 25 percent last year. Of course,
never have so many passengers been flying. Last year, some 608
million people flew, up from 275 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to how consumers are treated, ``There are
practices tolerated in the airline industry that are not tolerated
in any other American industry, and that is quite odd because this
is supposed to be a service industry,'' says Paul Dempsey, a
professor of law and director of the Transportation Law Program at
the University of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   At least three bills _ two of which are already slated for a
hearing next month _ have been introduced; the Senate version is
sponsored by US Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, and John
McCain, an Arizona Republican, who is the powerful chairman of the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. There is
Schuster's bill, and a second House bill, sponsored by US
Representative John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is a ranking
member of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While they vary somewhat, the three bills would give consumers
protection against common problems ranging from getting bumped from
oversold flights to having baggage lost for days. The two House
bills would impose penalties on airlines for flights delayed more
than two hours, raising concerns that some safety issues may be
overlooked in order to avoid a hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bills would legislate some ticket pricing by
permitting the use of splitting two round-trip tickets that include
a Saturday night, to avoid paying higher midweek fares. They would
also provide better information about airline frequent-flier seat
availability (something airlines tend to consider proprietary) and
about why planes are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that hearings are scheduled on the bills suggests that
``this is not some frivolous thing,'' says former US senator Alan
Simpson, director of Harvard's Institute of Politics at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw they could put together a Taxpayers Bill of Rights
with the IRS, and this may take a while _ nothing may happen this
session _ but there is enough real stuff out there to create honest
interest in this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of celebrating just completing a year in which there
was not a single fatality on a commercial airline, the industry is
sweating over a looming battle that many believe will lead to
higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   While the Air Transport Association, the trade group
representing the major airlines, has yet to take a position on the
bills, spokesman David Fuscus says, ``I don't think you really want
the government in customer service, and pricing is probably not a
good place for them to be in. Tickets are 36 percent less expensive
than they were 20 years ago,'' he says. (The industry was
deregulated in 1978).
</P>
<P>
   And at least one major passenger group agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicans are trying to attack indirectly what they
should attack directly _ the lack of competition and the
alternatives for passengers,'' says David Stempler, president of
the Washington-based Air Travelers Association. ``Secondly, we are
fearful that when the heavy hand of government comes in, we, as
passengers, will end up paying for it at the end of the day. The
law enacted most frequently in this town is the law of unintended
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Stempler says much of the hostility directed at the airline
industry these days stems from airplanes being more crowded. The
days of having the middle seat empty and a lunch or dinner served
on a flight to Chicago seem like a pleasant memory.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Dempsey, unlike other purchases, buying an airline
ticket does not give someone the opportunity to inspect the product
before purchasing it. ``You don't know until the plane leaves, if
it will depart on time; you don't know if it will be clean, if the
food will be edible, whether the flight attendants will be surly,
or if you will be seated in the middle between two obese human
beings in palm tree T-shirts and poor hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stempler notes that ``airlines are not immune from the
environment that we are all generally experiencing in the '90s _
the pressure and tension of time. Everyone is under pressure, that
is why there is so much road rage, and then you have this crowding
of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only time I can remember as much discontent was in the
days of air traffic control when planes were circling over cities
waiting to land. We resolved that with flow control, and hopefully,
the marketplace will solve some of the current problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FAA, nor the Department of Transportation, which
have oversight over the airline industry, have taken positions on
the proposed legislation. The department tracks passenger
complaints regarding airlines on everything from problems with the
flight to smoking. And although complaints in 1998 were up 25
percent over 1997 _ a fact politicians like Shuster use to bolster
their arguments _ the number of passengers who file complaints is
still relatively small. Of the 608 million passengers who flew last
year, 9,606 of them took the time to file formal complaints with
the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bills are just not well thought out,'' says Darryl
Jenkins, executive director of the Aviation Institute at George
Washington University and a professor of airline management. He
says he's never seen a time when so many people are angry at the
airlines, and ``the airlines need to do something, but these bills
are not a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says all the bills indicate a lack of understanding of
the complexity of the airline industry as well as the flexibility
it requires. Something as seemingly innocuous as the requirement to
announce to would-be passengers that a flight is oversold is
fraught with difficulty. Most flights are not oversold until the
day before the flight. Sophisticated computer programs record the
flight history and can predict quite well how much a flight can be
technically oversold _ but still, on the day of travel, have enough
room for everyone, because some people don't show up at the gate.
Such practices help keep prices down, by helping ensuring that all
seats are filled.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, says Jenkins, if a flight crew going to Asia
realizes on the day of its departure that a storm in the Pacific
will increase the amount of head winds the flight will encounter, a
plane that is not technically oversold, but simply full, becomes
oversold because it will have to use more fuel and weigh less to
arrive safely.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the causes of delays seems to be a good idea, Jenkins
says, because about 65 percent of all delays are caused by the
antiquated air traffic control system. ``If they inform passengers
accurately and truthfully about delays, the pilot will say, `This
delay is brought to you by the US Government,' maybe then Congress
will finally update the air traffic control system.''
</P>
<P>
   But fining airlines for delays raises troubling safety concerns,
according to aviation specialists. Take the case of a flight that
has gone through de-icing, and then has to wait 30 minutes before
it can take off. By that time, the pilot might well think it is
prudent to pull out of the takeoff queue and get de-iced again. But
if the airline has to pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines to
passengers because of the delay that causes, will the crew gamble
with the flight's safety?
</P>
<P>
   ``We never argue about the blacks and whites of safety,'' says
Stempler. ``It is the gray area in the middle that you have to
worry about. And you can't legislate against stupidity or bad
decisions, and that is really what happened in Detroit. They made
bad decisions.''

TRAINING IN ITALY A KICK FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA APUANA, Italy _ All is quiet in the big resorts. It is
fuori stagione (offseason), and nearly everything is empty in Forte
dei Marmi and neighboring Cinquale, except for the 50-room,
four-star Hotel Undulna, named for a poem by Gabriele D'Annunzio,
favorite son of the Versilia area.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach/goaltender Walter Zenga has booked the hotel,
which was built with the marble of Massa Carrara, Michelangelo's
favorite site, at low rates for the team's preseason training.
There is a new practice facility nearby, and Zenga has persuaded
the construction crew to build a ramp for hill training. There are
several professional teams in the area to provide competition, and
Zenga knows the coaches and directors, and the shortcuts to the
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the team goes, Zenga's friends and former teammates
appear. Fans of all ages request autographs and pose for pictures
with Zenga. In Modena, the Inter club is named for Zenga, and
hundreds arrive for the midweek afternoon exhibition, mostly to pay
tribute to him. After another game, a newspaper notes that fans
were disappointed because Zenga did not play (he stuck to coaching
duties that night) and his fiancee, Hoara Borselli, did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the games are essentially glorified training sessions.
Soccer is ritualistic in Italy, and the club games that draw the
most interest are weekend matches between eternal rivals.
</P>
<P>
   One Revolution practice was attended by Marcello Lippi, former
coach of Napoli and Juventus and heir apparent at Inter. This
impressed a reporter from Il Resto del Carlino of Bologna, who
noted, ``One Lippi watching your team is better than a thousand
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were curious about the Revolution. They wondered why the
team was called ``New England'' instead of ``Boston,'' and
newspaper accounts often referred to the team as the ``Boston New
England Revolution di Zenga.'' But they judged the team on merit.
Joe-Max Moore and Leighton O'Brien impressed observers with their
touch. When nonroster forward Ze Rodrigues dribbled past three
defenders in Modena, a journalist shouted, ``Would you look at
that. He's dancing with the ball and they can't touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the reviews were less enthusiastic. Said one, ``The
team has three players from the `stelle e strisce' (Stars and
Stripes, or national team), but evidently this is not enough to
give it a clear identity. If this formation plays in the top level,
we would venture to say that the Serie A of Uncle Sam is comparable
to our high amateur divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was after the Revolution's only victory of the first
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The preseason is still young, though, and Zenga is concentrating
on organizing the team's defensive schemes. The Revolution won only
once but remained in contention in all but one of their first six
matches. They have displayed enough spirit and ability to provide
hope for the Major League Soccer regular season, which begins March
28 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's jelling, everyone looks sharp,'' defender Richard
Goulooze said. ``Everyone realizes that last year was everyone's
responsibility. Everyone realizes that they have to work as hard as
possible. It's a good atmosphere. Walter wants everyone to take
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, Walter stops everything and tells you what he
wants. His English is not perfect but you can tell what he means.
He tells us to work hard and be proud, don't give up goals. And
don't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the team took a bus ride through the Apuane Alps
on Superstrada A12 north. Outside Parma, there are several
spray-painted signs of separatists seeking to establish the state
of Padana.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1/2 hours, the Revolution arrive in a town of 30,000
known to Renaissance buffs as the home of Giovanni Pico, count of
Mirandola and Concordia, an adviser to the Medicis once described
as ``precocious disputant and aristocratic mystic, enchanted
scholar.'' In 1486, Pico challenged the world to a public debate
upon 900 theses in Rome, but ``so many seemed likely to be
paradoxes against the true faith, too brilliantly defended, that
the Pope forbade the contest,'' according to E.V. Lucas. ``He
dabbled in the black arts, wrote learnedly on Mosaic law, was an
amorous poet in Italian, a serious poet in Latin, and in everything
he did was interesting and curious, steeped in Renaissance culture,
inspired by a wish to reconcile past and present and humanize
Christ and Fathers . . . He gave most of his fortune to a fund for
marriage portions for penniless girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution arrived at Stadio Libero Locci, a 1920s
construction in the grand Mussolini style with Roman columns
supporting a cantilevered covering for the stands. The columns give
the 5,000-capacity stadium a classy feel but block the view from
the press box.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament is sponsored by Cesare Ragazzi, a
hair-restoration expert from Modena. The Centro Cesare Ragazzi's
motto is ``because hair is beautiful.'' The connection with Zenga,
whose mop appears to have thickened since he was playing for the
Revolution in 1997, became more obvious as the night proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there was the tournament, with teams at the amateur
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they lose to these teams,'' said a stadium official, ``they
are going to have to come here and play in Promozione (equivalent
of the Serie F, the sixth division). And our team is going to
replace them in the Serie A Americano.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition represents the descendants of Pico's
constituency: Polisportiva Concordiese and Mirandolese.

 &HT;    Short Takes: PBS goes for ratings
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Washington Week in Review,'' PBS's long-running public affairs
program, is a stolid, dependable performer which features capital
reporters talking about current events, adding a bit of information
when that seems called for. The worst thing you can say about
``Washington Week'' is that it is stolid and dependable. The best
thing you can say about ``Washington Week'' is that it is stolid
and dependable. It is, in other words, virtually harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Its devotees think ``Washington Week'' is deep. It is, but only
as you compare it to the political food fights that take place
elsewhere on the television dial. ``Washington Week,''
nevertheless, is going through a bad time. Its producers want to
pep it up, give it more liberal vs. conservative attitude, get
panelists to be bolder, edgier.
</P>
<P>
   In service of this more lively vision, ``Washington Week'' is
now without its moderator, Ken Bode. The producers are temporarily
bringing back Paul Duke, the previous moderator, who, if anything,
is even more stolid and dependable. Curious thing, TV.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, it seems, we are destined for yet another left
versus right tag team match to teach us, once again, that we have
only two choices in our political life: evil and even worse evil.
Swell.

`TOM AND JERRY' SHOWS SHORTS SHOULD STAY SHORT

   NEW RELEASES: ``Tom and Jerry: The Movie'' _ When Jack Nicholson
first went to Hollywood, he worked for MGM animators Bill Hanna and
Joe Barbera. He delivered coffee and also answered some ``Tom and
Jerry'' fan mail. That said, this movie points up the value of
brevity. The cartoon cat-and-mouse games were designed as short
subjects, and that's the best way to see them. The feature is too
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point of Order'' _ This remarkable documentary focuses on
Senator Joseph McCarthy's rabid assault on the Army. Unlike his
rapacious move to drive fairly defenseless victims of the Red Scare
out of Hollywood, the Wisconsin senator got all he could handle
from the power of the Army. These 1954 congressional hearings make
the recent embarrassments in Washington seem tame.

HOW `RAGTIME' MADE IT FROM THE WALL TO THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This story begins with a wall. There's no hidden metaphor here,
no nod to Robert Frost or hats off to Pink Floyd. We're simply
talking about one author, one case of writer's block, and one
ordinary wall.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1972, and the scribe in question is E. L. Doctorow.
He's fresh off the success of his novel ``The Book of Daniel,'' and
he's supposed to be writing the next one. Instead, he stares at the
wall. The wall stares back. The vertical structure is attached to a
house built in New Rochelle, N.Y., circa 1906, and the house
eventually inspires scenes and characters, syncopated music, the
setting for a novel, and a certain mood. The novelist writes, and
then there is a book. It's called ``Ragtime.'' Then there is a
movie (a flop), and then there is a musical, a Broadway hit. A
touring production of the musical wends its way to Boston, where it
is selling out at the Colonial Theatre. The novelist is happy _ to
a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fairly painless, actually,'' Doctorow, now 68, says of
his involvement with the musical adaptation. The author has never
hidden his aversion to director Milos Forman's screen adaptation of
the novel _ or to movies in general. ``Films tend to be very
literal-minded,'' he says. And he has never been a passionate fan
of musicals, either. ``Of course, I've gone to them all my life _
`Threepenny Opera' and `Guys and Dolls' and Bob Fosse's stuff. But
I have never been creatively lured into thinking in terms of the
musical theater,'' Doctorow says. ``The form just never appealed to
me as a writer. And as with all forms, there is a lot of bad work
that has been a repository for stock sentiment and piety.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wide distribution &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Doctorow certainly didn't need to dust off the novel. Since
it was published, in 1975, ``Ragtime'' has been translated into
more than 30 languages and has sold more than 4.5 million copies in
English alone. But he was intrigued when impresario Garth Drabinsky
of the Toronto-based Livent Inc. came calling a few years ago to
cajole him into approving a musical adaptation. ``I was given the
right to approve the people who would be involved, the composer,
the lyricist, the librettist, the director,'' Doctorow recalls
during a recent telephone interview. ``I thought it would be a nice
kind of adventure. It was a gamble, but it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the gamble worked out creatively, but not necessarily
financially. Last year, Drabinsky was fired from Livent and charged
with conspiracy and fraud, and the company filed for bankruptcy in
November. Doctorow and ``Ragtime'' playwright Terrence McNally,
lyricist Lynn Ahrens, and composer Stephen Flaherty are suing
Livent for back payments. Doctorow is seeking $137,461 in back
royalties; McNally and his collaborators are claiming $385,743.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist has been on the same page as his collaborators all
along, from the drawing board to bankruptcy court. Back in the
development phase, Doctorow listened to demo tapes by five composer
teams. ``Some of it was very nice, but it wasn't ragtime. It was
regular Broadway stuff,'' he says. ``I almost decided there was no
point in going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he heard the Flaherty-Ahrens music, he gave his
approval. ``They had found their way into the spirit of the book,''
Doctorow recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded him of the revival of Scott Joplin and ragtime that
was going on back in the days when he had that original encounter
with the wall. Thanks to the soundtrack to ``The Sting,'' which
reintroduced Joplin to the masses, and to recordings by pianist
Joshua Rifkin, ragtime was all the rage in the '70s. ``I bought the
sheet music, and I found Joplin's advisory: `Do not play this piece
fast. It is never right to play ragtime fast,' '' Doctorow says.
``I used that as the epigraph for the book, in the event that
people finding it very, very accessible might be inclined to think
it was a lightweight piece with no serious intention. I thought
that was a nice analogy between Joplin's effort to impress people
with his music and my effort to sort of bridge the gap between that
which is thought of as serious and that which is thought of as
popular.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Serious themes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime'' is enormously entertaining, on the page as well as
on the stage. But its themes are hardly lightweight. Doctorow
interweaves the stories of three distinctly different American
families _ one black, one white, one newly immigrated from Latvia _
with such historical figures as Emma Goldman and Evelyn Nesbit,
Harry Houdini and Henry Ford. The novel, which is chock-full of
what Doctorow has described as ``the best facts I can dream up,''
sort of takes the reader by the hand and pulls him along on a mock
historical adventure. By now, the technique is hardly unique: It's
been used by such authors as Don DeLillo and Carlos Fuentes, and it
has also been adopted by Hollywood in such films as ``Forrest
Gump.'' ``Is that the one where they showed him talking to
Kennedy?'' Doctorow asks about the award-winning blockbuster. ``I
read about it, but I didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of eight novels, it seems, would rather stare at a
wall than at a film or video screen. But this bookish man was
intrigued with the theatrical process, and he sounds downright
delighted by the ingenuity of dramatic devices. The ``Ragtime''
creators sum up pages and pages of narrative with an ingenious
prologue, in which all the characters introduce themselves with a
brief character synopsis. The historical figures serve as a sort of
Greek chorus, moving the action along with their detached
commentary. At one point in the rehearsal stage, Doctorow was
concerned that the character of J. Pierpont Morgan needed a higher
profile. ``He wasn't coming through, and my solution as a writer
was to write a new scene, but they solved the problem by having him
walk across a beam and press down on the immigrants below. That's
just staging, and it doesn't take much time.''
</P>
<P>
   The novelist isn't entirely new to the theater. In 1952, he
spent a year as a graduate student studying drama at Columbia
University. ``After one year, I figured out something very simple:
When you finish writing a play, it's not finished. In other words,
it has to be produced, and it doesn't come into being until other
people get their hands on it. When you finish a novel, it's done.
Period.'' Doctorow did return to the theater once, back in 1978,
when his play ``Drinks Before Dinner'' debuted at New York's Public
Theatre. Intensely cerebral, the play left many scratching their
heads. Writing in The New York Times, Richard Eder described it as
``an endless epigram, a butterfly that turns into a centipede.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow isn't about to give up his day job: Any aspiring writer
would salivate for such a career. But he seems pleased about the
relatively painless process behind ``Ragtime'' (except that little
problem known as ``The check's in the mail.'') Sure, he might have
done a few things differently. The musical barely brushes on what
he calls the ``satirical eroticism'' of the novel. ``The other
thing that's missing is a sense of the surreality of American life,
a true madness,'' he says. ``But that's OK. That's fine. Anyone who
adapts a novel does a reading of it, and this reading is certainly
a lot better than the film people did.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ragtime'' adventure was fun, but it's back to the wall for
Doctorow, back to the blank pages of the next novel. ``When you
write a novel, you are the director, the scenic designer, the
lighting specialist, the costumer. You're everything,'' he
concludes. ``And for those of us who find it difficult to delegate
responsibility, that's a suitable form, isn't it?''

CALL IT TEEN SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the prestige fall movies _ the ones with war, death, and
Meryl Streep accents _ have made their big splash. The warm, fuzzy
holiday movies are as forgotten and stale as a December fruitcake.
And we're still a month shy of the Academy Awards, which will, in
theory if not in truth, honor the best films of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That means we're smack dab in the middle of the mediocre movie
season.
</P>
<P>
   Between January and April, lousy films clog up the cineplex like
hair in a bathroom drain. There are, of course, worthwhile films
like ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Affliction,'' which are just
finding their way to smaller cities after opening late last year in
New York and Los Angeles to be eligible for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the exception and not the rule during these months
that have become Hollywood's version of the town dump. Mostly
there's Kevin Costner looking forlorn and mumbling his way through
the goopy romance of ``Message in a Bottle,'' and Mel Gibson in the
ultraviolent ``Payback,'' the film with that dumb-as-a-brick ``Get
Ready to Root for the Bad Guy'' campaign. (Both are hits, which
speaks volumes about the need some folks have to see something,
anything at the movies.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most discernible trend during this winter of
moviegoing discontent is the sudden deluge of teen movies.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, there's been ``Varsity Blues,'' with teen
heartthrob-of-the-week James Van Der Beek; ``She's All That,''
starring Freddie Prinze Jr.; ``Jawbreaker,'' with the future Mrs.
Marilyn Manson, Rose McGowan. This week, ``Cruel Intentions,'' with
Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Reese Witherspoon,
arrives in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the big screen is percolating with prom queens,
letter-jacket-wearing jocks, and not-so-ugly ducklings blossoming
into swans just in time for the big dance. Not since John Hughes
created such films as ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``Sixteen
Candles'' in the mid-1980s, and made brief stars of
where-are-they-now subjects Anthony Michael Hall and Molly
Ringwald, have moviegoers been so inundated with adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of us experienced high school _ and may still bear
its scars _ the adolescent years are ever-green for filmmakers.
Some wonderful films have been made about teenagers _ ``Blackboard
Jungle,'' ``The Summer of '42,'' ``To Sir With Love,''
``Heathers,'' and, more recently, ``Clueless.'' Even some of
Hughes's films have held up far better than they ever should have.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Formula wearing thin
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's highly unlikely anyone will ever say the same about the
current crop of teen movies _ although it has inexplicably yielded
a few hits.
</P>
<P>
   Immune to the slings and arrows of critics, both ``Varsity
Blues'' and ``She's All That'' debuted as box office champs. Both
were fairly innocuous films with blandly attractive leading mannish
boys _ Van Der Beek, best known from TV's ``Dawson's Creek,'' and
Prinze, already on teen radars after ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' and its terrible sequel. And ``She's All That'' could even
boast as its inspiration George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' even
though it's unlikely its target audience has ever heard of Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the formula _ simplistic plots, attractive actors
with cheekbones to die for and 5 percent body fat, and the
all-important killer soundtrack _ is wearing thin. ``Jawbreaker,''
which opened earlier this month to near-unanimous pans, is as
stupid a film as anyone is likely to make this year. A blatant
rip-off of the far superior ``Heathers,'' it's a mean little story
featuring the most popular harpies at Reagan High School
accidentally offing their prom-queen pal by jamming a jawbreaker
down her pretty little throat.
</P>
<P>
   Even songs by the Donnas and Veruca Salt can't save this
worthless endeavor. Fortunately, the film got what it deserved: It
flopped at the box office, unable to even eke out a spot in the Top
10.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking style, ingenuity, and, in some cases, actual teenagers,
many of today's teen films, like ``Jawbreaker,'' are the product of
Hollywood at its most cynical. Recognizing the considerable clout
of teenage girls _ how else to explain the success of ``Titanic''
and 'N Sync? _ studio suits are churning out trifles, and trying to
pass them off as interesting films. They insult the intelligence of
the very audience they seek to entertain. After all, isn't being a
teenager difficult enough without a bunch of 20-something actors in
insipid films misrepresenting your trials and tribulations?

BLONDIE: THE TIDE IS HIGH AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clem Burke, drummer for the rock band Blondie, was home in Los
Angeles, scanning one of those celebrity name-dropping columns
about which star was spotted at what event. `` `Kirk Douglas, Vince
Vaughn, Lauren Bacall, and Clem Burke,' '' Burke read. And he
thought: ``What's wrong with this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Burke may have had an Admiral Stockdale moment in considering
his inclusion in this pantheon _ he's just the drummer in a rock
'n' roll band _ but America 1999 is Celebrityland, and curiously
enough, Burke seems to have been invited back into the club.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, after 16 years on the shelf _ beset with illness
and ill feelings toward each other, lawsuits, and tax trouble _
Blondie is a group once again. (At least, four original members
are.) And while many a reunion album tanks, there is reason to
think Blondie's ``No Exit,'' released last Tuesday, may not only
escape that fate, but go big. May go big.
</P>
<P>
   The radio single ``Maria'' has been all over the airwaves. In
England, always one of the New York-based band's strongest markets,
the song debuted at No. 1. This sixth No. 1 UK hit makes the group
the first to go No. 1 in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. The album
entered the chart at No. 3. (No US sales figures are available
yet.)
</P>
<P>
   So, how does it feel to slip into Blondie mode once again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like wearing an old pair of socks,'' says Deborah Harry,
singer and band namesake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty gym socks,'' adds guitarist Chris Stein, songwriter and
former paramour of Harry's. They may not live together anymore,
but, from New York, they are sharing both a phone line and a dry
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly two decades ago that Harry was the It girl, the
peroxide blonde who beat Madonna to the iconic and ironic Marilyn
Monroe pose. Before she was a cover girl for national glossies, she
was the cover girl for the classic underground magazine Punk _ the
sex bomb with a nod, a wink, and maybe a middle finger. She sang
these punchy, hook-packed, sometimes risque pop songs _ ``X
Offender,'' ``Look Good in Blue,'' ``Hanging on the Telephone,''
``One Way or Another'' _ with a mix of sass and diffidence. Harry
was hot ice, enticing and just out of reach. An early advertisement
posed a pouting Harry and the tagline ``Wouldn't You Like To Rip
Her to Shreds?'' _ playing off Blondie's ``Rip Her to Shreds,'' in
which Harry's character fantasizes about demolishing a rival.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Blondie,'' the noted late rock critic Lester Bangs
wrote: ``What _ if anything _ do these people care about?''
</P>
<P>
   In Blondie's own book, ``Making Tracks,'' Harry wrote: ``The
initial idea was to be desirable, feminine and vulnerable, but a
resilient, tenacious wit at the same time rather than a poor female
sapped of her strength by heartthrob and unrequited love. . . .
When Blondie did finally hop out on stage as a character she would
try to be bisexual or asexual, and a lot of times she would see and
do things from the point of view of a third person.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's idea of the band has generally been about the
exploration of music. In 1982, even as Blondie had penetrated the
pop mainstream, he told the Globe, ``I certainly never want to do
mainstream rock. Our thing has always been to look around and see
what's happening and then do something different.'' Indeed, Blondie
veered away from pure pop after two albums, and ventured into
waters not usually charted by a pop band of the era.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, with ``No Exit,'' Blondie has picked up the old
ball. Keyboardist Jimmy Destri's delirious, bells-a-ringing
``Maria'' harkens back to the early pop. ``I think it's the most
obvious,'' says Harry, of its selection as an emphasis radio track.
``It ties us directly to our more pop elements.'' But the new album
also includes forays into ska, reggae, country, rap, and hip-hop.
There are some new tricks, including digital recording, which Stein
credits for the quickness of arranging and producing as well as the
fluid sequencing of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   So what brought Blondie back from the grave?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the attention the music was getting over the years,'' says
Stein, who was the primary instigator. ``And the fan interest. I
could see the songs being used to represent different periods in
all the films. Once I thought about it really seriously it seemed
like a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they were going to regroup for a song or two to be
added to a best-of-Blondie compilation for EMI. Burke put an
immediate kibosh on that idea, and the others agreed. ``It was
important to make a new record and new music,'' he says. ``We
agreed if we were going to put this time and energy into it, it
wouldn't be for one new song. Let's be a band, not just a business
venture.'' Being a band, Burke believes, means writing new
material, not just coasting on old hits in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Blondie's groundbreaking history. In 1978, the band
brought a pure pop/girl group sensibility to the harder-edged punk
world. With ``Heart of Glass'' and ``Call Me'' they scored by
grafting the once-hated and verboten disco pulse to their own
style. Their sly ``Rapture'' was one of the first rap hits by a
white act. With ``The Tide Is High,'' Blondie brought slinky island
rhythms and untainted optimism to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can Blondie _ which has been away from the scene twice as
long as it was a working band _ keep breaking ground? Says Stein:
``There are all sorts of reunions, but they all have this
cashing-in (feeling), and if people are concerned with credibility,
maybe that is what is groundbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Aug. 12, 1982, and Blondie is nearing the end. The band is
playing the Providence Civic Center. Once a punk rock group, it has
crashed the mainstream, but now it's going down in flames. Success
is leaving a sour taste. You might quote one of the hits: Once they
had a love and it was a gas; soon turned out to be a pain in the
ass. Onstage, they give the impression of a band that does not want
to be there.
</P>
<P>
   During ``The Tide Is High,'' Burke starts winging his drumsticks
at keyboardist Destri, who retrieves them and shoots them back at
Burke.

`OUR KIND' ONLY CRACKS OPEN DOOR ON BLACK ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
OUR KIND OF PEOPLE 
Inside America's Black Upper Class 
By Lawrence Otis Graham 
HarperCollins, 418 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Our Kind of People'' is the kind of book you want to fling
across the room, when you aren't calling your friends to rant and
rave about its endless details and dish.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Otis Graham's look _ it can't be called anything so
analytical as an examination _ at America's black upper class is an
exasperating book about a group that has existed in shadow for more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   This is not simply a story about black folks with money; you'll
find no tender words for millionaire basketball players or rappers
who make it and move from the 'hood to the Hamptons. This is the
story of the black haves, people who _ insulated by privilege,
divisive standards, and an unconscious self-hatred _ have all but
shed their connection to the African-American community at large.
Graham clarifies the distinctions in the book's opening:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryant Gumbel is, but Bill Cosby isn't. Lena Horne is, but
Whitney Houston isn't. Andrew Young is, but Jesse Jackson isn't.
And neither is Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Clarence Thomas, or
Quincy Jones. And even though both of them try extremely hard,
neither Diana Ross nor Robin Givens will ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   See, it doesn't matter that Angelou is an acclaimed poet, or
that Thomas is a Supreme Court justice. Both hail from hardscrabble
backgrounds that will forever bar them from the black aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they're just too dark-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Graham, a long-standing member of the black
elite, these upper-class folks are just as concerned with skin
color _ and can be as hateful and haughty _ as the snooty whites
whose bigotry drove the black elites to establish their own
exclusive clubs in the first place (it's the Boule for men, the
Links for women, and Jack and Jill for children). Certainly, it
helps to be an alumnus of Howard, Spelman, or Morehouse, the three
predominantly black colleges that sparkle in the eyes of the elite
(Harvard will also suffice). But it's just as important that you're
light-skinned with straight hair.
</P>
<P>
   Graham (no relation to this reviewer) deserves some credit for
telling tales on his own. He conducted hundreds of interviews for
the book, though he need not have looked any further than his own
family tree. He recalls summers in Oak Bluffs, the Martha's
Vineyard enclave long popular among rich blacks, with his
great-grandmother Porter _ a ``well-educated, light-complexioned,
straight-haired black southern woman'' _ who would scold him for
spending too much time in the sun, lest he get too black. She would
thumb through Ebony magazine, dismissing the black entertainers
with the same racial epithet she surely heard as a black daughter
of the South. Even when Sidney Poitier won a best actor Oscar in
1963 for ``Lilies of the Field,'' Porter's pride was tempered
because she thought Poitier too dark-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes were born from the horror of slavery.
Light-skinned blacks often received better treatment, such as house
jobs instead of harsh field chores, than did their darker brethren.
It was also more likely for light-skinned slaves to be freed, since
they were the master's children. After the Civil War, these blacks
began to establish organizations to foster their sense of
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, for as long as I can remember,'' Graham writes,
``I grew up thinking that there existed only two types of black
people: those who passed the `brown paper bag and ruler test' and
those who didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests pass judgment on skin color and hair texture. If the
complexion is lighter than a paper bag, and the hair is as straight
as a ruler, you're in. If they're not, you're not. Such eligibility
requirements are still common.
</P>
<P>
   That Graham presents all of this in an uncritical,
this-is-how-we-do-it tone, is the book's great failing. The voyeur
within us can't help but read with fascination about the tony
cotillions and coming-out dances. But Graham never gets beyond the
material fabulousness to the hollowness within his subjects' souls.
He has gone inside, but not under the skin, and what's left is a
breathy chronicle of how the black elite meet and greet; he airs
their dirty laundry without considering its stain on the larger
black community.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked here is any dissection of the warped psychology of
black people shortsighted enough to believe good breeding and the
right socially incestuous connections have allowed them to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin once wondered how black folks might behave if they
were relieved of their oppression and granted the status of whites.
``Our Kind of People'' unwittingly offers one sad, disheartening
answer to that question.

 UNDATED: ... at Burke.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was terrible, it was towards the demise of the band,'' says
Burke, recalling the date.
</P>
<P>
   What triggered the assault? ``It could have been stress. Things
were not going good. We took two years off from the road, we went
into large venues and these (separate) limousines and a private
jet, where we were all on top of each other. People had different
agendas; Chris was ill; the business was in disarray.'' Blondie had
been together eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The band splintered. Harry helped get Stein through a
debilitating skin disease called pemphigus vulgaris. (The disease
is sometimes fatal, but Stein is well now.) They continued to work
together musically, but they split as a couple. Burke did session
and tour work for Eurythmics and Bob Dylan, among others. Blondie's
bassist at the time, Nigel Harrison, went into the business side of
music. Guitarist Frank Infante had fallen out with the band a long
time before (he was not on the last tour). Destri did limited
production and worked as a contractor. Infante and Harrison are not
part of this reunion; they weren't invited and are, in fact, suing
the others. (Stein calls it a personality clash; Burke opts for the
other usual suspect: artistic clash. Neither cares to expound.) The
touring band includes bassist Lee Fox Boston and guitarist Paul
Carbona.
</P>
<P>
   Harry carried on with a solo career that sputtered along at a
low level. She acted in cult movies such as ``Videodrome,'' ``Union
City,'' and ``Hairspray.'' She sent herself up, playing a faded pop
star on the ``Wiseguy'' TV series. In the '90s, she joined the Jazz
Passengers, which she says was an important step, as well as a
bridge (albeit an inadvertent one) back to Blondie.
</P>
<P>
   Harry calls it ``a stretch musically and more responsibility as
a musician in a band situation. I was not the `front person.' I
would say a singer-with-a-band, in some cases just an instrument,
perhaps like a flute or a violin. The latter half of my recording
with them, there were songs I had written, so that had a little
more personality, of course, for me. But I focused on singing in an
ensemble situation, a much different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the opposite of what they kept saying the first
time around with Blondie,'' adds Stein. ``They only talked about
her attitude and stance. No one ever thought about Debbie singing,
and the Jazz Passengers is the total opposite of that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meet the new Blondie. Same as the old Blondie?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the same people,'' says Burke. ``It feels like
some weird time capsule we came out of. We've all been through some
therapy. We're still a pop band on the verge of a nervous
breakdown. But everyone's a little older and wiser, and we can
tolerate each other and the outside forces.''
</P>
<P>
   From a responsibility standpoint, he admits, ``the brunt is on
Debbie's shoulders, really, even though we choose to represent it
as a group. We talked about this before we went public with it. We
feel like we're in the driver's seat right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that can be a precarious perch for rockers in their 50s,
as Stein and Harry both are. (The others are slightly younger.) The
muse has continued to inspire veterans such as David Bowie and Neil
Young, but many more times the pop musician of that age finds
creativity has long played itself out. With ``No Exit,'' Blondie
comes down on the plus side of the chasm.
</P>
<P>
   The copilot on this comeback flight is manager Allen Kovac, who
has worked comebacks for Meat Loaf and Duran Duran. ``We call him a
visionary,'' says Stein. ``He deals with the logistics of
marketing, applying different techniques that haven't been used in
the music business before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the world of Blondie,'' says Burke. ``It was always
part of our identity; I was always Clem from Blondie. I actually
don't get out much to feel this new adulation but certain people
keep calling you again, long-lost relatives start turning up. The
easy part was making the music. In the studio, it just felt like a
bunch of musicians making a record _ no deja vu or nostalgia
involved. The catharsis came when we completed the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondie has been all over television of late _ ``The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno'' and ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' in
the past two weeks. An hourlong concert taped Tuesday in New York
was to air Sunday night at 10 on VH1. There's a spot on Rosie
O'Donnell's show next Tuesday. The band's music is featured in the
film ``200 Cigarettes,'' which opened Friday. Tour plans are yet to
be finalized. The group has played about 35 dates in Europe and
Australia and is capable of a two-hour show _ four or five songs
from ``No Exit'' and a variety pack from the catalog. They are
gearing up for a US tour later this year. They may play mid-size
theaters; they may hold off for a shot at the summer shed circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As to goals, Stein hesitates. ``I don't know, I am looking to do
something that will sort of break through and I don't want to go
out doing more of what is already out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has become very philosophical about what he went
through,'' says Burke. ``He almost enjoyed it, being right on the
edge, facing mortality, and the good thing is he came back. He
doesn't take things for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry: ``I think that sometimes it seems like there is really
nothing new under the sun, but then something comes along. I guess
(my goal) would simply be to have this record go down well and be
in the position to do another, to take it a little further out.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the reunion permanent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' says Harry, ``is permanent.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; STONINGTON, Conn. _ James Houston ``went in'' to the Arctic in
1948 ``with just a sleeping bag and a lot of sketchbooks,'' he
says. And, in a sense, he never ``came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Note those two expressions: ``went in'' and ``came out.''
They're invariably found in the great accounts of exploration and
adventure in distant places. And they are expressions that Houston
_ now a bluff and ruddy 77 with a firm grip and far-seeing eyes _
uses as casually in conversation as you or I would the more usual
``went to'' and ``came from.''
</P>
<P>
   And well he should.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had just returned from World War II and art school in
Paris when he hitched a ride on a medical emergency flight into the
Canadian Arctic, landing in a native settlement on the northeast
coast of Hudson Bay. When the plane departed, Houston stayed
behind. ``I had found the place that I'd been looking for,'' he
writes in his autobiography, ``Confessions of an Igloo Dweller.''
It was a place where he would live for 14 years _ and a place that
he would capture in drawings and glass sculptures and in more than
two dozen books, most recently a novel, ``The Ice Master.''
</P>
<P>
   In all these varied art forms, Houston's purpose has been, as he
puts it, ``to reflect the historic Inuit vision of a world where
man and nature are locked, not in perpetual battle but perpetual
partnership, a world where fish and animals offer their flesh to
worthy hunters in an act of sublime generosity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston was to do more than celebrate that vision on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day in Inukjuak, on that first trip into the
Arctic, he made a sketch of an Inuit man's wife. In return, the man
gave him a small stone carving of a caribou. Houston was given
similar carvings in the days that followed.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that these were recent carvings, not the work of
a long-vanished Arctic civilization, it led to Houston playing a
major role in introducing the art of printmaking to the
artistically skilled Eskimos. The West Baffin Eskimo Co-Operative,
which he established at Cape Dorset on Baffin Island, has become a
center of Inuit art and culture. The works of its printmakers are
sold and exhibited widely.
</P>
<P>
   Houston now lives half the year in his 18th-century sea
captain's house in Stonington and half the year on an island off
British Columbia _ with an annual visit to his old art school in
Paris for a month of drawing. He has made 27 trips back into the
Arctic, most recently with his two sons to scatter his first wife's
ashes in West Baffin.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial trip, Houston returned to Ottawa, quickly
landing a post even farther in, as northern service officer and
civil administrator for West Baffin. He also married. When he went
back with his new bride, the trip took 40 days by dog sled over
frozen land and water.
</P>
<P>
   Unconventional as Houston's career already was _ as artist,
teacher, promoter, and government agent _ a radio message he
received in 1959 would lead to new careers as glass sculptor and
writer.
</P>
<P>
   The message was that an American named Houghton wanted to come
up to Cape Dorset. ``I thought nothing of it,'' Houston said,
``until I got a second message with instructions to have clothing
made for the people who would be coming with him _ and giving their
arm and foot sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see they were getting serious,'' Houston said. His
wife quickly organized the local people to make tents and clothing,
and to prepare for the arrival of a party that included, in
addition to Houghton _ who turned out to be Arthur A. Houghton Jr.,
president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and of Steuben Glass _
two pilots and a cook. Despite his earlier misgivings, Houston
said, ``it was the least foolish bunch you'd ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``they were overwhelmed,'' said Houston, recalling that
Arctic poppies were in full bloom and carpeted the ground inside
the tents.
</P>
<P>
   When Houghton left, he presented Houston with a piece of Steuben
glass _ a whale. Houston suggested that Houghton send a crew up to
Cape Dorset, where there was a good supply of clean sand, a key
element in glassmaking. ``Our guys,'' he said, speaking of the
local Inuit artists and craftsmen, ``could have tickled this up in
no time.'' Houghton countered with an invitation for Houston to
come to New York.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1962, with the Cape Dorset cooperative well-established _
and his wife having taken their two sons to London for school _
Houston wound up his tour as administrator and service officer in
the Arctic and headed for New York.
</P>
<P>
   His first experience as a sculpture designer was not auspicious.
As he recalls in ``Fire and Ice,'' a lavishly illustrated account
of his years at Steuben, on his first day on the job, he stood in
front of one of the red-hot furnaces that were ``roaring like a
herd of walruses,'' clutching a drawing of a polar bear. He felt,
he says, ``as small as a piece of butter beginning to melt.'' And
the polar bear, which on paper had looked so easy to make, ended up
as scrap.
</P>
<P>
   But as he learned the art and craft of glass sculpture, Houston
saw the affinity between glass and ice _ even comparing the
``delicate tinkling'' of upright-floating ice candles brushing
against each other to that of crystal glasses being clinked
together.
</P>
<P>
   Houston grew successful as a glass sculptor, but he continued
making sketches of Inuit scenes from memory. These came to the
attention of artist Fritz Eichenberg, who encouraged Houston to
write some articles on Inuit art. A weekend visit to Eichenberg on
Nantucket brought Houston to the attention of children's book
editor Margaret K. McElderry, who commissioned him to write and
illustrate a book based on Inuit myths.
</P>
<P>
   Written over a long weekend _ and illustrated the next _ it was
published as ``Tikta'liktak,'' the first of 17 children's books by
Houston, three of which have been Canadian children's book of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If writing is as easy as that,'' Houston remembers thinking,
``then I'm all set.'' So he tapped out a novel that was published
as ``White Dawn'' and was subsequently made into a motion picture
by Paramount. It was filmed in the Arctic, with Houston as
assistant producer.
</P>
<P>
   Following the success of ``White Dawn,'' Houston and his second
wife, Alice, a Connecticut native, bought a sheep farm in Exeter,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually sold the farm and bought the house of
18th-century sea captain Amos Palmer 15 years ago. It's a house
rich in history: a target for naval gunners when the British raided
Stonington during the Revolution and, later, the residence of
``Whistler's Mother,'' the subject of the painting by her son,
James McNeill Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a personal museum of sorts, reflecting Houston's
careers as artist, promoter of Inuit art, glass sculptor, and
writer. Display cases exhibit stunning examples of Inuit stone and
ivory carving, pieces of Steuben glass, and 18th-century powder
horns and insignia and whaling gear that Houston has collected
while writing books on those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the front parlor, drawing a visitor's eye away from the
period antiques, is the spiraled tusk of a narwhal, a small Arctic
whale, close to 7 feet long with a satiny sheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking along the beach on Coats Island one day,'' said
Houston. ``It was lying there, half buried in the sand and still
attached to the skeleton, which I had to leave behind.'' Houston
pulled out a map to point out Coats Island at the northern end of
Hudson Bay. Then, recalling that day as if it were yesterday _ and
he had ``come out'' for a brief visit _ he added in a quiet,
faraway voice, ``I don't imagine anyone had walked on that beach
for 25 years.''

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``Another Day in Paradise'' Larry Clark's
lowlife-crooks-on-the-lam movie gives James Woods his best role in
years as a yappy, wired thief, and gives Melanie Griffith her best
role since ``Working Girl'' as his tough, loyal junkie consort. You
find yourself hoping the sweet dumb kids (Vincent Kartheiser,
Natasha Gregson Wagner) they hook up with will get out of their
gritty pop odyssey alive. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !! &LR;  ``Eight Millimeter'' What could have been a scalding
indictment of the outwardly respectable consumers who have turned
porn into big business is bypassed in favor of a dark-looking but
superficial thriller. Nicolas Cage plays a private eye turned
avenging angel when he descends into the porn underworld to find
out what happened to a runaway girl he saw in a snuff film. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (FR)  &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The Last Days'' A moving and eloquent documentary.
Five Holocaust survivors relive their harrowing stories when they
revisit the death camps and their native Hungary, where Hitler,
knowing the war was lost in 1944, diverted military resources from
battle into exterminating as many Jews as he could ship out in
boxcars, more than 440,000. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !! &LR;  ``The Other Sister'' Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are
appealing as mentally challenged people who fall in love. But this
would-be romantic comedy with heart has been sugarcoated. What
should have been a sensitive and tender story is sweetened with
simplistic sitcom ingredients; now we see two-dimensional
characters, with an uptight mom as the only problem facing the
couple. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``200 Cigarettes'' Wildly uneven, mildly entertaining film
set on New Year's Eve 1981 in New York. The script is riddled with
dead spots, and despite a few sparkling moments, the cast _ which
includes Courtney Love, Martha Plimpton, Christina Ricci, and
Janeane Garofalo _ is largely wasted. (R) (Renee Graham)

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: War on drugs needs a new battle plan
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A motley of would-be drug policy reformers clustered under an
umbrella called the Network of Reform Groups will issue a report
Wednesday in which they will propose, shockingly, that we stop
simply fighting the war on drugs and start instead trying actually
to win it.
</P>
<P>
   They would do that by up-ending current, manifestly failed
priorities, cutting the 66 percent of the anti-drug budget that
goes to law enforcement to 33 percent and splitting the rest evenly
between treatment and strategies against youth drug use. As matters
stand now, only 22 percent of the effort goes to treatment and only
12 percent is targeted against drug use by the young.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, these are the usual suspects, long-time drug policy
critics from a variety of angles (stop forfeitures, decriminalize
pot and all that), but they make a strong, very sober case.
</P>
<P>
   It deserves a hearing. Alas, we seem instead about to go
rampaging off again into more of the same, with the drug czar, the
vastly unimaginative Barry McCaffrey, telling Congress just last
week that by turning up the heat, he'll cut drug use in half by
'07. You read it here first: no he won't.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Dennis Hastert is setting up a GOP Drug-Free
America Working Group. Do not expect enlightenment. Expect calls
for more cops, more firepower, more and longer mandatory sentences
and more prisons _ in a nation that already trails only Russia in
the percentage of its own people that it locks up.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless criminalization of drugs has mainly served _
surprise _ to create a huge, deadly criminal subculture around
drugs. Despite already draconian sentences, ugly interventions in
drug-producing and drug transfer nations and a deeply corrupting
quasi-war along the Mexican border, drug use among adults has
diminished only slightly in the '90s and use among teens has gone
up a tick.
</P>
<P>
   Drug prices are going down and purity up _ sure signs that
supplies are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   We are fighting this war mainly by taking ourselves prisoner.
Drug convictions produced 85 percent of the huge increase in the
federal prison population between 1985 and '95, in all a
twelve-fold increase since 1980. The result is a comparable
increase in unemployables and devastated family formation. And
because the most vulnerable drug activity is the indiscreet street
traffic among and by the poor _ and because poverty still
disproportionately conflates with race _ we are carefully
assembling a social timebomb.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, lock up the big traffickers, but for most of the
rest, a decriminalized, more medicalized model that emphasizes
prevention and treatment would lower the social damage and, happy
news, save money. A RAND Corporation study finds that alternative
strategies buy more drug-use reduction per dollar than law
enforcement does.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, even the dippiest fool figures out that he can't
get through a brick wall by running into it harder each time he
tries. Just how badly are we willing to bruise ourselves before we
start looking for a way around this brick wall?

REBATES OFTEN TOUGH TO REALLY GET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh. It sounds like a nice word, doesn't it? It conjures up
mental images of cash back in your pocket after making a purchase.
And cash in your pocket is always nice.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, these days the term ``rebate'' has become a dirty word,
especially among computer users who are inundated every day with
rebate offers on television, on radio, in magazines and in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've seen the offers. Many, for example, offer $30, $40
or more in rebates if you buy software or hardware at full price
and then mail in the rebate application with your proof of purchase
(and, sometimes, the bar code from the box).
</P>
<P>
   Some offers go so far as to promise consumers that their final
cost _ after they receive their rebate _ will be zero.
</P>
<P>
   Who can pass that up? Not many.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why law enforcement agencies, corporate
executives, consumer groups and media outlets across the country
are getting complaints from consumers angry over rebate offers gone
bad.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of most complaints: Somebody bought something, sent in
the required information but never received any rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers tell tales of waiting six to nine months with no
sign of a rebate. Some have documented countless telephone calls,
faxes, certified letters and other efforts to claim the money they
are owed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tale of Barry, a Valley resident who bought three
items at a Tempe electronics store nine months ago. All three came
with rebate coupons. He applied for all three rebates, but has yet
to receive anything.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to resolve the situation by dealing directly with the
Tempe retailer, Barry says he has run into constant roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told (the store's representative) that I would be
filing this matter in small claims court, she took that information
to her superiors,'' Barry wrote in an e-mail to me last week.
``Their response was (and I'm quoting her), `So that's what he'll
have to do then.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barry said he's had trouble getting rebates before, but it was
nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the ones that I have sent in, I have had to chase over 60
percent of them with repeated phone calls to get them to finally
deliver,'' he wrote. ``But I have never encountered a company that
has just outrightly snubbed their nose and said, in effect, `Go
pound sand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest explanation for the trouble Barry and others have
encountered is that rebate offers are just too popular. Too many
people are asking for too many rebates, and the companies hired to
handle much of the job, called ``fulfillment houses,'' are
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question rebate programs work. That's why we see so
many of them, whether they're attached to the sales of computers,
dishwashers or travel packages. I found an online reference to one
offer that forced a company in the computer business to cough up
$75,000 in rebates in just one week.
</P>
<P>
   But, as you might guess, there's more to the story than just
overwhelmed fulfillment houses.
</P>
<P>
   First, many rebate programs run into trouble due to scam
artists. CNNFN reported that rebate fraud costs American businesses
upward of $500 million every year. A U.S. Postal Service fraud
investigation a few years ago found up to 75 percent of rebate
claims it reviewed during the investigation were fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to legitimate rebate requests, many end up in the
trash heap because the consumer failed to follow the rules, usually
by not filling out the rebate form properly or by missing a
deadline for rebate requests. The smallest error can be enough
reason to deny a request.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are rebate offers that nobody intended to honor.
I can't name names. Law enforcement authorities are tight-lipped
when it comes to discussing ongoing investigations. But some of the
rebate horror stories I've heard and read about leave no other
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of rebate problems fall into a huge gray area.
These involve rebate requests that disappear in the mail, never to
be heard from again. Sometimes, fulfillment houses claim they never
received the paperwork. Sometimes, consumers are told to be
patient, that rebates will arrive in another six or eight weeks. Of
course, they usually don't.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many consumers forget about the rebates or just give
up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who suggest that's exactly what some companies
want consumers to do _ give up. And that could be true. It's been
suggested by industry insiders that some companies purposely make
it difficult to redeem rebate coupons in order to save themselves
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation could be that the companies in question
simply turned over their rebate programs to the cheapest
fulfillment house they can find, and then fail to monitor whether
the fulfillment houses are doing their jobs properly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, you have to admit that applying for and
actually getting a rebate these days takes attention to detail, a
lot of patience and a bucket of luck.
</P>
<P>
   When rebate offers go bad, consumers across the country are
starting to seek legal help. The Arizona Attorney General's Office
reports that 212 people filed rebate-related complaints in the
state in 1998. And 27 more have been filed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the complaints end up? That's hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Attorney General's Office won't comment on
particulars of any case, and won't confirm whether it's
investigating anything. My guess is that the office is busy with
big-ticket crimes and isn't spending a whole lot of time on Mr.
Consumer's complaint that he's owed $25 in rebates.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a consumer to do? Here are some basics I've put
together after researching this topic online and talking with
experts in consumer issues and with the Arizona Attorney General's
Office:
</P>
<P>
   - Don't count on a rebate to make a purchase worth your while.
If you really need a new hard drive, look for one with a sticker
price you can afford. Then, if it comes with a rebate, and you
actually get the rebate, great.
</P>
<P>
   - If you buy something with a significant rebate attached, don't
leave the store until you've asked about the rebate process. Do
they handle it themselves? Do they farm it out to a fulfillment
house? Who do you call if there are rebate problems?
</P>
<P>
   - Read rebate instructions carefully before you buy. Make sure
the deadline has not yet passed. And watch out for other tricky
requirements. Some rebate offers are honored only if the product is
purchased from authorized resellers, and not every retail store is
authorized to resell everything.
</P>
<P>
   - Fill out the rebate form carefully. Print your name, address
and other information so it can be easily read.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't forget to include required documentation, such as sales
receipts and/or the bar code from the box.
</P>
<P>
   - Make copies of everything. If the rebate disappears, you'll
have nothing to go on if you mailed off the originals and didn't
make copies.
</P>
<P>
   - Does the rebate offer require the original receipt? If so,
make sure the retail store will accept a copy of your receipt as
proof of purchase should you have to return the product.
</P>

CALIFORNIA GOP STRUGGLES TO RETAIN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ ``It's the women, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered by the November elections, the California Republican
Party spent much of its weekend convention trying to figure out
where all the women had gone.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent woman in national politics, Elizabeth Dole,
didn't show up here because of a scheduling conflict. But the
problems for the party run deeper than just getting Dole to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular political paraphernalia at the state convention
was a tiny yellow sticker plastered to blouses, shirts and sport
coats everywhere. It read: ``It's the women, stupid.'' A special
90-minute seminar focused on the issue Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Many Republicans here are fearful that another open
fight over abortion rights will alienate more women. In the
November gubernatorial election in California, the Democratic
candidate, Gray Davis, won 61 percent of all women voters and sent
the GOP candidate, Dan Lungren, to a resounding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Davis' huge lead among women can be tied to
Lungren's anti-abortion views, although Davis also focused on
issues such as education and health care and Lungren ran a largely
scattered, unfocused campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party needs to lighten up and liven up,'' said
Julie Leitzell of Larkspur, a partner in Common Sense Activism, a
group that tries to get media attention on GOP issues that she says
appeal to ``soccer moms with brains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to appeal to women on education issues,'' she said.
``Our kids can't spell, they can't add. If the Republican Party
can't figure out how to get that issue on the front page with the
disaster (in education) that is happening to California, the party
is doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Among high-ranking elected Republican officials in California,
only 8 percent are women, compared to 35 percent among Democrats.
There are no highly visible Republican women from California, with
the exception of Rep. Mary Bono of Palm Springs, who succeeded her
husband, Sonny Bono, when he died in a skiing accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are not identifying with the party,'' said Beth Rogers,
president of the Seneca Network, the New York organization that
raises money for Republican candidates who are women. ``We maintain
that you can never be a majority party in an era when you have one
party that is half men and half women (Democrats), and another
party that is all men. Women are sensing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and other Republican women say linking the party's
failure simply to abortion is too simplistic. Women identify with
candidates on all sorts of issues, they said, and focusing on a yes
or no answer when it comes to abortion masks what the debate is
truly about: women don't want men in power to tell them what they
can or cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls to take a more moderate path, state Republicans
ended their convention Sunday by electing the most conservative
anti-abortion candidates to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 state GOP delegates voted to elect Silicon Valley
executive John McGraw their new chairman. McGraw drew fire from
moderates in the party for telling a Catholic newsletter that
``killing our babies ... is the issue of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw pledged to unite the party.
</P>
<P>
   Some women contend that the party that stands for less
government intervention in personal lives ought to be wary of
government involvement in abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about less government,'' said Debra Madison, a
Sacramento artist and self-described centrist Democrat who attended
the convention. ``But I think to legislate what a woman would do on
abortion is creating huge government ... It's the one big problem I
have with the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Republicans are having trouble attracting all
sorts of diverse groups. Only a few blacks and Hispanics were
spotted at the state convention. Some believe reaching women is the
first step to regaining control in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is focusing on the Hispanic, Asian and
African-American vote,'' Rogers said. ``That's the new market for
the party. But we keep saying that Asians, Latin-Americans and
African-Americans come in boys and girls.''

RENOVATED HOTEL IS FIRST IN GALVESTON TO CATER TO GAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The first hotel catering solely to gay and
lesbian visitors is scheduled to open on Seawall Boulevard here
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-room inn is called Hollywood at Galveston, and each room
will recall legends of entertainment, such as Marilyn Monroe, Clark
Gable, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, owners Sherman Houck and Bob
Wilkins said. The decor will include unusual furnishings, such as a
huge kettle drum made into a table.
</P>
<P>
   Houck and Wilkins, longtime Baytown, Texas, residents, will be
resident managers of the inn, a two-story, 1946 building formerly
known as the Silver Sands Hotel. The inn, at Seawall Boulevard and
30th Street, was ragged and rundown when it closed several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of homeless people living in the building
when we bought it,'' Wilkins said. ``There was garbage and trash
all over and green slime in the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature hasn't helped much since the men purchased the
building in December 1997 and began the tedious restoration job. In
September, Tropical Storm Frances, which caused heavy erosion along
Galveston's West Beach, also caused the collapse of an exterior
wall of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Houck and Wilkins decline to say how much money they have put
into the project, but they said that it already is more than they
had planned.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels serving gay tourists and business travelers are not new
in the country, they said. Their idea for such a resort in
Galveston was born after they saw the 250-room Habana Inn resort in
Oklahoma City, run by a friend's relative and catering to gay
travelers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happen to be the first one on the island,'' Houck
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other Texas inns _ the Montrose Inn in Houston and
The Upper Deck on South Padre Island _ have catered to gay
travelers for years, Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay people spend $20 billion a year on travel,'' he said.
``Gay people have considerable disposable income.''
</P>
<P>
   He named Florida and Palm Springs, Calif., as two areas where
many hotels cater to gay crowds, and noted that cruise lines
schedule numerous exclusively gay trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that what's noteworthy here is the fact that
we're renovating an old building in Galveston,'' Wilkins said,
adding that virtually all of the building's original interior
woodwork has been preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Galveston project has spread quickly in gay circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably got 150 or 200 people on a waiting list who are
anxiously awaiting our opening,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the list who have visited Galveston recently have
stopped by to check progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rainbow banner, symbolic of gay pride, has adorned the old inn
since work began early last year and, except for a couple of
hostile notes to the inn's Web site, the plans for the property
have elicited no significant complaints, Houck and Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   While the inn's pool area was walled off from view from the
seawall, Wilkins said it is unlikely that the pool area will be
clothing-optional because he and Houck expect a mixed male and
female clientele. Guests will have a great view of the Gulf of
Mexico and activity along busy Seawall Boulevard from the
second-floor deck of the inn.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood will be a place where gay people can feel
completely comfortable holding hands and showing affection, the
owners said.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will have key cards to enter electronically controlled
outer doors to the property; other people will be screened before
they are admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting gay couples, such as Bob and I, who have been
together several years and who really enjoy traveling where they
can feel comfortable,'' Houck said. ``Gay couples have been
visiting Galveston Island for years and years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Late March is the target opening. Room rates will run from about
$70 on weeknights to about $120 on weekends, Wilkins said. Winter
weekday rates may be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the sun's out on weekends, people come out of the
woodwork to Galveston,'' Wilkins said.

OUT-OF-WORK FILMMAKER HAS A DATE WITH DESTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Myles Berkowitz isn't a romantic in any sense of
the word. He doesn't like soft music or candlelight dinners and
practically runs screaming from the room at the mere mention of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But the fledgling filmmaker put aside his prejudices long enough
to make a romantic comedy as his first movie. ``20 Dates''
chronicles, in a pseudo-documentary sort of way, Berkowitz's quest
for a girlfriend _ and a film deal. Along the way, the 36-year-old
Brentwood resident endured a couple of lawsuits from women unhappy
about being secretly filmed and actually found true love with a
beautiful sales clerk named Elisabeth. The two are set to be
married in October.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we play 20 Questions with the ``20 Dates'' guy and, in the
process, learn a little more about love, lawsuits and flirting in
the presence of a camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   Daily News: How did you get the idea for the film?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I decided to combine my two biggest failures _ my
personal life and my professional life. It's sort of like peanut
butter and jelly. Both are going nowhere alone. Put them together
and you've got something interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie, you go on 20 dates. Early on, you look a little
rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I was never a dater. I met a woman after college, we
lived together for four years and then we got married and then we
got divorced. So I found myself back out there in my early 30s and
I ha &UR; Q &LR; 't gone on a date for 10 years. It was strange.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the worst part?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: About dating? It's all horrible. It's the worst
experience a human being can go through.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you decided to make a movie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Well, the thing is, when you're in your 30s, you've
got these biological clocks ticking _ both men and women. So you
bring that agenda to the table, which makes it a much more intense
three or four hours. When you're younger, the stakes aren't as
high.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you break the tension?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: You don't. You just keep dating. And after going on a
few dates _ and you have to do this more than once every six months
_ you forget about the stakes and lower your anxiety level and it
becomes so routine that there's actually a chance that you might
have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Living in Los Angeles presents its own set of challenges as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Yeah. For one thing, when one business dominates a
city, like the movie business does here, it becomes a lot like high
school. You know who all the cool kids are and who the geeks are.
And being an out-of-work actor-writer-director wanna-be, I was not
one of the cool kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And yet, you got the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Amazing, isn't it? People ask me, `What kind of film
is this? Documentary? Romantic comedy? What?' And really, it's a
public service announcement. The message: If I can meet someone,
then anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, you were married once.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sure. But it's like my dad. He wasn't a ladies' man,
but he got it right once. You can be a total failure with women and
you can still manage to scrape together a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After you met Elisabeth and hit it off, you still had to go
out on more dates to finish the movie. That's not exactly a recipe
for harmony in a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She was upset, and I can't tell you why she put up
with it. She's not an actress and she's kind of shy. She just had a
good sense of humor about it and trusted me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds almost too good to be true. Do some people question
her authenticity?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: She's carrying around an engagement ring. That's my
proof that she's real.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other dates? Some seem real. Others come off a
little scripted.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: This isn't a documentary. I shaped reality by
provoking people. Just the mere fact that the camera was there
shaped reality. And then taking the 120 hours of film we shot and
compressing it into an 88-minute movie shapes reality. I could have
made 20 different movies with the footage we shot, each telling a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You certainly have no reservations about looking bad. You're
pretty rude to some of the women and other times really hard on
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I think that's why the movie works. The audience sees
me and I'm one of them. I've got my good points and my bad points.
I'm human. People can relate every time I do something bad or say
the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The encounter with your ex-wife was particularly raw. Did you
ever forget the camera crew was there?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Sometimes you do. My ex-wife and I know how to push
each others' buttons. Emotions get stoked and you're off and
running. Being on a date also makes you forget about the camera
because it's such an intense, emotional experience. After an hour
of laying yourself bare, you do forget you're being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of the women diQ't know they were being filmed, which
presented a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: It did. I diQ't know that was against the law here.
It differs from state to state. In New York, you can, which is how
you get shows like ``Taxi Cab Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: One date threatened to sue. At another point, you mention
further legal problems ...
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: We had several lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And more than a few rejections.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Yeah, but between acting and trying to sell scripts
for 12 years, I've had thousands and thousands of rejections. So
it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you've sold a movie, has your life changed?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I can afford to eat. I've been working on this movie
for three years, wearing four hats _ actor, writer, producer,
director. That's one reason I diQ't propose to Elisabeth sooner. We
never had a normal life together until now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you propose?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: Elisabeth's idea of a perfect date was going on a
helicopter ride around the city. Why, I don't know. I think it's
stupid. But I finally scratched some money together for a
helicopter ride and that's when I proposed. We landed and we went
out to dinner with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gee, that sounds kind of romantic. Did making this movie
change you in that regard?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: I am and always have been a cynic. But I think it was
Oscar Wilde who said something like, ``A cynic is just a romantic
who has had his heart broken a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last question: Where are you going on your honeymoon?
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz: (Grimaces) Paris. You see, I really have changed.

VIACOM TAKES ANOTHER NEW-MEDIA ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Hard on the heels of Disney, NBC and USA
Networks, another big old-media company decided this week that it
needed a bigger bite of the new-media world.
</P>
<P>
   But Viacom and its flinty Yankee of a chairman, Sumner Redstone,
decided to take a very different tack from big competitors, who all
dropped hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars buying
portal sites such as Lycos, Excite and Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Portals have been the Net's business buzzword of the past
several months, and everyone's been buying them at hugely inflated
prices, thanks to the overheated tech stock market. Portals offer a
raft of services to entice users to start there and stay long
enough to let the portal sell more advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To old-media minds used to thinking in television terms, portals
look a lot like big TV networks, aggregating lots and lots of
eyeballs that can interest big advertisers. So, the best way for
old media to go new, the thinking has been, is to buy a portal.
</P>
<P>
   The portal play has paid off for some: Disney's relentlessly
cross-promoted Go Network _ flush with established properties like
the online sites for ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel and sporting some
interesting parental-controls software _ promptly shot up to No. 4
in Media Metrix's monthly Web traffic surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a guaranteed success, as USA Networks found out,
when both its stock and Lycos' took a pounding after their merger
was announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Sumner Redstone, you're not all that ecstatic about
having to pay billions of dollars for some portal and arguing that
that's going to create a viable Internet presence,'' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Besides, ``Anything you buy now is second or third tier. That's all
that's left on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices high and selection grim, the penurious Redstone took
a much cheaper route, and one his company knows well.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Viacom made billions by dominating specific demographic
segments (kids and youth-oriented music) with its hugely successful
cable television channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1, it now will do
the same thing on the Internet, driving its young and younger TV
viewers to the Web sites and back again with heavy cross-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the intriguing additions will be Imagine Radio, the
Brisbane, Calif.-based startup that has been providing highly
personalized Internet ``radio'' for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom bought Imagine for a reported pittance, and it is
planning to expand its offerings from about 30 to more than 100
genres of music.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners can create custom ``stations'' that play a mix of
music from whatever of those genres they like.
</P>
<P>
   The Imagine music player also will allow listeners to rate
individual songs, buy albums and merchandise, get concert and band
information, and access live chats and well-regarded independent
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The sites _ tentatively named Project Nozzle for children and
the Buggles Project for music _ also feature the digital TV
channels that Viacom already is offering to satellite-dish owners.
</P>
<P>
   Though it will be awhile before there are enough high-speed
Internet connections for most people to watch those digital
channels on their computer/TV/convergence device, this is indeed
where entertainment is going.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, it's nice to see somebody in the old media
figuring out a slightly different way to go new. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VETERANS WANTED: Veterans have long told their war stories, but now
they have a place to put them, in the California Military Museum in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned museum is looking for personal stories, photos
and other memorabilia from California veterans that it can include
on its Web site at (www.militarymuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   If you have material you think may be appropriate, contact the
museum at webmastermilitarymuseum.org, or write to California
Military Museum, with attention to CSM Dan Sebby, Web site manager,
1119 Second St., Sacramento, Calif. 93814. You also can call the
museum at (916) 442-2883.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Web site already has an extensive amount of
information, including histories of California military
installations, units and ships. The Web site also includes an
events calendar, an online bookstore and lengthy listings of links
to other military history sites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCREEN SAVERS: Screen savers have long outlived their direct
usefulness preserving your monitor from phosphor burn-in problems,
but that doesn't mean they still can't be fun.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, KaizenWorks Publishing of Santa Monica is selling
a series of quote-of-the-day screen savers that also include
changing photos, backing music, and the ability to print out the
thoughts as note cards and daily agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14 Day-Savor titles are ones based on the ``Chicken
Soup for the Soul'' series and the game show ``Jeopardy!'' plus
motivational and educational quotes, ``angel messages'' and Bible
verses, golfing tips and daily astrology for all signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Day-Savors can be purchased on floppy disks or CD-ROM for
$16.95 in office supply or gift stores, or bought online-downloaded
at www.daysavor.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HANKS AND THE WEB: And finally, words to live by, from actor Tom
Hanks, star of the recent online romance yarn ``You've Got Mail''
and the substantially (and justifiably) less well-remembered
``Bosom Buddies.'' ``Don't ever make the mistake of searching for
your own name on the Internet,'' said Hanks backstage at the recent
People's Choice Awards in Pasadena. ``I found out more about
``Bosom Buddies'' than I ever knew, and I was one of the Bosom
Buddies.'' &QL;

   Almost three years after a Texas naturalist discovered it in
Brazil's Amazon rain forest, the colorful little bird with the big
voice still lacks a name.
</P>
<P>
   Soon that is expected to change.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Fort Worth, the Texas Audubon Society will mark its
100th anniversary by auctioning rights to name the new-found
antshrike.
</P>
<P>
   But that privilege will cost a lot of bird seed _ bidding starts
at $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winning bidder will have an indelible link to a living
organism,'' said Brett Whitney, who discovered the bird in Brazil's
western Acre state in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Brazil, Whitney said, ``This is a
way to honor significant contributors to conservation. It's like a
person who contributes a large sum to a hospital and then has a
wing of a building named after him.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder may name the bird for whomever he pleases.
``They can name it for their dog or their grandmother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John James Audubon, the 19th-century naturalist and artist for
whom the society is named, frequently named birds in honor of his
friends' children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intrinsic value in the name,'' added Noreen
Damude, bird conservation director for Texas Audubon. ``But the
namer will be immortalized. As long as there are birds and
ornithology, the name and the story of who gave it its name will be
in the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Also to go on the auction block at the society's centennial gala
will be birding tours, a set of bird prints by Fort Worth artists
Stuart and Scott Gentling, birdhouses and feeders and other bird
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Audubon Society was founded in March 1899 by two
Galveston women who were eager to rescue birds from the altar of
fashion. Women's hats of the era bristled with feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, said spokeswoman Pamela McCroskery, the organization
claims 40,000 members in 20 chapters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, 43, trained in biology and co-owner of an Austin
eco-tourism agency, discovered the new antshrike while surveying
wildlife with Brazilian bird experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a very poorly explored region about three days from
the nearest settlement,'' he said. ``We had traveled down shallow
rivers into the rain forest, and had camped on a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I awoke at the crack of dawn to the song of a bird I couldn't
recognize. I'm acknowledged as an expert in bird song, and this one
was very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney _ who previously had discovered unknown birds in South
America and Madagascar _ tape-recorded the song, then played it
back to lure the bird into sight.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day, he had captured two birds. The 7-inch-long male
was blue-gray, while the female was splashed with orange from
throat to belly. Both had dramatically hooked beaks for capturing
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, people think they have discovered a new species only to
later find that it already had been recorded,'' Whitney said.
``There was no way a specimen of this bird was lying around in some
museum. It was too distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional experience for me. This was
tremendously exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, discoverers of new species name them when they
report their findings in scholarly journals. Whitney assigned
naming rights to the Audubon Society to promote its conservation
efforts. The winning bidder will designate the bird's formal Latin
name and suggest a popular English name.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the top bidder will receive a tape-recording of its
song, photographs and a painting of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Damude said three-fourths of the money raised through the
auction of the bird's name will be used to finance her group's
Texas Important Bird Areas Program.
</P>
<P>
   Through that effort, Audubon officials hope to identify critical
habitats of many of the 613 bird species that live in or pass
through Texas and work with private and public landowners to
preserve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely voluntary program,'' Damude said, noting
that her organization's role largely will be providing preservation
expertise. ``There is no pressure, no regulation. My experience is
that land owners are proud of their land, their native animals and
plants. It's the joy of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them and us, this could be a win/win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction will be 6 to 9 p.m. CST Friday at the Bass
Performance Hall in Fort Worth. Out-of-town residents may submit
bids by telephone by calling (512) 426-5768 during the hours of the
auction.

UNDERCOVER TEXAS `HIT MAN' SNARES THE DESPERATE IN THEIR OWN WEBS
OF EVIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Want somebody dead?
</P>
<P>
   If so, Gary F. Johnson wants your business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offer them not only a quick solution,'' Johnson says, ``but
I promise them they won't get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch, however. Johnson is a senior investigator for
the Harris County district attorney's office who specializes in the
undercover art of posing as a hit man in the Houston area. Go to
him with a problem and you could end up wishing you were dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Johnson has played the role of hired killer
in more than 300 cases. Just 57 of them have resulted in
convictions, but he says that's because many people aren't serious
or come to their senses and back out before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who didn't are now in prison, providing Johnson with a
list of grim anecdotes, some funny, some sad.
</P>
<P>
   Jealous husbands and wives, scorned lovers, bitter ex-spouses,
disgruntled business partners, people looking to get rich or get
rid of a witness, gang members and drug dealers wanting to send a
message to a rival or a snitch. Whether they're from the affluent
River Oaks area in Houston or a trailer park they all have one
thing in common _ desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Some have offered big money, family heirlooms and other
valuables. One woman who had embezzled $1 million needed a business
associate dead. She offered Johnson an expensive racing boat that
had been reported stolen in an insurance scam.
</P>
<P>
   Others have offered next to nothing. One teen offered him three
$1 bills, $2 in change and some old Atari video games to kill a
former classmate he thought might one day date a girl whom he might
want to date.
</P>
<P>
   There was another teen who offered a cheap stereo and whatever
money he could raise if Johnson would choke his mom, revive her,
choke her, revive her, and so on until finally strangling her, so
she would ``die five or six times.''
</P>
<P>
   Coy Wayne Wesbrook, who killed five people in November 1998 and
is now on death row, told a cellmate as his capital murder trial
started last summer that he needed a hit man to kill five people
for him, including three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wesbrook's cellmate talked to authorities and led him to believe
that Johnson would kill the five for nothing because he owed the
cellmate a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Johnson and Wesbrook talked on the phone and Wesbrook set
up the deal. But their conversations were taped, and then used in
Wesbrook's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting a hit with someone you've never met, maybe through a
cellmate you've just met, may seem illogical and desperate, but
Johnson says it is not atypical of his ``clients.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We want something and we want it now. We hire somebody to
pick up our garbage, and we hire people to fix our TVs,'' Johnson
said. ``We want our problems solved now. And when people become
frustrated, their cognitive skills diminish. They become blind to
other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just concerned with eliminating the pain in their
life, whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Johnson knows how to handle those people and can deliver
a good case without entrapment, he's in high demand from
authorities in Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   The former Louisiana and Port Arthur, Texas, lawman has a
master's degree in psychology and knows what juries want and what
makes defense attorneys wince, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is always thinking of the courtroom while he's playing
the undercover role,'' said Ted Wilson, chief of the district
attorney's office major offenders division. ``He knows what a jury
is going to have to decide and always keeps that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has been with the district attorney's office since
1981, says he follows some simple rules:
</P>
<P>
   _ The person always has to come to him. Whether first contact is
made through a snitch or an undercover officer for another agency,
Johnson never makes the first call.
</P>
<P>
   _ He doesn't make the hit seem so risk-free or appealing that
the person couldn't possibly refuse. The target gets lots of
chances to back out.
</P>
<P>
   _ And Johnson, an expert in high-tech surveillance, videotapes
or records every meeting with a target. That leaves nothing to
chance in court, and jurors are often treated to dialogue usually
heard only in bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time an offshore oil worker wanted his wife dead. He
had taken her to a clinic and told doctors she was suicidal, though
she wasn't. He then hired Johnson to slit her wrists and comfort
her as she died.
</P>
<P>
   Then the husband, with a solid alibi provided by his work, was
going to claim the insurance money and sue the clinic that said she
wasn't suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Johnson does so well because he doesn't talk too
much, ``a rookie mistake.'' He lets the clients do most of the
talking, doesn't intimidate them and projects an understanding,
sympathetic demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, Wilson says, because a defense attorney might
argue that a client became afraid that if he didn't go through with
the scheme, Johnson would turn on him.
</P>
<P>
   When he's being himself, Johnson is polite, thoughtful and
humorous, a thin man who looks nothing like your stereotypical
thug. He admits to being a bit eccentric, and his dark office is
full of enough high-tech electronics to make a 14-year-old drool.
During a recent visit, Willie Nelson was singing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But adjust the clothes, change the attitude and Johnson looks
like a character you might meet in an Elmore Leonard novel, the
perfect undercover man, with a forgettable face and a low-key
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the most nondescript person in the world,'' he said. ``I'm
the guy who goes to a party and people don't even know I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he has to testify, Johnson slips in and out of the
courthouse without making a ripple. He does his bit on the stand,
then melts into the group of troubled souls who walk the halls.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes sure his face doesn't show up on the television
news or in the newspaper. The reason should be obvious _ he never
knows what his next role will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adapt to different situations well. It's a rush,'' he said.
``It's the closest to being in the zone that you can get. You know
you're a good undercover officer if they don't clap. If they
applaud, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Johnson can't have a little fun. One man had
tried, in vain, to beat someone to death with a metal pipe and was
out on bail. He wanted Johnson to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   So there was no mistake, Johnson told an intermediary to have
the man meet him in a diner, where he would be at the counter
eating a piece of pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That looks like good pie,'' the man would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All pie is good pie,'' was Johnson's prearranged response.
Then, they would talk business.
</P>
<P>
   And it happened just that way. Just like in a bad movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe he said it,'' Johnson said. ``I wanted to
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a pro, he didn't. The man offered him $1,500 for the job
and more if he wasn't questioned by police. The man was arrested
later.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says the work has also reinforced some of life's grimmer
lessons, especially how low the human soul can creep.
</P>
<P>
   One girl offered him her grandfather's wedding band if he would
kill a woman who was dating her ex-boyfriend. Nothing special about
that, but she insisted that Johnson should also kill the woman's
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The girl explained to Johnson that she was trying to consider
the best interests of the child. After all, with mom dead, the baby
would be an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also offered me $80 of her child-support money if she
could watch,'' Johnson said. ``It was the first time I think I was
ever offered a bonus.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 2:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEW-PLANETS (Undated) _ At last count, astronomers in the
United States and Europe have observed 18 nearby sunlike stars
showing telltale motions from the gravity of large, unseen planets
orbiting them, and they fully expect to find more. Yet they suspect
they have seen enough to begin rethinking how nature creates and
destroys planets and choreographs their orbital minuets. By John
Noble Wilford. (2350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SMOKING-CESSATION (Undated) _ A new approach combining an
anti-depressant, nicotine-replacement and counseling is sharply
increasing the chance of success of people who are trying to give
up smoking. By Holcomb B. Noble.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LOWCOST-ROCKETS (Washington) _ An experimental rocket that
is at the heart of NASA's plans to develop a low-cost, reusable
vehicle that might eventually replace the space shuttle has fallen
more than a year behind schedule for its first flight because of
mounting technical problems. By Warren E. Leary. (1625 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EARLIER-SPRINGS (Undated) _ Separate studies using different
methods in the last three years have found that as the earth's
atmosphere warms, spring is arriving earlier and autumn is coming
later in the Northern Hemisphere. But much of the evidence has been
indirect. Now a direct examination of the actual behavior of plants
across Europe appears to confirm the earlier findings. By William
K. Stevens. (1220 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FEAR (Undated) _ An examination of what psychologists call
the fearful by nature. It's not a disease, but a temperamental
flavor. An essay by Natalie Angier. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short items on science: preparing air,
food and water in space; carbon dioxide around a moon of Jupiter; a
tough new glass. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column:
Researchers have discovered that many elderly people suffer health
problems because of bad nutrition. Partly as result, the Department
of Agriculture has devised a food pyramid for people over 70. By
Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OCTUPLETS-EYES (Undated) _ Doctors treating the seven
remaining octuplets are on the lookout for retinopathy of
prematurity, a condition that could leave them blind. While they
are all doing well, the status of their eyesight will be in doubt
for weeks. Doctors are using lasers to help prevent the retina from
detaching, but that carries the risk of limiting the victim's side
vision. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1675 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.

   SCI-CIRCUMCISION (Undated) _ The American Academy of Pediatrics,
which issued a new circumcision policy yesterday, has had three
different policies in as many decades. In the 1970s, the academy
said there was no ``medical indication'' for circumcision. In 1989,
it reported ``potential medical benefits.'' Now, the 55,000-member
academy has concluded that while there are potential benefits, the
data are ``not significant enough'' to recommend routine
circumcision. By Deborah Stead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGANGUEO, Mexico _ His weathered face shaded under a
sweat-stained straw hat, Francisco Ambrocia Martinez pronounces the
still-unfamiliar words carefully, a bit uneasily _ words like
``ecosystem,'' ``reforestation'' and ``ecology.''
</P>
<P>
   A peasant farmer for the last 15 years, he appears a little
uncomfortable with his new role as environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made the decision to protect this place, so that it will
still be here for our children and their children,'' says Ambrocia,
standing in front of a thin stream that cuts through stands of tall
oyamel firs.
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the sky is a living blizzard of orange, filled with
the muffled flick-flick of tens of thousands of butterflies. They
dip and glide around Ambrocia, dropping a few at a time to flutter
on top of the water, where they drink deeply in preparation for a
long journey ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrocia is standing in what is perhaps a unique place on Earth
_ the winter home of the vast majority of monarch butterflies that,
in the summer, flit across back yards throughout the eastern United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   According to environmentalists and many scientists, this place
may also be one of the world's most endangered. The forest high in
the mountains of southern Mexico, they say, provides a lesson in
how hard it is to protect even the most precious of natural
treasures in the face of desperate poverty and rancorous politics.
</P>
<P>
   The region's poverty has for generations pushed communities to
cut more deeply into the forest on which the butterflies depend. A
recent boom in tourism, however, has turned some people from
pillagers into protectors, providing what environmentalists say may
be the best hope for saving this spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In comparative terms, this is like a human masterpiece of the
scale of `The Last Supper' or Teotihuacan,'' the massive pyramids
outside Mexico City, environmentalist Homero Aridjis says of the
region's forests and the butterflies they support. ``It's now or
never. This is our final opportunity to save what is basically a
biological masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the area was found by a Canadian researcher in 1975,
scientists searched for more than three decades to locate the few
hundred acres of cloud forest in the state of Michaocan, west of
Mexico City, where as many as 100 million butterflies gather energy
for the trip north. In an incredible feat of navigation, almost the
entire population of monarchs east of the Rockies converges here
every November.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the great mysteries of science, the
butterfly colonies that return here are three generations removed
from the ones that left. Scientists are still uncertain how such an
enormous population _ and one so widely dispersed _ can find its
way to a tiny spot that none of the monarchs has ever seen. It is
clear, though, that these mountains provide the rare combination of
temperature, water and seasonal change crucial for the migratory
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two years, the number of monarchs wintering
here has diminished by 70 percent. Researchers are still arguing
over why. Reasons may vary from the El Nino weather phenomenon to
dry conditions along the migration route. Mexican scientists say
the population drop could simply be cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic size of the decrease worries many top
scientists and environmentalists, who are increasingly concerned
about logging, erosion and watershed degradation in the monarchs'
winter home.
</P>
<P>
   If the destruction continues, it may break the migratory cycle
entirely, they fear, and North America's summer monarchs could
virtually disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction of the forests would eliminate the capacity of
the butterflies to survive the winter down there, effectively
wiping out this migration,'' says Chip Taylor, a monarch expert at
the University of Kansas. ``That forest is really the Achilles'
heel of this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A decree from Mexico's president protected nearly 40,000 acres
in five butterfly sanctuaries created in 1986. Logging is banned on
about 28 percent of the land, and it is allowed only by permit on
the rest. Investigators say, however, that trucks full of illegal
logs still come out of some protected areas at night.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the trees are cut not for big profits but to meet the
barest of needs. An entire oyamel sells on the region's open market
for as little as $8 to $10. For the peasant farmers who still own
the preserves, however, logging has been a prime source of income.
The land was given to them decades ago by the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping that it will become more lucrative to save the trees than
cut them down, many butterfly advocates are pinning their hopes on
the ecotourism that has begun to flourish here. As many as 5,000
tourists converge on these mountains each weekend between
mid-October and mid-April, filling the improvised parking lots and
hastily constructed paths that lead to the monarch colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrocia, who heads one of the 36 families that own most of the
land in the Sierra Chincua preserve, says tourism has turned into a
boon. Visitors pay $1.50 to enter the preserve, and the landowners
divide the proceeds. Two of Ambrocia's sons sell food to the
tourists, while another hocks T-shirts and monarch refrigerator
magnets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big source of income for us,'' Ambrocia says. ``It
makes sense to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty men, including Ambrocia, take turns standing watch in the
preserve 24 hours a day. Ambrocia says that illegal logging, at
least in his preserve, has virtually stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But ecotourism has brought its own problems. There is little
government regulation, and garbage is strewn along the paths. The
tourists raise noise and dust that, scientists say, may be harming
the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really ecotourism,'' says Monica Missrie, an
ecologist for the World Wildlife Foundation. ``It's just tourism.
There is nothing `eco' about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the butterfly colonies began moving from the cold
mountaintops to the warmer slopes below earlier than normal. That,
researchers say, was a direct result of the tourists' presence. It
could affect the monarchs' reproduction process, they fear.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem, scientists say, is that the preserves are
becoming islands of isolated forest. Landowners outside the
sanctuaries receive few benefits from the tourism, and logging is
continuing there at a furious pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the cutting comes closer,'' says Carmelo Martinez,
26, a member of a cooperative that owns part of one butterfly
preserve. ``Some don't understand that they shouldn't cut. Some
understand it but do it out of need.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that the growing isolation of the preserves is
affecting the health of the larger ecosystem on which the butterfly
colonies depend. And scientists have found new colonies outside the
protected zones.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers hope a solution will come later this year. The
Mexican government has agreed to revise the decree that protects
the preserves. Environmentalists want more land set aside. They
want tourism better regulated and the watersheds on which the
butterfly colonies depend protected.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics will likely be volatile. The 1986 decree
creating the preserves did not compensate owners for the new
restrictions on their land. Owners of one preserve immediately
logged their land in protest. The butterfly colonies there have
since moved or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is so sensitive that the World Wildlife Foundation
refuses to publicly release its recommendation for new preserve
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landowners are clamoring for the preserves to be
decreased, not increased,'' Missrie says. ``There are a lot of
different interests involved. It's a very conflictive area.''
</P>
<P>
   Government negotiations with landowners are set to begin this
fall. Many observers say the Mexican government appears aware of
the importance of the butterflies' winter home and seems willing to
go to greater lengths to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that Mexico's track record on environmental
protection has never been good. With presidential elections
scheduled for next year, the government may be unwilling to
alienate people who survive on the same land as the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities sometimes seem to be accomplices'' in
environmental destruction, says Aridjis, the Mexican
environmentalist. ``The authorities are too often on the wrong
side, protecting the transgressors. It's a lack of political will
to defend properly the environment.''

ANOTHER SIDE OF SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; As TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' Sarah
Michelle Gellar has become the idol of millions by vanquishing evil
while coping with teen-age insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   In her new movie, ``Cruel Intentions,'' Gellar could shock her
loyal following by embodying evil that ruthlessly exploits teen-age
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   An update of the 18th-century French novel ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'' set among modern, ultra-wealthy Manhattan teens, the
movie features TV's blond, buff Buffy as a dark-haired, heartless
manipulator who revels in vicious sexual gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I really am a brunette,'' the energetic 21-year-old
chirps. ``I think the fans will think it's a departure. It's
important that everyone remembers Buffy is a character I play, as
this girl Kathryn is a character I play. None of them are really
me. I hope everybody realizes that I am an actress and that I can
do other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Absurd as it sounds, Gellar's portrayal of the karate-chopping,
stake-wielding demon fighter has left her with a good-girl
reputation that's hard to shake. Even ``Intentions'' director Roger
Kumble had to be convinced that she could handle the relentlessly
nasty Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I initially talked to Sarah about the role, I asked `Are
you comfortable doing this? You're an icon on television,''' Kumble
recalls. ``She was like, `I'm an actor first. I'm really drawn to
this material, and I want to play this role.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kumble was hesitant despite evidence that Gellar could act very
bad indeed. Before ``Buffy,'' she played the chip-off-the-block
daughter of Susan Lucci's villainous Erica Kane on the daytime soap
opera ``All My Children'' _ and won an Emmy for it.
</P>
<P>
   But that teen-age terror was just a kid compared to ``Cruel's''
Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left the soap, I figured that, for the rest of my life,
I was going to be fighting the stereotype of the bad girl, the evil
vixen,'' Gellar reveals. ``And I was very young, which is a weird
time to feel that, which I did for a while. But then, all of a
sudden, I was Buffy, and I had to prove that I could do this
character that I figured I would be tagged as forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange turnaround, and it did take a little
convincing. It was still a change, too, because I don't think I was
as aware of my sexuality on `All My Children.' I was still a little
more awkward at that time; being 16 and trying to seduce Michael
Nader was not the greatest thing for me.'' Some aspects of
``Cruel'' were a little more comfortable. For one thing, Kathryn's
partner in serial seduction, her stepbrother Sebastian Valmont, was
played by a trusted friend: Ryan Phillippe, with whom she
co-starred in the hit horror thriller ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it easier to have a pre-established comfort level with
the person,'' says Phillippe, who exchanges both highly provocative
dialogue and teasing, intimate caresses with Gellar throughout the
movie. ``Sarah and I have developed, over the years, a kind of
antagonistic brother-sister repartee, and that lent itself to this
movie particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it certainly made the more physical bits less awkward,''
adds Phillippe, who in real life is romantically involved with
Reese Witherspoon, ``Cruel's'' other leading lady. ``It's much
easier to do that with someone you know well enough to understand
that there's not some imaginary line you're going to cross with
them, that they're going to smack you or something.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that the film required no female nudity and that
Gellar had no sex scenes. Nevertheless, the young trouper, who's
been working professionally for 15 years, did have difficulty with
one bit: her first kiss with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading up to it, I kept thinking, what's the big deal?''
Gellar reports. ``I kiss David Boreanaz (who plays Buffy's undead
boyfriend Angel on TV) all the time, and we're not intimately
involved. It shouldn't, technically, be any different; it's just
another actor in another scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to film the smooch with actress Selma
Blair (Zoe of `Buffy's'' WB sister show ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP;
Jane''), Gellar had a panic attack. And understandably so; the
scene took place on a warm spring day in New York's Central Park,
with hundreds of onlookers and dozens of paparazzi scrutinizing
every lip twitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, these pictures are going to wind up in a tabloid
somewhere with captions that make it look like they caught me doing
something,'' she recalls. ``All these things were going through my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' has the potential for putting a lot of
things in its target audience of impressionable young people's
heads. It is, after all, taken from the same story that inspired
the decidedly adult ``Liaisons Dangereuses'' stage hit and its two
R-rated movie interpretations, ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and
``Valmont,'' a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Cruel'' boasts an R rating, too, Gellar's participation
all but guarantees her younger teen fans will want to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great if you want to take your 17-year-old to
this movie, then discuss it afterward and make sure they understand
that this is not OK, this is not acceptable behavior,'' Gellar
says, as if adolescents are really going to attend the movie with
their parents. ``I'm glad that it does have an R rating. If it went
for a PG-13, the movie wouldn't have worked as well. And,
unfortunately, in public high schools these days there are a lot
worse things being discussed _ and happening _ than what goes on in
this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But parents still worry. Maybe they can take some comfort
in the fact that Gellar might not be the movie magnet her ``Buffy''
popularity would indicate. A month ago ``Simply Irresistible,'' a
lame romantic comedy/fantasy that was her first attempt at
headlining a feature, bombed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did some pretty nice work in it but, unfortunately,
it didn't turn out to be the movie we set out to make,'' Gellar
says of ``Simply.'' ``It was hard for me, but I learned a lesson
early and, hopefully, it didn't do me too much damage.''
</P>
<P>
   If a recent visit to San Diego was any indication, Gellar's
popularity hasn't waned in the least. And she's learning how to
deal with fame, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a movie with some friends, and when we got out, 50
people were waiting for us, and they followed us back to the hotel,
and it was getting dangerous,'' she says. ``A year ago, I would've
been crying, I would've been freaking out. But I knew how to deal
with it this time, and so did my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, stardom has its upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you learn how to take advantage of the perks, it's
incredible,'' she acknowledges. ``We also went to Sea World, where
they named three new baby otters Buffy, Willow and Xander (after
characters in the show). They gave us a backstage tour of Sea World
_ we got to go into the penguin habitat and play with the penguins,
which you're never allowed to do, feed a whale, play with the
dolphins _ it was this totally unbelievable day. Stuff like that is
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the (more-or-less) human Buffy, Xander, Angel and
company, their show is heading in some seriously new directions.
Boreanaz and another co-star, Charisma Carpenter, will leave at the
end of the current season to work on a spinoff series. And Buffy
herself will graduate from her high school that sits atop a portal
to hell in order to attend another disquieting institution in the
fall, college.
</P>
<P>
   What'll be the deal there? Wormhole into a demon dimension?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the writers are afraid we'll talk about it too much,
so they haven't really told us what's going to go on next year,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Gellar should be able to handle it. She claims
that stabiliy is a major virtue as far as she's concerned. And
ever since she first started doing commercials as a little girl in
New York City, Gellar has certainly displayed a maturity well
beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   Ask what her big passion in life is, and she'll tell you
collecting rare books. Whatever dating she does do is kept strictly
out of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar humbly suggests that her hard-working, self-controlled
demeanor may just be a characteristic of her generation of actors _
although that would make them the only show-biz group in human
history ever known for its premature maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not raucous, we're not wild, we don't go out and party
till 2 in the morning,'' she notes. ``You haven't heard one story
about this new group of actors I run with beating up photographers
or trashing a hotel room. We're a very sedate bunch. We're a group
that's about the job, about creating and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could pinpoint why,'' she muses. ``Maybe Hollywood is
just being pickier now. Maybe they're keeping this on the ones that
can handle it, the ones that can be successful and not let it crack
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they can pretend to be good at being very, very bad _
something Gellar says she learned how to mimic from hard experience
with experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows a Kathryn,'' Gellar says. ``I know
several, specifically. I went to school on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan with privileged girls that had a lot of wealth very early
and that had very little parental supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everyone may not know someone with Kathryn's kind of
power and wealth. But we all knew the bitch of the school, the one
that controls everything. High school is that hierarchy, and if
you're not in the most popular group, it is a miserable experience,
let's be honest. Anyone who says that they enjoyed high school is
either lying, or they were one of the most popular people, I always
say.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hollywood popularity is, of course, sweeter anyway. As
sweet, in fact, as vengeance. &QL;

   SCI-NEW-PLANETS (Undated) _ At last count, astronomers in the
United States and Europe have observed 18 nearby sunlike stars
showing telltale motions from the gravity of large, unseen planets
orbiting them, and they fully expect to find more. Yet they suspect
they have seen enough to begin rethinking how nature creates and

   SCI-EARLIER-SPRINGS (Undated) _ Separate studies using different
methods in the last three years have found that as the earth's
atmosphere warms, spring is arriving earlier and autumn is coming
later in the Northern Hemisphere. But much of the evidence has been
indirect. Now a direct examination of the actual behavior of plants
across Europe appears to confirm the earlier findings. By William
K. Stevens. (1220 words)

   SCI-OCTUPLETS-EYES (Undated) _ Doctors treating the seven

prematurity, a condition that could leave them blind. While they
are all doing well, the status of their eyesight will be in doubt
for weeks. Doctors are using lasers to help prevent the retina from

   SCI-CIRCUMCISION (Undated) _ The American Academy of Pediatrics,

said there was no ``medical indication'' for circumcision. In 1989,
it reported ``potential medical benefits.'' Now, the 55,000-member
academy has concluded that while there are potential benefits, the
data are ``not significant enough'' to recommend routine
circumcision. By Deborah Stead.

fruits as well as in certain processed foods and dietary
supplements, may sometimes be harmful because it negates the

a surprise, since in vitro studies showed that tangeretin acted
like tamoxifen to inhibit mammary cancer cells. (400 words)

down to avoid a repeat of the million-dollar bribery case that has
tarnished Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.

MATH COMES EASILY FOR THESE HUMAN CALCULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They looked like typical middle school students
_ baggy jeans, mouths full of metal and impossible to quiet down in
the cafeteria. No pocket protectors or taped-up glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But watch out if they tackle a math problem. And no calculators,
please.
</P>
<P>
   What is the square root of 120 times the square root of 30? It
took seconds for the kid to come up with the correct answer: 60.
</P>
<P>
   The annual MathCounts competition Saturday pitted teams from 10
public, parochial and private middle schools in San Francisco in
grueling and fast-paced tests of logic, skill and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The competition has been sponsored by the National Society of
Professional Engineers since 1983. The top two teams, plus an
all-star team made up of the top four individuals, will go onto the
state competition next month at the University of California at
Davis. If successful, they could then proceed to the nationals in
May in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Vadim Keyfes, an eighth-grader at Presidio Middle School, said
he likes the logic of math.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the same. One plus one is always two,'' he said.
``It's not like literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning session, which included 20 minutes for the team to
solve 10 problems and 40 minutes for individuals to solve 30
problems, can be humbling, said Armen Sedrakian, math teacher at
Presidio Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students come out shell-shocked,'' he said. ``Everybody
thinks they did terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculate this: What is the sum of the two least prime numbers
greater than 100? Answer: 204.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to being the smartest'' at their school, said
Richard Meyers, the math coach from Visitacion Valley Middle
School. ``Suddenly they realize there's more out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the students prepared for the contest all school
year, few admitted to any special pre-competition rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Luo of A.P. Giannini Middle School honed his mind Saturday
morning with television. ``I watched cartoons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His team came in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce MacMartin, an eighth-grader at San Francisco Community
School, said he did a chant with a couple teammates to prepare
himself mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said `Get pumped!' and slapped each other in the chest,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He came in third place in the afternoon round.
</P>
<P>
   Rena Kuliyeva, an eighth-grader at Giannini Middle School, knew
her strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like geometry with triangles and I like equations, but I
don't like prime numbers or probability,'' she said.

a scene from ``The Deep End of the Ocean.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Michelle Pfeiffer was 5 when she disappeared.
 &HT;    It was midnight in Santa Ana, Calif., and the prettiest little
girl on the block had decided to go for a walk. Alone.
 &HT;    ``I remember I loved being at my neighbor's house down the
street,'' the actress recalls, ``so I went over there determined to
wake up my little friends. The children answered the door, and I
asked them to hide me so my parents wouldn't find out what I had
done.''
 &HT;    The Pfeiffers were having a poker party that night, but almost
instinctively Michelle's mother decided to check on the oldest of
her four children.
 &HT;    ``My mom saw my empty bed,'' Pfeiffer recalls, ``and she was
literally in a panic.''
 &HT;    It was 1963, but a missing child was no less heart-stopping than
today. But a quick search of the block produced a sleepy, smiling
Michelle, who promised never again to go visiting on her own.
 &HT;    Over coffee on an early morning at Los Angeles' Four Seasons
Hotel, Pfeiffer looks back on the incident wistfully.
 &HT;    ``As much as I scared my folks that night,'' she says, ``I still
don't think my parents had the same fears I have now. As a child, I
would run barefoot through my neighborhood. I could knock on any
neighbor's door and not be afraid. My kids can't do that, which is
sad.''
 &HT;    A disappearing child figures in Pfeiffer's new film ``The Deep
End of the Ocean'' opening March 12. Based on Jacqueline Mitchard's
best-selling book, it stars Pfeiffer _ who also co-produced the
film _ as a young mother whose child vanishes in a crowded hotel
lobby, not to be seen again for years.
 &HT;    Pfeiffer admits that acting out every mother's worst nightmare
made her heart pound.
 &HT;    ``When I decided to do this movie, I had to allow myself to go
beyond that point where as a mother you say, `What if?''' the
actress says. ``It was actually so unpleasant for those first few
weeks of shooting that I really questioned why I chose to do this
at all.
 &HT;    ``After all, I am the mother who walked out halfway through the
movie `Ransom' because I couldn't take it anymore.''
 &HT;    The effect has lingered for Pfeiffer, who is married to
television producer/writer David E. Kelley, creator of ``The
Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' and has two children.
 &HT;    ``A few weeks after filming the scene where Ben disappears, I
was in a store and I told our 6-year-old daughter Claudia to hold
our 4-year-old son John's hand,'' she recalls. ``Suddenly I had a
cold chill _ I realized this was the exact line from the movie.
`Hold his hand.'
 &HT;    ``Now, after doing this movie, I never let my kids out of my
sight,'' she says. ``I think I've become a bit paranoid.''
 &HT;    If expert opinion counts for anything, ``Deep End of the Ocean''
ought to do well: An industry magazine recently named Pfeiffer as
the female star who has the most appeal at the box office. Not bad
for a former supermarket-checkout girl and beauty queen who first
caught the public eye parading around in hotpants in ``Grease 2''
(1982).
 &HT;    ``My new ranking raises a few eyebrows, don't you think?''
Pfeiffer says bemusedly. ``I mean, when they say highest-paid
actress in Hollywood, it's not me. It's Julia or Jodie.
 &HT;    ``I think they sort of figured out whose movies never make
money,'' she says, laughing. ``And then they looked at me and said,
`Hey, she's still doing fairly well. She's still here.'''
 &HT;    And how. Her upcoming projects include ``A Midsummer's Night
Dream,'' with Kevin Kline and Calista Flockhart, due out this
spring. She's currently filming ``The Story of Us,'' a comedy about
a marriage on the rocks which co-stars Bruce Willis. Next up is
``What Lies Beneath,'' a supernatural thriller with Harrison Ford.
 &HT;    ``I'm over 40,'' she says with a laugh. ``Can you imagine? I
didn't think Hollywood allows women all this good fortune when you
hit that number.''
 &HT;    It represents an almost-literal dream come true for Pfeiffer,
who had wanted to be an actress since even before she won a Miss
Orange County beauty pageant.
 &HT;    ``I remember working at that supermarket, knowing that I wanted
to do something else,'' she recalls. ``I knew that, of everything
in the world, acting was what I wanted to do, although it seemed
like a ridiculous dream at the time. But I thought, `Why not?' I
was naive enough not realize the kind of hurdle I was trying to
climb.''
 &HT;    The road to success included ``embarrassing TV shows'' such as
``Delta House'' (1979) and ``movies that were even worse,''
including ``The Hollywood Knights'' (1980).
 &HT;    ``I think the real turning point for me was when I did a TV
movie called `The Children Nobody Wanted' (1981),'' she says. ``It
was the first project where I couldn't wear any makeup and had to
look as bad as possible. That was huge for me _ I was actually
hired for my acting ability and not my looks.
 &HT;    ``And then I did `Grease 2,' which gave me exposure _ for better
or worse.'' She sighs. ``That movie made me vow to never wear
hotpants in public again.''
 &HT;    Movies including ``Scarface'' (1983), ``The Witches of
Eastwick'' (1987), ``Married to the Mob'' (1988), ``The Fabulous
Baker Boys'' (1989) and ``Batman Returns'' (1992) put Pfeiffer on
the map, and suddenly she was an A-list star.
 &HT;    ``The bad part of becoming a movie star is that I'm still shy,''
she says. ``It is still hard for me to overcome my fear of
strangers. I remember early on my publicist telling me, `Michelle,
don't run from the press _ it makes it worse. Just stand there and
let them take your picture.'
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, I would be hyperventilating thinking, `OK, OK, OK.'
And then I would literally run. I wanted to run away.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, Pfeiffer says, the tabloids leave her alone.
 &HT;    ``I'm married, which equals `boring' for them,'' she says with a
laugh.
 &HT;    Her marriage to Kelley followed a failed first marriage to Peter
Horton (Gary on ``Thirtysomething''), as well as relationships with
Michael Keaton, John Malkovich and Fisher Stevens. Pfeiffer also
briefly dated Eric Clapton and Val Kilmer.
 &HT;    Then she met Kelley on a blind date.
 &HT;    ``I just knew. Of course, I didn't know right away, because
David didn't talk on our blind date and I didn't talk,'' she says,
laughing. ``So it took awhile for us to get to know each other. But
he's very internal, just like me. People might think David doesn't
like them, but he's just an observer.''
 &HT;    In 1993, Pfeiffer adopted Claudia as a single mother. Two weeks
later, friends invited to Claudia's christening got an extra
surprise: Kelley and Pfeiffer's wedding vows.
 &HT;    ``My family all sort of came together at once,'' the actress
says with a laugh. ``Suddenly we were this team.''
 &HT;    Amid the challenges of combining two high-powered careers with
parenthood, Pfeiffer says that her 40th birthday passed virtually
unnoticed.
 &HT;    ``For me, I think turning 39 was actually a little worse,'' she
says. ``It was the anticipation. I spent the next year agonizing
over it, but then 40 came and I was over it.''
 &HT;    Of course, it helps that she looks better than most
30-year-olds.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I look in the mirror and see a little line here or
there,'' she says, smiling. ``For a working mother, I think I'm
holding up pretty well.''

 Includes a color slide of rock singer/songwriter Billy Joel. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Billy Joel has had his share of idols and musical inspirations
since he started writing songs more than three decades ago. You can
guess most of them _ Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles,
John Lennon.
 &HT;    But these days, the 49-year-old musician finds a more appealing
model in the composer George Gershwin.
 &HT;    ``He wrote a lot of great popular music and then turned to
writing classical music, and then continued to write popular songs
very, very well,'' Joel explains.
 &HT;    ``I don't think he felt one genre couldn't live without the
other,'' he adds. ``I think you have to go with what you're
feeling. If I was motivated to write a lot of songs right now, I
definitely would not stop myself _ I'd go with it. But at the
moment I'm inspired to write this kind of music.''
 &HT;    ``This kind of music'' is all-instrumental, classically oriented
piano pieces that the Piano Man has been working on for the past
four years. What began as an experiment has become an obsession,
and in 1997 Joel surprised his fans by announcing that he had given
up writing lyric-driven pop songs in favor of sweeping instrumental
melodies.
 &HT;    And now the man who on March 15 will be inducted into the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame is enjoying the best of both worlds. While he
hasn't produced a pop song since 1993 _ when he wrote the
ironically titled ``Famous Last Words'' _ he continues to dust off
his past hits for periodic concert tours while devoting his
creative energies to classical music.
 &HT;    ``I used to get the same kick out of writing a song,'' he says.
``As the years went on, I started getting frustrated by the
confinements of pop songwriting. You can't develop a melody more
than a certain amount of notes before you end the first verse and
you've got to start the second verse. There are time constraints,
attention spans. There are certain instruments that define it as
rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``None of that has anything to do with composition except for
basic, basic composition,'' Joel says. ``And it became frustrating.
I want to take a melody and see how far I can develop it ... as
opposed to thinking `How is this going to be sung?' or if it's
going to be played on the radio or do I have to make a video?''
 &HT;    The Long Island-born Joel, who gave up boxing as a youth to
pursue the musical ambitions that launched him to stardom with the
multi-million-selling album, ``The Stranger'' (1977) _ says that
he's finished about eight classical pieces so far.
 &HT;    Stylistically, most of them draw on mid-19th-century
romanticism, he says, ``which is really where most songwriters
hearken back to, anyway, in terms of the kinds of melodies we
write. I think we all go back to Schubert.''
 &HT;    So far, he adds, the joy has been in the composing of his new
music rather than performing or recording it. In fact, despite
frequent inquiries from his record company and various orchestras,
he has no current plans to have the music performed at all.
 &HT;    ``It's the writing of it that's jazzing me,'' Joel says. ``I'm
not necessarily the guy to perform this stuff _ although it would
make it easier for Columbia Records to market it if I was
performing it.
 &HT;    ``I think the best way to have it presented, if I'm going to
present it at all, would be to have a hired gun, a pistolero,
somebody who is classically trained,'' he adds. ``I am not by any
stretch of the imagination an accomplished virtuoso concert
pianist. In rock 'n' roll, I'm great _ but in terms of classical
music, I stink.''
 &HT;    For the record, Joel actually has written one pop song during
the past year. Inspired by his past sojourns in France, it was
called ``Champs d'Elysee.'' But his enthusiasm for it was quashed
when he brought it in to rehearsal and his guitarist looked at it
and said, ``Are we doing a song called `The Champ's Eyelashes?'''
 &HT;    ``You can't beat that,'' Joel says with a laugh. ``No matter
what I ended up writing about, it will forever be known as `The
Champ's Eyelashes.' It was kind of a wake-up call _ I might as well
be writing about the champ's eyelashes.''
 &HT;    But Joel's new musical path doesn't mean he's abandoning his old
repertoire. His entire catalog was recently remastered and
reissued, with video clips added to the enhanced CDs. And Joel has
no problem singing those songs on tour, even if his new material is
of an entirely different ilk.
 &HT;    Actually, he says, assembling a good touring show is an art of
its own, involving a balancing act between popular hits and the
music that he or his musicians may more enjoy playing.
 &HT;    ``I think you have to do a certain amount of songs that the
audience would be disappointed if you don't do, like `Piano Man'
and a couple of other known songs,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``What makes for a good cohesive show is a certain amount of
songs that are familiar, a certain amount of songs that are purely
indulgent on the musicians' part and then the songs that hold
everything together,'' Joel adds. ``There has to be a tradeoff _
you can't just do every single song that only the audience wants. I
think you've got to balance it.''
 &HT;    Not that Joel doesn't appreciate his hits, the 30-something Top
40 favorites such as ``Only the Good Die Young,'' ``Just the Way
You Are,'' ``My Life'' and ``It's Still Rock and Roll to Me'' that
have led to nearly 100 million albums sold worldwide and, of
course, the Hall of Fame enshrinement which, he admits, is an honor
that he savors.
 &HT;    ``Rock 'n' roll really saved my life,'' he says, ``and even
though I'm not writing it right now, the major part of my life was
spent writing, recording and playing rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``I know people may have an image of me as this guy playing in a
piano bar,'' Joel says, ``but I only did that for six months. And
ever since I became a professional musician when I was in my late
teens, that's really what I've been doing up until about four years
ago. It's the majority of my life.
 &HT;    ``So, yeah, it will be nice to be there.''

 Includes a color slide of Kyle Chandler in a scene from ``Early
Edition.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the little television drama that could. CBS' ``Early
Edition'' has overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to emerge
as, if not a blockbuster, at least a solid middle-of-the-pack hit.
</P>
<P>
   It had to overcome its title, an ill-chosen moniker which to
most people sounds like some ``60 Minutes'' clone.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's its time slot, an early-evening berth in that
television netherworld known as Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's not even mentioning its premise, a farfetched fantasy
about a Chicago saloonkeeper who somehow gets tomorrow's newspaper
today and, rather than lining his pockets with lottery winnings,
uses the advance knowledge to avert disasters and help people out.
Sort of a reluctant, latter-day Superman, sans tights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such challenges, ``Early Edition'' ended its first year
as the most popular new drama of the 1996/97 season, and has kept
its momentum ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers boil its secret down to two words: Kyle Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember the strapping 33-year-old from the critically
acclaimed, early-1990s drama ``Homefront,'' or from his
award-winning Broadway run in ``Picnic'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   He's undeniably handsome, but in a nonthreatening, all-American
way that's reminiscent of William Holden. His portrayal of Gary
Hobson, ``Early Edition's'' intrepid everyman, suggests the
aw-shucks humility of filmdom's finest antiheroes, James Stewart
and Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing between takes on ``Early Edition's'' Chicago set,
Chandler acknowledges the oft-made comparisons to such screen
giants. In fact, he says, he grew up fascinated by golden-age
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo and raised in the affluent Chicago suburb of
Lake Forest, Chandler's childhood was turned upside down in 1977
when his family relocated to a 22-acre farm in rural Georgia. Soon
afterward his father died, leaving the lonely, uprooted lad,
``looking for role models.''
</P>
<P>
   He found them on an Atlanta television station that specialized
in classic films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That station became my baby sitter,'' he recalls, ``and all of
a sudden I was finding heroes in my life. I watched all these old
John Wayne movies, all the Cary Grant and Gary Cooper deals. I was
14, and had an imagination that was just ready to roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happened was that I would head out into the woods and
take those movie characters with me,'' the actor says. ``I'd
imagine that they were beside me as we charged up a hill to attack
the Nazis or tried to escape a Vietnamese jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were defining moments for me, though I didn't realize it
til much later. Because to this day a lot of those imaginary
friends are constantly with me, in my work and in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of actors have had to struggle for years before being
recognized, but that wasn't the case for Chandler. In 1988, while
attending the University of Georgia in Athens, he was spotted by an
ABC scout and recruited for the network's new-talent program.
Within a year, he'd landed a recurring role in the short-lived CBS
Vietnam drama ``Tour of Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then tapped for a larger part in ABC's ambitious
``Homefront,'' playing a World War II veteran trying to adjust to
postwar life in a small Ohio town. Despite the series' heavy
premise, it also offered Chandler a chance to exercise his comic
skills, making romantic Tracy-Hepburn sparks fly with co-star Tammy
Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after ``Homefront'' was canceled, CBS lured him back
with ``Early Edition.'' At first, he admits, he found the premise
``pretty silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a movie or a pilot I could see it very clearly,'' he says,
``but I thought it would be almost impossible to do as a series. I
really don't think anyone thought it was going to make it out of
the gate but, to the credit of the writers and producers, they've
brought it a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor takes particular pride in the evolution of his
character into more than a cardboard superhero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get a lot of notes from the producers saying they
wanted Gary to be The Hero,'' he says. ``And I said, `No, I don't
want him to be just some two-dimensional do-gooder.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it was to make this guy completely human, to make
him full of flaws and let some of that comedy and timing I learned
as a kid fall into it,'' Chandler says. ``And that's what I now
love about the show. Sometimes Gary's very intelligent, other times
he's a complete idiot. He's got a big heart one moment, and the
next moment he's yelling at a kid on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so many different things, and he's such a reluctant hero,
that he's tremendous fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appreciates the producers' commitment to making ``Early
Edition'' appropriate viewing for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with sex _ in fact, I happen to really like
sex,'' he says, grinning. ``But this is not the show for it. This
is also not the show for violence, for blowing people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't believe in preaching to an audience,'' he adds.
``I don't think people tune in to be lectured about political
unrest or gun control or whatever the issue of the moment happens
to be. I'm proud that we stay away from all that and simply deliver
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling a story about a guy who gets tomorrow's news,''
Chandler concludes. ``It's not brain surgery. It's fun to shoot,
it's fun to watch and it is what it is. We're just here to create
fantastical little tales that anybody can enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, his colleagues say, the actor is even more likeable
than his character. Loucas George, the executive producer, calls
Chandler ``one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another co-worker agrees, recalling an episode last winter when
the show's makeup artist locked her keys in her car. A severe
snowstorm was raging, and everybody but Chandler had left for the
night. He spent five hours waiting with her until the auto-club
truck arrived, then followed her home to be sure she made it
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of the story, Chandler smiles sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I had to help her,'' he says. ``If I didn't, who was
going to do my makeup the next morning?''
</P>
<P>
   The show's Chicago setting would put off some actors, but
Chandler _ who lives in the Windy City with his wife, screenwriter
Kathryn Chandler, and their daughter Sydney _ enjoys it precisely
because of its distance from the Los Angeles spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely removed from Hollywood,'' he says, ``and it's
sort of nice. For me, it's never been about how many people know
who I am, how big my trailer is or how huge my paycheck is. My
father was a very simple man who loved to laugh and loved life. He
was never the kind of guy who liked all the trappings _ he loved
the real things in life, and I think I got that from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I've got a family to support, but I've also got a
job that I love to do and I've got great people to work with every
day. Right now, I couldn't ask for anything better.''

 &HT;    ``It's going to be a weekend like no other I've experienced,''
the fair-skinned redhead says over breakfast at a greasy-spoon
diner in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Bergl ate here
often when she lived in the area last year, a fact attested to by
the lipstick mark on her right cheek, supplied by a waitress who
remembered her fondly.
 &HT;    ``It's good, exciting and, I suppose, a dream come true,'' she
says. ``I never actually had this specific dream. I only hoped to
be working at this point, and not waitressing. I never had any
concrete aspirations beyond just working.''
 &HT;    And make no mistake, acting is work _ especially in ``Carrie
2,'' which casts the 23-year-old as Rachel, a teen-ager with latent
telekinetic powers which are unleashed when her fellow students
push her too far. Also on hand for the fun is Amy Irving as Sue
Snell, the only survivor of ``Carrie's'' prom-night bloodbath, who
20 years later is working as a guidance counselor.
 &HT;    ``What was most important to me is that the protagonist is a
very strong female,'' Bergl says. ``Rachel has terrible things
happen to her, but she's not a victim. The movie is not about her,
half-clothed, being chased around by some guy with a knife.
 &HT;    ``It's not a movie solely about shock value,'' she adds. ``It
talks about inner psychological fears, becoming a woman and about
dealing with high school.''
 &HT;    Pouring hot sauce onto her eggs, Bergl says that her goal was to
create a believable character with real-life problems, family
concerns and even a love story, involving a sympathetic football
star (Jason London).
 &HT;    ``It was very intimidating,'' she says. ``Not only did I go to
work every day thinking I had a $20 million budget riding on me,
but I also felt the movie itself rode heavily on my performance.
Really, if you don't sympathize with Rachel, the whole movie
doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``The script helped me, though, because you see parts of her
life that make her seem like a real person, someone young people
can relate to,'' the actress adds. ``You see her at a job, you see
that she's not wealthy and doesn't have a car. She lives with a
foster family and has problems to deal with. We've also got a
genuine love story, between me and Jason London.
 &HT;    ``So there's more in this script than you see in the typical
horror film,'' she concludes. ``In terms of my acting, I made an
effort to be truthful about what I thought was going on in this
girl's head.''
 &HT;    The film builds in intensity via drama, not gore, Bergl reports.
However, the film's climax lives up to the chaotic finale of
``Carrie,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``What happens to Rachel is even more humiliating than what
happened to Sissy Spacek, but I don't want to give it away because
it's one of the film's big shocks,'' Bergl says. ``It was a tough
scene to shoot, though, because it was me laying on the ground for
days and days and days.
 &HT;    ``I had all these kids yelling at me, and after a while I could
feel some of their spit landing on me. By the end of it I was ready
to really kill everyone in the room.''
 &HT;    Well, everyone except Amy Irving.
 &HT;    ``Having her around was a blessing,'' Bergl says. ``Meeting her
was one of the great things about doing the film. It's important to
work with more experienced actresses, to learn from them.
 &HT;    ``Watching her work and sharing scenes with Amy was a big
influence,'' she adds, ``but it was also great to soak up all her
knowledge when we were just hanging out together on the set.''
 &HT;    The magnitude of it all hit home for the young actress on
Christmas.
 &HT;    ``I was home with my parents in Chicago,'' she says. ``We knew
the `Carrie 2' trailer would be playing before `The Faculty.' We
had Christmas dinner, then went to the movie theater. We went up
this big escalator, and at the top there was this `Carrie 2'
poster, which I hadn't seen yet. We all just freaked out.
 &HT;    ``Then we went into the theater,'' she continues. ``We watched
the `Carrie 2' trailer and left. It was the first time I'd ever
seen myself on screen.
 &HT;    ``It was very cool, but surreal, too. I almost didn't believe it
was me, but it was.''
 &HT;    In its own way, ``The Lion in Winter'' is equally overwhelming.
Bergl plays Alais, the French princess who is also the mistress of
England's Henry II (Fishburne).
 &HT;    ``It scared me to take that on,'' she admits, ``and it still
scares me now. I'm totally scared, but I know myself and I'm always
scared at this stage of the process.
 &HT;    ``Alais is an interesting character,'' she says. ``She's the
lover of a king, and she's got a quiet power to her that I really
appreciate, that I'm trying to bring out in the character.''
 &HT;    Fishburne and Channing are both formidable performers known for
their exacting standards of professionalism, but Bergl sounds as if
she's holding her own.
 &HT;    ``They don't suffer fools lightly, but they're also two of the
most professional actors I've ever worked with,'' she says.
``There's none of that star B.S. I'm learning a lot from them. They
just won't sacrifice the quality of the work.''
 &HT;    The same apparently can be said of Bergl, who was born in
England, grew up in the Chicago area and studied English and
theater at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa.
 &HT;    After graduating, she moved to Manhattan and quickly landed a
job as an understudy in a Lincoln Center production of ``Ah,
Wilderness.'' More recently, she starred as Juliet in a
six-week-long run of ``Romeo and Juliet'' at the Old Globe Theater
in San Diego.
 &HT;    In short, everything seems to be coming together at once for
Bergl.
 &HT;    ``Every actor doubts they'll find work,'' she says. ``I worked
once with a woman who's worked steadily for about 35 years, and she
said that after she finishes every job she's afraid she'll never
work again. She thinks they'll find out she's no good.
 &HT;    ``I had a lot of fears that I wouldn't find work,'' Bergl
admits. ``I'm really lucky. I've paid some dues, but come on, most
people I know who've graduated from college aren't working, and a
lot of people don't work for years.''
 &HT;    But now that she's got her foot in the door, Bergl doesn't plan
to ease up.
 &HT;    ``I definitely see myself doing this for the long haul,'' she
says. ``Of course, like anyone else, I have career anxiety. But I
think I have less career anxiety than a lot of people I meet. Like
I said, I really only ever hoped to be an actor _ I've never wanted
to be a movie star, I never aspired to that.
 &HT;    ``I hope to do films,'' Bergl hastens to add. ``I hope people
like `Carrie 2.' But I'd be happy just to work in regional theater,
doing good Shakespeare, Ibsen or even good Christopher Durang.''

 Includes a color slide of Michelle Pfeiffer with Treat Williams in
a scene from ``The Deep End of the Ocean.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Michelle Pfeiffer was 5 when she disappeared.
 &HT;    It was midnight in Santa Ana, Calif., and the prettiest little
girl on the block had decided to go for a walk. Alone.
 &HT;    ``I remember I loved being at my neighbor's house down the
street,'' the actress recalls, ``so I went over there determined to
wake up my little friends. The children answered the door, and I
asked them to hide me so my parents wouldn't find out what I had
done.''
 &HT;    The Pfeiffers were having a poker party that night, but almost
instinctively Michelle's mother decided to check on the oldest of
her four children.
 &HT;    ``My mom saw my empty bed,'' Pfeiffer recalls, ``and she was
literally in a panic.''
 &HT;    It was 1963, but a missing child was no less heart-stopping than
today. But a quick search of the block produced a sleepy, smiling
Michelle, who promised never again to go visiting on her own.
 &HT;    Over coffee on an early morning at Los Angeles' Four Seasons
Hotel, Pfeiffer looks back on the incident wistfully.
 &HT;    ``As much as I scared my folks that night,'' she says, ``I still
don't think my parents had the same fears I have now. As a child, I
would run barefoot through my neighborhood. I could knock on any
neighbor's door and not be afraid. My kids can't do that, which is
sad.''
 &HT;    A disappearing child figures in Pfeiffer's new film ``The Deep
End of the Ocean'' opening March 12. Based on Jacqueline Mitchard's
best-selling book, it stars Pfeiffer _ who also co-produced the
film _ as a young mother whose child vanishes in a crowded hotel
lobby, not to be seen again for years.
 &HT;    Pfeiffer admits that acting out every mother's worst nightmare
made her heart pound.
 &HT;    ``When I decided to do this movie, I had to allow myself to go
beyond that point where as a mother you say, `What if?''' the
actress says. ``It was actually so unpleasant for those first few
weeks of shooting that I really questioned why I chose to do this
at all.
 &HT;    ``After all, I am the mother who walked out halfway through the
movie `Ransom' because I couldn't take it anymore.''
 &HT;    The effect has lingered for Pfeiffer, who is married to
television producer/writer David E. Kelley, creator of ``The
Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' and has two children.
 &HT;    ``A few weeks after filming the scene where Ben disappears, I
was in a store and I told our 6-year-old daughter Claudia to hold
our 4-year-old son John's hand,'' she recalls. ``Suddenly I had a
cold chill _ I realized this was the exact line from the movie.
`Hold his hand.'
 &HT;    ``Now, after doing this movie, I never let my kids out of my
sight,'' she says. ``I think I've become a bit paranoid.''
 &HT;    If expert opinion counts for anything, ``Deep End of the Ocean''
ought to do well: An industry magazine recently named Pfeiffer as
the female star who has the most appeal at the box office. Not bad
for a former supermarket-checkout girl and beauty queen who first
caught the public eye parading around in hotpants in ``Grease 2''
(1982).
 &HT;    ``My new ranking raises a few eyebrows, don't you think?''
Pfeiffer says bemusedly. ``I mean, when they say highest-paid
actress in Hollywood, it's not me. It's Julia or Jodie.
 &HT;    ``I think they sort of figured out whose movies never make
money,'' she says, laughing. ``And then they looked at me and said,
`Hey, she's still doing fairly well. She's still here.'''
 &HT;    And how. Her upcoming projects include ``A Midsummer's Night
Dream,'' with Kevin Kline and Calista Flockhart, due out this
spring. She's currently filming ``The Story of Us,'' a comedy about
a marriage on the rocks which co-stars Bruce Willis. Next up is
``What Lies Beneath,'' a supernatural thriller with Harrison Ford.
 &HT;    ``I'm over 40,'' she says with a laugh. ``Can you imagine? I
didn't think Hollywood allows women all this good fortune when you
hit that number.''
 &HT;    It represents an almost-literal dream come true for Pfeiffer,
who had wanted to be an actress since even before she won a Miss
Orange County beauty pageant.
 &HT;    ``I remember working at that supermarket, knowing that I wanted
to do something else,'' she recalls. ``I knew that, of everything
in the world, acting was what I wanted to do, although it seemed
like a ridiculous dream at the time. But I thought, `Why not?' I
was naive enough not realize the kind of hurdle I was trying to
climb.''
 &HT;    The road to success included ``embarrassing TV shows'' such as
``Delta House'' (1979) and ``movies that were even worse,''
including ``The Hollywood Knights'' (1980).
 &HT;    ``I think the real turning point for me was when I did a TV
movie called `The Children Nobody Wanted' (1981),'' she says. ``It
was the first project where I couldn't wear any makeup and had to
look as bad as possible. That was huge for me _ I was actually
hired for my acting ability and not my looks.
 &HT;    ``And then I did `Grease 2,' which gave me exposure _ for better
or worse.'' She sighs. ``That movie made me vow to never wear
hotpants in public again.''
 &HT;    Movies including ``Scarface'' (1983), ``The Witches of
Eastwick'' (1987), ``Married to the Mob'' (1988), ``The Fabulous
Baker Boys'' (1989) and ``Batman Returns'' (1992) put Pfeiffer on
the map, and suddenly she was an A-list star.
 &HT;    ``The bad part of becoming a movie star is that I'm still shy,''
she says. ``It is still hard for me to overcome my fear of
strangers. I remember early on my publicist telling me, `Michelle,
don't run from the press _ it makes it worse. Just stand there and
let them take your picture.'
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, I would be hyperventilating thinking, `OK, OK, OK.'
And then I would literally run. I wanted to run away.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, Pfeiffer says, the tabloids leave her alone.
 &HT;    ``I'm married, which equals `boring' for them,'' she says with a
laugh.
 &HT;    Her marriage to Kelley followed a failed first marriage to Peter
Horton (Gary on ``Thirtysomething''), as well as relationships with
Michael Keaton, John Malkovich and Fisher Stevens. Pfeiffer also
briefly dated Eric Clapton and Val Kilmer.
 &HT;    Then she met Kelley on a blind date.
 &HT;    ``I just knew. Of course, I didn't know right away, because
David didn't talk on our blind date and I didn't talk,'' she says,
laughing. ``So it took awhile for us to get to know each other. But
he's very internal, just like me. People might think David doesn't
like them, but he's just an observer.''
 &HT;    In 1993, Pfeiffer adopted Claudia as a single mother. Two weeks
later, friends invited to Claudia's christening got an extra
surprise: Kelley and Pfeiffer's wedding vows.
 &HT;    ``My family all sort of came together at once,'' the actress
says with a laugh. ``Suddenly we were this team.''
 &HT;    Amid the challenges of combining two high-powered careers with
parenthood, Pfeiffer says that her 40th birthday passed virtually
unnoticed.
 &HT;    ``For me, I think turning 39 was actually a little worse,'' she
says. ``It was the anticipation. I spent the next year agonizing
over it, but then 40 came and I was over it.''
 &HT;    Of course, it helps that she looks better than most
30-year-olds.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I look in the mirror and see a little line here or
there,'' she says, smiling. ``For a working mother, I think I'm
holding up pretty well.''

BILLY JOEL: IT'S STILL ROCK 'N' ROLL, BUT HE'S LOOKING FOR MORE

 Includes a color slide of rock singer/songwriter Billy Joel. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Billy Joel has had his share of idols and musical inspirations
since he started writing songs more than three decades ago. You can
guess most of them _ Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles,
John Lennon.
 &HT;    But these days, the 49-year-old musician finds a more appealing
model in the composer George Gershwin.
 &HT;    ``He wrote a lot of great popular music and then turned to
writing classical music, and then continued to write popular songs
very, very well,'' Joel explains.
 &HT;    ``I don't think he felt one genre couldn't live without the
other,'' he adds. ``I think you have to go with what you're
feeling. If I was motivated to write a lot of songs right now, I
definitely would not stop myself _ I'd go with it. But at the
moment I'm inspired to write this kind of music.''
 &HT;    ``This kind of music'' is all-instrumental, classically oriented
piano pieces that the Piano Man has been working on for the past
four years. What began as an experiment has become an obsession,
and in 1997 Joel surprised his fans by announcing that he had given
up writing lyric-driven pop songs in favor of sweeping instrumental
melodies.
 &HT;    And now the man who on March 15 will be inducted into the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame is enjoying the best of both worlds. While he
hasn't produced a pop song since 1993 _ when he wrote the
ironically titled ``Famous Last Words'' _ he continues to dust off
his past hits for periodic concert tours while devoting his
creative energies to classical music.
 &HT;    ``I used to get the same kick out of writing a song,'' he says.
``As the years went on, I started getting frustrated by the
confinements of pop songwriting. You can't develop a melody more
than a certain amount of notes before you end the first verse and
you've got to start the second verse. There are time constraints,
attention spans. There are certain instruments that define it as
rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``None of that has anything to do with composition except for
basic, basic composition,'' Joel says. ``And it became frustrating.
I want to take a melody and see how far I can develop it ... as
opposed to thinking `How is this going to be sung?' or if it's
going to be played on the radio or do I have to make a video?''
 &HT;    The Long Island-born Joel, who gave up boxing as a youth to
pursue the musical ambitions that launched him to stardom with the
multi-million-selling album, ``The Stranger'' (1977) _ says that
he's finished about eight classical pieces so far.
 &HT;    Stylistically, most of them draw on mid-19th-century
romanticism, he says, ``which is really where most songwriters
hearken back to, anyway, in terms of the kinds of melodies we
write. I think we all go back to Schubert.''
 &HT;    So far, he adds, the joy has been in the composing of his new
music rather than performing or recording it. In fact, despite
frequent inquiries from his record company and various orchestras,
he has no current plans to have the music performed at all.
 &HT;    ``It's the writing of it that's jazzing me,'' Joel says. ``I'm
not necessarily the guy to perform this stuff _ although it would
make it easier for Columbia Records to market it if I was
performing it.
 &HT;    ``I think the best way to have it presented, if I'm going to
present it at all, would be to have a hired gun, a pistolero,
somebody who is classically trained,'' he adds. ``I am not by any
stretch of the imagination an accomplished virtuoso concert
pianist. In rock 'n' roll, I'm great _ but in terms of classical
music, I stink.''
 &HT;    For the record, Joel actually has written one pop song during
the past year. Inspired by his past sojourns in France, it was
called ``Champs d'Elysee.'' But his enthusiasm for it was quashed
when he brought it in to rehearsal and his guitarist looked at it
and said, ``Are we doing a song called `The Champ's Eyelashes?'''
 &HT;    ``You can't beat that,'' Joel says with a laugh. ``No matter
what I ended up writing about, it will forever be known as `The
Champ's Eyelashes.' It was kind of a wake-up call _ I might as well
be writing about the champ's eyelashes.''
 &HT;    But Joel's new musical path doesn't mean he's abandoning his old
repertoire. His entire catalog was recently remastered and
reissued, with video clips added to the enhanced CDs. And Joel has
no problem singing those songs on tour, even if his new material is
of an entirely different ilk.
 &HT;    Actually, he says, assembling a good touring show is an art of
its own, involving a balancing act between popular hits and the
music that he or his musicians may more enjoy playing.
 &HT;    ``I think you have to do a certain amount of songs that the
audience would be disappointed if you don't do, like `Piano Man'
and a couple of other known songs,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``What makes for a good cohesive show is a certain amount of
songs that are familiar, a certain amount of songs that are purely
indulgent on the musicians' part and then the songs that hold
everything together,'' Joel adds. ``There has to be a tradeoff _
you can't just do every single song that only the audience wants. I
think you've got to balance it.''
 &HT;    Not that Joel doesn't appreciate his hits, the 30-something Top
40 favorites such as ``Only the Good Die Young,'' ``Just the Way
You Are,'' ``My Life'' and ``It's Still Rock and Roll to Me'' that
have led to nearly 100 million albums sold worldwide and, of
course, the Hall of Fame enshrinement which, he admits, is an honor
that he savors.
 &HT;    ``Rock 'n' roll really saved my life,'' he says, ``and even
though I'm not writing it right now, the major part of my life was
spent writing, recording and playing rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    ``I know people may have an image of me as this guy playing in a
piano bar,'' Joel says, ``but I only did that for six months. And
ever since I became a professional musician when I was in my late
teens, that's really what I've been doing up until about four years
ago. It's the majority of my life.
 &HT;    ``So, yeah, it will be nice to be there.''

 Includes a color slide of Kyle Chandler in a scene from ``Early
Edition.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the little television drama that could. CBS' ``Early
Edition'' has overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to emerge
as, if not a blockbuster, at least a solid middle-of-the-pack hit.
</P>
<P>
   It had to overcome its title, an ill-chosen moniker which to
most people sounds like some ``60 Minutes'' clone.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's its time slot, an early-evening berth in that
television netherworld known as Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's not even mentioning its premise, a farfetched fantasy
about a Chicago saloonkeeper who somehow gets tomorrow's newspaper
today and, rather than lining his pockets with lottery winnings,
uses the advance knowledge to avert disasters and help people out.
Sort of a reluctant, latter-day Superman, sans tights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such challenges, ``Early Edition'' ended its first year
as the most popular new drama of the 1996/97 season, and has kept
its momentum ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers boil its secret down to two words: Kyle Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember the strapping 33-year-old from the critically
acclaimed, early-1990s drama ``Homefront,'' or from his
award-winning Broadway run in ``Picnic'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   He's undeniably handsome, but in a nonthreatening, all-American
way that's reminiscent of William Holden. His portrayal of Gary
Hobson, ``Early Edition's'' intrepid everyman, suggests the
aw-shucks humility of filmdom's finest antiheroes, James Stewart
and Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing between takes on ``Early Edition's'' Chicago set,
Chandler acknowledges the oft-made comparisons to such screen
giants. In fact, he says, he grew up fascinated by golden-age
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo and raised in the affluent Chicago suburb of
Lake Forest, Chandler's childhood was turned upside down in 1977
when his family relocated to a 22-acre farm in rural Georgia. Soon
afterward his father died, leaving the lonely, uprooted lad,
``looking for role models.''
</P>
<P>
   He found them on an Atlanta television station that specialized
in classic films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That station became my baby sitter,'' he recalls, ``and all of
a sudden I was finding heroes in my life. I watched all these old
John Wayne movies, all the Cary Grant and Gary Cooper deals. I was
14, and had an imagination that was just ready to roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happened was that I would head out into the woods and
take those movie characters with me,'' the actor says. ``I'd
imagine that they were beside me as we charged up a hill to attack
the Nazis or tried to escape a Vietnamese jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were defining moments for me, though I didn't realize it
til much later. Because to this day a lot of those imaginary
friends are constantly with me, in my work and in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of actors have had to struggle for years before being
recognized, but that wasn't the case for Chandler. In 1988, while
attending the University of Georgia in Athens, he was spotted by an
ABC scout and recruited for the network's new-talent program.
Within a year, he'd landed a recurring role in the short-lived CBS
Vietnam drama ``Tour of Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then tapped for a larger part in ABC's ambitious
``Homefront,'' playing a World War II veteran trying to adjust to
postwar life in a small Ohio town. Despite the series' heavy
premise, it also offered Chandler a chance to exercise his comic
skills, making romantic Tracy-Hepburn sparks fly with co-star Tammy
Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after ``Homefront'' was canceled, CBS lured him back
with ``Early Edition.'' At first, he admits, he found the premise
``pretty silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a movie or a pilot I could see it very clearly,'' he says,
``but I thought it would be almost impossible to do as a series. I
really don't think anyone thought it was going to make it out of
the gate but, to the credit of the writers and producers, they've
brought it a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor takes particular pride in the evolution of his
character into more than a cardboard superhero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get a lot of notes from the producers saying they
wanted Gary to be The Hero,'' he says. ``And I said, `No, I don't
want him to be just some two-dimensional do-gooder.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it was to make this guy completely human, to make
him full of flaws and let some of that comedy and timing I learned
as a kid fall into it,'' Chandler says. ``And that's what I now
love about the show. Sometimes Gary's very intelligent, other times
he's a complete idiot. He's got a big heart one moment, and the
next moment he's yelling at a kid on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so many different things, and he's such a reluctant hero,
that he's tremendous fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appreciates the producers' commitment to making ``Early
Edition'' appropriate viewing for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with sex _ in fact, I happen to really like
sex,'' he says, grinning. ``But this is not the show for it. This
is also not the show for violence, for blowing people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't believe in preaching to an audience,'' he adds.
``I don't think people tune in to be lectured about political
unrest or gun control or whatever the issue of the moment happens
to be. I'm proud that we stay away from all that and simply deliver
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling a story about a guy who gets tomorrow's news,''
Chandler concludes. ``It's not brain surgery. It's fun to shoot,
it's fun to watch and it is what it is. We're just here to create
fantastical little tales that anybody can enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, his colleagues say, the actor is even more likeable
than his character. Loucas George, the executive producer, calls
Chandler ``one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another co-worker agrees, recalling an episode last winter when
the show's makeup artist locked her keys in her car. A severe
snowstorm was raging, and everybody but Chandler had left for the
night. He spent five hours waiting with her until the auto-club
truck arrived, then followed her home to be sure she made it
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of the story, Chandler smiles sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I had to help her,'' he says. ``If I didn't, who was
going to do my makeup the next morning?''
</P>
<P>
   The show's Chicago setting would put off some actors, but
Chandler _ who lives in the Windy City with his wife, screenwriter
Kathryn Chandler, and their daughter Sydney _ enjoys it precisely
because of its distance from the Los Angeles spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely removed from Hollywood,'' he says, ``and it's
sort of nice. For me, it's never been about how many people know
who I am, how big my trailer is or how huge my paycheck is. My
father was a very simple man who loved to laugh and loved life. He
was never the kind of guy who liked all the trappings _ he loved
the real things in life, and I think I got that from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I've got a family to support, but I've also got a
job that I love to do and I've got great people to work with every
day. Right now, I couldn't ask for anything better.''

SWEET, YOUNG AND SAVAGE: EMILY BERGL ON `THE RAGE,' THE STAGE AND
THE WAGES OF STARDOM

 Includes a color slide of Emily Bergl in a scene from ``The Rage:
Carrie 2.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Talk about a coming-out party.
 &HT;    On March 11, Emily Bergl makes her Broadway debut, co-starring
with Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing in ``The Lion in
Winter.'' The very next day she makes her feature-film debut in
``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' the sequel to Brian De Palma's 1976 horror
hit.
 &HT;    ``It's going to be a weekend like no other I've experienced,''
the fair-skinned redhead says over breakfast at a greasy-spoon
diner in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. Bergl ate here
often when she lived in the area last year, a fact attested to by
the lipstick mark on her right cheek, supplied by a waitress who
remembered her fondly.
 &HT;    ``It's good, exciting and, I suppose, a dream come true,'' she
says. ``I never actually had this specific dream. I only hoped to
be working at this point, and not waitressing. I never had any
concrete aspirations beyond just working.''
 &HT;    And make no mistake, acting is work _ especially in ``Carrie
2,'' which casts the 23-year-old as Rachel, a teen-ager with latent
telekinetic powers which are unleashed when her fellow students
push her too far. Also on hand for the fun is Amy Irving as Sue
Snell, the only survivor of ``Carrie's'' prom-night bloodbath, who
20 years later is working as a guidance counselor.
 &HT;    ``What was most important to me is that the protagonist is a
very strong female,'' Bergl says. ``Rachel has terrible things
happen to her, but she's not a victim. The movie is not about her,
half-clothed, being chased around by some guy with a knife.
 &HT;    ``It's not a movie solely about shock value,'' she adds. ``It
talks about inner psychological fears, becoming a woman and about
dealing with high school.''
 &HT;    Pouring hot sauce onto her eggs, Bergl says that her goal was to
create a believable character with real-life problems, family
concerns and even a love story, involving a sympathetic football
star (Jason London).
 &HT;    ``It was very intimidating,'' she says. ``Not only did I go to
work every day thinking I had a $20 million budget riding on me,
but I also felt the movie itself rode heavily on my performance.
Really, if you don't sympathize with Rachel, the whole movie
doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``The script helped me, though, because you see parts of her
life that make her seem like a real person, someone young people
can relate to,'' the actress adds. ``You see her at a job, you see
that she's not wealthy and doesn't have a car. She lives with a
foster family and has problems to deal with. We've also got a
genuine love story, between me and Jason London.
 &HT;    ``So there's more in this script than you see in the typical
horror film,'' she concludes. ``In terms of my acting, I made an
effort to be truthful about what I thought was going on in this
girl's head.''
 &HT;    The film builds in intensity via drama, not gore, Bergl reports.
However, the film's climax lives up to the chaotic finale of
``Carrie,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``What happens to Rachel is even more humiliating than what
happened to Sissy Spacek, but I don't want to give it away because
it's one of the film's big shocks,'' Bergl says. ``It was a tough
scene to shoot, though, because it was me laying on the ground for
days and days and days.
 &HT;    ``I had all these kids yelling at me, and after a while I could
feel some of their spit landing on me. By the end of it I was ready
to really kill everyone in the room.''
 &HT;    Well, everyone except Amy Irving.
 &HT;    ``Having her around was a blessing,'' Bergl says. ``Meeting her
was one of the great things about doing the film. It's important to
work with more experienced actresses, to learn from them.
 &HT;    ``Watching her work and sharing scenes with Amy was a big
influence,'' she adds, ``but it was also great to soak up all her
knowledge when we were just hanging out together on the set.''
 &HT;    The magnitude of it all hit home for the young actress on
Christmas.
 &HT;    ``I was home with my parents in Chicago,'' she says. ``We knew
the `Carrie 2' trailer would be playing before `The Faculty.' We
had Christmas dinner, then went to the movie theater. We went up
this big escalator, and at the top there was this `Carrie 2'
poster, which I hadn't seen yet. We all just freaked out.
 &HT;    ``Then we went into the theater,'' she continues. ``We watched
the `Carrie 2' trailer and left. It was the first time I'd ever
seen myself on screen.
 &HT;    ``It was very cool, but surreal, too. I almost didn't believe it
was me, but it was.''
 &HT;    In its own way, ``The Lion in Winter'' is equally overwhelming.
Bergl plays Alais, the French princess who is also the mistress of
England's Henry II (Fishburne).
 &HT;    ``It scared me to take that on,'' she admits, ``and it still
scares me now. I'm totally scared, but I know myself and I'm always
scared at this stage of the process.
 &HT;    ``Alais is an interesting character,'' she says. ``She's the
lover of a king, and she's got a quiet power to her that I really
appreciate, that I'm trying to bring out in the character.''
 &HT;    Fishburne and Channing are both formidable performers known for
their exacting standards of professionalism, but Bergl sounds as if
she's holding her own.
 &HT;    ``They don't suffer fools lightly, but they're also two of the
most professional actors I've ever worked with,'' she says.
``There's none of that star B.S. I'm learning a lot from them. They
just won't sacrifice the quality of the work.''
 &HT;    The same apparently can be said of Bergl, who was born in
England, grew up in the Chicago area and studied English and
theater at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa.
 &HT;    After graduating, she moved to Manhattan and quickly landed a
job as an understudy in a Lincoln Center production of ``Ah,
Wilderness.'' More recently, she starred as Juliet in a
six-week-long run of ``Romeo and Juliet'' at the Old Globe Theater
in San Diego.
 &HT;    In short, everything seems to be coming together at once for
Bergl.
 &HT;    ``Every actor doubts they'll find work,'' she says. ``I worked
once with a woman who's worked steadily for about 35 years, and she
said that after she finishes every job she's afraid she'll never
work again. She thinks they'll find out she's no good.
 &HT;    ``I had a lot of fears that I wouldn't find work,'' Bergl
admits. ``I'm really lucky. I've paid some dues, but come on, most
people I know who've graduated from college aren't working, and a
lot of people don't work for years.''
 &HT;    But now that she's got her foot in the door, Bergl doesn't plan
to ease up.
 &HT;    ``I definitely see myself doing this for the long haul,'' she
says. ``Of course, like anyone else, I have career anxiety. But I
think I have less career anxiety than a lot of people I meet. Like
I said, I really only ever hoped to be an actor _ I've never wanted
to be a movie star, I never aspired to that.
 &HT;    ``I hope to do films,'' Bergl hastens to add. ``I hope people
like `Carrie 2.' But I'd be happy just to work in regional theater,
doing good Shakespeare, Ibsen or even good Christopher Durang.''

MATES GAIN WHILE JAGR PLAYS LIKE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Jaromir Jagr wins the Hart Trophy for being the NHL's MVP,
you'll have to give Kip Miller an assist.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a nice twist of irony, seeing that Jagr has been the
one handing out assists all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins' winger has been spectacular, leading the NHL in
scoring and dishing out a league-best 60 assists through Thursday.
But those numbers alone don't rank Jagr as the league's MVP. Nope,
he needs Miller for that.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Kip Miller, while a fine individual, is a journeyman
center who before this season had played all of 90 NHL games over a
span of eight seasons. During that time, he had rung up 14
memorable goals.
</P>
<P>
   But early in January, Miller was placed on a line with Jagr to
give the Penguins more balance. Rookie Jan Hrdina also was added to
the mix, and Jagr was asked to basically carry two players who had
done very little to prove they were first-liners in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Miller has scored 11 goals in 13 games with Jagr,
and Hrdina has pushed himself into the rookie of the year race with
29 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him one of the top two or three \Rplayers in
the league\S, I'd say he's the best player in the league right
now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of the magical Jagr. ``If you
look at other teams, they have two or three players together _ Jagr
is doing it on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Jagr, the Penguins now have a strong second line and
have bought into coach Kevin Constantine's philosophy of two-way
hockey, producing a stunning achievement when you consider this
team is playing under the shadow of bankruptcy. In other words,
Jagr's dedication has been contagious.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is Eric Lindros has John LeClair in
Philadelphia, Paul Kariya has Teemu Selanne in Anaheim and Mike
Modano has Brett Hull in Dallas. Jagr is making stars of Miller and
Hrdina.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he's smiling while he's doing it. Many expected
Jagr to balk at Constantine's demand to play more defense, to
involve himself more strongly in a two-way game. After all, the
headstrong Czech had been raised by Mario Lemieux, a player who
often felt the system should fit him and not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Jagr is the antithesis of Lemieux. Jagr loves
hockey, loves the rink, loves to just hang out with his teammates.
He is an engaging character with the media and has the makings of a
pretty darn good captain.
</P>
<P>
   And that means it could be time for Jagr to finally step forward
and earn his first MVP trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious thing is people didn't expect that team to be
doing as well as they are,'' Hurricanes GM Jim Rutherford said.
``Not to take anything away from their other players, but it's
obvious Jagr has shifted to another gear. And I'm not sure anybody
else has that gear.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON...CHRIS CHELIOS
</P>
<P>
   First he told Philadelphia Flyers' GM Bob Clarke to shut up.
Now, he's telling his teammates to put up. That's the great thing
about Blackhawks defenseman Chris Chelios, he's never at a loss for
words.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, he is at a loss for pride. The Blackhawks
captain, who was born in Chicago, is fighting mightily to stay in
the Windy City. And he might be out of luck there. The Blackhawks
will miss the playoffs for the second year in a row and have a
payroll of $35.8 million. Something has to give. Management has
done a tremendous job of bumbling Chicago's situation. All the way
from owner Bill Wirtz to GM Bob Pulford, the Blackhawks have been
cheap at the wrong times, losing Ed Belfour and Jeremy Roenick and
have been foolish at the wrong times, spending far too much to get
center Doug Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a team that can't compete, but is too old to
rebuild. The only answer then is cutting salaries and starting
over. That's something Chelios, 37, doesn't want to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay and I want to win here, I want to be a part of
that,'' Chelios said.
GRETZKY RETURNS?
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone thought he was ready to leave, but Wayne Gretzky
offered a strong hint last week that he will be back for another
season with the Rangers. After a 6-2 loss to the Calgary Flames in
Calgary, Gretzky speculated about the Rangers possibly going after
free-agent-to-be Theo Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   ``One area where we have a cushion where Calgary doesn't: On
July 1, we have a lot of money that \Rmanagement\S can spend,''
Gretzky said. ``And I would hope that they would get into the
free-agent market. They didn't last year.''
</P>
<P>
   You boys at Madison Square Garden listening?
</P>
<P>
   FLEURY HYPE
</P>
<P>
   Is he going?
</P>
<P>
   Is he staying?
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding Fleury continues to get more intense every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fluery told ``The Calgary Sun'' that he turned down
an offer of $25 million over four years from the Los Angeles Kings,
who were trying to trade for him but wanted him to sign a new
contract before making the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The potential trade bait? Pavel Rosa and Yanic Perreault. Shows
what kind of offers the Flames are getting, huh?
</P>
<P>
   The best bet now is Calgary, which has made a 5-0-2 run to get
into playoff position, will keep Fleury for a potential postseason
run.
</P>
<P>
   HARVEY OUT
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars winger Todd Harvey, meanwhile, continues to battle
bad luck. Harvey, who was hoping to play for the first time against
the Stars on Tuesday, is expected to be out the next three months
with a broken thumb. He already has missed 21 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these freak injuries; what the heck am I going to do,''
Harvey said. ``Slashes on my thumb, my knee gets in a rut, I get
hit with a slap shot in the elbow. I think I'm going to see a witch
doctor and have the spell taken off.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody worried that Harvey is a Gary Roberts, Kevin Stevens
type of player that might be playing too tough for his body?
</P>
<P>
   GILCHRIST IMPROVES
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars winger Brent Gilchrist said he could be ready to
play this week. Gilchrist, who has missed the entire season with
various abdominal injuries, said he would like to play March 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation right now where I'm feeling stronger and more
comfortable every day,'' Gilchrist said. ``I'm pushing it and not
feeling pain. I accelerate and wait for something to hurt, but it
doesn't.''
AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Check out the scene in Detroit. Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman
has volunteered to move from center to left wing so that Sergei
Fedorov would be more comfortable at center. That would be like
Mike Modano volunteering to move to a wing. Brendan Shanahan also
is playing out of position on the right wing for the Red Wings. ...
Speaking of the Stars, guess who else held a bag skate recently.
Kings coach Larry Robinson sent his lads out without pucks after a
5-1 loss to the Blues last week _ skating them in sprints only. The
Kings responded with a 3-2 victory against the Red Wings the next
night, outshooting Detroit, 40-26. Funny, the players didn't seem
tired. Maybe Ken Hitchcock knows what he's doing, after all. ...
Assistant coach Lorne Molleken is now the interim coach in Chicago
now that the Blackhawks fired Dirk Graham. But don't expect
Molleken to be a head coach. The Hawks will look for an experienced
hand. ... The Red Wings still struggle against the good teams. They
are 3-13-2 against teams with winning records. ... Since the new
year, the Devils are 11-11-4. ... The Avalanche followed their
12-game winning streak with an 0-3-4 run. ... Tommy Salo wants off
of Long Island again. The disgruntled goalie would be a great find
for a team in need.
THE WEEK AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Avalanche at Panthers _ Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg and
Pavel Bure on the ice at one time. Friday: Red Wings at Coyotes _
The makings of a good rivalry is bubbling below the surface here.
Saturday: Maple Leafs at Senators _ Canada's two best teams square
off in a key Northeast Division rivalry. This is one reason
realignment is good.

TOM PENDERS: GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Munching on a muffin one recent morning, Tom
Penders looks happy and content in his office, a converted
townhouse only a 10-minute subway ride from the White House. His
George Washington basketball team is 17-7 and vying for a berth in
the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of a rebirth,'' Penders said. ``I couldn't have
written a better script.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances can be deceiving. Although he said he has put the
past behind him, Penders still has not forgotten the way his
10-year tenure at the University of Texas ended last March. It was
a messy divorce, and the resentment festers almost a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Penders reached into a desk and pulled out an exhibit to support
his contention that his ouster was orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   During a taxing two-week period at the end of a disappointing
season in Austin, Penders was confronted by a player revolt over
alleged coaching abuse and the suspension of highly regarded
freshman Luke Axtell, whose grades were faxed to a local radio
station in violation of federal student privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Penders said The Axtell Affair involved an immature freshman who
refused to attend study hall and tutoring sessions. Penders alleges
that Axtell lied about his absences.
</P>
<P>
   Axtell's family said that Penders suspended Luke Axtell out of
spite after their son announced he was transferring to Kansas.
Penders still denies he had anything to do with the faxing of
Axtell's academic progress report to an Austin radio station.
Assistant coach Eddie Oran, who is now selling cars in Austin,
admitted to sending the fax.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Axtell family is suing radio station KVET, which
released Axtell's grades. Sheri Rasmus, the Axtell's lawyer, is in
the process of deposing witnesses for the suit. The case is
scheduled to go to court in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of his health and his five-day hospital stay brings the
memories flooding back for Penders. The Longhorns were coming off a
Sweet 16 appearance in the 1996-97 season and had the best
recruiting class in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was going to be the year we were going to make a run at
the Final Four,'' Penders said. ``But DeLoss Dodds meddled.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders' relationship with his boss at Texas, Dodds, the
athletic director, began to falter in March 1997 when Penders
considered a coaching offer from Rutgers, one of a dozen openings
he was linked to in his time in Austin. Penders said that Dodds was
resentful and wanted him out.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds declined to comment specifically about Penders or his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to put this all behind us and move on,''
Dodds said. ``We appreciate all the good things Tom did while he
was at Texas, and we all wish him well at George Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt Penders had been treated fairly, Dodds said,
``I'm not going to get into whether he was treated fairly or
unfairly. That's all in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   When Penders left, his settlement with the university was for
approximately $900,000. It included a clause preventing lawsuits
from either side.
</P>
<P>
   Penders appeared headed for a radio-television career. He had a
four-year, $350,000 deal with Host Communications and was
auditioning for ESPN. Then, an old friend called.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington athletic director Jack Kvancz needed a
basketball coach. Last May, St. John's hired GWU coach Mike Jarvis
and Kvancz decided to call Penders, whom he knew from their days as
high school basketball rivals in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was adamant that he wanted somebody to trust, and that's
why he was interested in this job,'' Kvancz said. ``What we have
here is a situation that makes Tom feel very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of homework and nobody's talking about what
happened \Rlast March\S. Tom feels like he got undercut a little. I
think he was hurt, wounded by what happened at Texas. Within two
weeks of being up here, I think he had put all that stuff behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's over it, and I don't think he'll ever be
over it,'' said Tommy Penders, who is an assistant for his father
at George Washington. ``And I don't blame him. He is Texas
basketball, and they basically spit on him and didn't acknowledge
what he did. I think that's a reflection on the administration
there.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did at Rhode Island and Texas, Penders is primed to again
prove that he's Mr. March.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time comes, we're going to be there,'' said 5-4
senior point guard Shawnta Rogers, who has flourished under
Penders' open-court offensive system. ``Coach Penders won't let us
slip. He's a player's coach. He lets you go out there and play your
game. People aren't nervous playing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Penders' other coaching stops, he was faced with building or
rebuilding a losing program. Not so here. George Washington
averaged 19 victories the past five seasons and last season won 24
games. Penders' let-players-play coaching style has been a hit with
the Colonials.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Penders, it's like a computer _ wysiwyg _ what you see is
what you get,'' said senior forward Yegor Mescheriakov. ``He's
always straightforward. If you have a bad game, he tells you. I
appreciate that. He's aware of the time of the season, how tired we
are, how much we need to practice. I like his composure during
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders doesn't believe the Colonials' success this season
vindicates him. But then, the past pops up like wreckage from a
sunken ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets because everything I did at Texas was from
my heart and with honesty,'' said Penders, who is 495-326 in 28
seasons. ``I can look anybody in the eye. But there are a few
people who can't look me in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I put it in the past? Yeah. But, I'm still waiting for a
phone call from Dodds, an explanation. He claimed to be great
friend of mine. I've written him, he hasn't answered me. He can't
look me in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he doesn't own me any more. That's the one thing he didn't
count on. He thought he could ruin my career.''

JIM THORPE: ATHLETE OF THE HALF-CENTURY, NOW MAYBE THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world.'' - King
Gustav V of Sweden
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, King.'' - Jim Thorpe
</P>
<P>
   When the above exchange took place on an Olympic stage at
Stockholm in 1912, it was perhaps more notable for its cultural
irony than a celebration of athletic excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The laconic youth conversing with a European monarch was a Sac
and Fox Indian, born to modest circumstances on a farm near Prague,
Okla., on May 28, 1888.
</P>
<P>
   His birth preceded by 12 years the advent of ``The American
Century'' _ and came two years before the slaughter at Wounded Knee
in South Dakota ended, forever, the native American dream of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, before a generation had passed, Jim Thorpe was the idol of
a nation fast becoming obsessed with sports and sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's achievements during the second decade of the 1900s make
him perhaps the greatest all-around athlete of the century.
</P>
<P>
   A storied football All-American on Glenn ``Pop'' Warner's teams
at the Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pa., and a double gold
medal winner in the 1912 Olympics, Thorpe _ who later played
baseball for the New York Giants and became a founder of the
National Football League _ was indeed an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an exceptional life,'' said Bill Thorpe, 70, a retired
aircraft worker living in Arlington and one of four children from
Thorpe's second marriage. ``I think that, because of his great
athletic achievements, he never personally suffered any
discrimination from being an Indian. And because I was his son,
neither did I.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, three years before his death of a heart attack, Thorpe
was voted the greatest American athlete of the century's first 50
years in a national poll of sports editors conducted by the
Associated Press. Babe Ruth finished second.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a second poll at the end of the century, Grace
Thorpe figures the result should be the same. The youngest of four
children from Thorpe's first marriage, she has drafted a petition
and a resolution presenting her father's case as the greatest
athlete of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have pretty good evidence,'' said Thorpe, 77, who
lives in Prague, near where her father grew up. ``Name somebody
else who played Major League Baseball /and'' professional football
/and'' won two gold medals in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go up to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton \ROhio\S, and
the first thing you see when you walk in is a statue of my father _
like he's coming right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's life, however, was hardly a grand procession of
triumphs.
BRIGHT PATH
</P>
<P>
   The son of Hiram and Charlotte Thorpe, his Indian name _
Wa-Tho-Huk _ meant ``Bright Path,'' and in the beginning, Thorpe
had a great friend and playmate: a twin brother, Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   They were inseparable, and the first great blow of Thorpe's life
came at age 9, when Charlie died of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me once that he thought some of that tremendous energy
he had might have rightfully belonged to his brother,'' Grace
Thorpe said. ``He felt he had somehow taken it away from Charlie,
and it haunted him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he lost both of his parents, and was eventually
sent to the Carlisle Indian school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian schools of that day were the brainchild of Richard
Henry Pratt,'' Grace said. ``He was an army lieutenant back in the
1870s who captured a large number of Apaches, and was amazed at how
quickly they picked up the English language.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eventually founded Carlisle, and the idea was to create a
comfortable atmosphere for assimilating the native peoples into the
white culture. The schools were remarkably successful in their
purpose, but they also totally destroyed the family.''
</P>
<P>
   At Carlisle, Thorpe found a mentor in Warner, a future bride in
classmate Iva Miller and great fame as America's premier athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's Carlisle teams were among the most amazing in history:
famed for annually taking on a gauntlet of Eastern powers _ then
the cream of collegiate football _ and defeating all but one or two
per year. Their triumphs were legendary; a 1911 victory against
mighty Harvard and a 27-6 victory in 1912 against an Army team
featuring halfback Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely swift and noted for a running style that sometimes
knocked opposing tacklers cold, Thorpe was All-American in 1911 and
in 1912, when he scored 25 touchdowns and 198 points.
</P>
<P>
   In between those two seasons, he sailed across the Atlantic to
represent his country in the Summer Olympics. Traveling with him
was Carlisle teammate Louis Tewanima, a distance runner so
formidable he once won a two-mile race after running the 18 miles
to Harrisburg for the event.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Thorpe who excelled in Stockholm, winning the Games'
most grueling events _ the pentathlon and decathlon. To win the two
medals that would soon be taken from him, Thorpe had to compete in
15 events _ five in the pentathlon (broad jump, javelin, discus,
200 meters and 1,500 meters) and 10 in the decathlon (100 meters,
broad jump, high jump, shot put, 400 meters, 110-meter hurdles,
discus, javelin, pole vault and 1,500 meters).
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe accumulated enough points _ including 8,412.96 points in
the decathlon, then a world record _ to win two golds and the
admiration of a king.
</P>
<P>
   SADNESS
</P>
<P>
   In the years following his departure from Carlisle, Thorpe
played six major-league seasons _ mostly with John McGraw's Giants
_ and 15 years of pro football with the Canton Bulldogs, Oorang
Indians, Chicago Cardinals and others. He was the first president
of the league that eventually became the NFL. Two marriages
dissolved, and he filled his later years with work in Hollywood and
speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thorpe remembers his father as ``happy-go-lucky,'' a
generous man with many, many friends. Grace has a different
recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really had a rather unhappy life,'' she said, ``very sad
personally, if you think about it: His twin brother died as a
child, and he was never completely got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his mother when he was 15, and later, when his father
died, he was away at school and no one even bothered to tell him.
He became an orphan, and later his own first born son \RJim Jr.\S
died as a child. He married the love of his life _ my mother _ but
she finally left him, and so did Freeda \RBill's mother\S. He had a
lot of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, Thorpe was stripped of his Olympic records and medals
because he had received money for playing semi-pro baseball with
two teams in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rules of the day were murky _ ``Basically, they
used me as a guinea pig to make up the rules,'' Thorpe once said _
the decision stood until long after his death on March 28, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that he was a `professional' at the time of the
Olympics is ridiculous,'' Bill Thorpe said. ``He competed in
athletics for the sheer exhilaration of it. He was a natural
athlete, and he just loved doing it _ all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up in the country, breaking wild horses and playing a
kind of follow-the-leader game with the other boys, in which they
all learned to excel at a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   The records and medals were restored in 1982, through the
efforts of the Thorpe family and others _ notably Robert Wheeler of
Denton, who became president of the Jim Thorpe Foundation and
author of the book /Jim Thorpe, World's Greatest Athlete''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him about it once,'' Grace said, ``and all he said
was, `I never wrote a letter to anyone trying to get them back.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But his eyes burned when he said it, and it obviously bothered
him all of his life. When the medals were finally restored, we all
had a great feeling of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of her parents' marriage, Grace says, was an early
manifestation of a now-familiar syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that a professional athlete does not usually
make a great husband,'' she said. ``On the road, he would go out
and drink with the others after a game _ so did McGraw, for that
matter _ and because they were famous men, there were always women
available. It was just tough on my mom, and she finally ended it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's relationship with John McGraw was never easy either,
and his career with the Giants ended because _ take your pick _ he
drank too much and was not ready to play; McGraw wanted him to give
up football; or, the relationship ended one day when Thorpe chased
McGraw around the field after the famous manager called him a
``dumb Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace Thorpe simply remembers that, ``McGraw's wife, Blanche,
was very kind to my mother and remained her friend for years.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her father, she said, ``He didn't talk much normally, and
you had to pull things out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an honest, serious man ... stoic, almost ... who worked
hard to take care of his family. The most money he ever made as an
athlete was maybe $10,000 _ it's ridiculous what they make today _
and there were always financial needs.''
</P>
<P>
   LEGACY
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Grace Thorpe's world revolves around making sure
that the 1950 vote holds true for the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he never had a big PR machine back when he was alive,''
she said, ``or he might have made more money. Right now, I'm it _ a
77-year-old lady livin' on Social Security. But I get a lot of
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, a guy from Japan sent me a book he wrote about
my dad. It looks good, but it's written in Japanese, so I really
can't read it.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also received a call from Tom McNabb, author of
/Donovan's Run'', who is working on a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hero of the book is a black track star,'' she said,
``trying to win the greatest race of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running against the ghost of Jim Thorpe.''

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO LIMIT POLITICIANS' TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad news: Members of Congress who promised to limit their own
terms are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Good news: There are only four of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   The headline in my paper on Friday made it seem worse:
``Republicans rethinking pledges for term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment there, I thought that all Republicans were reneging
on their term-limits promises. And I thought that all those who
were reneging were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that four of 10 House members who were elected in 1994
on pledges to serve no more than three two-year terms are now
having second thoughts. And one of the four is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   That's not too bad at all, when you stop and think about it.
Generally speaking, if you put 10 politicians in a room and extract
a promise from each of them, you can figure that the first nine
will be breaking the promise before the last one is finished making
it.
</P>
<P>
   These term-limits promises were part of the Republicans'
Contract With America back in that '94 election that saw the GOP
seize control of Congress for the first time since ... well, since
dinosaurs roamed the Earth or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats also bought into the idea, including
Massachusetts Rep. Marty Meehan _ whom some Americans might
remember as one of the House Judiciary Committee's leading
defenders of President Clinton during the impeachment hearings last
year. Meehan is one of the four House members who promised in 1994
to step down in 2000 but is apparently reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Republican Reps. George Nethercutt of Washington,
Scott McInnis of Colorado and Tillie Fowler of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   All this information comes to us, by the way, courtesy of the
Knight Ridder News Service, which quoted Nethercutt's chief of
staff as saying that the Washington congressman would make a
decision based on ``consultation and conversation with the people
of Washington state.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting. Didn't Nethercutt already consult and converse with
the people of Washington state on this question? Didn't his 1994
campaign promise eliminate the need for any additional consultation
and conversation on the subject of self-imposed term limits?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential promise-breakers, according to Knight
Ridder, ``have yet to announce their intention to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why lots of folks support the idea of legally mandated
term limits _ because even candidates who vow to impose term limits
on themselves cannot be trusted to make good on their promises. If
we can't count on them to do what they say they'll do, some voters
figure, we need laws that leave no room for such double-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Such frustration is understandable. But it is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The American people don't need mandatory term limits to force
elected officials out of office once they've worn out their
welcome. We don't even need to count on politicians to keep their
word _ which, of course, is an exercise in futility under almost
any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   No, we the people have the power to limit the terms of every
elected official at every level of government. We can limit
officeholders to three terms, two terms, one term _ or we can allow
them to serve 20 terms, if we like the job they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of our system. The voters get to decide who
serves and how long they serve.
</P>
<P>
   We have the power to establish term limits. And we get to make
up the limits as we go along. No etched-in-concrete statute can
guarantee such flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   If those four House members who are waffling on their term-limit
promises believe they can get away with double-crossing their
constituents, they have every right to try. And the constituents
have every right to send the double-crossers packing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's disappointing that some of these politicians who
boldly vowed to vacate their congressional posts after six years
may turn out to be hypocrites. It's no fun being lied to.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what, voters? Involuntary retirement is every bit as
effective as voluntary retirement.

SOONER RATHER THAN LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever a president or other world leader uses a phrase in a
highly charged situation, it echoes through the language. Sooner
rather than later, it loses its referent and becomes a freestanding
idiom; people use the familiar phrase out of voguish habit,
forgetting the source that initially popularized it.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22, 1998, during a photo opportunity with a nonplused
Yasser Arafat, President Clinton told reporters inquiring about
nonforeign relations, ``I'd like you to have more rather than less;
 &UR; sooner rather than later &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase was repeated supportively by his press secretary, as
well as by his former chief of staff, Leon Panetta: ``There is
going to be a time, and I think it has to be  &UR; sooner rather than
later &LR; , where the president has to say to the country what the
situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   As lawyerly counsel was taken and this policy was abandoned, the
president's critics used the phrase to beat him about the head.
``The president himself states,'' argued the independent counsel
before the Supreme Court, ``in January of this year, that the
American people are entitled to more rather than less,  &UR; sooner
rather than later &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase was quickly compressed in speech to
 &UR; soonerathernlater &LR;  and spread far afield. Jane Brenner, a
councilwoman from Punta Gorda, Fla., who is striving to save its
1927 courthouse from demolition, told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune,
``We're hoping to get the courthouse worked out, and  &UR; sooner rather
than later &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   A securities analyst in Fort Washington, Pa., asked by Dow Jones
about the public offering of Goldman, Sachs, used the phrase as an
adjective: ``anticipating the  &UR; sooner-rather-than-later &LR;  offering
of its stock to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is an outgrowth of  &UR; sooner or later &LR; , the
lexicographer Sol Steinmetz informs me. In 1577, Barnaby Googe
wrote in his translation of the Dutch author Conrad Heresbach's
``Heresbach's Foure Bookes of Husbandry'' that ``The stones,
stickes, and suche baggage ... are to be thrown out  &UR; sooner or
later &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, J.M. Campbell, writing in Speculum, illustrated both
root and branch: ``But if efforts to overtake the meaning of a
stubborn passage always include the ((Church)) Fathers sooner or
later, then why not  &UR; sooner than later &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest citation I can find of S.R.T.L. is in an article
from the journal published by the Royal Economic Society in June
1895. Referring to the ``Boot War,'' W.B. Hoffman wrote: ``The most
we can expect is that repetition of the late disastrous war will
not occur for some time to come, but even that hope may be
shattered  &UR; sooner rather than later &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This followed the action of settlers who rushed into Oklahoma
before April 22, 1889, to be ready to stake their land claims
before the official opening date, and became known as the
``Sooners.'' (Those who followed were called, presumably, the
Laters, but left no impact on the language. I put this in as a
service to readers in Oklahoma who may not know the origin of their
nickname.)
</P>
<P>
   The etymological analogy holds for Clinton's ``more rather than
less'': That's based on  &UR; more or less &LR; , from 1589, give or take a
few years.  &UR; Give or take &LR; , however, in its 1958 sense of
``approximate,'' has not spawned ``give rather than take,'' because
it was not used in a crisis of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In stretching out stock phrases resting on the fulcrum of  &UR; or &LR;  _
from  &UR; one thing or another &LR;  to  &UR; here or there &LR;  _ we must ask
ourselves, Is this extension necessary? Does the redundancy detract
from precision? Is S.R.T.L. any sooner than the unadorned  &UR; soon &LR; ?
At the end of the day, are we slipping into the easy acceptance of
a series of bromides as bad as  &UR; at the end of the day &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   Decide for yourself, one way rather than the other.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW GLOBALITY
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Globalization &LR;  was last year's hot word at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Forget it; the world has passed it by.
This year's theme was ``Responsible  &UR; Globality &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Coinage was attributed to Daniel Yergin, author of ``The
Commanding Heights'' (appropriate reading in a ski village), who
wrote in the May 18, 1998, Newsweek, ``We are now beginning to see
a reality beyond globalization _ the world of  &UR; globality &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Boston, Yergin further explained the term: ``What
bothered me about  &UR; globalization &LR; ,'' he said, ``was that it
describes a process. We needed a word to carry it into a state of
being.  &UR; Globality &LR;  suggests a condition of community and
interconnection.''
</P>
<P>
   Few feelings are as exhilarating as the thrill of coinage. Some
unknown diplomat involved in the normalization of relations smacked
his forehead one day and cried, ``I've got it _ we've reached
 &UR; normality &LR; !'' Someday, a soldier denied fraternization with the
local girls will long in print for  &UR; fraternality &LR; , an uncoined word
to shorten the equally sexist ``brotherhood of Man.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Globality &LR;  is not yet in the dictionaries, though it will be
sooner rather than whenever. But sorry, Dan, coinage cannot be
claimed; somebody almost always crops up to claim first use of a
noun formed from a common adjective.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondent Frank Gervasi wrote in 1943 of ``a sense of
the  &UR; globality &LR;  of the war.'' The Merriam-Webster files also turn
up ``even in 1942 a final obstacle to complete  &UR; globality &LR; 
remained,'' in the 1942 ``Global War,'' by Edgar Ansel Mowrer and
Marthe Rajchman.
</P>
<P>
   Econometricians liked it, too: Kiyoshi Kuga observed in the July
1972 Econometrica that ``the problem of  &UR; globality &LR;  is always
important in this topic'' of the factor-price equalization theorem,
my copy of which does not come readily to hand.
</P>
<P>
   But cheer up, Dan; aside from a 1988 use by an explicator of a
papal encyclical (a holy ghostwriter?) and a few murmurings by
Eurocrats,  &UR; globality &LR;  was awaiting a push. Yergin was the
unchallenged popularizer in its current politico-business sense.
Globalization, panting, has at last arrived; here we are in a state
of doggy-dog  &UR; globality &LR; .

SEEING A SLANT IN STORIES AND STYLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hear this in telephone calls weekly, if not daily, and read it
in letters and e-mail messages: Some newspaper readers think the
stories we write and the way we write them are influenced by the
biases of the journalists involved.
</P>
<P>
   And some believe we follow a specific agenda. Just what that
agenda is depends greatly on the viewpoint of the caller.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not a surprise that the same issue surfaced in last
year's American Society of Newspaper Editors study on newspaper
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The report labeled this ``major finding No. 3'' and stated it
this way: ``The public suspects that the points of view and biases
of journalists influence what stories are covered and how they are
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the numbers: 78 percent of those surveyed felt
that there was bias in the news media. The good news for those of
us in print is that 42 percent see television as the worst
offender. The bad news is that 23 percent think newspapers are.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to believe that it doesn't make much difference _
sources of information are so lumped together that people awash in
information have trouble keeping them separated.
</P>
<P>
   Readers' and viewers' opinion of television news colors their
opinion of print news. They clearly know the difference between
supermarket tabloids and daily newspapers, but screaming headlines
about Liz Taylor's latest problems cannot help but take a toll on
our credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Not helping in all of this is the star system among national
reporters. And it's not just confined to television reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Readers clearly know the difference between editorials and
columns, but they are rightfully skeptical when they see a print or
broadcast journalist who is charged with being neutral express an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the ASNE study concluded that at the core, ``it
seems that the public most commonly defines the foundation of bias
as a lack of neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the editorial page as the only home for opinion or
suggestion,'' the report said. ``The public believes that the
reporter's job is to report the facts _ completely, insightfully
and without spin (even if the spin makes for a better read), and
clean of any intent to sway or convince.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found at least three interpretations of what bias is:
</P>
<P>
   _30 percent of adults see bias as not being open-minded and
neutral about the facts.
</P>
<P>
   _29 percent say that it's having an agenda and shaping the news
report to fit it.
</P>
<P>
   _29 percent believe that it's favoritism to a particular social
or political group.
</P>
<P>
   _8 percent say bias in the news media is all of these.
</P>
<P>
   There's some indication that the perception of bias is a
self-fulfilling prophesy.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the results ``suggest that once an
individual begins to question newspaper credibility, he or she is
far more likely to behave in a way that reinforces that belief
rather than dispels it.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, more than two-thirds of adults say that ``their
perception of bias in newspapers does not represent a major
obstacle to being able to trust newspapers as a source of news _
perhaps because they believe they've built sufficient filtering
mechanisms to identify and neutralize it when they think they see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers asked people what groups they thought could
influence news decisions, and they named the usual suspects:
``politicians or government officials, big business and wealthy
individuals.'' Half of those surveyed felt that ``there are
individuals or groups that get a special break and enjoy overly
favorable coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But 45 percent believe that some groups get overly unfavorable
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the presumption of a negative bias is primarily ethnic or
racial, with significant proportions of the public volunteering (on
an unaided, top-of-mind basis) that African-Americans,
Hispanics/Latinos, conservatives, the poor/people on welfare and
religious organizations (especially born-again Christians) don't
get a fair shake in the media,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   I've often told people that publishing a newspaper daily is
difficult enough and that adding something as complex as a
conspiracy would bring the process to a halt. But this is a case
where perception might as well be reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a newspaper's `agenda' is consciously articulated,
subliminally active or nonexistent, then, a large proportion of the
U.S. public believes that there is one, and they believe that it
can influence the news they see or don't see,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Defining ``news'' is a difficult assignment. What I find
interesting may bore you to tears. You may think a story short at
100 inches because it involves a favorite topic, while I can't get
past the third paragraph because I don't care much about that
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some perception of bias probably is linked to this: There's
never enough in the paper about your favorite causes, and there's
always too much in the paper about causes you dislike.
</P>
<P>
   But we can all survive these kinds of debates if we have
persuaded you that what we select for print and the way we write it
is fair and evenhanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reputations for credibility are hard to win and easy to
lose,'' the report said. ``Most dangerous, of course, is the short
distance between the public believing that there is an agenda
within the newsroom, and to them seeing that agenda expressed as
opinion within the news report.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the public senses this, it's a severe threat to
credibility _ irrespective of whether the intention of the agenda
they see is noble, or whether the expression of its voice is
skillful,'' it said.

`RELIGIOUS RIGHT' HAS ITS USES, LIBERAL SCHOLAR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``religious right,'' considered dangerous by some liberal
politicians and theologians, isn't all bad, one liberal scholar of
religion says.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives have forced Americans into deeper
discussion about morality in politics, personal life, family life
and the original meaning of separation of church and state, said
Ron Flowers, director of the department of religion at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers made that point to journalists and religion scholars
during a two-day ``Religion in the News'' conference in Fort Worth
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the religious right is wrong,'' Flowers said in an
interview. ``Still, it has been very useful in bringing heated
debate on separation of church and state, abortion, public morality
and the content of TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers is president of the North Texas chapter of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, and author of ``That
Godless Court? Supreme Court Decisions on Church-State
Relationships.'' He was one of several speakers at the Fort Worth
conference aimed at improving coverage of religion in the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   The TCU workshop was one of a series throughout the nation
spearheaded by Mark Silk, a former Atlanta Constitution reporter,
editorial writer and columnist who directs the Center for the Study
of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
Financial support for the workshops is provided by the Lily
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth event was co-sponsored by TCU's religion
department and the American Academy of Religion, Southwest Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several goals, including letting supervising editors
get an idea of what the religion beat is like, or should be like,''
Silk said. ``Also, it helps news people get acquainted with
religion scholars who have the expertise to help with news
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian conservatives' call for moral correctness
continues to be newsworthy, Flowers said at the workshop,
</P>
<P>
   Personal morality has been shoved even further into the
forefront lately by President Clinton's misadventures with Monica
Lewinski and his subsequent impeachment trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a liberal who voted twice for President Clinton, but I was
completely undone by his behavior,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers of the religion scene believe the president's
misbehavior offers an opportunity to reflect on America's moral
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   United Methodist Bishop Felton E. May, leader of his
denomination's Baltimore-Washington conference, issued a statement
saying Clinton had apparently grown spiritually because of his
ordeal. And he urged the president to speak up for a higher
morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where consumption, hedonism and
self-gratification have increasingly become normal and even
celebrated,'' May said. ``I believe President Clinton now has a
unique opportunity to call a world from selfishness to Christ-like
love and service of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Flowers said he agrees that the nation should seek a
higher morality, he said the Christian right is seeking to enforce
its own brand of morality on others. He said that as much as he
abhors Clinton's conduct, he believes that the investigation of the
president was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe Hillary Clinton was more right than wrong when
she said the whole thing was initiated by the right wing to remove
him from office,'' Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives are better organized than they were when
they emerged on the American political scene in the 1980s. They
still are pushing for anti-abortion laws, school-prayer bills and
tuition voucher legislation, which Flowers said gets the church too
involved with the state.
</P>
<P>
   And although Flowers praises Christian political conservatives
for bringing up moral questions, he will spend the next few years
opposing their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, we still have great cause to be alarmed by the
religious right,'' he said.

   When Diane Kelly describes her unusual field of study, her
listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's because she
spends her days doing experiments on the penises of mammals from
rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the first and only
scientist to study the biomechanics of the male organ _ in other
words, the principles of engineering and physics that enable the
penis to do what it's supposed to do. Mary Roach, a contributing
editor of Discover magazine, reports.

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some

EARLY SIGNS OF SPRING AND GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Separate studies using different methods in the last three years
have found that as the earth's atmosphere warms, spring is arriving
earlier and autumn is coming later in the Northern Hemisphere. But
much of the evidence has been indirect.
</P>
<P>
   Now a direct examination of the actual behavior of plants across
Europe appears to confirm the earlier findings.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence comes from a network of 77 research sites
called the International Phenological Gardens. Spread across the
length and breadth of Europe from northern Scandinavia to Greece
and from Spain and Ireland to Poland and Bulgaria, the gardens
contain genetically identical clones of various species of trees
and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring from 1959 to 1993, observers at the sites recorded
the dates when buds first appeared, leaves unfolded and plants
flowered. Each fall, the observers noted the dates when leaves
turned color and fell from trees.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the resulting mass of data, two researchers at the
University of Munich in Germany have found that over the three
decades, the advent of spring advanced an average of six days,
while autumn was delayed an average of about five days.
</P>
<P>
   This 11-day lengthening of the growing season was caused by
warmer temperatures, concluded the researchers, Dr. Annette Menzel,
a specialist in the study of forests, and Dr. Peter Fabian, who
specializes in climate, meteorology and forests. Their report
appears in the current issue of Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 19th century, the average surface temperature of
the earth has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more,
with northern latitudes warming more than the global average. Most
climate experts believe that emissions of heat-trapping waste
industrial gases like carbon dioxide, a product of the burning of
fossil fuels like coal and oil, are responsible for at least some
of this warming.
</P>
<P>
   This dominant view also holds that if emissions of the
heat-trapping gases continue at the present rate, the average
global temperature will rise by another 2 to 6 degrees, with a best
estimate of 3.5 degrees, over the next century. This compares with
a warming of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age
some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The predicted warming, the experts say, would disrupt the
earth's climate, make both droughts and floods worse, cause the
oceans to rise and push temperate-zone climatic zones farther
north. It would also be expected to have some positive effects, not
least the lengthening of growing seasons in northern latitudes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Menzel-Fabian study, the longer growing seasons
have already arrived. The area of the study spanned almost the
entire width of the northern temperate zone, from the sub-Arctic to
the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists' analysis of the plants' spring awakening and
autumn decline found that in some stations, in the Balkans, spring
was coming later. They attributed this to regional patterns of
climate change that were exceptions to the larger European pattern.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern, they found, was clear: Over the last three
decades, the onset of spring gradually moved earlier in the year,
while the advent of autumn became later and later. Further, they
discovered, this pattern matched what would be expected to happen
on the basis of computer models of the effect of rising
temperatures on plant behavior in spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Plants' response to seasonal change is driven mainly by changes
in the average daily temperature, said Dr. Menzel, and Europe's
temperature has been rising over the last three decades. Modeling
studies, she said, indicate that 70 percent of the lengthened
growing season can be explained by rises in daily temperature.
Changes in light, soil conditions and water supply also influence
the awakening and dormancy of deciduous plants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers attributed the rise in daily temperatures to a
general warming of the climate rather than any locally induced
warming produced by what is called the urban heat-island effect.
Cities are warmer than the surrounding countryside, but only a few
of the research sites in the International Phenological Gardens are
in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Other recent studies have shown that buds are bursting open
earlier in the spring in Canada, and studies in Britain have found
that birds are laying their eggs earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Dr. Charles D. Keeling of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in San Diego reported that an earlier spring in the
Northern Hemisphere was reflected in the seasonal rise and fall of
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Plants ``breathe'' carbon
dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   When they drop their leaves in the fall and go dormant,
atmospheric levels of the gas increase. When they regain the leaves
in the spring, levels drop.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of these fluctuations revealed that spring was arriving
across the hemisphere about a week earlier in the 1990s than in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, this finding was bolstered by a study by Dr. Ranga B.
Myneni of Boston University and four other researchers, including
Keeling. Using a different method, they found that spring was
arriving about a week earlier in the early 1990's than in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This study was confined to regions north of the 45th parallel,
which runs through or near Yellowstone National Park, Minneapolis,
Ottawa, Boston, Bordeaux, Belgrade and Vladivostok. North of that
line, warming in recent decades has been substantially greater than
the global average.
</P>
<P>
   The Myneni study also found that fall was arriving later, with
the result that the growing season in the northern climes had
increased by 12 days, give or take 4 days. The researchers reached
this conclusion by analyzing changes in solar radiation absorbed by
plants as they perform photosynthesis. From this, the scientists
were able to infer the arrival of the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Myneni said, all the recent studies indicate
that a warming and greening of the planet is indeed under way, and
that the growing season should lengthen further if temperatures
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The result, a number of scientists say, is a greener planet. Dr.
Menzel and Fabian, writing in Nature, said the lengthened growing
season they found was ``likely to contribute to increased biomass
formation.'' Biomass is the dry weight of living things, in this
case plants.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in Europe and Asia have indicated that forests have
indeed increased in biomass. And Myneni and his colleagues were
able to determine that because of more vigorous plant growth
associated both with warmer temperatures and higher levels of
atmospheric carbon dioxide, the amount of vegetation in the
northern regions had increased by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from the effect of warming, carbon dioxide spurs
plant growth. What this carbon dioxide effect might mean for
agriculture and forestry is not entirely clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that while more carbon dioxide makes plants
bigger, it does so by reducing the relative amount of nutrients in
a plant. This makes it less nutritious as food _ a person or animal
would have to eat more to get the same benefit.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a greener north could increase agricultural
and timber production and expand the Northern Hemisphere's
wheat-growing regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A new approach combining an antidepressant, nicotine replacement
and counseling is sharply increasing the chance of success among
people who are trying to give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, according to scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and other experts on smoking, fewer than 5
percent of smokers who seek to quit without outside help are
successful. But when the new approach was tried with 4,000 smokers
at centers across the country, 40 percent to 60 percent remained
smoke-free a year after completing the program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Ferry, chief of preventive medicine at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif., who first proposed
the combination treatment, said it involved bupropion, a drug
originally developed as a treatment for depression; varying dosages
of nicotine replacement delivered through patches, gum nasal spray
or inhalers, and counseling individually tailored to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Slade of the American Society of Addictive Medicine, an
organization of doctors and others who treat alcoholism, drug abuse
and nicotine addiction, called the new results ``very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, said the
results so far were ``highly encouraging for 45 million Americans
who smoke but now have a much better chance of quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, health experts estimate, three million people,
including more than 440,000 in the United States, die prematurely
each year from strokes, cancer, heart disease and other illnesses
brought on by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in tobacco dependence caution that the findings on the
new approach must be regarded as preliminary. Nicotine addiction is
notoriously tenacious, and smokers can relapse even after going 5
to 10 years without smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said much more needed to be
learned about the addiction. Still, he said, the addition of
bupropion to programs for ending the smoking habit represents the
biggest development in the field since nicotine-replacement therapy
was introduced in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Bupropion, made by Glaxo Wellcome, was first marketed in 1989 as
an antidepressant under the name Wellbutrin. A slow-release form of
bupropion, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for
treatment of nicotine addiction, is marketed under the name Zyban.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination approach is being widely used in clinics
around the country, including the center in Loma Linda; the
University of Wisconsin in Madison; the Army base at Fort Knox,
Ky., and the Mayo Clinic's Nicotine Dependence Center, as well as
private clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The success rates of 40 percent to 60 percent that were achieved
compare with 10 percent to 26 percent success rates among smokers
who try to quit by using nicotine replacement alone.
</P>
<P>
   One small, aggressive treatment program at Loma Linda involved
six women who were lifelong smokers who had tried many times to
quit. All six stopped smoking and have not smoked for a year.
(Their treatment involved 12 months of outpatient counseling
sessions, lectures, films, exercise and a buddy system in which one
person helps persuade the other not to smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Matthew P. Bars, a clinical psychologist who runs clinics at
Pavonia Medical Associates, a group practice in Bergen County,
N.J., said the new approach even worked for an airline pilot who
had smoked seven packs of cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was so addicted to nicotine, Bars said, that ``he
could not sleep more than two hours at a time, when the urge for
more tobacco woke him up and he'd have to have a puff or two before
he could sleep again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot remained free of cigarettes for a year, and then, Bars
said, he lost touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   The combination treatment has evolved out of initially
unexpected findings in the 1980s of a high correlation between
nicotine addiction, depression and other mood disorders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, scientists were learning of the trickery by
which nicotine is able to work itself into the cells of the brain,
influencing the production of powerful chemicals that act on the
brain, dopamine and norepinephrine. Among other things, dopamine
contributes to feelings of joy and pleasure, and norepinephrine
increases energy and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   But nicotine causes rapid surges and then rapid depletions of
these chemicals, leaving the smoker yearning for another cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists discovered a class of drugs that slow the
depletion of brain chemicals that affect mood. Bupropion worked
specifically on dopamine and norepinephrine, bringing them back to
their more natural and longer-lasting levels _ and without being
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dr. Ferry proposed putting these two findings together,
and treating nicotine addiction with the bupropion. The maker of
the drug, Burroughs Wellcome, which later merged with Glaxo,
declined to take part on the ground that there was no clinical
evidence that the approach would work.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Ferry went ahead on her own, financing a small pilot
study with $5,000 from Loma Linda University, where she teaches at
the medical school, and from the Loma Linda center. She enlisted
her mother, a retired nurse, and a group of medical students to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ferry had been treating a group of veterans who were
seriously ill with smoking-related disorders but were nevertheless
still unable to stop smoking. She selected 44 of these men, put
half on bupropion and half on a dummy pill: all 22 on the placebo
failed to quit but 12 on the medication succeeded in stopping
within three weeks, and after three years only one of them had
resumed smoking.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the manufacturer provided $175,000 for a larger pilot
study of 190 people, which achieved success rates of 43 percent
after 12 weeks and 28 percent one year after completion of the
trial. Those rates were then regarded as high for a group of the
hardest-core nicotine addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David P.L. Sachs, director of the Palo Alto Center for
Pulmonary Disease Prevention in California, and an expert on
smoking-related lung disorders and the neurological effects of
nicotine, was among those who reviewed the Loma Linda studies and
recommended the larger trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear from Dr. Ferry's trials that bupropion worked,''
Sachs said. ``We know it blocks the re-uptake of dopamine and
norepinephrine molecules and helps restore the more healthy
chemical balances of the brain. But we still do not know precisely
how.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer then organized what eventually became the first
of two large-scale placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 1,500
nondepressed people who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day,
comparing bupropion with a placebo, and then to both a placebo and
nicotine patches, and to the combination of nicotine patches and
bupropion used together. In both studies brief counseling was also
given.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of first project were reported in The New England
Journal of Medicine in 1997: of smokers treated at three centers
across the country, 44 percent of those who took 300 milligrams of
bupropion a day stopped smoking by the end of a six-week trial
period, as against 19 percent in the group taking the placebo.
After a year, 23 percent were still not smoking, as compared with
12 percent in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, which included results of smokers treated with
the combination, found that 23 percent of participants on a placebo
had quit by the end of six weeks, 36 percent of those on the patch,
49 percent on bupropion alone and 58 percent on the combination of
patch, medication and counseling. It was on the basis of this trial
that the drug agency approved the marketing of Zyban.
</P>
<P>
   The results a year later, as reported in a follow-up study
awaiting publication, are expected to be lower, but still
significantly higher than for any treatments previously used.
</P>
<P>
   Though Glaxo Wellcome and others credit Dr. Ferry with
conceiving the new approach, she cites other researchers as
contributing to it, including Dr. Neal L. Benowitz at the
University of California at San Francisco, who studied nicotine's
influence on smoking patterns; Dr. Torgny Svensson of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, who traced, in rat studies, the
pathways nicotine takes to the command centers of the brain; Dr.
Alex H. Glassman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University,
who found strong correlations between depression and the likelihood
of becoming addicted to smoking; and Dr. David E. Comings of the
City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., and Dr. Caryn Lerman
of the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who have
found a genetic link to vulnerability to nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Comings and Lerman have identified genetic variations that
appear to leave people vulnerable to the effects of nicotine,
especially at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news so far about the new approach, Dr. Ferry
says it illustrates a serious problem with a medical system that
relies on private industry to support research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is,'' she said, ``drug companies naturally get
involved initially only if they see a potential profit, but then
once they get government approval for selling their drugs, they
drop the subject, when there is still much to learn about its
dosages and how and under what conditions it works best.''

SEARCHING FOR BIG WAVES? TRY SURFING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Surf forecasting has become a booming business,
and some forecasters claim better than 90 percent accuracy in
predicting the big waves.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasts are so reliable that when a respected forecaster
predicts a big swell for Fiji, Hawaii, Peru or Tahiti, well-heeled
surf-seekers fly there to catch the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a forecast of high waves sent 20 big-wave riders
from around the world to Mavericks, the surf break along the
California coast, for the first ``Men Who Ride Mountains'' contest.
The victor, Darryl Virostko of Santa Cruz, Calif., won $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years surfers have become completely dependent on surf
forecasts, said Evan Slater, editor of Surfer Magazine in San Juan
Capistrano. Forecast accuracy is ``about 90 percent and higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Surf forecasters use data from the National Weather Service,
satellites, scientific buoys, paid surf-watchers at different
beaches, video monitors of various coastlines, and other sources to
predict the surf conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in the summertime, when storms are coming out of the
Southern Hemisphere, we're telling people a week and a half in
advance (about swells). We can predict a swell right on the
button,'' said Chris Borg, a 12-year veteran of surf forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a downside to surf science: It has robbed surfing
of much of its former mystery. In the 1960s, the golden age of
surfing popularized by Hollywood movies starring Annette Funicello
and Frankie Avalon, the inexplicable comings and goings of ocean
swells inspired cosmic reveries and poetic musings.
</P>
<P>
   While most beach films were teen-oriented showcases for pop
music and bikinis, critics recognized at least one surfing film _
``The Endless Summer'' _ as a thoughtful depiction of a
counterculture lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mystery is gone. The ocean is constantly scrutinized by
orbiting satellites which relay wind, storm, sea-level and other
measurements by the National Weather Service, the National Data
Buoy Center and other agencies. The data are dumped into the
Internet, where anyone with a computer can access the information.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 weather-watching buoys around the world are monitored
by the National Data Buoy Center, a branch of the National Weather
Service. The center is based at NASA's Stennis Space Center in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   A leading surf forecaster, Sean Collins of Surfline/Wavetrak in
Huntington Beach, Calif., bases predictions on the time periods
between swells and other factors, which indicate whether wave
intensity is growing or ebbing.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also rely on weather maps, which reveal the position
and strength of storms. From the Internet, they get data from
floating buoys, which show how high swells are.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the intensity of a wave may vary according to the angle at
which it hits a coastline. So in calculating the effects for each
beach, surf forecasters must take into account the shape of the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   They must also take into account factors below the water's
surface. Submerged islands, for example, can disturb an otherwise
strong swell.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-time surfers lament ``the death of mystery'' as surf
forecasting becomes routine and reliable, Slater admits. ``Now it's
all through the Internet. You almost are disappointed the next
morning if the forecasts don't live up to expectations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A new approach combining an antidepressant, nicotine replacement
and counseling is sharply increasing the chance of success among
people who are trying to give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, according to scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and other experts on smoking, fewer than 5
percent of smokers who seek to quit without outside help are
successful. But when the new approach was tried with 4,000 smokers
at centers across the country, 40 percent to 60 percent remained
smoke-free a year after completing the program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Ferry, chief of preventive medicine at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif., who first proposed
the combination treatment, said it involved bupropion, a drug
originally developed as a treatment for depression; varying dosages
of nicotine replacement delivered through patches, gum nasal spray
or inhalers, and counseling individually tailored to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Slade of the American Society of Addictive Medicine, an
organization of doctors and others who treat alcoholism, drug abuse
and nicotine addiction, called the new results ``very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, said the
results so far were ``highly encouraging for 45 million Americans
who smoke but now have a much better chance of quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, health experts estimate, three million people,
including more than 440,000 in the United States, die prematurely
each year from strokes, cancer, heart disease and other illnesses
brought on by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in tobacco dependence caution that the findings on the
new approach must be regarded as preliminary. Nicotine addiction is
notoriously tenacious, and smokers can relapse even after going 5
to 10 years without smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said much more needed to be
learned about the addiction. Still, he said, the addition of
bupropion to programs for ending the smoking habit represents the
biggest development in the field since nicotine-replacement therapy
was introduced in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Bupropion, made by Glaxo Wellcome, was first marketed in 1989 as
an antidepressant under the name Wellbutrin. A slow-release form of
bupropion, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for
treatment of nicotine addiction, is marketed under the name Zyban.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination approach is being widely used in clinics
around the country, including the center in Loma Linda; the
University of Wisconsin in Madison; the Army base at Fort Knox,
Ky., and the Mayo Clinic's Nicotine Dependence Center, as well as
private clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The success rates of 40 percent to 60 percent that were achieved
compare with 10 percent to 26 percent success rates among smokers
who try to quit by using nicotine replacement alone.
</P>
<P>
   One small, aggressive treatment program at Loma Linda involved
six women who were lifelong smokers who had tried many times to
quit. All six stopped smoking and have not smoked for a year.
(Their treatment involved 12 months of outpatient counseling
sessions, lectures, films, exercise and a buddy system in which one
person helps persuade the other not to smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Matthew P. Bars, a clinical psychologist who runs clinics at
Pavonia Medical Associates, a group practice in Bergen County,
N.J., said the new approach even worked for an airline pilot who
had smoked seven packs of cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was so addicted to nicotine, Bars said, that ``he

more tobacco woke him up and he'd have to have a puff or two before
he could sleep again.''

DEAD WEIGHT AND TAXES: THE NATIONAL DEBT AND SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxes are the price for all the things we do together as a
nation, their adequacy a mark of our maturity and their fairness a
test of our wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three years ago, a cynical old pro of Texas political wars
offered me (then a first-time candidate for the Texas Legislature)
what he guaranteed was a sure-fire, can't-fail recipe for perpetual
re-election: Vote for all appropriations and against all taxes! The
latter in any form, he opined, were simply anathema to voters.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed to make superficial political sense to GOP
congressional leaders, looking for something popular with big
contributors and salable to voters, to promise an
``across-the-board tax cut.'' To the surprise of the plan's
promoters, the public began telling pollsters and at least some
Republican congressmen that instead of that tax cut, they'd prefer
applying the $63 billion federal budget surplus to protecting
Social Security and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   All of this tends to confirm my long-held conviction that the
public is generally more sensible, more responsible and less greedy
than politicians quite often give people credit for being. It
validates some much better political advice I got, also about 50
years ago, from a Weatherford, Texas, lawyer and longtime mentor
named George McCall. His admonition: Never overestimate the
public's information, but never underestimate the public's
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the people seem to understand that this
proposed ``across-the-board'' reduction in taxes _ slicing
everyone's tax rate by a flat 10 percent _ would be a lot less
egalitarian than it sounds. A study by the Joint Committee on
Taxation concludes that the bill would shower its greatest benefit
on the nation's very wealthiest _ those who obviously need it the
least.
</P>
<P>
   During the first full year of the proposed rate cut, one-third
of the rebate would go to the most affluent 1 percent, and more
than half would inure to taxpayers with incomes exceeding $100,000
a year. Only 17 percent of the cut would be enjoyed by the middle
and lower two-thirds of America's families who make less than
$50,000 annually. The bottom third of all taxpaying households
would get virtually no benefit at all.
</P>
<P>
   This plan is identical to the tax cut successfully pushed by
President Reagan in 1981, except that it just doesn't ask for two
more layers of 10 percent cuts in succeeding years. It was that
very plan, sold as an economic panacea by the winsome old
persuader, that set us on the path of rising deficits and soaring
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, our national debt stood at just under $1 trillion, the
cumulative result of 200 years of nationhood and 39 presidential
administrations. The Reagan tax cut, spun out principally to
America's wealthiest 10 percent while we were doubling military
expenditures, more than tripled the national debt in one short
decade.
</P>
<P>
   As result of that prodigal economic policy, our annual interest
payment on the debt _ the amount that taxpayers have to shell out
every year just to service the debt _ skyrocketed from about $50
billion in 1980 to approximately $267 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on that figure for a minute. It is dead weight. It buys us
nothing. It doesn't pave a single mile of road, buy a single
schoolbook or build a single airplane. Interest on the debt is not
optional. It's automatic. It must be paid first, before we can buy
anything else. This year, it amounts to almost exactly $1,000 per
capita _ man, woman and child.
</P>
<P>
   And the only conceivable way to reduce this ubiquitous drag on
our national pocketbook is to start paying down the debt. Take part
of that $63 billion surplus and use it to reduce our level of
indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
   People who'd offer big tax cuts to those who don't need them in
times of prosperity rather than paying on the debt are not, in the
classic sense, conservatives. For years they've been boisterously
blaming the debt on ``the tax-and-spend crowd.'' They're wrong. At
fault is the borrow-and-spend crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, in 1959, I proposed that we begin paying off
the national debt at the rate of 1 percent a year. Some thought
that whimsical. According to an amortization table we worked out at
the time, within 18 years we'd have been paying less in principal
and interest combined than we were then paying annually in interest
alone. In 1959, interest on the debt cost us about $11 billion, and
I thought that was a lot. That was 20 years before Reagan's tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   It is mistaken _ absolutely wrong _ to say that the working poor
``pay no taxes'' when their total earnings fall below the income
tax threshold. They pay a far bigger percent of their meager
incomes on sales and excise taxes than do we who get to save and
invest a portion of ours. Moreover, these lower-income wage earners
feed the Social Security trust fund with payroll taxes deducted
regularly from their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   To complain, therefore, about the progressivity of the income
tax is to ignore the regressivity of most other taxes. To complain
against using the biggest portion of any budget surplus to buttress
the Social Security trust fund is to ignore the several decades in
which we've borrowed from that fund to mask our budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   To fail to make a serious start on these problems this year when
good fortune has given us a surplus would be unforgivable folly.

 UNDATED: being addictive.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1989, Dr. Ferry proposed putting these two findings together,
and treating nicotine addiction with the bupropion. The maker of
the drug, Burroughs Wellcome, which later merged with Glaxo,
declined to take part on the ground that there was no clinical

recommended the larger trials.

   WASHINGTON _ An experimental rocket that is at the heart of
NASA's plans to develop a low-cost, re-usable vehicle that might
eventually replace the space shuttle has fallen more than a year
behind schedule for its first flight because of mounting technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket, called the X-33, represents a radically different
approach to launching space payloads that proponents say could
drastically reduce costs and expand access to space for new types
of uses, including tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the X-33, a half-scale prototype that is to
demonstrate an array of new technologies for future launchers, is
behind schedule and under budget pressures because it was designed
to do too much under a tightly limited program.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
project's lead contractor, the Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Skunk Works
Division in Palmdale, Calif., acknowledge that unexpected technical
problems have delayed the experimental rocket project. But they say
such troubles are expected with a cutting-edge program and are the
price of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Problems affecting the X-33 include difficulty in manufacturing
its engines, a new design that has never flown before; trouble in
making its lightweight, graphite-reinforced plastic fuel tanks, and
excess weight that will reduce the craft's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we picked this X-33 concept in the summer of 1996, we
knew this design was brand new and nothing like it had been built
before,'' said Gary Payton, head of NASA's re-usable launching
vehicle program. ``When you choose an aggressive and daring
project, you know you will run into problems,'' he continued,
``That's one way of knowing you're really pushing the technology,
which is what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 program is a cooperative government-industry effort to
demonstrate that it is possible to make a rocket that is cheaper
and easier to operate and maintain than anything now flying. It
costs about $10,000 per pound to orbit payloads with the space
shuttle and one of the goals of the new rocket would be to reduce
this to $1,000 a pound, or less.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has committed $941 million to the project and Lockheed
Martin and its industry partners have put up about $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   The envisioned vehicle is called a single-stage-to-orbit rocket
because it would fly into space and return to Earth in one piece,
much like an airliner. Conventional rockets, even the space
shuttle, are not totally reusable because with each use they
discard parts, like fuel tanks, booster rockets or spent lower
stages.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and Lockheed Martin hope a successful X-33 program will
prove the feasibility of building a larger rocket, called the
Venture Star, which would be able to carry space shuttle-size
payloads into space at much reduced cost. The plan calls for the
company to seek private investment of more than $5 billion to build
two Venture Stars that it would own and operate, selling launching
services to government and commercial clients as early as 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers are skeptical about the program's chances for
success. John E. Pike, director of space policy for the Federation
of American Scientists in Washington, said developing a
privately-owned space launcher of this scale would take more time
and money than proponents acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a dozen flights of a sub-scale vehicle will give
you a firm handle on the reliability and flight rates of a Venture
Star that you can take to investors,'' Pike said, ``The main
challenges of Venture Star are not technical, but economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Vanderbilt, a spokesman for the Space Access Society, a
national advocacy group for cheaper space flight, said the designs
of the X-33 and Venture Star were too complex to reduce costs
enough to open space to small businesses and individuals. And
failure of the project could cause potential investors to turn away
from other, more promising, low-cost rocket proposals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a tragedy if Venture Star made people think the
single-stage-to-orbit concept can't work,'' Vanderbilt said.
</P>
<P>
   The winning Lockheed Martin design, the most ambitious of three
candidates proposed in 1996, is a vehicle shaped like a flat
arrowhead with fins at the bottom. It is designed to take off
vertically using a new type of nozzleless rocket engine, to
re-enter the atmosphere protected by a novel metallic thermal
covering, to fly back horizontally with the help of lift generated
by its flat body, and to land on a runway like an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 67-feet-tall and measuring 68-feet-wide at the tail,
the unmanned experimental craft is not designed to reach orbit with
its two engines powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. But
engineers say it should be able to fly 50 miles high at hypersonic
speed, more than enough to prove its design and test its components
under the harshest conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 was originally to begin a series of 15 test flights
this month, but a number of manufacturing and engineering problems
forced the first launching date to slip, first to July, then to
December. Program officials said last week that the new target date
was July, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Austin, NASA's X-33 program manager, said project delays
were attributed to a range of problems, including late delivery of
parts by suppliers and difficulties in assembling components. For
example, trouble bonding high-temperature engine parts at the
Boeing Co.'s Rocketdyne engine division added $36 million to
project costs and pushed the schedule back several months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 and its successor are to be powered by linear aerospike
engines, which save weight and complexity by forgoing the moveable,
bell-shaped engine nozzles used for conventional rocket engines.
Each of the X-33's engines, which generate 205,000 pounds of
thrust, has small combustors, or thrust chambers, that fire along
curved open exhaust ramps instead of through a nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   The two ramps form a V-shape with thrusters, aligned along the
top outside surface of each side, that fire downward toward the
point.
</P>
<P>
   The ramps are made of a copper alloy sheet milled to include
internal passages through which coolant is circulated. The copper
is backed by a brazed-on steel sheet, but temperature differences
throughout the ramps and other problems made the bonding much more
difficult than expected, Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   In a problem related to the engine, which has been tested
extensively on the ground since the 1970s but never in flight, NASA
and Lockheed Martin announced in November that they had given up on
a more than three-year effort to test-fire a small aerospike engine
atop an SR-71 research plane during high-speed runs.
</P>
<P>
   During the $27 million program, known as Lasre for Linear
Aerospike SR-71 Experiment, a small engine carried in a one-tenth
scale model X-33 flew aboard the former reconnaissance jet seven
times, but was never fired.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rising, the Lockheed Martin executive in charge of the
X-33 program from the beginning, said persistent fuel leaks in the
test model's plumbing system made live firings dangerous and the
company felt it was not worth spending more money to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel flow tests during the flights and ground firings of the
engine helped the company validate computer predictions of how the
aerospike's hot, open exhaust plume would behave in flight, he
said, and further investment in Lasre was not warranted just to
fire the engine in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem arose in December when part of one of the
X-33's two liquid hydrogen fuel tanks came apart when it was being
heat cured. A 28-foot-long section of the tank's skin, made by
laying sheets of composite material, pulled apart from its inner
surface and has to be completely replaced, engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rising said that it would cost $6 million to make and replace
the damaged tank skin, but that there were no estimates of the
total cost of correcting the snag.
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 also has had a weight problem, at one point growing
from its intended 65,000 pounds to 78,000 pounds, Rising said. The
craft's mass is now down to about 75,000 pounds, he said, but the
company has decided not to invest in a severe weight-reduction
program because it would be costly and most of the rocket's flight
objectives can be reached without being lightened further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already taking what we are learning with X-33 and
applying it to the design of the Venture Star, and that's where we
are making the weight-reduction measures,'' Rising said.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is one of the reasons the X-33 will not meet an original
program goal of flying at a top speed of Mach 15, or 15 times the
speed of sound, a little more than 11,000 miles per hour. Rising
confirmed that the craft's maximum speed is now down to Mach 13.8,
about 10,000 mph, but said this was sufficient for the craft to
meet all its test objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Launched vertically from a recently completed site at Edwards
Air Force Base in California, the X-33 is to make test flights in
which it would land at military bases in Utah or Montana and then
be brought back to California by truck. Early flights will be to
the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and higher, longer-ranged tests
will take it to Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Rising said the problems with the X-33 should not distract from
the program's accomplishments so far, including completion of its
launching site ahead of schedule, certification of its metal
heat-shield system as flight-ready, successful testing of the
systems that pump fuel to the engines and control their thrust, and
completed verification testing of the system of small rockets that
will control the spacecraft at high altitudes.

QUIET ANNIVERSARY BELIES CONTROVERSIAL PAST OF `THE WARRIORS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These are the armies of the night,'' screamed a movie poster
20 years ago. ``They're out to stop the Warriors.'' And so,
director Walter Hill's crowning B-picture classic, ``The
Warriors,'' was issued into America.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Grease,'' or ``The Godfather'' _ or the ``Star Wars''
trilogy _ ``Warriors'' will not receive a grand rerelease, even
though it was the generation's most influential action movie. There
won't even be a salutatory ``20-year anniversary'' sticker on its
videocassette box.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``The Warriors'' was also one of the most
controversial movies of its time. Outbreaks of violence at theaters
prompted a nervous Paramount Pictures to withdraw the film shortly
after its 1979 release, while it was still making money.
</P>
<P>
   An exciting and too effectively lurid trailer spelled out the
picture's story: The gangs of New York have decided to unite to
take over the city. It was a great paranoid premise, one that sent
a chill through a nation made uncomfortable by the rise of gangs.
And New York was at its dangerous, deteriorating peak _ four years
earlier, a New York Post headline had bellowed the president's
response to the city's appeal for federal aid: ``Drop Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story line, from the novel by Sol Yurick, followed
what happened at the big gang convocation. Cyrus, the head of the
Riffs and the charismatic figure behind the takeover idea, is
assassinated. The Warriors are blamed, even though they're not
responsible. And they have to fight their way back from Manhattan
to their home in Coney Island, with every gang in the city out to
stop them. (Yurick's novel followed the Greek legend of Xenophon
and the 10,000; after their leader is killed in Persia, Xenophon
and his band have to battle their way home.)
</P>
<P>
   Hill staged the film in a manner new to American action films,
with fight sequences inspired by the Hong Kong kung-fu movies of
the early '70s. Hill's action-choreography had a high-flying
clarity that hadn't been exploited in American films before; it was
scored with throbbing Euro-metal music, and a few bad, but
stirring, songs.
</P>
<P>
   Each fight was like a rousing show-stopper number in a musical;
after a tense, dazzling throw-down in the confined space of a
subway men's room, the audience I saw the movie with was on its
feet, stomping and applauding. Also, each fight was like a
miniclimax, advancing the narrative and increasing the adrenaline
level.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout must've caught the studio off guard, because
``Warriors'' shot right through the pipeline, playing to just the
wide-awake, juice-hungry crowd that might cause trouble in movie
theaters. If violence were to break out in a theater these days, a
movie company would likely hire extra security and put a
public-relations spin on the episode to mitigate negative
publicity. (This was done after a few incidents connected with
``New Jack City.'') But in 1979, panic _ and a few shrill
editorials with the usual end-of-Western-Civilization bent _ caused
exhibitors to begin withdrawing ``Warriors'' from their movie
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Before studios realized, and exploited, the ability of TV to
speak directly to the prime moviegoing audience _ kids ages 15 to
19 _ newspapers were the main source of advertising and publicity.
As such, papers wielded enormous power. An editorial attack on
Stanley Kubrick's ``A Clockwork Orange'' by The Detroit News, and
its subsequent ban on ads for X-rated movies, had already helped
kill the adult art movie in this country.
</P>
<P>
   So, as ``Warriors'' didn't have much support from movie critics,
it was easier to slip it from theaters _ no one was going to make
much of a case for it. And whereas other gang films were steeped in
a stereotypical liberal bias that attempted to explain the social
roots of gang violence, ``Warriors'' was just a straight-ahead
action movie with hints of European existentialism. The characters
were realized through movement, rather than through dialogue.

NEW CHAPTER IN JUDICIAL CAMPAIGN FINANCING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the never-ending saga of Texas judges
attempting to survive the political process without appearing to be
politicians, we have another chapter.
</P>
<P>
   A study committee appointed by the Texas Supreme Court has
issued a mixed bag of recommendations on financing judicial
campaigns, including the oh-so-bold proposal that judges be
required to recuse themselves from cases involving people who gave
them illegal campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that such a requirement isn't already the law of
the land speaks volumes about the potential for abuse inherent in
Texas' elected judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is on the word ``potential.'' This is intended as
no broadside against the ethics of most Texas judges, despite
outspoken critics who argue that if justice isn't ``for sale'' in
our state, there certainly is a perception that it is.
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be reformers are urging the Legislature once again
this year to replace the partisan election of judges with a system
of gubernatorial appointments and retention elections. But with
that prospect remaining a long shot _ partly because most Texans
want to elect their judges _ the Supreme Court asked the committee
to see what could be done to improve the present system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the quest for reform isn't exactly virgin territory, the
panel of nine lawyers and judges, chaired by Houston attorney Wayne
Fisher, had plenty of previous studies to guide it, including a
report commissioned by the American Bar Association just last year
on lawyers' political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the committee's recommendations may be adopted
administratively by the Supreme Court, which has disciplinary
oversight over Texas judges. Others would likely require
legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that more teeth be put into campaign
contribution limits imposed on judges and judicial candidates a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the campaign limits, the law doesn't require a judge to
step down from a case if it involves a lawyer or a litigant who
gave him or her an illegal, excessive contribution. The study
committee recommended that judges be required to recuse themselves
in such cases and that judges who knowingly violate the law be
subject to disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended the same requirement be imposed on judges
who benefit from major expenditures, such as billboards, made
independently by interest groups on the judge's behalf. Current law
doesn't even limit those independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended the recusal requirement be imposed on
justices of the peace, who aren't covered by the statutory campaign
contribution limits. And the panel proposed that campaign finance
limits imposed on law firms also apply to other entities.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution limits, as set out in law, vary according to
the size of the geographic area from which the judge or judicial
candidate is running. The limit for a Texas Supreme Court justice
is $5,000 from an individual or $30,000 from a law firm.
</P>
<P>
   But since the limit is for each election, a Supreme Court
justice who has a contested primary race, a contested runoff and an
opponent in the general election could receive as much as $15,000
from one person or $90,000 from one law firm in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those limits _ the only fund-raising limits imposed on
any state political candidates in Texas _ are too high will still
be debated.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that judges' campaign finance
reports be filed electronically so that they can more easily be
read by many Texans and that more voter guides on judicial races be
developed and distributed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The panel didn't address the questionable practice of winning
judges and judicial candidates soliciting ``late train''
contributions after an election. But it did propose that limits be
imposed on judges' ability to hoard political donations between
elections.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that judges and judicial candidates be
prohibited from donating part of their campaign funds to political
parties or political committees that endorse candidates. The latter
practice has frequently been criticized as a way for judges to buy
political support.
</P>
<P>
   Judges will have a chance to air their views on the report in a
hearing before the Supreme Court this week. The court will have
another hearing _ for everybody else _ March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Phillips predicted that the
limits on saving campaign ``war chests'' between elections and the
prohibition against sharing campaign funds with other political
organizations will probably be the most controversial among judges.
</P>
<P>
   Three judges on the study committee, in fact, dissented from the
latter recommendation, signaling that the road to reform will
remain rocky.

UNDATED: through dialogue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was probably a good thing, because the dialogue (and much
of the acting) was barely serviceable. Taking in the speeches in
``The Warriors'' is like watching badly subtitled kung-fu movies,
with dialogue of the ``My-master-can-defeat-all-of-you-jokers!''
variety. Except that it's not delivered with that much emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why almost none of the actors went on to much
in acting. Of the Warriors, only James Remar continues to work
regularly. (One bit player, though, went on to win an Oscar:
Mercedes Ruehl, who made her film debut as an undercover cop.) And
the DJ, an ominous presence who provides a running commentary _
although all we see of her is a pair of rouged lips _ was played by
Lynne Thigpen, the clue-giving chief on ``Where in the World Is
Carmen Sandiego?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warriors,'' though little heralded at the time, has become
one of the most influential action movies of all time. Directors
John Woo and Quentin Tarantino have cited the movie as being hugely
inspirational. Director Walter Hill has gone on to other seminal
action films lacking conventional morality, such as ``48 HRS.''
(You almost get the feeling that he made that film to show he could
direct actors who had to talk.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Warriors'' producer Lawrence Gordon also produced ``48 HRS''
and several other pictures with Hill. Gordon's then-assistant, Joel
Silver, is now the reigning impresario of action movies. He has
produced the ``Die Hard'' series (with Gordon) and the ``Lethal
Weapon'' movies, and is such an iconic show-biz figure that he has
been parodied in several movies. (Steve Martin did him in ``Grand
Canyon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, ``The Warriors'' seems quaint now. It lacks the
head-punching noise and music that are staples of the genre it
helped to redefine. And for which it raised the stakes: After its
release, action movies were never the same.

ECONOMY ISN'T BRAKING FOR BONDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In December, economists were saying that the economy was going
to slow in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bond investors liked that news because a fast-growing economy
can lead to inflation, which erodes the value of long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, bond fans have had a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a rally Friday, U.S. treasuries in February suffered
their biggest monthly losses since 1980, according to Ryan Labs, a
New York money management and bond research firm.
</P>
<P>
   For the month, this fall in price reduced the face value of a
$1,000 investment in a 30-year U.S. Treasury bond by about 8
percent, which pushed up the yield about 0.57 percentage points to
5.57 percent Friday, enough to catch the eyes of investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been burned severely,'' said Kevin Kennedy, who
helps oversee $32 billion of bonds at Citibank Global Asset
Management in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds sank in February as evidence piled up that a long-awaited
economic slowdown isn't about to arrive. Bond buyers had hoped the
economy would slow and spark the Federal Reserve Board to cut
interest rates again and push up the value of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on jobs, manufacturing and gross domestic product all
indicated that the economy is humming along.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at
a faster pace than previously estimated during the fourth quarter,
led by enthusiastic consumers and an improved trade picture.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made bond investors really nervous
last week when he told Congress that the central bank has to
evaluate whether its three interest-rate cuts last year remain
``appropriate'' now that stability has returned to world financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also have lost some of their luster because investors no
longer see a need to flee to them as a safe haven from
international economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Asia, such as South Korea, are improving economically,
and the Russian meltdown seems like a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
YIELDS ARE INVITING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The upside of all this is that bond yields look sweet, compared
with inflation, which rose just 1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   So if you agree with Greenspan when he said the stock market
looked overvalued, it may well be time to move into bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year treasury note is yielding about 5.20 percent. That
means the inflation-adjusted yield is 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good level on an historical basis,'' said
Thomas Donne, senior portfolio manager in fixed income at Bank One
Investment Advisors. ``On an historical basis, you shouldn't be
able to get more than 2.5 to 2.75 percentage points over
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   With yields that fat, the stock market tends to suffer because
the risk-free yield is so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it even more tempting is that not many people believe
inflation is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation is still very tame,'' said Steve Ward, chief
investment officer at Charles Schwab Investment Management. ``It's
only fear about future inflation that's driving interest rates
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that the United States will soon see
inflation when the rest of the world's economies are slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deflation seems to be the major anxiety outside of the United
States,'' Donne said. ``How long can we remain unaffected by the
slowdown in the global economy in general?''
</P>
<P>
   Most central banks in other countries are leaving interest rates
alone or even lowering them, said Bob Alley, senior vice president
in fixed income at Aim Capital Management, a Houston mutual fund
firm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FALL FRAYS NERVES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for those folks who saw their bonds fall about 2 percent
last week, these are scary times, and these securities are likely
to continue swinging.
</P>
<P>
   This means it wouldn't be a good idea to pour all your money
into bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment statistics are due out this week, and those numbers
have been known to make or break bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the most important market-moving numbers that the
bond market experiences on any regular basis,'' Donne said.
</P>
<P>
   If more people found jobs than economists projected, that would
indicate that the economy is still doing fine, which would jar the
bond market. On the other hand, if the numbers come in below
expectations, bond investors may see bonds as dirt-cheap and snap
them up.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy bonds, buy them a little at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could buy a bond and could see the price fall later,''
Ward said.

KELLY WILLIS DESERVES, AT LONG LAST, A LISTEN
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Kelly Willis was supposed to be a star. Assured,
sexy, with a voice angels might envy, Willis cultivated a coterie
of fans who still swoon over her way with a country song. Critics
adore her. She was named one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful
people in 1994. Her first label (MCA-Nashville) invested more than
$1 million in her.
</P>
<P>
   Her one, enormous problem: She didn't sell records.
</P>
<P>
   MCA let her go. Her next label, A&AMP;M, released one EP and wasn't
crazy about it _ which led her to think that the label would try to
change her into something she wasn't, another cookie-cutter
Nashville songbird.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she decided to leave it all behind _ being a
can't-miss-but-did critic's darling was just too painful a way to
make a living. She figured she would go back to school, settle down
in Austin, Texas, and try to be happy. Her one stipulation: She
would record one more CD. A final statement, a farewell, and then,
real life for a change. Only then could she walk away with her head
held high.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the motivation _ the way I persevered,'' said Willis,
nibbling on a muffin and drinking coffee at Quack's, a quiet
bakery/coffee shop in a working-class neighborhood north of the
University of Texas campus. ``If I didn't finish it, I would have
felt incomplete, like I didn't do something I had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else will be your goal?'' she added, sitting slightly
forward in her chair. ``Selling millions of records? That doesn't
make you happy. You have to get down to what makes you happy.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Kelly Willis knows happy. She turned 30, she's
married to singer/songwriter Bruce Robison, and she's just released
``What I Deserve,'' a gently luminous set of songs that may well be
the benchmark CD of her stop-and-start career.
</P>
<P>
   Released Tuesday, ``Deserve'' is a beautiful record about
troublesome boyfriends, loneliness, aching confusion, the sweet
pang of attraction _ and, finally, soul mates. It is, Willis said,
truly her record in ways that three CDs for MCA between 1990 and
1993 and an EP, ``Fading Fast,'' for A&AMP;M (1996) never were: She had
a greater hand in the arrangements than ever before (''I was
telling musicians exactly what to do for the first time'') and she
wrote or co-wrote more songs on it (six out of 13) than on any
previous CD.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in other words, what it was supposed to be: her
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the songs on this CD were about struggle and what I've
been through the past five years,'' she said. ``I think they all
have to do with self-discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her confidence onstage, Willis is shy; she doesn't
regard being interviewed as big fun. She is forthright, though,
even when discussing the hard times: the past two years in
record-company limbo, becoming tabloid fodder when she was briefly
linked to the then-married Lyle Lovett in 1994 _ and her youth,
which was marked by a solitary, shut-in period.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oklahoma and raised in Virginia, Willis was devastated
at age 9 when her mom left the family. Willis simply went to her
room and stayed there. For years. ``I was pretty shy, but lonely
was the biggest thing,'' she said. ``My dad had a lot to handle. It
was hard for me. I wrote some bad teen-age poetry _ really bad. ...
I drank and smoked pot for a year, but I got over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in her teens, she had begun singing in a rockabilly band,
Kelly and the Fireballs. The plan was to major in drama at Virginia
Tech, but instead the band moved to Austin in December 1987. Willis
enrolled in Austin Community College, but she was really there to
make music. The band evolved into Radio Ranch and then into Willis
as a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   And after impressing MCA head Tony Brown with a showcase
performance at South by Southwest, she was signed to MCA and
recorded her debut, ``Well Traveled Love.'' The follow-up, ``Bang
Bang,'' was released in 1991, and in the next few months Willis
looked poised for stardom: She had songs on the soundtracks to
``Thelma and Louise'' and ``Boys,'' she'd had a small role in Tim
Robbins' 1992 political satire ``Bob Roberts,'' and she'd modeled
in Rolling Stone and Vogue.

SMALL TEXAS TOWN HOODWINKED BY MAN WHO TURNS OUT TO BE MURDERER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLNEY, Texas _ When Faryion Wardrip showed up in Olney a year
ago wearing an electronic monitoring device on his ankle, residents
didn't ask any questions.
</P>
<P>
   They took him at his word when he said he had been paroled after
he was convicted of accidentally killing a woman in an automobile
accident and had paid his debt to society.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Wardrip was a newly married Sunday school teacher who
never missed a day of work and fed scraps to the crippled dog at
his workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But what Wardrip didn't tell folks in this town 93 miles
northwest of Fort Worth was that he had been convicted of murder.
And two weeks ago, police said he has admitted killing three other
women _ including one in Fort Worth _ more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely lied to us, that's for sure,'' said Brad Duncan,
whose family owns Olney Screen and Door where Wardrip worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I guess I can understand why. If we knew he was a
convicted murderer, there's no way we would have hired him. If I
had just thought about it, I would have figured out he wouldn't
have done that kind of time for that type of offense, but I never
did. I guess we all wanted to believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Wardrip's arrest Feb. 12 in the December 1984 death of a
Wichita Falls, Texas, woman who was raped and stabbed in a friend's
home, Olney residents have learned the grisly truth about him.
</P>
<P>
   They found out that he admitted years ago to suffocating a
Wichita Falls woman in 1986. And four days after last month's
arrest, authorities say he admitted three other slayings, including
the March 1985 death of Debbie Taylor in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wardrip's confessions, Olney had mostly been known as the
home of the One Armed Dove Hunt, an annual shooting event for
amputees. Residents are stunned that their quiet town has become
known as the home of a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely came as a shock to people in this town,'' said
Wilbur Carraway, managing editor of the Olney Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty nice little town where, even though he was an
ex-con, people welcomed him, gave him a job and accepted him,''
Carraway said. ``But very few people knew him other than the people
who lived, worked or went to church with him. He wasn't really part
of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Wardrip, 39, apparently moved to Olney because his parents lived
there and could help him land a job. He was about to celebrate his
first anniversary at Olney Screen and Door when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was grooming him to sit in my desk and do my job so I could
go on vacations for two weeks if I wanted to,'' said Dave Collard,
who was Wardrip's supervisor. ``He was one of the most reliable
people I had working for me. He was the last person who worked here
you would think of that would be capable of this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Collard said Wardrip enjoyed his time at church and his weekly
trip to a Bible study program in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was someone who was at that church every time the door
opened,'' Collard said. ``That was a critical part of his life. I
really think he came out of prison a changed man. He told me on
more than one occasion that I wouldn't have wanted to know him
before he went to prison. He said there were a lot of drugs, a lot
of drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton Street Church of Christ, which has a sign out front
saying, ``You Are Welcome Here,'' apparently welcomed Wardrip.
</P>
<P>
   He taught Sunday school and occasionally read Scripture during
services, and he married Glenda Diane Kelly, 45, in the church last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most church members were reluctant to talk about Wardrip, and
minister Scott Clark declined an interview request. But Wardrip has
apparently tried to make amends, writing to the church to help
explain his actions, Collard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen the letter, but it is my understanding he
apologized,'' Collard said. ``I think that is helping many of the
church members who helped him. ... I think it gives them closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wardrip kept a low profile at the small apartment where he lived
on the southern edge of town. Most of his contact with neighbors
came from his wife baby-sitting for others in the complex, said
Gary King, a neighbor and maintenance man for the apartment
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this humble man who you wouldn't think would hurt a
fly,'' King said. ``This is a place made up of senior citizens and
families with their little kids, and he misled us all, and I know
I'm pretty angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Collard, his supervisor, said he believes that Wardrip
underwent a conversion to Christianity in prison. Still, Collard
said, he deserves the death penalty if he committed all of the
crimes to which he's confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a true Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of thing,'' Collard
said. ``I truly think this is a man who changed and came out of
prison a different man. That can't change what he did 14 years ago,
and I think he knows that. He changed the lives of five families
forever and he will have to pay the price.''

AUSTIN, Texas: and Vogue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although her first two CDs had not sold, Brown had shown
considerable faith in her, co-producing the third CD with big-time
star-making producer Don Was, who had already worked with the likes
of Willie Nelson and Bonnie Raitt.
</P>
<P>
   The same people who loved left-of-center, edgier country artists
such as Steve Earle and Lucinda Williams loved Willis' CDs, but
mainstream country radio and record buyers never caught on. Willis
was a cult item, a beautiful woman who made haunting, bare-boned
country music but who couldn't sell even 100,000 records when a
half-million was what Nashville considered a success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after ``Kelly Willis'' fared no better than her first
two CDs, she got her walking papers. In return, the label forgave a
debt of more than $1 million it had invested in her for promotion
and tour support. Not long after she landed on the People magazine
list, tabloids hounded her any time she and Lovett were seen dining
together. Willis became a pop-culture footnote, known as the tiny
blonde with whom Lovett was stepping out.
</P>
<P>
   Only, she said with quiet firmness, there was nothing going on
besides friendship and him working with her on a demo tape.
Nevertheless, the experience terrified her. ``I was really afraid
if I acknowledged it (the tabloid attention), I'd be Jessica Hahn
the rest of my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Willis tried to get back on track. She released
``Fading Fast,'' a four-song EP recorded with members of the
Jayhawks, Son Volt and 16 Horsepower, on A&AMP;M Records. But A&AMP;M execs
weren't happy with it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chagrined, and worried that a second label would try to mold her
into something she wasn't, she asked to be dropped. ``I didn't want
to have to change myself to make everyone else happy,'' she said.
``At the time, I thought it was a great move _ but it wasn't as
easy to get back to making a record as I thought it'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Dwight Yoakam sang, things change. Willis pushed herself
to write great songs. Her confidence was bolstered by a personal
decision: She married Austin singer Bruce Robison in 1997. The
union, she said, has made her content. ``Bruce is a really strong,
positive force in my life,'' she said. ``He's always made me feel
what I do is worthwhile. I might have given up without him.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, she hooked up with producer Norman Kerner, who
offered to let her use his San Francisco studio and to pay half the
recording costs. She flew to San Francisco in August 1997 and began
recording.
</P>
<P>
   It was wrong from the start. She and Kerner didn't see
eye-to-eye on the music, she didn't like being away from Austin,
and the songs weren't turning out the way she wanted. She was
having anxiety attacks back in the hotel room at night.
</P>
<P>
   Willis played her last card. Just before the recording had
begun, she had gotten a call from Geoff Travis, founder of
England's Rough Trade Records. Now she accepted Travis' offer and
came home. ``Geoff came to my rescue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, finally, everything clicked. She knocked out
``Deserve'' in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them (the songs) are personal, such as `Talk Like
That,' which is about my family,'' she said. `` `What I Deserve' is
about trying to figure out your place in the world and what
acceptance means. `Happy With That' is sort of about thinking
everyone has it better than you.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Willis hopes ``What I Deserve'' will sell well; she
said she's ``in the mood to work'' and will be on the road a long
time. While she'd love to tour with Son Volt, Emmylou Harris or
Wilco, she also expresses interest in playing stadium shows with
George Strait. ``I don't have a hell of a lot of pride,'' she said
with a laugh. ``I'll play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kelly Willis what her favorite song is on her new CD, and
she doesn't mention the title track, a wonderful song of hope and
self-examination that she wrote with Jayhawks leader Gary Louris.
Nor does she name the spritely gem ``Wrapped,'' one of two songs
Robison contributed to the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she points to ``Time Has Told Me,'' a haunting but very
tender love song by the troubled English folk musician Nick Drake,
who overdosed on anti-depressants in November 1972.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Time has told me
</P>
<P>
   You're a rare find
</P>
<P>
   A troubled cure
</P>
<P>
   For a troubled mind
</P>
<P>
   And time has told me
</P>
<P>
   Not to ask for more
</P>
<P>
   Some day our ocean
</P>
<P>
   Will find its shore''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love song to Bruce _ it gets to the basics of what life
is and what love is,'' she said softly. ``Success doesn't mean much
if you don't have someone to share it with. ... That's why that
song is so comforting to me. And that's what I look for in music,
to be comforted.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, given a chance, she gives back.

UNDATED: through dialogue. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was probably a good thing, because the dialogue (and much
of the acting) was barely serviceable. Taking in the speeches in
``The Warriors'' is like watching badly subtitled kung-fu movies,
with dialogue of the ``My-master-can-defeat-all-of-you-jokers!''
variety. Except that it's not delivered with that much emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why almost none of the actors went on to much
in acting. Of the Warriors, only James Remar continues to work
regularly. (One bit player, though, went on to win an Oscar:
Mercedes Ruehl, who made her film debut as an undercover cop.) And
the DJ, an ominous presence who provides a running commentary _
although all we see of her is a pair of rouged lips _ was played by
Lynne Thigpen, the clue-giving chief on ``Where in the World Is
Carmen Sandiego?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warriors,'' though little heralded at the time, has become
one of the most influential action movies of all time. Directors
John Woo and Quentin Tarantino have cited the movie as being hugely
inspirational. Director Walter Hill has gone on to other seminal
action films lacking conventional morality, such as ``48 HRS.''
(You almost get the feeling that he made that film to show he could
direct actors who had to talk.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Warriors'' producer Lawrence Gordon also produced ``48 HRS''
and several other pictures with Hill. Gordon's then-assistant, Joel
Silver, is now the reigning impresario of action movies. He has
produced the ``Die Hard'' series (with Gordon) and the ``Lethal
Weapon'' movies, and is such an iconic show-biz figure that he has
been parodied in several movies. (Steve Martin did him in ``Grand
Canyon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, ``The Warriors'' seems quaint now. It lacks the
head-punching noise and music that are staples of the genre it
helped to redefine. And for which it raised the stakes: After its
release, action movies were never the same.

RALPH ELLISON'S ELUSIVE `JUNETEENTH' TO SEE PRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 19, Random House will publish ``Juneteenth,'' the second
and last novel we will ever get from Ralph Ellison. Because
Ellison's masterwork, ``Invisible Man,'' was published in 1952, and
because his second novel has been anticipated since he began
working on it in 1954, it seems almost cruel that the publisher
will make us wait any longer for ``Juneteenth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet its publication date is appropriate, too; the book's title
refers to June 19, 1885, the date when slaves in Texas first
learned of the Emancipation Proclamation. And after this long,
what's another three months?
</P>
<P>
   Ellison never really completed ``Juneteenth,'' at least to his
satisfaction. He died in 1994, having spent much of his past 42
years trying to get everything in ``Juneteenth'' just right. There
had been false alarms; in the mid-1960s, publication seemed like a
serious possibility. But Ellison pulled it back, and only now has
Random House determined that readers can see the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary information from Random House indicates that
``Juneteenth'' is the tale of a proudly racist U.S. senator who is
shot by a young black assassin. Dying, the senator summons a black
preacher to his side; ``Juneteenth'' mostly examines their past
relationship. This plot sounds, at least, as though it will be much
more direct than ``Invisible Man.'' But Ellison was a daunting
intellect who, in his first novel and later essays, seemed to want
readers to have to work for his message.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of this book is fueled by ongoing literary
allegiance to ``Invisible Man.'' Ellison burst into the public
consciousness with that book, which in convoluted, challenging
terms presented the frustration and fear of those socially
determined to be invisible _ blacks, certainly, but in perhaps a
larger sense the physical and financial unlovelies whose existence
would never be accepted by the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ellison was a compatriot of influential African-American
writers Richard Wright and Langston Hughes, critics at first missed
the real influences on his writing _ Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Franz
Kafka. Critics now routinely link ``Invisible Man'' with
Dostoyevsky's ``Notes from the Underground,'' and many college
literature courses require students to read these two works one
after the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is a fascinating study. The grandson of slaves, he was
born in Oklahoma City in 1914. When the child was 3, his father
died and his mother went to work as a maid. She was determined her
son would get the best education possible; Ellison eventually
attended Tuskegee Institute in Alabama but left without completing
degree requirements. Burning to write, Ellison participated in
federally subsidized writing programs until entering the merchant
marine during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Ellison received a grant and devoted himself to
writing ``Invisible Man.'' That novel's success enabled him to
spend the rest of his life teaching and writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth'' often stymied him. He frequently interrupted that
frustrating task to write essays and short stories. But in the
1960s, Ellison's work came under fire from some political radicals
who believed his work did not reflect harshly enough on
white-dominated society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Ellison believed he had ``Juneteenth'' just about ready
to go, but a fire destroyed his home and the pages of revisions on
which he'd been working. Ellison spent the next 27 years trying to
recapture what was lost. He died at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, there was some movement among literary circles to
have Ellison awarded the Nobel Prize. That never happened. Ellison
himself, though not a recluse, preferred to stay out of the
spotlight. He sometimes taught at New York University. Otherwise,
he believed whatever he had to say could best be discovered in what
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Even if ``Juneteenth'' disappoints critics, it is certain to get
lots of attention. Perhaps the best way to approach the book is
realizing that ``Invisible Man,'' by its very excellence, must make
it one of a kind. Ellison may catch literary lightning in a jar
again, but it will have to be a different jar. Perhaps that
knowledge is what made it so difficult for him to complete
``Juneteenth'' to his satisfaction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery of planets around other stars has made Epicureans
of astronomers. Not that they now put out the fine silver, pop the
cork and dress for dinner by candlelight every long night under the
observatory dome; they are still unwrapping their tired sandwiches
and tearing open the corn chips, thank you. But nowadays their
tastes run to the cosmic musings of the eponymous founder of
Epicurean philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Epicurus, a Greek philosopher in the fourth century B.C., did
not explicitly predict the existence of planets around stars other
than the Sun, but he believed in an infinity of worlds, meaning
other ordered systems beyond the visible universe as it was then
conceived. This contrasted to the Earth-centered cosmos of the
contemporary Aristotle, whose cosmology prevailed in Western
thought for more than two millennia.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last three years, have astronomers established the
reality of latter-day Epicurean speculations about a plurality of
worlds, which in recent centuries came to mean planets beyond the
solar system, some possibly inhabited. But while astronomers tip
their hats to Epicurus, they just wish he had advised them how to
make sense of the distant planets being detected by their
telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Finding something is not the same as discovering what is found.
The more astronomers study the growing evidence of extra-solar
planets, the less they resemble anything in the one planetary
system they had known and had based their theories on: the Sun's
family of planets.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, astronomers in the United States and Europe had
observed 18 nearby Sunlike stars showing telltale motions from the
gravity of large, unseen planets orbiting them, and they fully
expect to find more. Yet they suspect that they have seen enough to
begin rethinking how nature creates and destroys planets and
choreographs their orbital minuets.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the objects hug closer to their parent stars than
Mercury is to the Sun, closer than standard theory predicted
planets could be; one is so near that it makes a complete
revolution _ its full year _ every 3.1 Earth days. The other nine
travel unusually elliptical, or oval-shaped, orbits, several of
them plunging in relatively close to their stars and then swinging
far out again; orbits in the solar system are almost circular.
Several extrasolar planets are at least three times as massive as
Jupiter, the solar system's giant, and one is estimated to have 11
times the Jovian mass _ raising questions about how massive can a
planet be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Geoffrey W. Marcy, the astronomer at San Francisco State
University who has had a hand in most of the discoveries, is as
surprised as anyone. ``A trend is now being stamped on these
discoveries that we thought, frankly, would go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not, and questions pile up. Many stars may have
planets, as the discoveries suggest, but is there a typical
pattern? Could the solar system be an oddball? If so, does that
diminish prospects for intelligent life existing elsewhere in the
universe?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a theorist of planetary systems at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, thinks astronomers will
eventually ``find systems that look something like our solar
system.'' He acknowledged that they will also ``find many more
surprises to make us rethink what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers concede that so far their sampling of extrasolar
planets may not be representative, only a reflection of detection
capabilities. They have no proof yet of another Sunlike star with
more than one planet, or with anything considerably smaller than a
Jupiter. But it is easier to observe the gravitational effects of
Jupiter-class planets, especially if they are extremely close to
the host stars. It takes years of repeated observations to gather
reliable evidence for planets traveling the longer orbits at much
greater distances from a star. And it is not yet possible to detect
in any orbit, near or far, an Earth-size or even Saturn-size
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The newest detection, announced last month, was of the smallest
extrasolar planet yet examined, one that has less than half of
Jupiter's mass and is only 1.4 times more massive than Saturn. The
planet, in a tight 3.5-day orbit around the star HD 75289, was
found by a team of Swiss astronomers led by Dr. Michel Mayor of the
Geneva Observatory, who in October 1995 reported the first
confirmed planet around another star like the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration expects to fly several space telescopes for a more
comprehensive survey of planets around nearby stars. On the drawing
board is an advanced satellite called Planet Finder that someday
could send back the first pictures of Earth-type extrasolar
planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terribly exciting field right now,'' said Dr. Stephen
Lubow, an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute
in Baltimore. ``The discoveries have really opened a new window on
the nature of planetary objects in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The first discoveries of extrasolar planets should have prepared
astronomers to expect the unexpected. In 1992, radio astronomers
reported the first strong evidence of such objects, but the two
planets were not orbiting a normal star. They accompanied a pulsar,
the dense remnant of an exploded star and not a neighborhood likely
to be hospitable to life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mayor and Dr. Didier Queloz of Switzerland then detected a
planet around 51 Pegasi, a solar-type star, and this was soon
confirmed by Marcy and a colleague, Dr. R. Paul Butler. The first
accepted planet of an ordinary star excited and puzzled
astronomers. Both teams were startled to find that the planet,
about half the mass of Jupiter, was in an almost circular orbit
less than one-sixth the equivalent distance of Mercury to the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, theorists have been puzzling over how several
of the large planets _ dubbed ``hot Jupiters'' because of their
proximity to the intense heat of their stars _ could be where they
are. Why were they not out somewhere the equivalent of the
Jupiter-Sun distance?
</P>
<P>
   Because known physical laws rule out the formation of large
planets so close to a star, theorists think they formed in a more
benign environment far out and migrated inward. The unlucky ones
probably crashed into their star. Others somehow settled into cozy
orbits at less than one-fourth of an astronomical unit, the
standard measure of planetary distances in which one A.U. is the
distance from the Sun to Earth, or 93 million miles.
</P>
<P>
   The migration theory that receives the widest attention was
proposed by Dr. Douglas Lin of the University of California at
Santa Cruz, Dr. Peter Bodenheimer of the university's Santa Barbara
campus, and Dr. Derek Richardson of the University of Washington.
Their concept drew on research by Dr. William Ward of the Southwest
Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and ideas developed to
explain the interplay of the rings and satellites around Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   According to prevailing theory, a planetary system forms from a
disk of gas, dust and chunks of rock that surrounds a newborn star.
The star's heat would drive gas out of the inner disk and prevent
the huge gaseous planets from forming there. They would instead
develop in the gas-rich outer disk. In the early period of
planetary formation, the disk would still be thick with gas and
other material. Drag from the disk material and its general inward
flow, caused by the young star's gravity, would have drawn many of
the large planets out of their original orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists postulate several phenomena that prevent at
least some of the planets from plunging all the way into their
stars. One is that when the star was young it was spinning more
rapidly, creating tidal forces that arrest a planet's migration
short of catastrophe. Another idea, suggested by some observations
of young stars, is based on the likelihood that the gravity or
magnetic forces of newly formed stars soon sweep away disk material
from their nearest surroundings, leaving a doughnut hole at the
center. Here the migrating planets could settle into parking
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, pondering why something like this did not happen to
Jupiter, decided that previous Jupiters in the solar system
probably migrated to their destruction. Jupiter and the other solar
planets represent the last generation, created as the planetary
disk was dissipating and leaving more stable conditions. Or perhaps
the solar system's protoplanetary disk never had enough gas and
dust to perturb the orbits of its new planets.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent variation on the migration theory was introduced
by a team of theorists at the University of Toronto led by Dr.
Norman Murray. In the early formative period, they argue, planets
might be orbiting through a disk of planetesimals, small rocky
objects colliding with or being ejected by the planets. The
destabilizing interactions with the planetesimals could push the
newly forming planets toward their stars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first detections by the Marcy-Butler team, announced
in January 1996, introduced another puzzlement. The planet around
70 Virginis was more than seven times the Jovian mass and not as
close to its star as many others, but its orbit was highly
elliptical. Other planet discoveries revealed similar
characteristics. The one around 16 Cygni B has the most elliptical
orbit; if it was in the solar system, the massive planet would
sweep in as close as Venus and retreat out as far as the asteroid
belt between Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful gravitational forces, astrophysicists said, must
have perturbed the planets' orbits. A star passing too close could
knock a planet out of its generally circular orbit. Or the planet's
own star could be part of a binary system, one of two stars in
gravitational embrace, and the companion star could be unsettling
the nearby planets. But not all the planets in elliptical orbits
are in binary systems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederic A. Rasio of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, working with Dr. Eric Ford, has proposed a concept of
gravitational scattering that, he said, ``explains very naturally
and simply planets in wide eccentric orbits.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea involves two or more huge planets orbiting in close
proximity so that they generate a kind of gravitational slingshot.
The forces might sling one planet off on an elongated orbit to the
inner planetary system, while the other might fly off toward the
fringes of the system, perhaps escaping into interstellar space.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario could also explain why astronomers have yet to
find more than one planet around a single star. Any other large
ones there were catapulted into deeper, longer orbits and would be
undetectable in the brief time astronomers have been looking for
evidence of extrasolar planets. Just one giant planet on an
elongated orbit, moreover, would probably spell doom for smaller
planets as it crosses their paths time and again, scattering or
destroying them in the turbulence of their gravitational wakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our Jupiter were in an eccentric orbit, the Earth and Mars
would likely be gravitationally scattered out of the solar
system,'' Marcy said. ``Thus our existence depends on both Jupiter
and Earth being in mutually stable, circular orbits.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications are profound for the search for
extraterrestrial life. ``The big bullies may wipe clean the
terrestrial planets in those planetary systems, rendering them void
of any Earth analogues,'' the astronomer said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy takes an optimistic view. Of all the Sunlike stars that
have been studied so far by planet seekers, he said, only 5 percent
have been found to have Jupiter-mass planets in such dangerously
eccentric orbits. That leaves 95 percent of stars that may be free
of these wrecking forces and so could harbor habitable planets.
</P>
<P>
   All theories to explain the newly detected extrasolar planets,
Rasio said, remain at ``the hand-waving level.'' Theorists are
severely limited by observations, which have yet to reveal more
than one planet around a single normal star. The two or three
objects around a pulsar offer little insight. Earlier reports of
possibly two planets around the star Lalande 21185 have not been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only see one companion to a star, you cannot say that
this is a planetary system,'' Rasio said. ``That's going to be the
next major breakthrough, finding multiple planets and then putting
some constraints on the properties and behaviors of other planetary
systems. That's our holy grail.''
</P>
<P>
   Planet hunters like Marcy are looking. They speak of some
interesting hints, but nothing yet for the new Epicureans of
astronomy to feast on.

March 1, 1999 JASPER-TRIAL (Jasper, Texas) _ Editors: For those who used the
JASPER-TRIAL stories that were sent to the wires Wednesday, Feb.
24, and Friday, Feb. 26, the stories contained an error. In those
stories about the capital murder trial of John William ``Bill''
King in Jasper, the Houston Chronicle incorrectly reported that
King was the first white man convicted of killing a black person in
Texas in modern times. However, Donald Vigneault, who is white, was
sentenced to death in the 1979 Matagorda County slaying of Loretta
Jones, a black woman. Although Vigneault spent several years on
death row, his name escaped prison records because he died of
natural causes in 1997.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CHILD CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation took the
first step toward improving the quality of child care in Kansas
City by providing hundreds of college scholarships to child-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the city moved even closer to that formidable goal.
The Kauffman Foundation was joined this time by the Francis
Families Foundation and the Bank of America Foundation, the
philanthropic foundation of the newly merged NationsBank and the
Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   The three have established a $1.2 million fund that will be used
by child-care centers to help at least 100 of them become
nationally accredited by the end of 2002. The Heart of America
United Way will oversee the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart of America Family Services already provides technical
assistance to programs to help them complete the accreditation
process.
</P>
<P>
   But now, child-care centers _ which are run on notoriously tight
budgets _ will be able to use this new fund for teaching materials,
equipment and minor remodeling projects they need to meet
accreditation standards.
</P>
<P>
   Why the big push for accreditation?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study funded by the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development found that half of the day care provided to
the youngest children in this country is considered only fair.
Fewer than one-third of the children receive excellent care and 8
percent of the care was considered poor.
</P>
<P>
   One way to significantly improve the quality of child care is to
get centers to meet national accreditation guidelines. Today, only
23 of the approximately 500 early-childhood centers in the
metropolitan area are accredited by the National Association for
the Education of Young Children. While states can accredit and
license centers, the national association is considered the
premiere standard in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensing provides the floor of quality,'' said Carol Scott,
manager of the Metropolitan Council on Child Care. ``Accreditation
takes you almost to the ceiling. A nationally accredited center is
not only a healthy and safe environment, it is a place where you
get support for everything the child will need to reach her
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term goal is to have 80 percent of the centers in the
city meet national accreditation by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are trying to raise an additional $300,000 for the
fund. The Kauffman Foundation, Francis Families Foundation and
NationsBank have long supported programs that help Kansas City
children. Hopefully, others will follow their example and recognize
that what we invest in children when they are young determines what
kind of people they will be as adults.

DRIVING ACROSS TEXAS THE LONG WAY: BACK ROADS SLOW, ENJOYABLE
</HEADLINE>
   (With Photos)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things about Texas: It's big and it's empty.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, crossing Texas along the interstate, it is two
days of tedium, flatness and gravel from the desert west to the
forested east.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way to eliminate the tedium of the
unavoidable crossing of the world's largest vacant lot: Slow down,
take your time and enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   That is what I decided to do when faced with yet another
transcontinental automobile trip last fall. I stayed off the
interstate and took the back roads from El Paso to Beaumont,
encountering great views, interesting topography, peculiar history
and even more-peculiar people.
</P>
<P>
   Mile 0 is the boundary between New Mexico and Texas, entering
the state at Anthony. I drove through in the early morning, with
the sun just sitting on the horizon, the Franklin Mountains to the
east looking the color and texture of gray suede. The dew had
raised the smell of the creosote bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first real chance to get off Interstate 10 comes with the
Trans-Mountain Expressway that lifts you up and over the mountains
and into Fort Bliss, just north of El Paso. As you descend, you
pass the U.S. Border Patrol Museum and the streets of the military
reservation named for out-of-date missiles: Minuteman and Bomarc.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal is the Hueco Mountains along U.S. 62. As you get
to the top, at mile 56, you can spot the Guadalupe Mountains,
highest point in the state, about 75 miles in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The road passes along the dry regions of western Texas, with few
people and even fewer gas stations. The first is at Cornudas, a
one-time Butterfield stage stop, now a dilapidated gas station and
cafe, with souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The sign outside reads ``Wel come to beautiful downtown
Cornudas, pop. 5 or 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the cafe is covered from head to foot in collectibles:
old hubcaps, old postcards, things written on old napkins, old
license plates, old photos and newspaper clippings. The ceiling is
hung with things, including souvenir ball caps, each individually
wrapped in clear plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The tables, too, are loaded down with writings, some printed,
some handwritten, then covered with plastic. The table legs are
wrapped in blue-jeans legs and bottomed with cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   And on every table, along with menu and salt-and-pepper shakers,
are copies of Lyndon LaRouche's wacko ``New Federalist''
newsletters. This is a cafe with a political point of view.
</P>
<P>
   And one table, near the cash register, sit two or three aging,
potbellied ``cowboys,'' dressed in overalls and scratchy with
whiskers. They look up at me as I enter as if I were a spy come to
undo their righteous cabal.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I have a wonderful breakfast, which I recommend to
all: a good Spanish omelet, toast and sliced fried potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   When I finish, I ask if I can get gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, we're all out,'' the waitress tells me. ``But you can
get some up about nine miles at Route 1111.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying the bill, I say to the nice woman behind the counter,
``You sure are a far piece from civilization,'' and she said with a
smile that was only slightly ominous, ``That's just the way we want
to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the gas station at the crossroads is closed. But
another 15 miles down the way, at Salt Flat, there is another.
Actually, it is a pile of corrugated tin and stucco buildings
surrounded with cyclone fence. I pull in, amble up to the office
and find it is locked, despite the open sign in the window.
</P>
<P>
   A dog barks, then another, then a few more. Behind the fence
they are howling. A house sits across the dirt lot from the pump.
Its door is closed. No one stirs. The sun is beating down. I honk
my horn. I ring the doorbell. Nothing. Silence except for the dry,
angry barking of junkyard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   An empty place
</P>
<P>
   West Texas is a very empty place. The air is desiccated, the
ground is sandy, the mountains are heated stones, even in October.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that this group of shanties in Salt Flat
seems like a set for one of those cheap made-for-TV stalker films.
The area was also the site of the 1877 El Paso Salt Wars, when
private industry bought the land and began charging for the salt
that previously had been collected free by Indians and Mexicans.
Many lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   The road curls just south of El Capitan, the prominent peak at
the head of the Guadalupe Mountains and part of one of Texas'
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   To the east at mile 105, the Delaware Mountains are lined with
about 65 electricity-generating windmills.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Guadalupes that dominate. In their wrinkled
canyons are trees and streams. There is bird life and butterflies.
At the visitors center, little yellow butterflies wink in the
butterfly weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fall color here last week,'' the ranger tells me. ``But
we had a 90-mile-an-hour wind come through and we don't have any
fall color anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   They also don't have any gas. The nearest is in the next state,
35 miles to the north at White City, N.M., near Carlsbad Caverns.
</P>
<P>
   But I take the turn southeast to Orla. At mile 145, I enter the
Central time zone, but time is certainly meaningless there among
the cows and chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   At the Orla Grocery, mile 185, the sign says, ``It's a long way
to anywhere from Orla Grocery.''
</P>
<P>
   The town is made up of a few sagging shacks, some tilted all the
way over. There is also a yard filled with oil-drilling machinery,
marking a change in geography. From there to the Hill Country,
there is oil.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves County, which includes both Orla and Pecos, is a flat,
arid grassy land. In Pecos, the historical marker tells about the
Pecos cantaloupe:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally famed melon, originated in this city. Residents
from 1880s grew melons in gardens, noting sun and soil imparted a
distinctive flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to say, ``Famed lecturer Helen Keller, Presidents
Eisenhower and Johnson, and many other distinguished persons have
ordered and appreciated Pecos cantaloupes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is oil that is most apparent, especially as you enter the
rocky hill country near Iraan.
</P>
<P>
   The town is named for Ira G. Yates and his wife, Ann. It was
under his ranch that the Marathon Oil Co. _ then Ohio Oil _
discovered the biggest oil field in Texas and one of the biggest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, oil experts had agreed, ``You won't find oil west of
the Pecos River.'' But they did. Within a year of the first well,
struck in 1926, the Yates field had 100 wells dug. It now has more
than 600.
</P>
<P>
   Iraan is also the birthplace of the comic strip ``Alley Oop.''
It was created by V.T. Hamlin while he lived here. Giant statues at
the town playground immortalize Oop, his girl friend Ooola and his
dinosaur, the 65-foot-long Dinny.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of town, the school sports a sign that reads
``Iraan Braves, 1996 Double-A State Football Champs. 16-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Smack-dab in the middle
</P>
<P>
   It is a long draw _ about 90 miles _ to the next town, Eldorado.
The road, U.S. 190, passes some of the most beautiful scenery in
Texas, with mesas and buttes, trees and scrub.
</P>
<P>
   But at the halfway point through the state, at Brady and mile
507, is the geographical center of Texas. Or so the town claims.
</P>
<P>
   As the crow flies, it is 437 miles to the state's westernmost
point, 341 miles from the most easterly point, 401 miles from the
most southerly point and 412 miles from the most northerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enclosed within the 4,137-mile perimeter of the state are
267,339 square miles or 7.4 percent of the nation's total area''
reads the historical marker. ``Fifteen of the 50 states could be
readily accommodated within Texas' borders _ with more than 1,000
square miles left over.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only the land that changes as I head into the eastern
half of the state. The humidity rises, so that when I wake up the
next morning after a night in the motel at Brady, the streets are
so wet with dew, it looks as if it had rained in the night.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy dew also brings out the smell of the grass and the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   South of Brady, U.S. 87 enters the Texas Hill Country, a bubble
of limestone that rises in the center of the state and continues
north from the Balcones Escarpment. It is an oasis in the monotony
of Texas landscape, with streams, forests, lakes and the former
home of former President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as a shock to me how incredibly beautiful the LBJ Ranch
actually is. And it is also a shock to hear Johnson, in old TV
footage shown at the visitor center, talk about his love of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up at a time when Johnson was demonized for his policy on
the Vietnam War. I never thought of him as anything but a power-mad
monomaniac. But the LBJ Ranch, mile 592, humanizes him
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV footage, he talks about watching deer jump the fence
on the farm, about watching a yearling fawn, about raising the
cattle and sheep. He speaks with genuine affection and without any
of the boilerplate rhetoric that was his signature.
</P>
<P>
   And I realized how Southern he must have been, how much the land
meant to him despite anything he did in the ``halls of power.''
</P>
<P>
   I walk around the property on the edges of the Pedernales River,
along Williams Creek that empties into the river.
</P>
<P>
   There is the tannic smell of autumn leaves on the ground; there
is hackberry and post oak and Virginia creeper along the fence
posts.
</P>
<P>
   The creek is filled with bluegill sunfish, Texas softshell
turtle, minnows, yellow mud turtles, bullfrogs, Rocky Mountain
toads, crayfish, Rio Grande leopard frogs and the blotched water
snake.
</P>
<P>
   It is nature full of its variety. The river itself has
kingfishers, mallards, Texas sliders, coots, largemouth bass, red
sunfish and catfish.
</P>
<P>
   As I stand on the bank of the river under a pecan tree hundreds
of years old, a black anhinga flies up over the small dam that
creates a cascade in the river, and four white geese try to cross
the dam from the opposite shore. No, it's five.
</P>
<P>
   A nature trail winds around a fenced deer enclosure and one of
them comes up to nibble some grass I hold out for it.
</P>
<P>
   The trail continues into a small demonstration farm, typical of
those in the area when Johnson was young. Five sheep and two little
lambs are resting and sleeping. One of the lambs is curled up in a
ball next to the woodpile. Uncounted chickens run around the yard
under the shade of post oaks and sumac and one big, old live oak.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet on, I spot a newborn lamb, just a few months old, his
ears sticking straight out, catching the sun from behind. He is
looking right at me.
</P>
<P>
   Over my head, I can't quite see him in the sunlight, but I hear
him tapping: It is a flicker.
</P>
<P>
   And over the very top, there is a hawk flying, soaring over the
top of the farm. The little lamb shakes his head and flaps his
ears.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is a paradise, an Eden, and I want to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana-bound
</P>
<P>
   From the ranch to the Louisiana boundary, Texas becomes
increasingly Southern. The landscape becomes more forested, the
towns closer together, and the traffic thicker. And the humidity
becomes intense.
</P>
<P>
   I pass Dripping Springs at mile 629, Ledbetter at mile 728. At
mile 766, I cross the Brazos River. It is still full from last
summer's heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   At mile 803, I see my first mention of the word Cajun, and I
know I am near the end of the state.
</P>
<P>
   At mile 823, I enter Cut and Shoot, a town more memorable in
name than substance. It is just another junked-up Southern town,
filled with pickup trucks and Carol Sue's Country Kitchen: ``Dine
in, Carry out, We deliver, Barbecue and fixin's.''
</P>
<P>
   After the dryness of western Texas, it is frightening to see the
Trinity River in flood, swollen way over the woods on each side of
its banks. The adjoining farm fields are lakes, with a few old
cornstalks sticking up through the surface. The river water is
still moving with a swiftness that looks as if it could wash away a
town.
</P>
<P>
   And north of Sour Lake, the many sections of Big Thicket
National Preserve look as if it might as well (begin itals) be (end
itals) Louisiana, with its cypress sloughs and dense forests of
beech, magnolia and loblolly pine.
</P>
<P>
   I join Interstate 10 once again in Beaumont, mile 905, and it
will be interstate from here on. And I cross the Sabine River into
Louisiana at mile 933. The interstate mile marker reads 881, which
means I have added only 52 miles by taking the back roads.
</P>
<P>
   But I have seen, heard, smelled and tasted so much more. &QL;

HUMAN NATURE: SOME FEAR EVERYTHING, EVEN FEAR ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo.)   (af)  
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, I had another episode of a recurring nightmare:
the going-back-to-the-Bronx dream. In reality, my childhood
apartment building on Creston Avenue has long since burned to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   In my dreams, though, I must get back to it, no matter how
dangerous the journey. I must walk along dark streets where
batterers and murderers loiter in every doorway. I must travel on
subways that invariably run the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   And when I finally arrive, the apartment is deserted, with no
lock, no lights, no furniture, no family to protect me. I'm all
alone in the Bronx, and I'm terrified right out of my id. At which
point, I bolt awake _ and the real nightmare begins.
</P>
<P>
   You're up! my conscious mind brays. Good, good you've got a lot
of work to do. Forget about the Bronx and your girlish, nameless
fears. You can't lie around worrying about phantoms. You need some
meat behind your emotions.
</P>
<P>
   And so my mind tables for my inspection that fleshiest source of
anxiety: work. I worry about the assignments still to be reported,
the parts of my latest book that I hate, the many stories that I've
started but never finished, the parts of my latest book that I must
have written under the influence of a J. Peterman catalog.
</P>
<P>
   I review with the crack of a dominatrix's whip every craven act
of procrastination that I've engaged in for the past year, for the
past lifetime. I revisit some recent writing failures _ clumsy
sentences, idiotic metaphors _ and recall verbatim snippy but
searingly accurate criticisms from readers.
</P>
<P>
   With my curriculum vitae beaten comatose, I move on to whipping
girl No. 2: my feeble personality. I natter over my self-indulgent
gloominess and failure of imagination. I worry that my daughter is
doomed, that she'll blame me, or, worse, that she won't even bother
blaming me. And what about my husband? Why was he putting up with
me and my manufactured despair?
</P>
<P>
   I thought about waking him to ask that question, but then I
worried he'd ask himself the same thing, and, before you know it,
I'd have something new to worry about, i.e., single parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I come to the apogee of angst _ that I will waste my
life worrying. From the first moment of sentience, I've managed to
find something to dread, something that kept me awake at night: the
next day's spelling bee, the dirt under my fingernails that my
teacher would surely punish me for.
</P>
<P>
   You see pictures of me as a little kid, and my brow is as knit
as a mitten. Would it be ever thus? Was I condemned to spend my few
precious decades of consciousness trapped in an Edvard Munch
painting?
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid so. From what I've been able to gather through
discussions with some of the nation's behavioral vivisectionists _
also known as psychologists _ I am fearful by nature. It's not a
disease, they tell me, it's a temperamental flavor: call it Rocky
Road.
</P>
<P>
   My fearfulness can even be parsed. According to the reigning
model of personality development _ that is, the model accepted by
at least two tenured professors who are not identical twins reared
apart _ one's character is constructed of some six core components,
which are mixed, matched, chopped and pureed into the primordial
soup we call the self.
</P>
<P>
   Each dimension is thought to be partly inherited, and partly
formed, or deformed, by experience. The ancients knew these
personality modules as the ``dispositional humors,'' giving them
zesty names like ``phlegm,'' ``choler'' and ``black bile.'' The
current lingo has been castrated into proper jargon, and scientists
now speak of human nature as a compendium of the traits ``harm
avoidance,'' ``novelty-seeking,'' ``self-directedness''
``cooperativeness,'' ``persistence'' and ``extraversion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``tendency to wring one's hands'' was not among the
dirty half-dozen, I called Dr. C. Robert Cloninger of Washington
University in St. Louis and asked him, ``What's the recipe for a
crybaby?''
</P>
<P>
   He took to the subject with unnerving cheerfulness. ``There are
two aspects of personality related to fearfulness,'' he said. ``One
is being high in the dimension of harm avoidance. This means that
you're very sensitive to all sorts of potentially uncomfortable
stimuli. You anticipate threats and pains, and you try to avoid
them.''
</P>
<P>
   I shifted in my chair uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part of fearfulness is being low in
self-directedness,'' he said. ``That means you don't have much
self-confidence, and you tend to think of the world as a hostile
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hearing him say that made me annoyed and defensive. Was he
implying that I'm hostile?
</P>
<P>
   ``The two often go together, as you might expect,'' he said.
``If you're sensitive to threats, it's hard to have a hopeful view
of life. That negativity can end up eroding your self-esteem. On
the other hand, if you are naturally high in harm avoidance, and
you're raised in a supportive environment where you learn what the
safe limits are, you can gain confidence and self-directedness, and
avoid becoming excessively fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine if you're a kid,'' I muttered. ``But what can you
do if you're a fearful adult? Can a worrywart be surgically
removed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible to change,'' he said, ``but it is
difficult. One thing we've learned is that temperament tends to
remain stable over the course of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh joy, I thought. So, however the depradations of time may
alter my bones, heart, skin and hindquarters, I can rest assured
that my inventive fretfulness will stay perky right up to the
mortician's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a different tack and explore the positive side
of negativity. I called Dr. Myron Hofer of the New York State
Psychiatric Institute in New York, who has studied the evolution of
fear and anxiety, and asked him, ``What good is fear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear, of course, was absolutely necessary to survival in our
evolutionary past,'' he said. ``For our ancestors, the world was a
dangerous place, and it paid to be nervous about it most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxiety is probably the first emotion that an infant
experiences, at the moment of birth and separation from the
mother,'' he continued. ``In nearly all birds and mammals, an
infant that is separated from the nest will show signs of intense
anxiety, particularly by vocalizing. The only species we've seen
where this doesn't happen is the rabbit. For some reason, baby
rabbits don't cry.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's what I need, I thought. The world's first human-rabbit
xenotransplant. Oh, wait. Hugh Hefner already tried that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain aspects of the fear response make physical sense,''
Hofer continued. ``For example, consider the fact that your arm
hairs stand on end when you're scared: that could be a holdover
from a young mammal's response to separation, an attempt to stay
warm in the absence of its mother by fluffing up its fur.'' Or take
the shallow breathing and tendency toward paralysis that can
accompany intense fear, he said: what better way to fool a lurking
predator than to act invisible, or dead?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of anxiety is still a good thing to have,'' Hofer
said. ``Performance artists say they need a surge of anxiety to put
on a great show. But perpetual anxiety and fearfulness are another
matter. They don't make sense. Many of the threats that our
forebears confronted no longer exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Says who? Come with me and I'll give you something to worry
about. It all starts with a midnight trip _ to the Bronx. &QL;

BUILDING A LIFELINE ON MARS  
 INTO THE THINNEST AIR  
 BREAKING GLASS, SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Pa.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If humans are ever to visit other planets in this solar system
or beyond, most of the air, food, water and fuel for survival will
have to be produced on site. After all, space travel is no picnic _
it is impractical to bring your own.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a team of engineers at the University of Arizona is taking
a small step toward self-sufficiency in space. They are building an
instrument that when it arrives on Mars as expected in January 2002
will be the first to produce one of the necessities for life from
other-worldly sources.
</P>
<P>
   The device is a tiny generator that will produce oxygen from
carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere by electrolysis. It will
be aboard the unmanned Mars Surveyor lander that is due to be
launched in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The generator is an experimental one, and the small amounts of
oxygen produced _ about a cubic centimeter per minute _ will not be
put to use. But the project developers hope that bigger models on
future space probes will provide enough oxygen to power a drill to
take core samples or even help fuel a rocket to return samples to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   And the same technology, on a much bigger scale, could
eventually help humans colonize Mars and other planets. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Future colonizers, however, might want to skip Callisto, one of
Jupiter's moons. New research shows that the moon has a carbon
dioxide atmosphere, but one with a surface pressure less than
10-trillionths that of Earth. Such thin air would leave even an
oxygen generator gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, used a spectrometer
aboard the Galileo spacecraft to determine the composition of the
atmosphere, finding evidence of carbon dioxide up to 60 miles above
the moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, discussing the findings in a recent issue of
Science, noted that the carbon dioxide may be coming from
Callisto's interior, or by radiation's acting on carbon-bearing
compounds on the surface. Or the gas may have been the result of
bombardment by meteors and comets over the eons.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher calculated that whatever the source, without
constant replenishment the atmosphere would last only about four
years, as the ultraviolet radiation ionized the carbon dioxide
molecules and the ions were swept away by Jupiter's magnetic
field. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Normally, breaking a piece of glass is an all-or-nothing thing.
Either the glass withstands the pressure applied to it, or it
develops cracks that lead almost instantly to breakage. This is
especially true of tempered glass, which has been treated to make
it handle more strain, but breaks catastrophically when the stress
exceeds a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of researchers has designed a way to temper glass
that allows cracks to develop and propagate in a stable manner,
without total failure. Panes of glass tempered in this way can be
examined for cracks and replaced before breakage occurred.
</P>
<P>
   With their method, the researchers, from Pennsylvania State
University, Caterpillar Inc. and the University of Trento in Italy,
turn normal chemical tempering of glass on its head. In the usual
process, sodium atoms in the surface layer of the glass are
replaced by potassium atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The potassium atoms, being slightly larger, make for a tighter
fit among the glass molecules, compressing them. (And compressed
glass can handle more stress trying to pull it apart.)
</P>
<P>
   In the new process, the researchers used potassium replacement
throughout the glass, and then added sodium atoms back, but only on
the surface. The result is glass with its compressed layers within.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described their technique in the journal
Science, noted that with the new glass, when a crack begins in the
surface, it reaches a compressed layer and stops. Many cracks can
form in this way before an ultimate crack that will shatter the
glass.

INVASION OF THE CROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How can we get rid of the crows that have invaded
the big garden in our city apartment complex, where we used to get
songbirds?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Short of exterminating all the crows in town, there is not
much chance,'' said Dr. Kevin J. McGowan, associate curator of
birds and mammals at Cornell University. ``Driving out a family
opens a place for another young male to move in.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible way is to make things less attractive, McGowan
suggested. ``Unfortunately, what attracts crows is the same thing
that makes gardens attractive to humans,'' he said. Crows like open
green space, and a big lawn with a few trees is ideal. The lawn
provides food like earthworms, mole crickets and June beetle
larvae.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to cut the trees down and pave the lawn,
another possibility is scaring the crows. ``They tend to be a bit
more wary than other birds,'' McGowan said. ``Some tin plates on a
string might just change things enough so that they don't want to
come into a particular yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Crows have moved into urban areas around the country in the last
30 years, McGowan said, becoming urban rather than rural birds.
</P>
<P>
   Family groups average 3 birds but range up to 15 or 20, many of
them young males waiting for the opportunity to breed, McGowan
explained. Males usually breed first at the age of 5, females at 3{
to 4.
</P>
<P>
   As for the songbirds that disappeared, the crows probably did
not play a direct role, and the cardinals, etc., are probably still
around.  &QL;

PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY FILINGS BREAK RECORD IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A record number of Americans filed for bankruptcy
in 1998, but the rate of the increase slowed sharply, according to
federal court figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of personal and business bankruptcy filings in 1998
was 1.44 million, which was an increase of 2.7 percent over 1997.
Individuals filing for protection under federal bankruptcy laws
accounted for the bulk of the increase, with business bankruptcies
actually declining.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's increase contrasted with the 19.1 percent increase
in 1997 and double-digit rises from 1994 to 1996, according to the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The number of personal bankruptcy filings in 1998 totaled 1.4
million, up 3.6 percent from 1997. The number of individuals filing
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy rose 4.7 percent in 1998 while the number
of Chapter 13 filings fell by 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 7 bankruptcy allows people to eliminate most of their
debts, while Chapter 13 requires people to repay all or a portion
of their debts through a court-administered plan. About 70 percent
of individuals who file for bankruptcy file under Chapter 7.
</P>
<P>
   Business bankruptcy filings dropped 21.8 percent to 44,367 in
1998 from 54,027 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy figures coincide with a renewed congressional
push to enact legislation that would make it harder for individuals
to eliminate all of their debts when they file for bankruptcy
protection in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which failed to become law last year, would
require more people to file under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said the current bankruptcy code
``encourages people to walk away from their debts regardless of
whether they have the ability to repay any portion of what they
owe.'' Boucher is one of 34 co-sponsors of a bankruptcy bill that
was reintroduced in the House last week.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the same legislation last year with
bipartisan support. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies, which lose millions of dollars annually
when people file for bankruptcy protection, have been pressing
Congress to change the bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bill would establish a formula that would make it
difficult for people earning more than the national median income,
which is $51,000 for a family of four, to file under Chapter 7.
People earning more than the national median income and who can pay
off at least 20 percent of their debts in five years would, in most
cases, file under Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said the formula is too rigid and
has threatened to veto the legislation in its current form, but
isn't opposed to making it harder for people to walk away from most
of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as the Consumers Union oppose the legislation
and blame the rising number of personal bankruptcies on the credit
card companies. Consumer groups argue that the millions of credit
card solicitations that are sent out each year unfairly entice
people to take on more debt.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require credit card issuers to give
consumers more information about the effect of only paying the
minimum amount per month, which may not even cover a monthly
interest rate of 19 percent. For example, if a person had a $2,000
credit card bill it would take more than 10 years to retire the
debt only paying the minimum amount of $10 or $15 a month without
ever adding to the debt.

<P>
   For centuries, sweet has meant sweet as sugar. Now a growing
number of diet-conscious Americans are turning instead to stevia, a
shrub native to South American containing sweeteners that are
essentially calorie free.
</P>
<P>
   One leading stevia supplier, Now Foods of Bloomington, Ill.,
estimates $10-million worth of the substance was sold nationwide
last year. But its market is restricted to use as a dietary
supplement, and it cannot be used in other foods or sold as a
table-top sweetener. That limitation has led to a number of clashes
with the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Brandle, a Canadian agriculture department researcher
developing stevia as a commercial crop, said the leaf of Stevi
rebaudiana contained seven sweetening compounds.
</P>
<P>
   The most potent, stevioside, is almost 300 times as sweet as
sugar. It does contain calories, he said, but the amount needed to
match sugar's sweetness is next to zero, or equivalent to
artificial sweeteners like saccharine or aspertame.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, some herbal companies began to use stevia. But in
1991, the federal agency blocked the import of stevia, which now is
grown primarily in China, calling it an unapproved food additive.
The American Herbal Products Association and the Thomas J. Lipton
Co. unsuccessfully petitioned for a ``generally recognized as
safe'' exemption to stringent food testing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Pauli of the FDA said that the petitions failed
either to prove widespread historical use or to present a
persuasive body of evidence. ``We were talking about ceremonial use
by Indians in the 15th century,'' he said. ``And from a scientific
standpoint, the data available were nowhere near what we expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ryan Huxtable, a professor of pharmacology at the University
of Arizona, gave a mixed assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the plus side,'' he said, ``it has been widely used in
South America and Japan and no health issues have raised
themselves. But there are a lot of gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, animal tests have shown that at high levels
stevia can interfere with energy metabolism. Whether that takes
place in humans is unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevia returned in 1994 after Congress voted to allow some
unapproved substances to be sold as dietary supplements, although
as a sweetener it was vastly different from most supplements used
as herbal medicines. ``It's 300 times sweeter than sugar, there's
really only one use for it,'' said Lynda Sadler, president of
Traditional Medicinals, a California teamaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stevia is sold in leaf form, as liquid extracts that can sweeten
with a few drops, and in tea blends, like Ms. Sadler's Mucho Mate.
Stevia has a slight aftertaste, described by some as licorice-like
and others as bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Foods sells stevioside powder in what look like standard
sugar packets. But selling stevia as a sweetener would be illegal,
which is why every packet bears a tiny supplement label. ``We're
walking that line a little bit,'' acknowledged Dan Richards, sales
manager for Now Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevita Co., of Arlington, Texas, tripped over that line
last year after the food agency found it to be in violation of
labeling laws for displaying books with stevia recipes next to the
herb. Pauli said that the 1994 law had created a host of ``gray
areas'' for herbal manufacturers and regulators alike.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legal issues, sales of stevia are growing, Richards
said, adding that ``We haven't scratched the surface yet.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She slithers across the stage at the Cafe Carlyle,
catlike, 72 years old, with the muscles of an adolescent boy _
Eartha Kitt, whom Orson Welles called ``the most exciting woman in
the world'' and the CIA reportedly called ``a sadistic sex
nymphomaniac'' after she stood up at a White House luncheon and
criticized the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Her tight velvet dress is slit to the thigh, fixed with a
glittering brooch, as she sings her own rendition of ``I'm Still
Here'': ``I lived through Shirley Temple. Now I'm here. I remember
Lyndon Johnson. Gee, that was fun . . . .'' She purrs, growls, does
a belly dance to ``Uska Dara,'' pours champagne down a waiter's
throat, delivering a patter of double-entendres as she goes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitt has been a fixture on the music scene since the early
1950s, known for her sultry voice, her persona as a golddigger who
renders men into helpless little boys with her sexual power. The
New York Times critic Stephen Holden called Ms. Kitt the original
``material girl.''
</P>
<P>
   She has performed on Broadway and in Las Vegas and played
Catwoman in the ``Batman'' television series. She has appeared in
films ranging from ``New Faces,'' based on the Broadway revue that
made her a star, and ``St. Louis Blues'' to, more recently,
``Boomerang,'' with Eddie Murphy, and ``Harriet the Spy,'' from the
popular children's book.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 60s and early 70s, her career went into a
decline as music tastes changed, and because, she says, of her
opposition to the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But now she is back in full force, appearing at the Carlyle till
March 13 and as a voice in New York City taxicabs admonishing
passengers to buckle their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in the past, with the smoldering anger of her
performance, her voice straining in the back of her throat, Ms.
Kitt has degenerated into self-parody. '``If you look back,'' said
her daughter, Kitt Shapiro, her voice ``almost sounded like a
caricature. Now I think it's very real. It represents life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are many who think that Ms. Kitt has finally come
into her own. The voice has mellowed, become softer around the
edges, rather like vintage wine. And in an age of mass
entertainment on huge screens and in giant stadiums, people are
drawn to her cabaret act for her ability to create an intimacy with
her audience. It is an act, Holden said, ``worthy of comparison
with Marlene Dietrich in her prime.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Carlyle performance, you wouldn't know it
was Eartha Kitt in the hotel's restaurant, dressed in black
sweatshirt and sunglasses, and without makeup and wig. But even
offstage, she preserves the shtick, conducting herself with
hauteur, referring to herself sometimes in the third person.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is beluga always in the fridge, champagne,'' Ms. Kitt
said, ``even though I don't have a man.'' But she would like a man,
she said, ``just as somebody who would escort me around town.''
</P>
<P>
   True to her Catwoman image, Ms. Kitt says she sleeps on a bed
covered with lion skins. She would like to fill the room with them.
``When I get out of bed I am usually nude,'' Ms. Kitt said. ``I
look at myself every morning to see if there are bulges, so you
don't let it go past, say, five pounds.'' The solution is exercise.
She can lift 50-pound weights, she said, and wants to make an
exercise video for older women that is aimed at preventing
osteoporosis, and that uses the principles of Radu, her trainer.
</P>
<P>
   She has also learned to preserve her voice, to ``throw'' it from
the larynx, as she puts it. She is an opera lover, she said, and
draws inspiration from Maria Callas. Ms. Kitt is also quite a
reader, she said, having read through the Book of Knowledge and
``Goethe, Marlowe, Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato was a great influence on my mind because he teaches you
to think,'' Ms. Kitt said, with a haughty gaze. There is an anger
in her presence, as well as her performance, a calculated tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever man's down front is hugely intimidated,'' said Daryl
Waters, her longtime accompanist and music director. ``Now and then
she gets someone who decides to get up and dance with her, or catch
her because they think she's going to fall. She always has a line
or a look ready. Usually it's `Where's your father?'''
</P>
<P>
   The other night at the Carlyle, Ms. Kitt said, ``I was doing my
belly dance'' when suddenly a woman in the audience offered her
husband for the night. ``I don't think you can afford me,''' Ms.
Kitt responded coolly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite her intimidating stage presence, Ms. Kitt says
she is ``scared to death.'' ``Every time I walk out there I think
I'm going to be rejected again.'' Indeed, rejection is a constant
refrain in her conversation.

 UNDATED: her conversation.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has laid out the lineaments of her life in three
autobiographies. The most recent, ``I'm Still Here: Confessions of
a Sex Kitten,'' in 1989, sometimes reads like Dickens: an
illegitimate child, an unknown father _ a white man, she believes,
who may have been the son of the owner of the South Carolina
plantation where her family lived.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitt said she was rejected by her darker-skinned family and
given the name ``yella gal.'' Her mother abandoned her because her
new stepfather said her skin was too light. The family that took
her in abused her, she said, and she went to work in the cotton
fields. When she was about 8, an aunt sent for her to live in
Harlem. The aunt told her she was her real mother, but treated her
unfairly too, Ms. Kitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Her looks often worked against her, Ms. Kitt said. In 1958, when
she starred in ``Anna Lucasta'' with Sammy Davis Jr., ``2,500
cinemas would not take this film because they thought I wasn't
black enough to be making love to a black man on the screen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a teen-ager, Ms. Kitt won a scholarship to the
Katherine Dunham dance troupe, the leading black modern-dance
company. On a trip to Paris, she was ``discovered'' and began
singing in cabarets. In Paris, she knew James Baldwin, Richard
Wright and Jean-Paul Sartre. ``He was very quiet,'' she said of
Sartre. ``But he seemingly remembered everything and went home and
wrote about it.'' She also met Orson Welles, who cast her as Helen
of Troy in his theatrical production of ``Dr. Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States in the early 50s with a vaguely
French accent, Ms. Kitt had exotic appeal, a sophistication that
made her acceptable to mainstream whites. She became a
``crossover'' figure, like Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, also
light-skinned. Ms. Kitt said that she, Ms. Horne and Ms. Dandridge
were the ``the three most beautiful women in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitt appeared on Broadway in ``New Faces of 1952.'' And she
went on to record ``C'est Si Bon,'' `'I Want to Be Evil,'' ``Uska
Dara'' and ``Santa Baby,'' songs that were to become her
signatures. She said she received a Tony nomination for a dramatic
role on Broadway in ``Mrs. Patterson'' in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitt also had relationships with wealthy men, who sent
flowers and boxes from Tiffany. One was with the playboy Porfirio
Rubirosa, who ``thought I was too young,'' she said. ``I never had
an affair with him.'' Among her other boyfriends, she said, were
Charles Revson, John Barry Ryan 3d and Arthur Loew Jr. ``I wished
he was the father of my child,'' Ms. Kitt said of Loew. Often, she
said, it was the men's mothers who broke up the relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kitt has been married only once, to a man named Bill
McDonald, and they had one child before their divorce. Ms. Kitt has
two grandchildren, Jason, 8, and Rachel, 3.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Ms. Kitt was invited to the White house by Lady Bird
Johnson. ``You send the best of this country off to be shot and
maimed,'' she said to Mrs. Johnson. ``No wonder the kids rebel and
take pot.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer's outspokenness nearly ended her career in the United
States, she said. Ms. Kitt said she learned from a reporter that
the Central Intelligence Agency had drawn up a damaging report on
her. Contracts were canceled. She went abroad, working mostly in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her reputation was revived somewhat in the mid-70s after
President Jimmy Carter invited her to a gathering at the White
House, and she appeared in a concert at Carnegie Hall. Then, in
1978, she won a Tony nomination for her role in ``Timbuktu!''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in 1996, her first American recording in nearly
20 years, ``Back in the Business,'' won a Grammy nomination.

   For most of her life, Ms. Kitt has not known her exact age. Last
year, she challenged students at Benedict College in Columbia,
S.C., to find her birth certificate, and they did. She had been
celebrating her birthday on a random date, Jan. 26, and assumed she
was in her 60s. But the certificate said she was born on Jan. 17,
1927.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, Ms. Kitt said she wanted to do more
concerts and legitimate theater. ``I'm tired of traveling,'' she
said. Maybe she should pair up with one of the new female rappers,
someone suggested, to have more presence with younger audiences.
Ms. Kitt looked down her nose. ``I've been doing rap since the
beginning of time,'' she said. And you wouldn't want to contradict
her.

CIRCUMCISION'S PAIN AND BENEFITS RE-EXAMINED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.C.)   (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten months ago when their baby, Grace, was born, Leon Wynter and
his wife, Yvonne Parnell Wynter, were relieved to have a newborn
daughter rather than a son for one key reason: Like many parents,
they were at odds over circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came up, my wife said, `No, I'm not going to let it
happen,''' said Wynter, a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and
a journalism professor at Baruch College in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Circumcised at birth like most American men, Wynter said he saw
no reason to question the procedure. Also, he said, he wanted his
child to be like him. But Ms. Wynter, an operations analyst at an
investment bank, was just as resolute. She believed circumcision
would cause ``great pain to the baby'' and was ``skeptical'' that
any health benefits were worth it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just parents like the Wynters who differ on the issue.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, which issued a new circumcision
policy Monday, has had three different policies in as many decades.
In the 1970s, the academy said there was no ``medical indication''
for circumcision. In 1989, it reported ``potential medical
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 55,000-member academy has concluded that although there
are potential benefits, the data are ``not significant enough'' to
recommend routine circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, the policy says that if parents do
circumcise a son, for cultural, religious or medical reasons,
relieving pain is ``essential.'' Recent studies show that numbing
creams and injections are safe and effective, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The new report, which appears in the March issue of the journal
Pediatrics, also scrutinizes the potential benefits of circumcision
cited 10 years ago: lower rates of infant urinary tract infections
and of sexually transmitted diseases and penile cancer in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Although uncircumcised baby boys have a fourfold risk of getting
urinary tract infections in the first year, the report says, that
means, at most, a one in 100 chance. And although uncircumcised men
_ especially those with phimosis, the painful inability to retract
the foreskin _ have three times the risk of developing penile
cancer, that risk is ``extremely low'' in America, where only about
9 of every 1 million men are diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The academy also reports that while studies suggest circumcised
men have a reduced risk of contracting HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, ``behavioral factors appear to be far more important risk
factors'' than circumcision status.
</P>
<P>
   The re-evaluation of the 1989 policy was spurred by recent
research, said Dr. Carole Lannon of the University of North
Carolina School of Medicine and head of the academy's seven-member
Circumcision Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   A study reported in the Dec. 5, 1998, issue of The Lancet, for
example, followed 58,000 newborn boys in Ontario and found
hospitalization rates for first-year urinary tract infections were
7.02 per 1,000 uncircumcised babies, compared with 1.88 for
circumcised infants.
</P>
<P>
   And pain studies published in the Jan. 1, 1998, issue of
American Family Physician and the March 1, 1997, issue of The
Lancet, found that babies circumcised with analgesic cream cried
less and had less-elevated heart rates than those whose pain was
unrelieved. The studies also found that infants circumcised without
pain relief were more distressed than other babies when they were
vaccinated four to six months later.
</P>
<P>
   The re-evaluation, the statement said, was also prompted by the
debate on circumcision in medical and parental circles. In the
1960s, about 95 percent of American-born boys were circumcised
before leaving the hospital compared with about 60 percent today,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, with large populations of Hispanic and Asian
immigrants, who do not usually circumcise, as well as vocal
anti-circumcision groups, the rate is just 36 percent. (The
statistics do not include infant boys circumcised in the Jewish
ritual of the bris.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents today question the need for circumcision much more
frequently,'' said Dr. Andrew Mezey, chairman of pediatrics at Beth
Israel Medical Center and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wynters, the new policy is unlikely to settle the
debate. Wynter pointed to the finding that circumcision pain is
relievable. But Ms. Wynter said she would still oppose the
procedure, ``from a maternal and humane standpoint.''

CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS BURNING POLICY FOR OIL SPILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California may soon burn oil spills from wrecked
vessels as a way to save wildlife and prevent fouled beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The state expects to adopt a policy by June that would allow
burning instead of trying to mop up tar-like spills that kill
seabirds and marine mammals and spoil the fragile coast.
</P>
<P>
   While some regulators caution that not enough is known about how
air pollutants from petroleum fires affect sea life, most agree
that burning could be preferable to letting hundreds of thousands
of gallons of crude oil or fuel find its way to the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the California Office of Oil Spill Prevention
and Response has been working with air pollution districts, state
and federal agencies and the oil industry to write the burn policy.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to divide the coast into 10 zones and set
conditions for quick burn approvals with the goal of reacting
within minutes of an accident. Burning must be done quickly, before
the oil breaks up in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard and Oregon officials say they averted a major
environmental disaster at Coos Bay on Feb. 11 by setting fire to a
wrecked Japanese freighter's 396,000 gallons of fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   The 639-foot New Carissa had gone aground 300 yards from shore,
cracking the hull and fuel tanks. Environmental officials had the
choice of watching the fuel oil pollute Coos Bay, ruining crab
habitats and killing seabirds, or setting it afire and causing air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of debate, they decided to approve the first burn to
minimize a spill, calling the vast black clouds of pollution a
necessary trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Navy team ignited the ship's hold with explosives and
napalm, triggering a 33-hour fire that destroyed about half the
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've got oil in the environment, you can't say no one
will get hurt. The question is what will be hurt less,'' said
Yvonne Addassi, in charge of formulating the burn policy for
California's Office of Spill Prevention and Response.
</P>
<P>
   Addassi stood on the Coos Bay beach Feb. 12 and monitored the
second day of burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get the oil off the water, thousands and
thousands of birds will die. It's unlikely that you'll get
thousands and thousands of birds dying from particulates falling on
the water,'' Addassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies of smoke plumes indicate the most significant human
health risks come from particulates, which can trigger asthma and
other respiratory illnesses and lodge deep in the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Addassi has received comments from federal and California
regulators recommending monitoring a whole range of pollutants
released from oil burning, not just particulates.
</P>
<P>
   Some regulators, including those at the California Coastal
Commission and three of the national marine sanctuaries, warn that
not enough is known about the effects on wildlife and the
environment to make knowledgeable trade-offs between burning and
skimming. They want to see more studies on air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident, laws have required the
industry to phase in oil tankers with double hulls and other safety
measures. There are tougher controls on vessel traffic,
requirements for on-site cleanup equipment and response plans plus
higher fines on the polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In past oil spills, cleanup crews generally have relied on
skimming oil from water, still the preferred method. But skimming
typically removes less than 20 percent of the spill. In some cases,
crews use chemical dispersants, which either work well or don't
work at all, depending on oil and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the final draft of the state's burn plan, a fire of
vast amounts of leaking cargo has advantages over skimming or
dispersing oil.
</P>
<P>
   Burning can rapidly convert large quantities of oil into a black
smoke plume. Carbon dioxide and water make up about 85 percent of
the plume, and particulates in the form of soot about 14, says the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent are carbon monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur
dioxides and traces of carcinogenic furans and polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   The concentrations of all the pollutants decline downwind as
clean air dilutes the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the most comprehensive review of burning on the West
Coast is a document prepared two years ago by the Environmental
Protection Agency, Coast Guard and Interior and Commerce
departments. They agreed that the health risk from oil fire smoke
is relatively small, particularly when compared with health and
safety risks associated with using chemicals to break up a spill.

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD: STAVING OFF BLINDNESS IN THE TINIEST OF
INFANTS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a nurse holds the hands and head of one of the seven
surviving octuplets born in Houston in December, a doctor peers at
the back of the eyes through an ophthalmoscope. In assembly-line
fashion, the eye doctor examines each child. The aim is to seek the
earliest sign of a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity,
or ROP, resulting from abnormal blood vessel growth, and to use a
laser to prevent a detached retina, which can cause blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The octuplets were born nearly four months before the mother's
due date of April 1. Like other infants born many weeks too early,
they are at high risk of developing ROP in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3.9 million babies born in the United States in 1996,
about 11 percent, or 400,000, were premature, up from 9.4 percent
in 1984. Federal health officials attribute most of the rise to
larger numbers of multiple births, which increase the risk of
pre-term delivery. Many multiple births, like those of the
octuplets, result from fertility drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, medicine now can keep alive tiny babies who
would not have survived only a few years ago. Still, some become
blind.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving octuplets, who are now 10 weeks or older, remain
at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. The first was born on
Dec. 8 and the seven others on Dec. 20. All weighed less than 2
pounds at birth. The smallest, a girl named Odera who weighed 10.3
ounces, died on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The seven survivors are doing well, hospital officials said,
although four are in serious condition and three are still listed
as critical. All but one are consuming a combination of formula and
breast milk. One is fed intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the status of their eyesight is uncertain and will
remain so until several weeks after they leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Dr. David K. Coats and his wife and
ophthalmological partner, Dr. Evelyn A. Paysse, began examining the
surviving octuplets periodically, as they would any infant born
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Coats spoke in interviews about the general nature of ROP, but
not about the findings in the surviving octuplets because their
parents, Nkem Chukwu, the mother, and Iyke Louis Udobi, the father,
wanted no disclosures about their babies' eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   At least 55,000 babies born prematurely each year are at highest
risk for ROP, and an estimated 1,000 of them suffer severe visual
impairment or blindness from ROP. No one has precise figures, but
they would be much higher if pediatric ophthalmologists did not use
lasers or a freezing technique to try to limit the damage in
affected babies.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of tiny infants develop a mild form of ROP that
generally will not impair vision, and 10 percent escape entirely.
But 10 percent do develop a severe enough form that threatens to
cause blindness from a separation of the retina from the wall of
the eye. It is this fraction that requires treatment to prevent a
retinal detachment.
</P>
<P>
   The more premature babies are, the more likely ROP is to
develop, making the odds much higher for two groups of the tiniest
premature babies _ those with an estimated gestational age of 28
weeks or less, and those with a birthweight of 3.3 pounds. Such
babies have up to a 35 percent risk of needing treatment to prevent
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   For a group of seven or eight babies who, like the octuplets,
were 25 to 27 weeks estimated gestational age at birth, the odds
are that one or two of them will need treatment for ROP, Coats
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is you do not know which one will develop ROP,''
Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   The laser and freezing treatments, though usually successful in
preventing blindness, involve an important trade-off. ``We tell
parents that they are sacrificing varying but significant amounts
of side vision to maintain what vision has already developed and to
prevent total blindness,'' Coats said.
</P>
<P>
   Most babies are born with about 20-400 vision, which generally
does not become 20-20 until about age 6 months.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Babies born prematurely also are at risk for vision loss from
other conditions like lazy eye. About 10 percent of the tiniest
babies will become extremely nearsighted and will have to wear
glasses with lenses as thick as Coke bottles for life, beginning in
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Infants born months prematurely have immature eyes, and the
blood vessels that nourish the retina are often absent. Normally,
at about the fourth month of fetal life, blood vessels begin to
grow from the optic nerve in an orderly fashion until they reach
the outer limits of the retina. That usually occurs about the time
a full-term baby is born.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the blood vessels will continue to grow normally,
reaching the outer margins of the retina at term without requiring
treatment. But in some premature infants, development of blood
vessels goes awry and results in ROP. A prevailing theory is that
the immature retina produces a chemical that stimulates growth of
blood vessels. Why ROP does not develop earlier than a month after
birth is not well understood.
</P>
<P>
   ROP is the new name for what was called retrolental fibroplasia
about 30 years ago. At that time, doctors were detecting the
condition in its most severe form, after the retina had detached.
Doctors also discovered that the blindness resulted from a baby's
being given excessive amounts of oxygen. Doctors still believe that
oxygen plays a role, but they can better control the amount. And
they know that laser and freezing can prevent the retinal
detachment.
</P>
<P>
   The test to detect infants whose eyes show the most severe,
abnormal growth patterns, begins with a drop of a dilating drug in
each eye. An hour later, the ophthalmologist adds a drop of local
anesthetic to minimize the infant's discomfort during the
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through an ophthalmoscope, Coats determines the maturity
of the retina by examining the optic nerve, which is a direct
extension of the brain, and other areas. Then he looks at the blood
vessels, studying their width and growth pattern and looking at how
far they have spread. He must also determine if there is a smooth
transition from the areas without blood vessels to those with them,
as it should be, or if there is a sharp border, as it should not.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting damage, the doctor describes it as on a clock: He
may pinpoint a problem between ``one and three o'clock.'' At the
end of the examination, Coats checks the infant's eye muscle
movements and reaction to a bright light. The examination takes a
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the blood vessel growth is normal, Coats checks again every
week or so until the retina matures and the child is no longer at
risk for ROP.
</P>
<P>
   But if the blood vessel growth pattern goes awry, and the baby
is at high risk for developing irreversible blindness, treatment is
started within three days.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ophthalmologists relied on written notes and their
memories in following the progress of development. Now Coats sets a
special camera made by the Massie Research Co., in Dublin, Calif.,
on top of the baby's eye and obtains photographs that are about the
same quality as what he sees through an ophthalmoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is recommended when the ophthalmologist sees abnormal
growth of blood vessels in at least five contiguous, or eight
non-contiguous, hour zones.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can choose between two therapies, either a laser or
freezing technique. Neither treatment is aimed at the abnormal
blood vessels, but at the retina that has not yet developed a blood
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Each procedure takes from 45 to 90 minutes. It can be done by
the bedside or in the operating room under general anesthesia to
avoid dealing with a moving or crying child.
</P>
<P>
   Using a laser, Coats flashes a beam on the retina from 500 to
2,000 times in each eye, depending on the severity of the
condition. The laser beam is directed in a full circle at the
peripheral retina with the hope of stopping production of the
chemical growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the freezing technique, known as cryotherapy, the
ophthalmologist inserts a device along the side of the eye and the
bone, pushing it until it reaches the retina in the back of the
eye. Then the doctor continually freezes the retina until the
entire outer section of the retina is treated. The procedure does
not harm the muscle, sclera and other eye tissues.
</P>
<P>
   After treatment, a child with severe ROP will be left with only
a small amount of normal retina and a less severely affected baby
with a larger area. Laser or cryotherapy is generally a one-time
application. But treatment a second time is needed in about 5
percent of infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a cure for this disease,'' Coats said. ``We have
an intervention, which will usually result in a good visual
outcome, but not always.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite treatment, about 12 percent of treated infants develop a
retinal detachment in one or both eyes. In general, the more
premature the baby, the more likely the outcome will be poor.
</P>
<P>
   If the retina detaches, doctors will perform other procedures to
reattach it. But, at best, such procedures restore only partial
vision.

<P>
   Many ailments that afflict older Americans are directly caused
or indirectly worsened by poor nutrition _ an inadequate intake of
essential nutrients, dietary fiber and water. Health problems like
heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, kidney disease and even
cancer are influenced by the foods consumed, or not consumed,
especially in older people.
</P>
<P>
   Poor choice of foods, rather than a shortage of finances, is the
usual reason. Studies indicate that nutritional shortcomings are
common among the elderly who are well-to-do as well as those with
limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the elderly have been sorely neglected by
nutrition researchers. But in the last decade or so, experts have
learned much about both the nutritional needs of people over 70 and
the nutritional shortcomings they commonly experience. And studies
have shown that just as a child's nutritional requirements differ
in quantity and quality from an adult's, the nutritional needs of
the elderly differ from those of younger adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Guide Pyramid to good eating habits devised in 1992 by
the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services
is now familiar to many households. It depicts the various food
groups and the number of recommended servings of each per day to be
consumed by a healthy adult who wants to remain that way. The
pyramid calls for a daily intake of six to 11 servings of
grain-based foods, three to five servings of vegetables, two to
four servings of fruits, two to three servings of a high-protein
food (meat, poultry, fish, dried beans, eggs and nuts) and two to
three servings of dairy foods. Fats, oils and sweets _ at the tip
of the pyramid _ should be eaten sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   But large numbers of elderly Americans fall seriously short of
these recommendations, consuming the least nutritious choices in
each food category, like white bread instead of whole grain and
fruit juice instead of whole fruit. In addition, as energy needs
decline with age, the elderly tend to eat fewer calories, and hence
fewer servings, of the recommended food groups.
</P>
<P>
   With these problems in mind, Dr. Robert M. Russell, a professor
of medicine and nutrition at Tufts University in Boston and his
colleagues at the Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts, Dr. Alice Lichtenstein and Helen
Rasmussen, a registered dietitian, have developed a revised food
guide pyramid for Americans over 70.
</P>
<P>
   This guide has a new foundation: water, eight 8-ounce glasses of
it (or its nonalcoholic, caffeine-free equivalent) each day.
Russell said that ``older people have a reduced thirst mechanism _
they have to consciously think of drinking more and keeping well
hydrated, especially if they live in warm climates.'' He explained
that without enough water, blood pressure can fall dangerously low,
clots may form and block blood vessels, kidney function may be
compromised (and may result in toxic concentrations of drugs) and
constipation can become chronic.
</P>
<P>
   The next level _ six or more servings a day of grain-based foods
like bread, cereal, rice and pasta, which form the bulk of the
elderly diet _ must emphasize fiber-rich choices, the Tufts
researchers insist. Fiber, Russell said, is important in preventing
constipation and its complications, diverticulosis and
diverticulitis. Certain fibers also help counter high cholesterol,
protect against cancer and maintain a normal blood sugar level,
which is especially important for people with diabetes. And the
cereals in the grain group should be fortified with extra
nutrients, especially B vitamins like folic acid and B-12. Folic
acid can lower blood levels of homocysteine, a substance that
increases the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the fruits and vegetables, both of which are best
consumed as fiber-rich whole foods, not juice. They can be sliced,
chopped or pureed and they can be fresh, canned or frozen, but
fruits packed in syrup provide too many sweet calories, the
researchers maintain. Furthermore, they say, the recommended three
or more servings of vegetables and two or more servings of fruits
should feature foods that are richly colored _ dark green, orange,
red or yellow. These are richest in essential nutrients. In
addition, vegetables in the cabbage family like broccoli,
cauliflower, kale and mustard greens, are rich in cancer-blocking
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In the dairy group, the three recommended servings a day should
feature low-fat choices. Russell noted that people who were lactose
intolerant could still consume lactose-reduced milk, low-fat hard
cheeses and yogurt. Most adults in this country do not consume
enough vital calcium or vitamin D nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Within the meat group, the two or more daily servings should
emphasize variety and feature fish (which may reduce cardiac risk)
and dried beans (rich in fiber) as well as lean cuts of meat and
poultry, the new pyramid suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the consumption of high-fat and highly sweetened foods
should be limited since they provide nutritionally empty calories
and leave less room in the daily energy quotient for nutrient-rich
foods. As for the types of fats used in cooking, in dressings and
as table spreads, the Tufts scientists recommend liquid oils and,
if margarine is used it should be free of so-called trans fatty
acids, which behave like artery-clogging saturated fat in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The Tufts researchers, who are publishing their suggested food
guide in the March issue of The Journal of Nutrition, have added
something new to the pyramid: a supplement ``flag'' at the peak.
Russell explained that few older people were able to get enough
calcium, vitamin B-12 and vitamin D from their diets to achieve the
recommended intake of these nutrients, and many would have to take
supplements to fulfill these nutritional needs.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of bone metabolism over the last two decades,
older people are now being advised to consume 400 international
units of vitamin D daily (double the previous recommendation), the
amount in a quart of milk. Though vitamin D is made in the skin
when it is exposed to sunlight, many older people do not spend
enough time outdoors with sunscreen-free skin exposed to meet their
need for this nutrient.
</P>
<P>
   It is also difficult for the elderly to achieve the recommended
intake of calcium _ 1,200 to 1,400 milligrams a day (up from 800
milligrams), approximately the amount in a quart of milk. Other
good sources of calcium include yogurt, hard cheese and
calcium-fortified orange juice. Many older people would need to
take a calcium supplement to get the recommended daily amount,
Russell said. He cautioned, however, that multivitamin-mineral
supplements did not contain enough calcium to meet nutritional
needs.
</P>
<P>
   As for vitamin B-12, a diet containing any animal foods supplies
this nutrient. But among people over 60, 10 percent to 30 percent
do not form enough acid in their stomachs to release the vitamin
from the food protein that binds it. If the vitamin remains bound,
it cannot be absorbed. B-12 that can be absorbed even by people
with low stomach acid is found in supplements and in cereals
fortified with the vitamin.

   A Boston Globe article about municipal elections in Tehran
incorrectly identified Mahsan Kadivar, a clerical leader in the
reform movement, as a candidate for the Tehran city council.
Kadivar's sister, Jamileh Kadivar, was the candidate and was among
the leading vote getters in the election. She ran for the seat
after Mahsan Kadivar was disqualified by conservative opponents as
a candidate in elections last year for national seats on the
religious Council of Experts.

CENTERS PUBLISH BREAST CANCER GUIDE

<P>
   When a woman finds out that she has breast cancer, fear and
depression may be quickly followed by overwhelming confusion. There
are so many decisions to make about surgery, radiation, types of
chemotherapy and hormonal treatment that women may wonder how to
make sure they really are getting the best, most up-to-date advice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network, a group of 17 cancer centers, have published
breast-cancer treatment guidelines that they say are the first
written specifically to give patients information on
``gold-standard cancer treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, released Monday at a cancer network conference
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are a plain-English version of
recommendations that the cancer network has been issuing and
updating yearly for doctors since 1995. They are in the format of a
24-page magazine article with many diagrams and flow charts, and a
glossary.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Gansler, director of health content for the American
Cancer Society, said the recommendations were more specific and
more directive than information that the cancer society offered
patients in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we find many patients want,'' Gansler said. ``It's
moderately complex, for patients who want take an active role in
their treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the material was meant to be taken as
``guidelines, not recipes,'' for women and their doctors to use
together.
</P>
<P>
   Some cancer experts had reservations about the guidelines. Dr.
Patricia Ganz, a breast cancer specialist at the Jonsson Cancer
Center at the University of California at Los Angeles, said,
``Getting information out to consumers is very important, but these
guidelines are very dense for the average consumer. It's surprising
they didn't make it a little more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ganz said, in some cases the guidelines call for
more aggressive testing and treatment than many physicians would
recommend, particularly for very small tumors. She said patients
who took the recommendations as the letter of the law might become
unduly frightened that their own doctors' treatment plans were
inadequate. The guidelines, she said, should be used in discussing
treatment, but should not be allowed to dictate it.
</P>
<P>
   The document begins by listing information women must find out
in order to use the guidelines, including details about the stage
of cancer, number, size, grade and type of tumors, involvement of
lymph nodes and presence of estrogen receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Because biopsy results are so important in determining
treatment, the guidelines stress that all women get a second
opinion, or pathology review, on the biopsy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Once the diagnosis is clear, a woman can follow a series of
``decision trees'' to find out what cancer experts would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler noted the breast cancer information was the first in a
series of patients' guidelines that would be offered for the most
common forms of cancer. Prostate cancer recommendations will be
next, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer guidelines can be obtained from the American
Cancer Society by calling (800) ACS-2345 or visiting its Web site,
www.cancer.org or from the cancer network at (888) 909-NCCN, or
www.nccn.org.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KAJIADO, Kenya _ Naataosim Mako fiddled with the edge of the
desk and fluffed up her skirt, more than a little embarrassed to
talk so barely about her young life.
</P>
<P>
   But these were the facts: For her hand in marriage, a friend of
her father gave a small fortune of a dowry _ 10 cows, 4 goats, more
than 200 quarts of home-brewed beer, more than 6 pounds of sugar
and a sack of rice.
</P>
<P>
   He was about 30 years old, she said. She was only 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still young,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naataosim, foal-thin in her green school uniform, is 10 now.
This is her second year in the AIC Girls Primary Boarding School,
where she is a pupil rather than a very young bride. The school, on
a dusty plateau in southern Kenya, is circled by a chain-link fence
topped with barbed wire, meant to deter not thieves but the fathers
of the girls from sneaking them away.
</P>
<P>
   The school has become a haven for girls seeking to escape early
marriage, a practice not at all unusual among the Masai, perhaps
the most fiercely traditional and independent of the 42 tribes in
Kenya. And so, the school has found itself at the heart of an
unending argument here about how the modern world is gaining ground
on traditional life in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Masai may still dress in plaid shawls, but more and more
they are giving up nomadic life, as their land is parceled off and
the plains fill with houses. The Kikuyu, the largest tribe, have a
saying that sums up the inching forth of change: Even the Masai are
wearing underwear now.
</P>
<P>
   But many Masai families do not understand why that change must
extend to one of their most precious and pliable resources, their
daughters. And that has made it hard for the school, where
three-quarters of the girls are Masai, and its headmistress,
Priscilla Nangurai.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are more problems than successes,'' she said by
way of weary introduction to her school. ``They feel that when a
girl goes to school she gets spoiled because she gets to a point
where she is equal to the men. But she's not supposed to be equal.
She's not supposed to make her own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men are afraid of that, of their not getting married at
all,'' she added. ``To them that is like you are an outcast. A
woman should get married. She should have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the fence, which went up six years ago, as well as rules
that allow families to visit the girls only two times each term.
During Mrs. Nangurai's 18 years there, the school has become well
known for taking in girls in trouble. Some are victims of sexual
assault. One girl who will enroll soon is the daughter of a woman
killed in December by her police officer husband, a case that has
heightened concern in Kenya about domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nangurai said she is not on a crusade to destroy Masai
culture, even though she has been accused of that. Despite her
abhorrence of female genital cutting, for example, she said she
does not try to stop it. Nearly all her students have undergone one
form of genital cutting or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them at least to do it on the holidays,'' she
said, ``so the girls can have some time to heal before they come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Nangurai said some people have softened on the
school, it was clear from interviews around the town of Kajiado
that there is much suspicion of education for girls. Nantayio
Sonto, 35, a market vendor, said girls were more respectful in the
``older'' days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the girls of today, once she goes to school and gets an
education, she will not listen to her elders,'' she said. ``She
might even elope.''
</P>
<P>
   The school was founded in 1959 by Protestant missionaries from
the African Inland Church, though it no longer supports the school.
The idea was that the Masai could leave their daughters behind for
schooling while the rest of the family followed their cattle to
fresh grazing lands. The school is now financed through fees from
parents who can pay and grants from outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   From 20 girls at the start, the number had grown to 412 by the
time Mrs. Nangurai became headmistress in 1981. But she said there
was still much suspicion about the school, so much that she had to
recruit for first-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 650 girls there, and many of their stories follow
a similar script.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father wanted to marry me off,'' said Jedida Nkadoyo, who
was only 10 when her father mysteriously forbade her to go to
school in her home village. A week later, she said, her mother told
her, ``Today you are going to your husband's place.'' Her dowry was
one cow, a crate of bottled beer and 40 liters of home brew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a girl who is going to school so I can get my education,''
she said she told her father. ``My father said, `That's
nonsense.'''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage lasted one day, and by some circumstance she is
still not completely aware of, she ended up at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Shuaka was 14 when her father told her she was to be
married one day after she came home from school. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I was just playing,'' she said. ``He said, `You are
going to be married because you are old enough to get married
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the start, her father would not visit her at the school. But
slowly he came. He does not talk about marriage anymore, Ms. Shuaka
said. She wants to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen now that I have done a good job,'' she said. ``He
has said it is very important for me to be educated.''

BREAKING THE SILENCE ON AIDS

<P>
   They baptize people, confirm them, preach to them, marry them,
bury them, and now, like it or not, in the face of AIDS, priests,
ministers and other members of the clergy are teaching parishioners
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is the need felt more urgently than in places black
people worship, whether Roman Catholic, Pentecostal or Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Despite successes in medical treatment, AIDS continues to pose a
disproportionate peril to blacks. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, in 1997, the most recent
year for which data are available, a larger proportion of blacks
were reported to have AIDS than any other group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, the center had received reports of 230,029
cases of AIDS among blacks. That accounts for 36 percent of the
cases, but blacks make up only about 13 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African-American community has to understand that if we
are going to overcome this, the church will have to be involved,''
said the Rev. George McRae, pastor of the Mount Tabor Baptist
Church in the Liberty City section of Miami. ``Every hour we lose
three people in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the clergy of all races have been hesitant to take up
the role of AIDS educators, but the black church, especially given
the statistics, has been exceptionally reluctant to tackle the
issues, said those active in AIDS education.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning it was perceived as a gay white male
disease,'' said the Rev. Rosetta E. Dubois-Gadson, whose son died
of AIDS in 1996 and who now has an AIDS ministry at St. Luke's
a.m.E. Church in Harlem. ``The attitude was `Thank God it wasn't
us.' `Many churches didn't want to deal with the stigma or with
drug abuse.'''
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes are changing. In growing numbers, black religious
leaders are speaking out, sometimes uncomfortably, teaching
prevention for the healthy and compassion for the stricken. They
are transmitting from the pulpit, in the classroom and in private
counseling sessions the messages of abstinence, monogamy,
protection, including condoms, and avoidance of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, for example, only 50 churches participated in the
first Black Church Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS led by
Balm in Gilead, a national organization based in New York City that
educates black churches on AIDS. For this year's week of prayer,
which begins Sunday, 5,000 churches have signed up and are planning
worship services, lectures and concerts, said Pernessa Seele, the
founder and chief executive of Balm in Gilead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that increase, Ms. Seele, said: ``If churches were doing
enough, we wouldn't be in business. Some members of the clergy have
been misinformed that AIDS is a sin and that it only affects gays.
Their position on homosexuality becomes their excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence among religious leaders is usually broken by the
recognition of how close to home HIV or AIDS can hit, she said,
outlining a typical scenario: ``A pastor who has never said
anything about HIV decides to do a special prayer, even though he
thinks, `I know no one in my church has AIDS.' After church,
somebody thanks him for the prayer, saying, `I have AIDS' or `I am
taking care of my grandkids because my daughter has AIDS.' The
pastor is shocked and calls an AIDS service organization that helps
him begin educational work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the route to an active role for religious leaders is
even more direct. The Rev. Franklin Richardson, senior pastor of
the Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y., began publicly
discussing the illness of his brother before he died of AIDS in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got his permission to talk about it with the congregation,''
said Richardson, who is running for president of the National
Baptist Convention. ``It was a blessing, and a surprise. So many
families came to tell me, `You helped me so much.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Richardson said, he discusses AIDS frequently in his
church. ``We want people to understand that AIDS is not a sin, but
a disease,'' he said. ``And like any disease, we want to talk about
how to prevent it. That is where sex education begins.''
</P>
<P>
   While some leaders of more liberal denominations seem
comfortable with such candor, those discussions are rare in
churches and mosques that prohibit the use of condoms or that take
strong stands against homosexuality and sex outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the quandary in which he finds himself, the Rev.
Theodore K. Parker, pastor of All Saints Roman Catholic Church on
Madison Avenue at 129th Street, said: ``We must reason our way
through the church's conflicting statements on matters of health.
As a Catholic priest, naturally I advocate personal restraint from
sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if condoms offered the best protection against the virus
outside of abstinence, he said, ``Yes, that is true, but we can't
say anything else about it. We try to stay within church law while
saying, `You are an adult. You put two and two together.' People
know that the priest is in a bind.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders face a similar dilemma. ``In Islam, promiscuity,
relations outside marriage and intoxicants are forbidden,'' said
Talib Abdur-Rashid, imam of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood
in Harlem. ``Though certainly there are Muslims who are sexually
promiscuous and Muslims who use narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach in his mosque? ``We try to keep an open public
discourse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of condoms as a preventive measure also presents a
problem in Islam. As a birth control measure, condoms are permitted
only if pregnancy would threaten a woman's health, said
Abdur-Rashid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that having a condom does not make fornication or
adultery right,'' he said. ``To distribute condoms and not teach
the morality of their use is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   With strict views on sexuality, clergy members of the
Pentecostal, evangelical and fundamentalist branches of
Christianity have also hesitated to join the discussion of AIDS.
But in some of their churches, attitudes are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only given one sermon about AIDS so far and plan to
give another one in March,'' said the Rev. Charles Edward Cook,
pastor of the House of David Pentecostal Apostolic Church in the
East New York section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor, who believes that homosexuals and drug addicts can
change through prayer, said: ``We don't scorn people because of
their activity. We offer them a way out through love and
Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   As for condoms, he added, ``We don't push them. When you push
condoms, you are giving people an out to go for sex, which we don't
promote. But my wife and I tell our teen-age grandchildren, if
you're going to do this, please use condoms. But the best way is to
abstain.''

FALLOUT FROM MOMS' WORK: ALMOST NONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest long-term study to date on working mothers has found
that employment outside the home has no significant or lasting
effect on their children's development, adding to a growing but
murky body of evidence on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Six previous studies, in fact, had taken smaller dips from the
same pool of evidence and emerged with a mishmash of conclusions:
some finding that children are harmed when mothers work outside the
home; others finding benefits, and others showing no effect at all.
Dr. Elizabeth Harvey, the author of the new study, which was
published Monday in the journal Developmental Psychology, said her
work was aimed primarily at plowing through that ``puzzling''
statistical morass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite contradictions on details, Dr. Harvey, an assistant
professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, said that seven studies agreed on what she called the big
picture: All the effects found were relatively small and fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   The studies analyzed data collected for the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which began tracking 12,000 male and
female subjects in 1979, when they were between 14 and 22 years
old. Since 1986, the annual interviews have included the children
of the women, a group that now numbers about 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harvey drew on data through 1994 to assess what effect a
mother's employment status during a child's first three years would
have later on. She found that employment status itself seemed to
leave no mark one way or another. But the children of women who
waited the longest to go back to work had the fewest behavioral
problems at ages 3 to 4. The only lasting effect Dr. Harvey found
was that the more a woman worked, the more likely her child was to
have slightly lower language skills, although the gap fell within
the test's margin of error, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many variables that affect children's
development, including the quality of parenting, the parent-child
relationship and educational opportunities,'' Dr. Harvey said.
``These findings suggest that parents are in the best position to
judge what's best for their family, and should feel good about
making either decision.''

   Surprise Finding on Tamoxifen and Citrus &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In trying to explain why fruits and vegetables help prevent
cancer, some researchers cite flavonoids, which are chemical
ingredients that inhibit cancer cell growth. But a new study
suggests that tangeretin, a flavonoid in citrus fruits and certain
processed foods and dietary supplements, may sometimes be harmful
because it negates the benefits of tamoxifen, the breast cancer
drug. The finding came as a surprise, since in vitro studies showed
that tangeretin acted like tamoxifen to inhibit mammary cancer
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University Hospital in Ghent, Belgium,
wanted to see if tangeretin could amplify tamoxifen's therapeutic
effect in mice with mammary cancer. Their study was published last
month in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. One group of
the 80 mice drank water with tamoxifen, one drank water with
tangeretin, one drank water with both substances and the fourth
group served as a control. The tamoxifen group had significantly
less tumor growth than the others and lived an average of 56 weeks,
compared with just 14 weeks for the tangeretin-tamoxifen group.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers do not know why tangeretin suppresses cancer
growth in vitro but not in mice. But a likely reason, they wrote,
is that tangeretin interfered with the mice's immune response to
the cancer cells. Tangeretin suppresses the activity of natural
killer cells in the immune system, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a provocative study, the kind of thing one pays
attention to,'' said Dr. Larry Norton, director of the solid tumor
oncology division at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. He said the findings needed to be duplicated, but he agreed
with the researchers that women should not stop eating citrus
fruits and drinking citrus juices while taking tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've treated hundreds of thousands of women with tamoxifen,
and we take a detailed dietary history, and we haven't noticed a
trend in which women who eat citrus fruits have adverse effects,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norton also agreed with the researchers' advice that women cut
back on tangeretin intake from other sources while taking
tamoxifen. Those sources, which have far more tangeretin than
fruit, include its dietary supplements and beverages, baked goods
and candy flavored with citrus peel oils.

   Mouths at Risk When Guards Are Out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although mouth guards can prevent dental injuries that occur
during contact sports, a University of Minnesota study says that
few athletes are wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 318 soccer players, basketball players and wrestlers
who participated in the study believed mouth guards could help
prevent injuries, but only 6 percent reported using them.
</P>
<P>
   Participants cited discomfort, breathing and speech impairment,
lack of retention, and peer pressure as reasons for disliking mouth
guards. The study appeared this month in The Journal of Public
Health Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because most kids wore boil and bite mouth guards, they found
it hard to breathe,'' said Dr. Brent Kvittem, lead author and a
pediatric dentist in Minneapolis. He referred to inexpensive mouth
guards that were first boiled, and then, while warm and soft, were
placed in the mouth to mold the device to the athlete's bite.
``Boil and bite mouth guards don't stay in place very well. With
custom-made ones, that isn't as common.''
</P>
<P>
   Among study participants who did not wear mouth guards, one in
10 reported a dental injury, among them broken, lost or chipped
teeth, bruised or cut lips, and jaw injuries.
</P>
<P>
   None of the athletes who used mouth guards reported any
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly recommend that athletes use custom-fitted mouth
guards,'' Kvittem said. ``If you bump a tooth, it's possible to
cause that tooth to die, which could lead to a root canal or crown
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids can prevent injuries now, it will save them cost and
involved treatment in the future.''

UNIT OF AFL-CIO ANNOUNCES DRIVE TO BRING PHYSICIANS INTO UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of organized labor on Monday announced a
$1-million drive to unionize the roughly 300,000 doctors employed
by health maintenance organizations and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said salaried doctors
need unions because the ``upheaval in the health care industry is
affecting their work.'' Nearly 300,000 doctors _ 50 percent of the
nation's 600,000 practicing physicians _ are in salaried positions
in hospitals and in HMOs, making them eligible for union
membership, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have told us very clearly they fear the trend towards
corporate takeover of health care, and they've told us they want
doctors making patient-care decisions,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Stern, president of the 1.3 million Service Employees
International Union, also described the organizing drive as a
battle for improved patient care, not just for better wages and
hours for physicians, in the era of managed care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference at AFL-CIO headquarters here,
Stern said doctors ``take their Hippocratic oath to heal seriously.
They're kind of tired of the hypocritical oath of corporate
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of doctors belonging to unions range between 35,000
and 45,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 of them will be part of the National Doctors
Alliance, a new umbrella organization unveiled Monday by the SEIU.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will sponsor a new organization, the National
Doctors Alliance. It will be made up of the 9,000-member Committee
of Interns and Residents, and the 1,000-member United Salaried
Physicians and Dentists, both now part of the SEIU.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an independent group, the 2,500 member Doctors
Council, which represents doctors primarily at municipal hospitals
in New York City, will join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With another 2,500 doctors organized in other units of the SEIU
also joining in, the alliance starts out with a grand total of
15,000 unionized doctors. Other unions also have organized
physicians into their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Stern told reporters the SEIU will put $1 million into a
nationwide organizing drive. He declined to name specific initial
targets for organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing doctors may prove to be a steep challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law exempts doctors in group practices or partnerships
who share in managerial decision-making. But the advent of the
managed- care system of health care in the past decade has blurred
the lines of who is an employee and who is a partner.
</P>
<P>
   As a class, doctors historically have viewed themselves as
professionals, distinctly different from the blue-collar workers
who generally are the targets of labor organizing drives. Even
under managed care, doctors' pay is in the six-figure range. A
recent survey of over 700 doctors in managed care pegged their
average yearly income at $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Dr. Barry Leibowitz, head of the
Doctors Council, said doctors ``have always been very poor business
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As professionals who spend years in training before they can
actually practice, salaried doctors often work 60 hours a week or
more treating patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical
Association, said that while the doctors' organization ``continues
to be deeply concerned'' about the impact of managed care on
medicine, ``we do not believe that traditional trade union
practices ensure the integrity of the patient-physician
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said the AMA is ``exploring ways'' to help physicians,
following what she termed ``a strict adherence to the highest
principles of professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the American Association of Health
Plans, the managed-care industry's trade group, said the group had
``no quarrel'' with doctors in salaried, non-managerial positions
attempting to organize into unions.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of HMOs that employ doctors is relatively
small, she added, because most use a contractual arrangement that
precludes union organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're in an environment today where there's a high
level of rhetoric geared toward managed-care plans,'' Pisano said.
``We disagree with some of the conclusions put forward.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A swath of light-to-moderate snow will fall across parts of
Wisconsin and the lower peninsula of Michigan Tuesday as
cyclogenesis, the process by which a low pressure system forms and
intensifies, commences over the southern Great Lakes region. Two to
five inches of snow are possible to the north and west of the path
of the low.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will develop across parts
of the western Gulf States and the lower Mississippi, Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys as a cold front stretching southwest from the Great
Lakes low lifts increasingly moist air streaming inland from the
Gulf of Mexico. A few storms may approach severe levels later
Tuesday afternoon or night, but severe weather will likely be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will arrive in the Pacific Northwest from northern
California to Oregon as a potent low pressure system approaches
from the Pacific. Winds blowing offshore over northwest Washington
will allow some weak sun through gathering high clouds. Clouds will
thicken Tuesday night and rain will arrive later. Thunderstorms are
possible later Tuesday and Tuesday night over parts of Oregon,
northern California and Washington as a pool of very cold air at
18,000 feet destabilizes the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers and snow flurries will coat the mountains of
northern New England as moisture wraps southward around a low
pressure system to the east of Canada's James Bay. Low clouds will
likely spill eastward over the mountains to parts of the Northeast
seaboard before gradually breaking up from southeast New York
northward.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Memorable Dryness
</P>
<P>
   Rain was scarce across the southern-tier states in February.
Only a trace fell at Tucson, Ariz. Only a trace fell at
Albuquerque, N.M., insuring the city's sixth-driest winter on
record. A mere one-hundredth of an inch of rain fell at San
Antonio, Texas, marking the city's second-driest February on record
and ranking this winter as the driest in city history. At Mobile,
Ala., it was the driest February since records began in 1855. In
the absence of a robust, moist southern branch of the jet stream,
parching high pressure ruled the southern-tier states for much of
the winter.

`STOLEN YEARS': LIVING TO TELL ABOUT THE HORROR OF STALIN'S CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<TEXT>
<P>
   Half a century ago, the Soviet gulag was still thriving, with
jammed freight cars carrying political prisoners from Moscow and
Leningrad on a long journey to the mines and factories on the
eastern borders of the empire. For many the sentence proved fatal,
but in ``Stolen Years,'' a few of those who survived return Tuesday
night with memories of their time in the merciless cold and
demoralizing conditions, doing long days of back-breaking labor
with no prospect of release.
</P>
<P>
   These men and women deliver their memories directly to the
camera, without further documentation; the accompanying pictures
are mainly atmospheric. A voice of authenticity is added by Robert
Conquest, the British historian who exposed Stalinist atrocities
before that was altogether fashionable, and nothing that we hear
Tuesday night contradicts the mass of gulag testimony
post-Solzhenitsyn.
</P>
<P>
   The shared experiences began with sudden arrests, often of whole
families, on vague charges; the dungeonlike imprisonment, the short
sham trials and the ordained long sentences. Then came the
excruciating passage across the country to places like the gold
mines of Kolyma, a huge network set in the middle of the hard frost
of nowhere. Nature's afflictions were exacerbated by human nature;
robbery and rape by the camp's criminals, tough nonpoliticals who
served as surrogates to Soviet officials, were common.
</P>
<P>
   These prisoners seemed to have been selected from the
better-educated strata. One man survived by doing illustrations,
including a portrait of Stalin on view Tuesday night and slogans
reminiscent of those of Nazi camps: ``Liberation Through Honest
Toil.'' Another tells of keeping his sanity by writing poems while
in prison. ``I spoke with God,'' he says. Indeed, anyone's survival
remains a miracle under the conditions described here so vividly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after years of hopelessness, in 1953 there came the
death of Stalin. One prisoner tells of hearing the music of Bach
and Beethoven over the camp's loudspeakers. ``The bastard was
finished,'' he rejoiced. ``And we began kissing one another.'' But
a woman confesses to weeping over Stalin: ``I never blamed him for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the survivors says he was arrested when he was in his 30s
and was 47 when he was released. Now in his 80s, he says in what
can serve as an epitaph to this compelling horror of 20th-century
cruelty, ``They took away the filet of life.''

COURT EXAMINES PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN BIAS CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court wrestled Monday with the question
of how ``egregious'' job discrimination must be for a victim to
receive high-cost damages beyond loss-of-pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose in the case of Carole Kolstad, who worked in
the Washington, D.C. office of the American Dental Association
(ADA) and sued her employer after she was turned down for a
promotion in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   She sued under an anti-discrimination law that permits people
who suffer intentional discrimination to collect punitive damages
as well as back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she won a $52,718 back-pay award, but the
U.S. District Court judge in her case refused to grant punitive
damages, which are intended to punish the employer and deter future
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the U.S. Court of Appeals here agreed with that
ruling, saying Kolstad needed to prove ``egregious conduct'' on the
part of the ADA in order to win punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said during oral arguments
over the case, ``This statute is simply confusing.'' He added,
``Nobody can pretend that it's a clear guideline as to where a
court ought to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Other justices, including Antonin Scalia, criticized the appeals
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really understand what is meant by an egregious act.''
said Scalia, who then joked, ``I have it. Firing on Christmas Eve.
That would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, also having trouble with the term
egregious, said courts must not allow it to be defined by the
worker claiming discrimination. ``Punitive damages are not going to
turn on whether an employee is thin-skinned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter suggested that the law sets a stricter
standard for awarding punitive damages because it requires proof
that employers who intentionally discriminated against someone also
knew they were violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Kolstad's lawyer, Eric Schnapper, arguing against the appeals
court ruling, insisted that his client did not have to prove
``egregious behavior'' to seek punitive damages. He said she needed
to show only that the ADA ``intentionally'' discriminated against
her because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   Schnapper said federal job-discrimination laws, which lay out
the standards for forcing employers to pay punitive damages, never
directly set ``egregious conduct'' as a hurdle that must be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Kolstad's boss ``knew he was breaking the law and, therefore, my
client should be allowed to try for compensation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Raymond C. Fay, attorney for the Chicago-based ADA,
argued that allowing Kolstad to seek additional damages would let
virtually everyone who proves intentional job discrimination seek
punitive damages. He said past cases show there is a ``tradition of
a more difficult standard of proof'' for such damages.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked him if the very act of firing
people because of their sex or race, and knowing the action was
unlawful, might be considered egregious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It very well may be,'' Fay answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision, expected in July, could clarify
employers' liability when they are found to have intentionally
violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars
employment discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules in Kolstad's favor, thousands more plaintiffs
in discrimination cases will be able to seek punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Congress amended the 1964 act in 1991 to allow people who prove
they were victims of job bias to collect punitive damages if they
can show their employer acted with ``malice or with reckless
indifference'' to their rights. The amended law also limited awards
for punitive damages to $300,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kolstad was the ADA's director of federal agency relations in
Washington when the association's director of legislation announced
his retirement in 1992. Kolstad and another ADA Washington office
employee, Tom Spangler, expressed interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   When Spangler got it, she sued, contending that the ADA chose
Spangler before a formal selection process had begun and that the
choice was motivated by sexual bias against her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Leonard Wheat, who headed the
association's Washington office, told sexually offensive jokes at
staff meetings and sometimes used derogatory terms to refer to
professionally prominent women. Wheat denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In awarding her back pay in 1995, a federal jury found that the
ADA had illegally discriminated against her. The trial judge
disagreed with the verdict but said he would uphold it. Yet he
refused to allow the jury to award Kolstad punitive damages and
held that she was not entitled to have the director's position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia ruled that the jury should have been
allowed to consider punitive damages for her. But later that year,
the entire D.C. Court of Appeals, in a 6-5 decision, sided with the
ADA, ruling that Kostad was not entitled to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   To recover punitive damages, the appeals court said an employee
must show not only intentional discrimination but also ``egregious
conduct'' by the employer.

`SINGLE &AMP; SINGLE': HERO, STYLE AND SUBJECT ARE FAMILIAR, FOR A
WHILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appealing hero of ``Single &AMP; Single,'' Oliver Single a k a
Oliver Hawthorne a k a Mark West, is a familiar le Carre figure: a
disaffected son, in thrall to (and in rebellion against) his
prodigal father; a sleight-of-hand artist who has gone to work for
the British government as a spy; a loner torn torn between loyalty
to his family and loyalty to his own ideals. He will remind
faithful le Carre readers of both Magnus Pym, the conflicted,
father-obsessed hero of ``A Perfect Spy'' (1986) and Jonathan Pine,
the title character of ``The Night Manager'' (1993) _ a man haunted
by his past and in hiding from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although this novel is flawed by a predictable villain and a
silly action adventure ending, it gets off to a fast start, sailing
along on John le Carre's narrative panache. Once again we are
plunged into the author's shadowy world of informers and double
agents, a world in which betrayal _ of one's family, country,
principles or loved ones _ is the operative word.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Night Manager,'' the Cold War has ended, and
international dealers in guns and drugs have replaced the
Communists as the bad guys. Money, not ideology, is the motivating
force now; at stake are the millions and millions of dollars to be
made as the former Soviet Union collapses and ruthless cartels move
in to exploit an emerging free market.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these power brokers is Yevgeny Orlov, a fabled
Moscow fixer who has been facilitating illicit trade in everything
from ``Afghan heroin for teen-agers to Czech Semtex for Irish peace
lovers and Russian nuclear triggers for Middle Eastern democrats.''
Yevgeny's own personal fixer is Tiger Single, Oliver's father,
whose firm specializes in the laundering of ill-gotten gains and
the creation of the ``best legal loopholes that illicit wealth can
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Domineering, arrogant and ruthless, Tiger Single not only
recalls Magnus Pym's flamboyant father, Rick, in ``A Perfect Spy''
but also bears more than a passing resemblance to le Carre's own
father, as the author has described him in interviews _ a charming,
silver-tongued con man whose globe-spanning, entrepreneurial
schemes read like a more innocent, less sophisticated version of
Tiger's.
</P>
<P>
   While Oliver grows up worshiping his father, his adoration soon
turns to disillusionment when he goes to work for the family firm
and realizes just what sort of activities it's been engaged in.
After falling in love with Yevgeny's daughter, Zoya, who urges him
to take a stand against their fathers' nefarious dealings, the
prince regent of Single &AMP; Single turns informer, contacting Nat
Brock, a member of a British ``interservice task force''
investigating black market trade and domestic corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with anger at his father and guilt over his own betrayal,
Oliver Single tries to begin a new, anonymous life as Oliver
Hawthorne. He marries, has a daughter, separates from his wife and
settles down to a new life as a children's magician in a small
English town near the coast of Devon. Five years pass, and Oliver's
new life is suddenly shattered with the news that a mysterious
stranger has deposited 5 million 30 pounds in cash in his
daughter's trust. It is followed by the disturbing news that one of
Single &AMP; Single's agents, a man by the name of Alfie Winser, has
been killed gangland style in Turkey, and that Tiger Single has
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   These key events unfold with le Carre's usual authority and
aplomb as he builds tension by cutting back and forth in time and
back and forth between several seemingly independent story lines.
The reader is immersed in Oliver's psychological drama and at the
same time ineluctably drawn into the dizzying world of
international contraband and high finance.
</P>
<P>
   As Oliver, accompanied by Brock's operatives, sets out to find
his missing father, he must puzzle out the story behind his
disappearance. Why was Alfie Winser murdered, and what does it have
to do with the Russian government's seizure of a ship bound for
Liverpool? What caused the sudden estrangement between Tiger Single
and Yevgeny Orlov? And what role in all this was played by Alix
Hoban, Yevgeny's sinister right-hand man? In sorting out the
answers to these questions, Oliver must come to terms with his
feelings about his father, and in doing so, must also decide where
his own conflicted loyalties lie.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel proceeds, le Carre's orchestration of these
narrative strands relies increasingly on the sort of crudely
manipulative techniques favored by directors of Sylvester Stallone
and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. In the latter stages of the
novel, he frequently resorts to wordy debriefings of crucial
witnesses to pull information together, and he ends ``Single &AMP;
Single'' with a highly implausible set piece that reads like a
cartoony script for James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   It is a singularly inappropriate punctuation point for a novel
(and, for that matter, a body of work) predicated upon
psychological subtlety, hardheaded realism, meticulous knowledge of
tradecraft and wonderfully human heroes like the tortured Oliver
Single.

CEMETERY REMOVES FENCE DIVIDING HISPANIC, WHITE PLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYNAN, Texas _ A cemetery fence that briefly separated the
gravestones bearing German and Hispanic names was removed Monday,
ending a feud that sparked threats of a civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The five-foot-high border that divided plots marked Fonseca,
Lopez and Trevino from those marked Kuhnert and Dornbusch triggered
resentment when it was erected three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday morning, 30 people watched as metal-cutting shears
sliced through the chain links at the Waldheim Cemetery, located 3
miles south of the Bee County community of Tynan and some 45 miles
northwest of Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good. Now we are one country, one flag and one
cemetery, which is what we believe in,'' said Irma Reynero, 32, of
Tynan, whose relatives are buried at the cemetery that dates back
more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was very sad. We really shouldn't have been
treated this way,'' said Willie Garcia, 58, also of Tynan. ``Seeing
the fence come down gives you a different feeling in your heart.
They're treating us equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there for less than a month, the fence stood as a
slight to the Hispanics in this town of 175 people.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Waldheim Cemetery Association, which maintains
the white portion of the 4-acre burial ground, voted 22-3 to remove
fence that it had early approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't have happened,'' said Howard Salge, a farmer and
member of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was peace and harmony prior to this, and given some
time, peace and harmony will return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That harmony was disrupted when E.A. Murff, then-president of
the white cemetery association, installed the fence. Murff resigned
last week after the association voted to remove the boundary.
</P>
<P>
   He has declined to be interviewed but did pass by slowly in his
tractor Monday as the fence was being dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the metal fence posts was planted in the gravesite on the
Hispanic side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a desecration of a grave to string a fence over a
grave, and then to put a post through it is unforgivable,'' Salge
said.
</P>
<P>
   The American G.I. Forum, an Hispanic civil rights organization,
threatened to file a federal civil rights lawsuit, giving urgency
to the decision to remove the fence and resolve the hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the G.I. Forum said he was ``very happy'' with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything came out beautifully. We did this peacefully. As
you can see, the fence is down and out,'' said Xico Garcia,
commander of the Hector P. Garcia chapter of the G.I. Forum in
Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Salge said he and Diana Cavazos Taylor, who represents the
Hispanic cemetery association, will iron out other details,
including how much of the 4-acre plot each group owns.
</P>
<P>
   That could take some doing.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle will be translating the minutes, covering the period
1912 to 1948, of the original cemetery association. The German
settlers wrote those minutes in their native language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deed for the whole cemetery but no separate deeds
for the Anglo and Hispanic portions, so legally, it's all one
cemetery,'' Salge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the old minutes of the cemetery association will
reveal what is commonly believed, that at some time they gave two
acres to the Hispanics,'' Salge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 86 years of history and custom, the only thing would be
to formalize it and get a clear understanding of who owns what,''
he said.

 &HT;    This week: Two magazines look at racial issues
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) offers a thoughtful piece on the
criticism of racial stereotyping in the hugely amusing animated
television series ``The PJs.'' Spike Lee has called the send-up of
ghetto life ``hateful towards black people,'' but funkster George
Clinton, who wrote the theme song, says, ``I was raised in a PJ
(housing project) in Newark, and people like these cartoon
characters exist in the flesh.'' EW points out white stereotypes
that don't draw flak _ for example Hank Hill in ``King of the
Hill'' _ and the generational differences in black humor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Seeds of hate: Why did William ``Bill'' King turn from an
average burglar into a white supremacist? U.S. News &AMP; World Report
($2.95) takes a cursory look at the three-year incarceration of the
killer sentenced to die for the Jasper, Texas dragging murder, and
at the violent world behind bars in Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   -- Drawing fire: Once again, The New Yorker ($3) has generated
controversy (and publicity) with the power of the brush. The March
8 cover illustration, featuring a genial cop taking aim at
silhouettes of human targets in a carnival-style shooting gallery,
angered the Patrolman's Benevolent Association as ``grossly
offensive.'' In the gallery is a sign saying ``41 shots 10 cents,''
alluding to the Feb. 4 death of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo,
shot at 41 times by four New York officers in the vestibule of his
N.Y. apartment. The cover is by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist
Art Spiegelman, who told the Associated Press, ``This was never
intended as an insult to the officers ... but as a warning sign of
how radically the (public's) perception of a police officer has
changed.'' Inside, don't miss the personal account of gambling
fever by brothers (and frequent New Yorker contributors) Frederick
and Steven Barthelme, who are charged with cheating a Mississippi
casino.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rx for circulation: Women and health gain the attention of
the newsweeklies this week: Newsweek puts out a special edition
($3.50) with 96 pages on menopause, breast cancer, aging,
osteoporosis, depression and other concerns. At the same time
(miraculously) Time ($2.95) illustrates a cover story on ``The
Truth About Women's Bodies'' with a lush, arms-crossed nude: (The
truth? Time knows, as well as Maxim and Details, that women's
bodies sell magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Nonfat: A skinny but ambitious monthly publication, bluemilk
Magazine (call 404-815-9983 for information) grew out of an Atlanta
arts collective of the same name. The current issue offers
photographs of Butler County by Mark Wolfe, an excerpt from
``Bombingham,'' a novel in progress by Anthony Grooms, and
reproductions of artwork by a variety of Atlanta-based artists.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sorry doesn't cut it: A wonderful cover story on forgiveness
in the Utne Reader ($4.99), reprinted from the Family Therapy
Networker newsletter, tries to unravel an approach to
reconciliation in an age of false apologies. It's accompanied by
six sidebars, including a provocative defense of the death penalty
from one of the Unabomber's surviving victims.
</P>
<P>
   -- Space rocks: At up to $25,000 a gram, the rarest meteorites
are 2,500 times as expensive as gold. Collectors knew this when
they began stumbling around the farms of Portales, New Mexico last
summer, hunting for any one of several fist- and head-sized chunks
of space rock that made a flashy descent into this tiny town.
Describing one 37-pounder that dropped into Nelda Wallace's
vegetable garden, the Smithsonian ($4) says ``The impact sounded
like two cars colliding and raised a cloud of dust as big as a
house.'' The magazine of the Smithsonian Institute spins an
engaging tale of dealers waving large handfuls of cash, poachers
who steal from natural history museums, and other casualties of
meteorite madness.

 &HT;    Teletubby controversy sees Tinky Winky sales increase
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tickle me Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the purple Teletubby are shooting up in some stores
since the Rev. Jerry Falwell accused the children's TV character of
being a gay role model.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlanta area, the urge to bag the bag-toting Tinky Winky
is especially strong inside the Perimeter. Many adults are buying
the toys for themselves, with some stockpiling them as potential
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   At the GPTV (Georgia Public Television) Store of Knowledge in
Lenox Square Mall, Tinky Winky has replaced Po, the red Teletubby,
and Laa-Laa, the yellow one, as the most popular. Tinky Winky toys
have sold out at FAO Schwarz, although there are four dozen each of
the other Teletubbies on the shelves. Outwrite Bookstore in Midtown
saw its Teletubby sales rise from about 25 toys in the two weeks
before Falwell outed Tinky Winky to 150 over the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are adopting Tinky Winky as their own. Some are getting
it as a protest. Some are getting it for their kids to make sure
they understand that for a televangelist to bring something like
this up is offensive,'' says Outwrite owner Philip Rafshoon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Perimeter, Tinky Winky sells about the same as he
always has, several store managers say. On online auction site
eBay, the most popular Teletubby is the red one, Po. Certain
versions of the talking Po doll _ or, as eBay sellers are calling
her, potty-mouthed Po, for her allegedly off-color sayings _ are
being touted as the next hot collectible.

SURVEY SAYS CHILDREN WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT SEX

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even in an era of deadly sexually transmitted
diseases, parents still are so reluctant to discuss the facts of
life with their children that they leave them wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   While almost all parents of 10- to 12-year-olds have raised such
topics as alcohol, drugs and violence, two-thirds said they have
never talked to their children about what kinds of birth control
are available and 62 percent said they have never talked about how
to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, according
to a national study released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation
and Children Now.
</P>
<P>
   When they do talk about tough issues, parents get overwhelmingly
favorable marks from their children, with more than nine out of 10
children ages 10 to 15 saying they got good information from their
parents about AIDS, sex, violence and alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But half of all 10- to 12-year-olds said they wanted more
information on how to protect themselves against the AIDS virus.
Roughly one in four said they would like to learn more about how to
handle pressure to have sex, how to know when they are ready for
sex and how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are looking for information about topics their parents
aren't talking about,'' said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family
Foundation in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Sex really stood out in the
survey. Parents seem to be having a hard time talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Children Now lobbies for policies on behalf of Children has
offices in Oalkand, Calif., Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 348 children ages 10 to 15 and 880
parents of children ages 6 to 15 was conducted between Sept. 15 and
Oct. 13, 1998, by the by Princeton Survey Research and Associates
in Princeton, N.J.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Nine people died Monday in a provincial
capital when the police opened fire on a crowd outside a mosque,
several witnesses told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings followed a new round of clashes between Muslims
and Christians in the provincial capital, Ambon, on an island about
1,400 miles east of Jakarta that has been convulsed for two months
as sectarian violence has hopscotched across this far-flung nation.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses said the police had fired at the Muslims after
they emerged from dawn prayers at a mosque on the outskirts of the
city. ``Suddenly we were attacked by police,'' one witness said.
``They were Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Police authorities did not confirm the shooting, and some
Christians in Ambon said the officers had fired only warning shots
after Muslims and Christians fought outside the mosque. Other
witnesses said a Christian mob had set fire to several houses owned
by Muslims in a nearby neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people have died in religious-based battles in
Ambon since January. Native Ambonese Christians resent Muslim
migrants who have come to their island from South Sulawesi seeking
work at a time of economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, the groups are
balanced on Ambon, with Christians concentrated in the city and
Muslims scattered in surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayhem in Ambon seems very far away, its echo has
resounded in Jakarta. Monday the chief of the armed forces
announced the formation of a special unit to respond to riots and
social unrest. The unit is to be dispatched wherever violence
erupts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to handle this problem,'' said the armed forces chief,
Gen. Wiranto, at the announcement ceremony in Jakarta. ``If not, it
could create disintegration and instability on the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a special unit to handle unrest may reflect a
recognition on the part of the Army that it has mishandled previous
demonstrations. Last November, Indonesian troops opened fire on a
student protest here, killing 16 people.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 students demonstrated Monday in Jakarta, calling on
the government to accelerate its investigation of Suharto, the
former president. The rally was peaceful, and the students traveled
to a second demonstration on a bus bedecked with banners as riot
police officers watched casually.
</P>
<P>
   Although the students have resumed almost daily demonstrations
against both Suharto and President B.J. Habibie, this no longer
feels like a city on the edge of calamitous disorder. But with the
economy still in a tailspin and the country in a political fever
with elections scheduled for June, people here warn that even the
most routine demonstration could spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   As the riots last May showed, social unrest can also skip from
one part of Indonesia to another, and officials here are watching
the unrest in Ambon carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the violence remains local, it sends a bad message about
Indonesia at a time when foreign companies and investors have begun
to venture back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a reminder to everyone that there are a lot of
potential problems in this country,'' said James W. Castle, head of
a consulting firm here. ``We have to be aware that we're in a very
delicate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders seem acutely aware of the problem. On Saturday
the government was supposed to announce the closing of as many as
40 banks, which would have led to at least 20,000 layoffs; but at
the last minute, the government delayed the announcement for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they simply needed more time to decide which
banks to close, but the prospect of thousands of newly jobless
people hitting the streets played a part in the decision.

REVOLUTION GRADUALLY IMPROVING   AS THEY WIN ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MASSA, Italy _ The Revolution are learning some painful lessons.
And, nearly a month into their preseason tour, they appear to be
making progress. They took a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Alaniya
Vladikavkaz in an exhibition match Monday, their first win against
a top-division team since arriving in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore provided the difference with a well-placed free
kick in the 36th minute after drawing a foul about 22 yards from
goal. And the Revolution finally displayed cohesion in their
defensive scheme, installed by Walter Zenga _ who chose to coach
and not play _ to keep the opposition from threatening in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   This was an encouraging performance by the Revolution, though
the reserves struggled mightily in the second half, as Alaniya
twice hit the post and Manny Motajo cleared off the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Moore-Giovanni Savarese strike combination started the
contest, but Savarese was stopped on an early foray when an
opponent grabbed him by the necklace, then departed after a
suffering a deep shin bruise in the 16th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the midfield, sparked by the aggressive play of Paulo Dos
Santos and Ivan McKinley, kept the Revolution on the attack. Jair
made a steal that led to a Mike Burns free kick, sending Moore in
alone on the goalkeeper in the 32d minute. But Yuri Mandrakian, a
17-year-old goalkeeper for the Russian Olympic team, kick-saved
Moore's low shot.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, Dos Santos led a counterattack on the right
and sent a pass across to Moore. After Moore was taken down, he
drilled a low free kick around a wall of six players from Alaniya
and two teammates just inside the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started moving toward what Walter wants from us,'' Jair
said. ``It is still going to take some time, since we've only been
together for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he wants us to stay compact, keep possession, work hard
defensively as a team. When we get the ball, we have to play our
soccer and try to score some goals, but the most important thing is
to not surrender any goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaniya, which is on a two-month offseason tour to four European
countries, won the Russian championship in 1996 and was eighth
place last season. The team includes four Brazilians, several
Georgians, plus national team players from Belarus, Lithuania, and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution showed some combative qualities and enough
composure to overcome their relative inexperience in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter wants to bring to the States the Italian mentality,''
Jair said. ``He took us to the Inter-Juventus game (Saturday night)
to help us understand the Italian way of playing. They take no
risks in the back and the midfield always stays compact.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Milan was profitable, except for the loss of Jair's
wallet to a borsaiolo (pickpocket) in the Galeria Vittorio
Emmanuele II before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jair and his midfield teammates, though, were doing most of the
stealing on the field Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm offensive-minded, so I've really had to prove I
can play defense,'' Jair said. ``It's been good for me because it
makes me a better player. I really want to play, and that means I
have to work very hard defensively. That's the only thing I'm
concentrating on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have a 2-3-2 record in the preseason. They will
travel to Sicily Friday . . . They plan to cut the roster to 22
players by Tuesday.

FOR CARTER, BEING IN THE ACTION IS JUST FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Anson Carter was ready to return to the Bruins
after missing 15 games because of a sprained ankle, he knew coach
Pat Burns wasn't going to give him spot duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a funny feeling he was going to throw me in the fire
right away,'' said Carter, smiling broadly. Burns did, and Carter,
who made his comeback against the Oilers in Edmonton Feb. 9, has
been rolling ever since. He has been back for eight games and in
the last three he has been a fixture on the top line with Jason
Allison and Dmitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Sergei Samsonov missed a pair of games with a sinus
infection, opening a spot. Carter played so well in the first two
games that when Samsonov returned Saturday against the Capitals,
Burns kept Carter up there and spotted Samsonov with other
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of weird,'' said Carter. ``I think anybody can play
with anybody and we've had to learn that because Burnsie has been
known to juggle lines every now and then. You have to be ready and
aware of what other guys can do so when you get into that
situation, you know what you're going to do the second you get the
puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally and Dmitri are pretty skilled guys. I have a pretty good
idea where to go without the puck and I think I know what I have to
do with the puck as well, so I'm not really too surprised. The
pressure is on us to perform and that sometimes brings out the best
in players, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter already had plenty of familiarity with Allison. The two
were together in Washington before coming over in the multiplayer
deal that involved Adam Oates two years ago, and they also played
in the minors together. When they were recalled to the Capitals to
be showcased, they were put on the same line. When they arrived in
Boston, they were put together.
</P>
<P>
   But last season, the chemistry among Allison, Khristich, and
Samsonov was so strong that the combination was not about to be
broken up.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with contract holdouts and various injuries forcing
Burns to juggle, Carter ended up with Allison out of necessity and
is glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been a couple of games, but I know at the same time
that Sammy is breathing down my neck because he wants to get back
in his spot,'' said Carter. ``Competition brings out the best in
players so I want to try to play the best I can to try to stay
there and help the team as much as possible. I know Sammy's working
his butt off to try to get back on the line, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't think anyone is concerned with who is
playing on what line. The main thing is to make sure we're bringing
our A game to the table and we're winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't figure it would be him to take Samsonov's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be on that line,'' he said. ``I thought
myself, Joe (Thornton) and (Cameron Mann) had a pretty good thing
going on the second line so it has been a surprise that I moved up
so quickly to the first line. But we're all just trying to make
sure we play our best games because we can't afford any setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   If Samsonov's gift is his amazing ability to dangle, then Carter
is more of a strength player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my job is to get in on the forecheck and try to create
loose pucks,'' he said. ``I'm one of the stronger guys on the team
and I can use that strength to my advantage down low holding on to
pucks and making plays. Dmitri is smart and strong and Ally has a
lot of patience with the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three contests, the top line has a combined 7 goals
and 16 points. Carter said there's still room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first period of the Washington game, we struggled as a
line,'' he said. ``I know I wasn't going. I was a little bit slow
getting to loose pucks and that can't happen on our line. I have to
get in there and create some havoc. So when Burnsie came in yelling
and screaming, I took it personally because I knew I wasn't going
and I had to get my butt in gear.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov played just nine shifts (7 minutes 29 seconds of ice
time) against the Capitals and appeared to be still bothered by the
effects of the infection. ``I'm feeling better,'' he said after
Monday's workout. ``Today was probably my best day. I felt pretty
good in practice. I was able to work out 100 percent. It's not an
injury where you can play through it. You just take your pills and
wait. But I feel much more alive. I don't have any more symptoms.
My first game back was a little different than my usual games. You
could tell I was having sinus problems, but it's getting better
each day.'' One noticeable difference is Samsonov's color; when he
was sick, he was pale as a ghost. ``I know,'' he said. ``I looked
like custard.'' . . . Samsonov and Allison are profiled on ``Be A
Player, The Hockey Show,'' on ESPN2 Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. The show
will be replayed Wednesday on the same channel at 1 a.m. . . . Ray
Bourque was given Monday off, and defenseman Grant Ledyard was off
skates because of a sore knee. He is listed as day to day. Steve
Heinze also missed practice in suburban Wilmington because of
illness.

 &HT;    ACC could be humbled by upstart SEC teams in NCAA brackets
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``It's incomprehensible,'' Wake Forest's Dave Odom
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine it,'' Duke's Mike Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be be totally unbelievable,'' Maryland's Gary
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   What has these ACC coaches so indignant? The growing possiblity
that their tradition-rich conference might get only three
invitations when the 64-team NCAA Tournament Field is announced
Sunday (6:30 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   It's ``On the Bubble'' time, when writers and announcers wear
out that term for teams that might or might not be good enough to
get one of the 34 at-large berths once the nine-member NCAA
selection committee finishes crunching the numbers in Kansas City.
Some of these ``bubble teams'' enter this week knowing that they
have to win one or two games in their conference tournaments just
to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are nervous as the ACC prepares to gather in
Charlotte for its 46th annual tournamen. Since the NCAA field went
to 64 teams in 1985, the ACC has never failed to get at least four
teams in the tournament. Only once, 1995, has it failed to get five
teams in.
</P>
<P>
   But the ACC has been a top-heavy league in 1999, dominated by
No. 1 Duke and No. 5 Maryland, which are a combined 27-1 against
the rest of the conference. Throw in North Carolina (22-8), which
is No. 9 in the current Ratings Percentage Index, and the bottom
two-thirds of the ACC is 3-33 against the big three.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no other team in the ACC has a winning record in
the conference and every team but Wake Forest (7-9), is four games
below .500 or worse. Since 1984, 11 ACC teams have made the NCAA
field with losing conference records but only one (Florida State,
1998) was 6-10. That's why the ACC is a bit antsy.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, however, think that the strength at the top of the
ACC should help, not hurt the league's chances of getting four
teams. Several coaches, in fact, believe the conference deserves
five teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just do the math,'' Krzyzewski said. ``You play six of your
games against Top 10 teams. If you lose those, you have to win
eight of your last 10 games just to go .500. That's really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACC is still the No. 2 ranked conference in the country
behind the Big Ten and that should count for something, Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the only league in the country that plays a
complete round-robin schedule and then a conference tournament,''
said Odom. ``We're doing the things the NCAA asks us to do. We're a
total conference that takes on all challengers. If that's not good
enough, then maybe we have to re-evaluate how we're scheduling and
do some things that other conferences are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus is that if Wake Forest can beat N.C. State
again in Friday's second round of the ACC Tournament, the Deacons
probably will get into the field as the fourth ACC team. They do
have an 85-72 win over Maryland on Jan. 31 when the Terps were No.
4.
</P>
<P>
   But beating N.C. State for the second time in less than a week
won't be easy. The Deacons thumped the Wolfpack 74-45 in its
regular-season finale Sunday in Winston-Salem. And if N.C. State
wins Friday's game, it could get dicey. Before Sunday's game, the
Wolfpack (17-12) had an RPI rating of 53 and only one win over a
Top 25 team (Oklahoma on Dec. 23). Oklahoma is now 19-9 and has an
RPI rating of 43.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not so nerve-wracking over in the SEC, where five
teams apparently have clinched tournament bids. Four of the five
already have 20 wins and Florida (19-7) could get to 20 by beating
LSU in the first round of the SEC Tournament on Thursday. The
Gators also have respectable RPI of 29.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC still thinks it can get six in the tournament, something
it has not done since 1987. Its best bet is Mississippi, which is
18-11, although three of those wins came against non-Division I
teams and won't be counted by the committee. But Mississippi is
rated No. 19 in strength of schedule and a pair of wins against
Arkansas. The Rebels play South Carolina in the first round of the
SEC Tournament. If they lose in the second round to Kentucky, 19-12
just might be good enough to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State (17-11) appears to be a long shot with an RPI
of 102 and a No. 142 strength of schedule.

 &HT;    International Soccer notes: Ronaldo probably out of action
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports from Italy aren't giving a favorable prognosis to Inter
Milan and star player Ronaldo for Wednesday's key European
Champions' League clash at Manchester United (2:30 p.m., live,
ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   The Champions' League, an annual tournament during the European
domestic season, features the continent's top clubs and is the most
widely followed soccer event in the world after the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Ronaldo, a Brazilian who has played only six full
matches for Inter this season because of recurring knee problems,
hasn't tempered a bit following his mysterious illness before
Brazil lost to France in the World Cup final in July.
</P>
<P>
   A Inter club official said it is ``99 percent certain'' Ronaldo
will not play, and Roberto Baggio and Ivan Zamorano also have been
banged up in recent games. The contest has other World Cup
overtones. Manchester's David Beckham and Diego Simeone of Inter
will meet for the first time since their confrontation during the
England-Argentina second-round match in France. Beckham, who is
engaged to Spice Girl Victoria Adams, received a red card after
lightly kicking Simeone, who fell to the ground in an exaggerated
fashion. Playing a man short, England was eliminated.

   French pretty-boy David Ginola, more famous for tossing his
brunet locks in a shampoo commercial than anything he's done on the

great Johan Cruyff, a master of hyperbole, is calling him
``probably the most exciting player in the world.'' . . . Aston
Villa, which led the Premier League for most of the first half of
the season, is 13 points behind Manchester United after a 4-1 loss
to lowly Coventry City on Saturday. . . .Chelsea midfielder Graeme
Le Saux could face disciplinary action after punching Liverpool's
Robbie Fowler hard to the ground in a 2-1 win by the London side.
Le Saux was not called for a foul because the referee did not see

who has been out with the flu, has been cleared to play. . . .

Mallorca drew 1-1 with 10-man and cellar-dwelling Tenerife. . . .
John Toshack's second stint as Real Madrid coach got off to a bad
start Friday in a 3-2 loss to Real Betis. Toshack, who guided
Madrid in the early 1990s, was summoned after Guus Hiddink got axed
last week with the club in seventh place. . . . Atletico Madrid's

   Players for Brazilian club Santos, which Pele elevated to fame,
are miffed at allegations that they're under orders to commit

matches in the Rio-Sao Paulo league. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has
admitted that the tactics often are deliberate: ``I'm stupid
because I tell the truth.'' . . . Troubled Colombian striker
Faustino Asprilla has been warned by his country's soccer
federation to keep his mouth shut. Asprilla, who scored two goals
in a 3-3 friendly draw with Germany in Fort Lauderdale last week,
complained that he had to fly economy class to Italy to be in

Chivas of Guadalajara has started slowly in the winter (Invierno)
league, losing 2-1 to Morelia on Sunday. Chivas is in third place
in Group A. . . . Players in Argentina's first division delayed the

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With their black uniforms and barely disguised
swastikas, the followers of Alexander Barkashov's Russian National
Unity party are hard to miss, which is one reason their march
through a Moscow neighborhood a few weeks ago attracted so much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, shouting out ``Glory to Russia!'' with stiff-armed
salutes, numbered no more than 200, hardly a show of strength in a
city of 10 million. But for Barkashov, 45, a pony-tailed karate
expert and veteran of an earlier extremely nationalist movement,
just showing up was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to prove his legal rights,'' noted Vladimir
Bondarenko, deputy editor of the newspaper Zavtra, which provides
ideological support for Barkashov and other Russian supremacists,
``that is to say, his right to walk down the sidewalks, to go where
he wants, when he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   These are strange times in Russia where, seven years after the
collapse of communism, hopes for lasting stability seem more
elusive than ever. Elections _ first to the Parliament, then to the
presidency _ are still months away, but, ready or not, the country
is already stricken by pre-election nerves that flare up in the
press, on television and sometimes on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this jumpy atmosphere that the ``barkashovtsi'' made
their move _ and it was in this atmosphere that their Sunday outing
stirred a noisy national debate: politicians and prosecutors are
once again arguing over how to deal with Russia's peculiar,
virulent brand of nationalist socialism, with its deep strains of
anti-Semitism and its glaring antagonism to the West.
</P>
<P>
   How dangerous a threat is posed by Russia's `neo-fascism' is one
of the main questions under debate. It is not difficult to make a
comparison between Russia today and pre-Hitler Germany _ a
collapsed economy, an electorate that feels bitter and betrayed, a
weak central government. Poll takers do not have to look too far or
too deep to find a widespread yearning for an ``iron hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the scare talk, Russia's neo-fascist groups are
still small and marginal. Some experts maintain that they are
creatures of the old KGB, while others argue conspiratorially that
they are used by the authorities to whip up pre-election anxieties
that will drive voters back into the embrace of the political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You notice they make no noise until the pre-election period,
when people in power try to use them for their own ends,'' said
Oleg Vakulovsky, a television documentary film maker who has become
an expert on Russian fascist groups. ``The authorities have done
more to boost their popularity than their own swastikas do. But
their popularity takes on a life of its own, like a snowball.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the themes that now unite extreme nationalists and alarm
liberal Russians is a recurrence of anti-Semitism. According to
Bondarenko, it is no more and no less than a popular expression of
the humiliation of Russian national feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Estonians, Russians are the symbol of occupation,'' said
Bondarenko, expanding on one of his newspaper's favorite subjects.
``Here in Russia, Jews have power over finances, information and
the circles that surround the president. So for millions of
Russians, Jews are a symbol of their humiliation. You cannot stomp
on national feelings for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   With their open attacks on Jews, Russia's hardcore nationalists,
including those in the mainstream Communist Party, have served up a
challenge to Russia's democratic politicians _ a challenge that so
far has been answered only feebly, some say disgracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has taken Barkashov's
grandstanding as a personal affront and is trying to have the
Russian National Unity party banned from the city. Elsewhere,
however, attempts to put a stop to the overt racism have mostly
ended in bureaucratic quagmires, with groups of ``experts''
assigned to ``study'' the legal definition of ``political
extremism.''

ACADEMY HONORS INVENTIVE PEOPLE OF MOVIE BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Wow, this is geek heaven,'' remarked Dr.
Douglas R. Roble upon receiving his certificate at the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Scientific and Technical Awards,
held Saturday evening at the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel. It may
not be the glitzy, internationally televised Academy Awards, but to
the 80-plus men (and no women, unfortunately) who received
commendations for important behind-the-scenes inventions, this was
the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winners' products have been used on such huge hit
films as ``Titanic'' and ``Back to the Future II,'' they have a
sense of humor about their relatively obscure contributions to
filmmaking. The program, hosted by actress Anne Heche, was laced
with laughs.
</P>
<P>
   At what other awards show will you see a video of the inventor
of the Shock Block, Stephen J. Kay, demonstrating the product by
standing barefoot in an aquarium and dropping a live light fixture
into it? That video was followed, as a joke, by a clip from a James
Bond movie where Bond electrocutes a villain by knocking a lamp
into the water-filled bathtub he's fallen into.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one Academy Award of Merit given to
editing equipment maker Avid Technology, the awards were in the
form of certificates or plaques rather than the familiar Oscar
statuette. That mattered little to the men whose creations are used
for such things as cleaning film, visual special effects and
blocking electric shocks when lights are accidentally submerged in
water.
</P>
<P>
   Many proudly brought their families to the ceremony and
commented on their amazement at receiving an award from the
academy. In fact, the event was the best-attended in the history of
the technical awards, with about 700 people there.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the winners are still active way behind the scenes in
the film industry, but a few have moved on to other fields where
they're applying their scientific expertise. Highlighting this _
and the crossover between high-tech Hollywood and other
technology-based businesses _ Bala S. Manian, who shared an award
for developing a laser film recording process, is now a Silicon
Valley entrepreneur specializing in medical applications for
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Manian referred to this laser
technology being used to help patients with conditions from cancer
to AIDS. Most speeches were brief and to the point: This was not a
show where anyone proclaimed himself King of the World or asked the
audience to send good thoughts to Tibet. This was working
Hollywood, people without whom we wouldn't have the striking images
and sounds that continue to keep Los Angeles the dominant film
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Heche valiantly made it through dozens of
technical, detailed descriptions of winners' inventions with the
help of a script and a TelePrompTer. Her efforts were greatly
appreciated by those in attendance, who gave the actress a warm
round of applause after she rejoined her significant other, Ellen
DeGeneres, in the audience at the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual. In her introductory remarks, Heche
proclaimed, ``I am so thrilled to be in a room full of people who
can honestly say that they know what they're doing in this
business.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

MOSCOW: ``political extremism.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the debate heats up, so does the language of hate. In Moscow,
the Russian National Unity followers are now lying low, but on
television, reports of anti-Semitic statements _ and excuses for
anti-Semitic statements _ have become practically commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian National Unity party may not be the biggest danger;
by employing Nazi symbols, it has relegated itself to the political
fringe in a country that lost millions of lives in the war against
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The party _ mostly young men in their 20s and 30s, many employed
in sport clubs and security firms _ has its strongholds,
particularly in the Stavropol region along Russia's border with the
unruly Caucasus. But membership, even in this season of deep
political disillusionment, does not exceed 100,000, by the party's
own boastful estimate.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, even more flamboyant groups, of which the
noisiest is Eduard Limonov's Nationalist Bolsheviks, who recently
interrupted a political gathering of Russia's fast-dwindling
liberal elite with chants of ``Stalin! Gulag! Beria!''
</P>
<P>
   Such shock tactics have earned Limonov, a writer and former
emigre, a reputation as an outrageous star of political theater.
But his followers _ almost of all of them young students, not yet
in their 20s _ number no more than 6,000, and his victories are
measured by media exposure, not by the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing than all the extreme nationalist groups (which,
as Russian nationalists like to point out, are less armed or
violent than America's own militias) is the nationalist wing of the
Communist Party, headed by Gen. Albert Makashov.
</P>
<P>
   His rabid anti-Semitism has become increasingly blatant and
vicious, and to date it is still unchecked. As he stumps the
country, sometimes with Viktor Ilyukhin, a fellow Communist and
chairman of a parliamentary committee, Makashov seems to have no
other message than an appeal to a centuries-old Russian instinct to
blame Jews for everything.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, let loose with another tirade, this time to an
enthusiastic gathering of Cossacks in southern Russia. ``So, the
word `anti-Semite' is illegal, et cetera, et cetera,'' Makashov
shouted into a microphone. ``Yet everything done for the good of
the people is legal. The people are always right. We will remain
anti-Semites, and we must triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   The Makashov strategy seems to confirm the view that the
Communist Party, which can claim the sympathy of about one-third of
the electorate, plans to divide like an amoeba in the December
parliamentary elections. In this view, an extreme wing, led by
Makashov and Ilyukhin, would make an open pitch for hardline,
anti-Semitic nationalists, reaching out for nationalist protest
votes that in 1993 went to Vladimir Zhirinovsky and in 1996 to Gen.
Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   By the calculations of Bondarenko, the editor, the Makashov wing
could get as much as 15 percent of the vote. Together with the rest
of the Communist Party, which may split further between hardline
Marxists and more moderate socialists, the extreme nationalists
could patch together a coalition that could lure more than 50
percent of the members of parliament, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Limonov is more dubious about the nationalists' chances, citing
the pitiful showing of Yuri Vlasov, an Olympic weight-lifting
champion and hardcore nationalist who won only 220,000 votes in the
1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sure we have popular anti-Semitism, but when it comes to
elections, people prefer to be very, very cautious and not vote for
radicals,'' said Limonov, whose party is one of the few nationalist
groups that tries to steer clear of racist name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Polls on the subject are often contradictory. One taken in
January showed 43 percent supporting ``Russia for Russians,'' an
ambiguous slogan in a country that has more than 100 nationalities.
But another recent poll found that 83 percent considered the
anti-Semitic statements of Makashov and his ilk to be
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The various nationalist movements draw on different parts of the
past for inspiration _ some looking to Czarist times, others to the
perceived glory of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   But the movements themselves have also intertwined. Barkashov,
for instance, came from Pamyat, a late Soviet-era nationalist
organization that sank from sight after one leader was sent to
prison for shouting out anti-Semitic slogans at a literary
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barkashov and Makashov became symbols of violent opposition
to President Boris Yeltsin in 1993 when they helped lead an
abortive coup that ended with Yeltsin's order to shell the Russian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Limonov sees his movement, which he says has surged in
membership since the financial crisis hit last August, as more
radical, certainly more youth-oriented than the others, and drawing
on symbols of Russian power _ like Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans worship George Washington, so why should we not
worship Stalin?'' he asked. ``I am sure if you looked into
Washington's biography, you would find unpleasant moments, too.
Stalin is our national hero; he was the head of our state at its
most powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Limonov rejects attempts to paint his followers as dangerous
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very sad,'' he said. ``We are widely accused of being
extremists while those big bosses _ Makashov and Ilyukhin _ are
sitting quietly in their seats in the Parliament. My question is:
why aren't they being prosecuted for not behaving properly?''

 &HT;    2 bottlers in France being sold to CCE
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In its first major acquisition of the year, Coca-Cola
Enterprises is buying two bottling operations in southern France
for about $100 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The move will allow Atlanta-based CCE, the world's largest soft
drink bottler, to distribute Coca-Cola drinks in all of France,
except on the island of Corsica.
</P>
<P>
   CCE said Monday it has signed a letter of intent to purchase the
bottling operations of Sud Boissons SA and Societe Boissons
Gazeuses de la Cote d'Azur. The two bottlers, owned by the Daurella
family, had combined operating revenue of $70 million last year,
selling 18 million cases of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we first entered the French market in 1996, we have
increased per-capita consumption almost 30 percent,'' Henry
Schimberg, CCE's president and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``We believe these new territories offer the same
opportunity to generate investment returns and increase the
shareholder value that we found in the rest of France.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's trading, CCE's stock closed at $31.56 1/4, up 56 1/4
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co., which owns 43 percent of CCE and has been trying
to expand its reach in France, has been consolidating its bottling
among fewer companies around the world, so it can more effectively
control its expansion. CCE already is the sole licensed bottler for
Coca-Cola products in Belgium, Great Britain, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to appropriate
expansion in Western Europe,'' Schimberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contiguous acquisitions typically offer some operating and
purchasing efficiencies,'' added CCE spokeswoman Laura Brightwell
Asman. Last year, CCE spent more than $2 billion to buy a dozen
U.S. bottling operations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal, which will be completely financed by issuing
debt, is subject to regulatory and board approval.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to close by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Coca-Cola Co. has yet to submit to the French
government a revised offer for Pernod Ricard SA's Orangina beverage
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year French officials rejected Coca-Cola's initial $885
million bid after rival Pepsico Inc. complained the acquisition of
Orangina, which also distributes Pepsi products in France, would
give Coke too much power and squeeze Pepsi out of the market.

 &HT;    Lockheed workers set to strike if negotiations break down
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pat Stripling remembers the last strike at the
Lockheed Martin Corp. plant in Marietta, Ga. It happened in 1977
and lasted three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked the picket line with my dad,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stripling, who followed her father into a career at the
plant, is ready to do it again, unless Machinists union leaders and
management come up with a better contract than the one rejected by
workers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent appears to have stemmed more from job security, benefits
and workplace issues than from 3 percent annual raises offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The icing on the cake looked good,'' Stripling said of the
deal, rejected by a 68 percent vote. ``The ingredients were bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the vote, union leaders on Monday sent a five-day
strike notice to plant management. That could trigger a walkout
next week by the union, which represents 4,200 of the plant's 9,200
employees.
</P>
<P>
   A strike at Cobb County's largest private employer, however, can
still be averted if the two sides quickly re-enter negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to sit down and talk with them,'' said Susan
Miles, a company spokeswoman. ``We probably won't know anything
about (a timetable) for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   If talks resume and continue after the five-day strike notice
expires, the union would then have the option of calling a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Bruce, an official at Machinists Local 709, said if talks
resume the union ``will do everything we can to keep people at work
until we get another proposal from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders had endorsed the tentative three-year deal, citing
the pay raises and a boost in retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Stripling said a plan to combine 24 job classifications into
nine was seen as a way to cut jobs. Another controversial item was
a switch to 10-hour-a-day, four-day workweeks for some employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of younger workers that would have day care
problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stripling also said the retirement boost was seen as too meager,
and workers were leery of a tougher attendance policy because the
current policy hasn't been evenly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Plant management is under pressure to boost productivity to
offset high costs and slow sales for the C-130J, an update of the
venerable airlifter built there since the 1950s. In January 280
workers, both union and nonunion, were laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said the labor unrest so far hasn't affected operations at
the plant, which also leads development of the F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it comes at a sensitive time, as Lockheed Martin seeks to
persuade the Air Force to step up C-130J orders and grapples with
cost problems in the F-22 program.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract was reached last month in negotiations
that also included Machinists locals at Lockheed Martin plants in
Sunnyvale and Palmdale, Calif. Workers at the Palmdale plant also
rejected the deal, while it was ratified at Sunnyvale.

``GRASSROOTS'' PUSH FOR BUSH CAREFULLY CRAFTED AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush kicked off the 76th
session of the Texas Legislature last month, he said there was too
much to do here to be crisscrossing the country in pursuit of a
2000 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   He never said he wouldn't bring the country to him.
</P>
<P>
   Without having to leave home, Bush has methodically assembled a
team of likely advisers, collected commitments from deep-pocketed
contributors and hosted delegations from several key states, all
urging him to run.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is a modern version of the ``front porch''
campaign that former Ohio Gov. William McKinley conducted in his
successful White House race more than 100 years ago _ but Bush is
using the back yard of the Texas Governor's Mansion as the setting
for some of his political pep rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example was the pilgrimage to Austin last week by
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who grew up in Fort Worth, and U.S. Rep.
Scott McInnis, R-Colo. Flanking the governor, they urged Bush to
run and predicted he'll win if he does.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, repeating what Bush aides have been saying for weeks,
denied there has been any orchestration of the ``Draft Bush''
movement that has gained ground among Republicans in Congress and
in a growing number of statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request is not coming from Texas. The request is coming
from the other direction,'' McInnis said. Owens added: ``He didn't
call us. We made the call.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush can count on loyal support and money without
ever picking up the phone, thanks to an extensive network of
friends and former associates of his father who are eager for him
to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews, letters and published reports suggest that the
seeds of the ``grassroots'' movement to get Bush into the
presidential race were carefully planted long ago _ largely by Karl
Rove, the architect of Bush's political strategy and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rove acknowledged coordinating the visits, but said a snowball
effect has taken hold. Now, states are cold-calling with offers to
send petitions and delegations to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from people saying we've got one, do we send
it to you?'' Rove said.
___
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, Bush's political office in Texas issued the
following news release: ``As a courtesy, we are forwarding two
press releases issued in South Carolina ... and New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reported that sizable numbers of GOP legislators in those
states were calling on Bush to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Described as an isolated, spontaneous outburst of support, the
effort to round up support in New Mexico was, in fact, carefully
coordinated with Rove from Austin, according to the leader of the
effort there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (Rove) and said, `If you guys want to do something
... give me a call, I'm ready to help,' '' said Colin McMillan, a
former assistant secretary of defense under President Bush. ``I
asked him what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rove) said, `Well, you might consider doing this,' ''
McMillan added, referring to the draft movement that snared more
than three-quarters of the Republicans in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, fax machines in Austin were whirring with the news
release from McMillan and the one from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one week later, Alabama weighed in, with Attorney
General Bill Pryor _ another Rove client and avowed Bush fan _
leading the charge. Pryor said he was inspired by what other states
were doing, and decided to ``follow the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he needed no encouragement from Rove, Pryor said
he has talked with the consultant about Bush, and he cited a kind
letter from the governor that he says compelled him to ``do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dated Jan. 29, the letter reads, in part: ``Karl told me of your
kind words of encouragement to run for President. If I decide to
seek higher office, I would very much appreciate your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would decide by spring, Bush asked Pryor to ``keep
your powder dry until then.''
___
</P>
<P>
   If Bush seems eager to keep in touch with potential supporters,
he is by no means alone.
</P>
<P>
   A year before he helped organize a group of legislators to jump
on the ``Draft Bush'' bandwagon, Iowa farmer Thurman Gaskill
remembers the excitement he felt after receiving a message from
another George Bush _ the former president _ congratulating him on
his election to a Senate seat there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left a message on my machine,'' said Gaskill. ``It blew my
mind.'' Asked if he thought Bush was trying to woo him on behalf of
his son, Gaskill described the former president as a proud father
who would do anything ``appropriate to assist him in the political
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaskill is typical of the legislators who are helping organize
the nascent Bush 2000 campaign in the American heartland, and his
participation underscores the formidable network waiting to be put
into motion.
</P>
<P>
   His ties to the former president go back to 1980, when he
organized Farmers for Bush in the key state, which holds the
nation's first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gaskill and fellow farmer Tom Dorr, also a former Bush
political activist, who helped round up support among Republicans
in the Iowa Legislature for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The two also helped put together a trip to Austin to visit with
Bush and urge him to get into the race. Dorr said Bush officials
did not ``engineer it in any stretch of the imagination,'' and
described the group as ``just a bunch of old country boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Those country boys were nevertheless able to hitch a ride to
Austin on corporate jets provided by two major Republican
contributors in Des Moines _ trucking magnate John Ruan, head of
Ruan Transportation, and insurance baron Gerald Kirke, co-founder
of the firm Kirke Van Orsdel.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Ruan or his spokesman were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But in a measure of the insular and ironic world of politics, it
was Kirke's firm that provided corporate jet rides to John Sununu _
President Bush's former chief of staff _ after he was caught using
military planes for personal and political trips in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Another irony: Kirke was meeting with former Vice President Dan
Quayle, an announced presidential candidate, on the very day he
lent his plane to the Iowa legislators who came to Texas to visit
Bush. (He said the lawmakers reimbursed him for the flight, as Iowa
law requires).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested for them to get down there to find out what
this is all about,'' Kirke said, adding that he was asked by a
lobbyist to arrange the trip. ``I want to see what George Bush
stands for. I want to see him come out and be questioned.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas: xxx be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has publicly expressed a reluctance to get into the
race, in part because his twin teen-age daughters are skittish
about a national campaign, his state political operation has been
regularly mailing video updates to supporters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as August, four months before his re-election as
governor, Bush mailed videos to out-of-state contributors and
supporters, said Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for the Bush political
office. Four have gone out so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes out to donors of $500 and up, and supporters who have
expressed an interest in the governor's activities,'' she said.
``It's probably 90 percent donors _ donors and interested
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Containing short political documentaries, campaign ads and plain
news footage, the tapes are the work of Austin media consultant
Mark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The news clips on the tapes contain multiple references to
Bush's possible entry into the 2000 presidential race. McKinnon's
combination of heroic music, slow motion and a variety of film
formats _ including grainy 8mm clips from an old home movie camera
_ give the longer tribute pieces an unmistakable documentary feel.
___
</P>
<P>
   By bringing the early ``draft'' campaign to Austin, and mailing
out videos beyond, Bush has been able to line up support from the
comfort of his own mansion while honoring his commitment to work
hard on Texas issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say he'll form a presidential ``exploratory'' committee
within two weeks, and Bush has lined up a team of advisers. And
late Friday, Bush officials announced that delegations from three
more states were coming to visit.

   In 1896, William McKinley's political man, Mark Hanna, carefully
orchestrated a front porch campaign that brought thousands of
supporters to Canton, Ohio, avoiding a national tour that he
thought ``demeaned the office,'' according to a 1996 issue of
History Today.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bush camp is using ``a combination of William
McKinley's campaign and the (draft) Colin Powell campaign that
never was,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences between 1896 and 2000 are as numerous as
the similarities, the parallels are not lost on Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a recent public appearance to describe a scenario
in which Republicans could retake the White House after eight years
of Bill Clinton, Rove effortlessly drifted back over 100 years for
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1896, not 1998,'' Rove said. ``All the guys from the
Civil War are dying off. ... There's a new economy rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forwarding to modern America, Rove says the ``governing
paradigm of the Cold War is gone ... a generation of leadership is
passing away ... there's a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Bush is the candidate to seize the moment, and
become the candidate of change, is another question. While he is
able to capitalize both on his outsider status and his family's
deep political connections, that may not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is it going to be before his Republican opponents
and/or Al Gore say, `Remember George Bush senior? Do you really
want to go back to those tragic, depressing times?' '' asked
Sabato, author of a book about end-of-century politics called
Toward the Millennium. ``His father is his greatest asset and his
heaviest burden.''

<P>
   OLNEY, Texas _ When Faryion Wardrip showed up in Olney a year
ago wearing an electronic monitoring device on his ankle, residents
didn't ask any questions. They took him at his word when he said he
had been paroled after he was convicted of accidentally killing a
woman in an automobile accident and had paid his debt to society.
What Wardrip didn't tell folks in this town 93 miles northwest of
Fort Worth was that he had been convicted of murder. And two weeks
ago, police said he has admitted killing three other women _
including one in Fort Worth _ more than a decade ago. By BILL

``GRASSROOTS'' PUSH FOR BUSH CAREFULLY CRAFTED AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush kicked off the 76th
session of the Texas Legislature last month, he said there was too
much to do here to be crisscrossing the country in pursuit of a
2000 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   He never said he wouldn't bring the country to him.
</P>
<P>
   Without having to leave home, Bush has methodically assembled a
team of likely advisers, collected commitments from deep-pocketed
contributors and hosted delegations from several key states, all
urging him to run.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is a modern version of the ``front porch''
campaign that former Ohio Gov. William McKinley conducted in his
successful White House race more than 100 years ago _ but Bush is
using the back yard of the Texas Governor's Mansion as the setting
for some of his political pep rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example was the pilgrimage to Austin last week by
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who grew up in Fort Worth, and U.S. Rep.
Scott McInnis, R-Colo. Flanking the governor, they urged Bush to
run and predicted he'll win if he does.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, repeating what Bush aides have been saying for weeks,
denied there has been any orchestration of the ``Draft Bush''
movement that has gained ground among Republicans in Congress and
in a growing number of statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request is not coming from Texas. The request is coming
from the other direction,'' McInnis said. Owens added: ``He didn't
call us. We made the call.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush can count on loyal support and money without
ever picking up the phone, thanks to an extensive network of
friends and former associates of his father who are eager for him
to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews, letters and published reports suggest that the
seeds of the ``grassroots'' movement to get Bush into the
presidential race were carefully planted long ago _ largely by Karl
Rove, the architect of Bush's political strategy and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rove acknowledged coordinating the visits, but said a snowball
effect has taken hold. Now, states are cold-calling with offers to
send petitions and delegations to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from people saying we've got one, do we send
it to you?'' Rove said.
___
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, Bush's political office in Texas issued the
following news release: ``As a courtesy, we are forwarding two
press releases issued in South Carolina ... and New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reported that sizable numbers of GOP legislators in those
states were calling on Bush to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Described as an isolated, spontaneous outburst of support, the
effort to round up support in New Mexico was, in fact, carefully
coordinated with Rove from Austin, according to the leader of the
effort there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (Rove) and said, `If you guys want to do something
... give me a call, I'm ready to help,' '' said Colin McMillan, a
former assistant secretary of defense under President Bush. ``I
asked him what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rove) said, `Well, you might consider doing this,' ''
McMillan added, referring to the draft movement that snared more
than three-quarters of the Republicans in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, fax machines in Austin were whirring with the news
release from McMillan and the one from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one week later, Alabama weighed in, with Attorney
General Bill Pryor _ another Rove client and avowed Bush fan _
leading the charge. Pryor said he was inspired by what other states
were doing, and decided to ``follow the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he needed no encouragement from Rove, Pryor said
he has talked with the consultant about Bush, and he cited a kind
letter from the governor that he says compelled him to ``do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dated Jan. 29, the letter reads, in part: ``Karl told me of your
kind words of encouragement to run for President. If I decide to
seek higher office, I would very much appreciate your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would decide by spring, Bush asked Pryor to ``keep
your powder dry until then.''
___
</P>
<P>
   If Bush seems eager to keep in touch with potential supporters,
he is by no means alone.
</P>
<P>
   A year before he helped organize a group of legislators to jump
on the ``Draft Bush'' bandwagon, Iowa farmer Thurman Gaskill
remembers the excitement he felt after receiving a message from
another George Bush _ the former president _ congratulating him on
his election to a Senate seat there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left a message on my machine,'' said Gaskill. ``It blew my
mind.'' Asked if he thought Bush was trying to woo him on behalf of
his son, Gaskill described the former president as a proud father
who would do anything ``appropriate to assist him in the political
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaskill is typical of the legislators who are helping organize
the nascent Bush 2000 campaign in the American heartland, and his
participation underscores the formidable network waiting to be put
into motion.
</P>
<P>
   His ties to the former president go back to 1980, when he
organized Farmers for Bush in the key state, which holds the
nation's first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gaskill and fellow farmer Tom Dorr, also a former Bush
political activist, who helped round up support among Republicans
in the Iowa Legislature for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The two also helped put together a trip to Austin to visit with
Bush and urge him to get into the race. Dorr said Bush officials
did not ``engineer it in any stretch of the imagination,'' and
described the group as ``just a bunch of old country boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Those country boys were nevertheless able to hitch a ride to
Austin on corporate jets provided by two major Republican
contributors in Des Moines _ trucking magnate John Ruan, head of
Ruan Transportation, and insurance baron Gerald Kirke, co-founder
of the firm Kirke Van Orsdel.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Ruan or his spokesman were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But in a measure of the insular and ironic world of politics, it
was Kirke's firm that provided corporate jet rides to John Sununu _
President Bush's former chief of staff _ after he was caught using
military planes for personal and political trips in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Another irony: Kirke was meeting with former Vice President Dan
Quayle, an announced presidential candidate, on the very day he
lent his plane to the Iowa legislators who came to Texas to visit
Bush. (He said the lawmakers reimbursed him for the flight, as Iowa
law requires).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested for them to get down there to find out what
this is all about,'' Kirke said, adding that he was asked by a
lobbyist to arrange the trip. ``I want to see what George Bush
stands for. I want to see him come out and be questioned.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has publicly expressed a reluctance to get into the
race, in part because his twin teen-age daughters are skittish
about a national campaign, his state political operation has been
regularly mailing video updates to supporters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as August, four months before his re-election as
governor, Bush mailed videos to out-of-state contributors and
supporters, said Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for the Bush political
office. Four have gone out so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes out to donors of $500 and up, and supporters who have
expressed an interest in the governor's activities,'' she said.
``It's probably 90 percent donors _ donors and interested
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Containing short political documentaries, campaign ads and plain
news footage, the tapes are the work of Austin media consultant
Mark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The news clips on the tapes contain multiple references to
Bush's possible entry into the 2000 presidential race. McKinnon's
combination of heroic music, slow motion and a variety of film
formats _ including grainy 8mm clips from an old home movie camera
_ give the longer tribute pieces an unmistakable documentary feel.

</P>
<P>
   By bringing the early ``draft'' campaign to Austin, and mailing
out videos beyond, Bush has been able to line up support from the
comfort of his own mansion while honoring his commitment to work
hard on Texas issues.
</P>
<P>

Quayle, an announced presidential candidate, on the very day he
lent his plane to the Iowa legislators who came to Texas to visit
Bush. (He said the lawmakers reimbursed him for the flight, as Iowa
law requires).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested for them to get down there to find out what
this is all about,'' Kirke said, adding that he was asked by a
lobbyist to arrange the trip. ``I want to see what George Bush
stands for. I want to see him come out and be questioned.''

<P>
   While Bush has publicly expressed a reluctance to get into the
race, in part because his twin teen-age daughters are skittish
about a national campaign, his state political operation has been
regularly mailing video updates to supporters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as August, four months before his re-election as
governor, Bush mailed videos to out-of-state contributors and
supporters, said Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for the Bush political
office. Four have gone out so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes out to donors of $500 and up, and supporters who have
expressed an interest in the governor's activities,'' she said.
``It's probably 90 percent donors _ donors and interested
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Containing short political documentaries, campaign ads and plain
news footage, the tapes are the work of Austin media consultant
Mark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The news clips on the tapes contain multiple references to
Bush's possible entry into the 2000 presidential race. McKinnon's
combination of heroic music, slow motion and a variety of film
formats _ including grainy 8mm clips from an old home movie camera
_ give the longer tribute pieces an unmistakable documentary feel.

</P>
<P>
   By bringing the early ``draft'' campaign to Austin, and mailing
out videos beyond, Bush has been able to line up support from the
comfort of his own mansion while honoring his commitment to work
hard on Texas issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say he'll form a presidential ``exploratory'' committee
within two weeks, and Bush has lined up a team of advisers. And
late Friday, Bush officials announced that delegations from three
more states were coming to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, William McKinley's political man, Mark Hanna, carefully
orchestrated a front porch campaign that brought thousands of
supporters to Canton, Ohio, avoiding a national tour that he
thought ``demeaned the office,'' according to a 1996 issue of
History Today.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bush camp is using ``a combination of William
McKinley's campaign and the (draft) Colin Powell campaign that
never was,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences between 1896 and 2000 are as numerous as
the similarities, the parallels are not lost on Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a recent public appearance to describe a scenario
in which Republicans could retake the White House after eight years
of Bill Clinton, Rove effortlessly drifted back over 100 years for
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1896, not 1998,'' Rove said. ``All the guys from the
Civil War are dying off. ... There's a new economy rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forwarding to modern America, Rove says the ``governing
paradigm of the Cold War is gone ... a generation of leadership is
passing away ... there's a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Bush is the candidate to seize the moment, and
become the candidate of change, is another question. While he is
able to capitalize both on his outsider status and his family's
deep political connections, that may not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is it going to be before his Republican opponents
and/or Al Gore say, `Remember George Bush senior? Do you really
want to go back to those tragic, depressing times?' '' asked
Sabato, author of a book about end-of-century politics called
Toward the Millennium. ``His father is his greatest asset and his
heaviest burden.''

`GRASSROOTS' PUSH FOR BUSH CAREFULLY CRAFTED AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush kicked off the 76th
session of the Texas Legislature last month, he said there was too
much to do here to be crisscrossing the country in pursuit of a
2000 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   He never said he wouldn't bring the country to him.
</P>
<P>
   Without having to leave home, Bush has methodically assembled a
team of likely advisers, collected commitments from deep-pocketed
contributors and hosted delegations from several key states, all
urging him to run.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is a modern version of the ``front porch''
campaign that former Ohio Gov. William McKinley conducted in his
successful White House race more than 100 years ago _ but Bush is
using the back yard of the Texas Governor's Mansion as the setting
for some of his political pep rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example was the pilgrimage to Austin last week by
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who grew up in Fort Worth, and U.S. Rep.
Scott McInnis, R-Colo. Flanking the governor, they urged Bush to
run and predicted he'll win if he does.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis, repeating what Bush aides have been saying for weeks,
denied there has been any orchestration of the ``Draft Bush''
movement that has gained ground among Republicans in Congress and
in a growing number of statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request is not coming from Texas. The request is coming
from the other direction,'' McInnis said. Owens added: ``He didn't
call us. We made the call.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush can count on loyal support and money without
ever picking up the phone, thanks to an extensive network of
friends and former associates of his father who are eager for him
to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews, letters and published reports suggest that the
seeds of the ``grassroots'' movement to get Bush into the
presidential race were carefully planted long ago _ largely by Karl
Rove, the architect of Bush's political strategy and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Rove acknowledged coordinating the visits, but said a snowball
effect has taken hold. Now, states are cold-calling with offers to
send petitions and delegations to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from people saying we've got one, do we send
it to you?'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TAKE THE CASE OF NEW MEXICO: On Feb. 18, Bush's political office
in Texas issued the following news release: ``As a courtesy, we are
forwarding two press releases issued in South Carolina ... and New
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Both reported that sizable numbers of GOP legislators in those
states were calling on Bush to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Described as an isolated, spontaneous outburst of support, the
effort to round up support in New Mexico was, in fact, carefully
coordinated with Rove from Austin, according to the leader of the
effort there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (Rove) and said, `If you guys want to do something
... give me a call, I'm ready to help,' '' said Colin McMillan, a
former assistant secretary of defense under President Bush. ``I
asked him what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rove) said, `Well, you might consider doing this,' ''
McMillan added, referring to the draft movement that snared more
than three-quarters of the Republicans in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, fax machines in Austin were whirring with the news
release from McMillan and the one from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one week later, Alabama weighed in, with Attorney
General Bill Pryor _ another Rove client and avowed Bush fan _
leading the charge. Pryor said he was inspired by what other states
were doing, and decided to ``follow the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he needed no encouragement from Rove, Pryor said
he has talked with the consultant about Bush, and he cited a kind
letter from the governor that he says compelled him to ``do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dated Jan. 29, the letter reads, in part: ``Karl told me of your
kind words of encouragement to run for President. If I decide to
seek higher office, I would very much appreciate your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would decide by spring, Bush asked Pryor to ``keep
your powder dry until then.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If Bush seems eager to keep in touch with potential supporters,
he is by no means alone.
</P>
<P>
   A year before he helped organize a group of legislators to jump
on the ``Draft Bush'' bandwagon, Iowa farmer Thurman Gaskill
remembers the excitement he felt after receiving a message from
another George Bush _ the former president _ congratulating him on
his election to a Senate seat there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left a message on my machine,'' said Gaskill. ``It blew my
mind.'' Asked if he thought Bush was trying to woo him on behalf of
his son, Gaskill described the former president as a proud father
who would do anything ``appropriate to assist him in the political
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaskill is typical of the legislators who are helping organize
the nascent Bush 2000 campaign in the American heartland, and his
participation underscores the formidable network waiting to be put
into motion.
</P>
<P>
   His ties to the former president go back to 1980, when he
organized Farmers for Bush in the key state, which holds the
nation's first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gaskill and fellow farmer Tom Dorr, also a former Bush
political activist, who helped round up support among Republicans
in the Iowa Legislature for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The two also helped put together a trip to Austin to visit with
Bush and urge him to get into the race. Dorr said Bush officials
did not ``engineer it in any stretch of the imagination,'' and
described the group as ``just a bunch of old country boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Those country boys were nevertheless able to hitch a ride to
Austin on corporate jets provided by two major Republican
contributors in Des Moines _ trucking magnate John Ruan, head of
Ruan Transportation, and insurance baron Gerald Kirke, co-founder
of the firm Kirke Van Orsdel.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Ruan or his spokesman were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But in a measure of the insular and ironic world of politics, it
was Kirke's firm that provided corporate jet rides to John Sununu _
President Bush's former chief of staff _ after he was caught using
military planes for personal and political trips in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Another irony: Kirke was meeting with former Vice President Dan
Quayle, an announced presidential candidate, on the very day he
lent his plane to the Iowa legislators who came to Texas to visit
Bush. (He said the lawmakers reimbursed him for the flight, as Iowa
law requires).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested for them to get down there to find out what
this is all about,'' Kirke said, adding that he was asked by a
lobbyist to arrange the trip. ``I want to see what George Bush
stands for. I want to see him come out and be questioned.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While Bush has publicly expressed a reluctance to get into the
race, in part because his twin teen-age daughters are skittish
about a national campaign, his state political operation has been
regularly mailing video updates to supporters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as August, four months before his re-election as
governor, Bush mailed videos to out-of-state contributors and
supporters, said Mindy Tucker, a spokesman for the Bush political
office. Four have gone out so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes out to donors of $500 and up, and supporters who have
expressed an interest in the governor's activities,'' she said.
``It's probably 90 percent donors _ donors and interested
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Containing short political documentaries, campaign ads and plain
news footage, the tapes are the work of Austin media consultant
Mark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The news clips on the tapes contain multiple references to
Bush's possible entry into the 2000 presidential race. McKinnon's
combination of heroic music, slow motion and a variety of film
formats _ including grainy 8mm clips from an old home movie camera
_ give the longer tribute pieces an unmistakable documentary feel.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   By bringing the early ``draft'' campaign to Austin, and mailing
out videos beyond, Bush has been able to line up support from the
comfort of his own mansion while honoring his commitment to work
hard on Texas issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say he'll form a presidential ``exploratory'' committee
within two weeks, and Bush has lined up a team of advisers. And
late Friday, Bush officials announced that delegations from three
more states were coming to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, William McKinley's political man, Mark Hanna, carefully
orchestrated a front porch campaign that brought thousands of
supporters to Canton, Ohio, avoiding a national tour that he
thought ``demeaned the office,'' according to a 1996 issue of
History Today.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bush camp is using ``a combination of William
McKinley's campaign and the (draft) Colin Powell campaign that
never was,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences between 1896 and 2000 are as numerous as
the similarities, the parallels are not lost on Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a recent public appearance to describe a scenario
in which Republicans could retake the White House after eight years
of Bill Clinton, Rove effortlessly drifted back over 100 years for
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1896, not 1998,'' Rove said. ``All the guys from the
Civil War are dying off. ... There's a new economy rising.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forwarding to modern America, Rove says the ``governing
paradigm of the Cold War is gone ... a generation of leadership is
passing away ... there's a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Bush is the candidate to seize the moment, and
become the candidate of change, is another question. While he is
able to capitalize both on his outsider status and his family's
deep political connections, that may not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is it going to be before his Republican opponents
and/or Al Gore say, `Remember George Bush senior? Do you really
want to go back to those tragic, depressing times?' '' asked
Sabato, author of a book about end-of-century politics called
Toward the Millennium. ``His father is his greatest asset and his
heaviest burden.''

DIVIDED JUSTICES TO TO RULE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT, DAMAGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a case that could affect
thousands of lawsuits, appeared divided Monday as it considered how
invidious sex discrimination must be before federal law permits
punitive damages against an employer.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for discrimination victim Carole Kolstad and for the
Clinton administration, which is supporting her view, argued that
the 1991 Civil Rights Act allows victims of intentional bias to
collect punitive damages if a jury finds their employers
discriminated maliciously or with reckless indifference to their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for the American Dental Association, Kolstad's
employer, countered that punitive damages are available only in
extreme cases of intentional discrimination, such as when the
company showed an ``egregious'' disregard for the law.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, often splitting into blocs that defied their usual
ideological differences, seemed as divided as the attorneys as they
weighed when punitive damages are available under the 1991 act. For
example, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and the moderate
Justice David H. Souter, generally on opposing sides in civil
rights cases, appeared united as they expressed the view that the
law permits juries to award punitive damages in many intentional
sex discrimination cases.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1991 law, victims of intentional sex bias can collect
punitive damages if a jury concludes that their employer acted
``with malice or with reckless indifference'' to their statutory
rights. The law also limits to $300,000 the amount of punitive
damages that a jury can award.
</P>
<P>
   The statute is essentially an amendment to Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which prohibits job discrimination on the basis
of sex, race, color, religion and national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which
enforces anti-discrimination laws, reported that 24,454 Title VII
cases alleging sex bias were filed with the agency in fiscal year
1998, which ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Eric Schnapper, pressing the case for Kolstad, who was
passed over for a lucrative lobbyist position at the American
Dental Association, argued that the law states that victims of
intentional sex discrimination must prove only that the employer
showed a reckless indifference to their legal rights to collect
punitive damages. Companies that intentionally discriminate can
escape being assessed punitive damages if they sincerely believed
their discrimination was legal, the Seattle attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Schnapper noted that the law permits companies to
intentionally discriminate against women if being a man is a ``bona
fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary for the normal
operation of that particular business or enterprise.'' Legal
experts say that such a male-only job might include the starring
role in the television series ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, pressing the Clinton
administration's support for the woman, told the justices that the
law gives juries latitude to assess punitive damages against
companies that intentionally discriminate. The law sets
``explicit'' standards for punitive damages, including the reckless
indifference of employers, the Justice Department lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the arguments that the law is clear has lost in both the
federal district court and U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington _ a point not lost on Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statute is simply confusing,'' Rehnquist said, noting
that the issue of punitive damages sharply divided the federal
appeals court, which ruled 6-5 against the woman. Punitive damages,
Rehnquist said, are generally reserved to punish companies for only
the most reckless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in a comment supporting
Schnapper's position, said that intentionally discriminating
against a woman because of her sex is itself outrageous and perhaps
warrants punitive damages. ``I don't think there's a human being in
the United States'' who does not know that intentional sex
discrimination is illegal, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Schnapper and Waxman, the dental association's
attorney argued that punitive damages are available only for the
most serious violations of law. Historically, federal law, judges
and juries have limited punitive damages to instances when
employers showed an ``egregious'' disregard for an employee's
statutory rights, said Washington attorney Raymond Fay.
</P>
<P>
   However, Souter and Scalia disagreed, saying the 1991 law
mentions only reckless, not egregious, disregard. Scalia, a
stickler for remaining true to the words of a statute and not
trying to broaden their meaning, said Fay's reading of the act
brings confusion, not clarity, to the 1991 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by an egregious act?'' Scalia asked. ``Can
you have a really egregious firing?''
</P>
<P>
   Fay responded that Congress in passing the 1991 law did not
intend to alter the historical standard that punitive damages be
awarded only in exceptionally severe circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The case the justices heard arose in the fall of 1992, when
Kolstad, then the dental association's director of federal agency
regulations, was passed over in favor of a man for a promotion to
director of legislative policy. Kolstad sued the association,
claiming she was rejected because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district court jury ruled that the association
intentionally discriminated against Kolstad and awarded her $52,718
in back pay, but only after a federal judge held that the company's
behavior was not malicious enough to warrant punitive damages. The
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's denial of
punitive damages, ruling that such awards are available only when
companies have committed ``particularly egregious violations'' of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Kolstad then appealed to the Supreme Court. The justices are
expected to render their decision in the case, Kolstad vs. American
Dental Association, by July.

FOR ISRAELIS, A NERVOUS DAY AWAITING RETALIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The morning after an Israeli bombardment of
guerrilla targets in Lebanon, the northernmost residents of Israel
awoke Monday to a strange lull, unsure whether the conflict would
intensify or fade away.
</P>
<P>
   At Kibbutz Maayan Baruch, close to the border, some were tempted
into defying government orders to stay ensconced in bomb shelters,
like the teen-age boys who kicked a soccer ball outside in the
crisp air of late winter.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime, Amnon and Hannah Shamosh heard the kibbutz's
loudspeaker crackling, warning residents to report back to their
underground bunkers. Mr. and Mrs. Shamosh, who are in their 70s,
consider themselves too old to spend any more time in the drab,
chilly shelters.
</P>
<P>
   So they stayed put in their home, anxiously awaiting familiar
sounds: the buzz of Katyusha rockets, the menacing hum of
helicopters and the roar of fighter planes heading off on a bombing
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else is in their safe room, but we're here at home,
waiting for these machos to escalate the whole thing one more
time,'' Shamosh, a writer who has lived there for 52 years, said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation never came. Everything remained quiet on the
northern front of Israel, where tens of thousands of Israelis
endure the simmering conflict in South Lebanon as a fact of their
daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet decided not to act
unless the guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked
first. By evening, the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim guerrillas had
fired no rockets and ambushed no soldiers, and Israel's northern
residents were permitted to emerge from underground after 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure to exercise restraint, Netanyahu
ordered no fresh attacks, and no unusual military buildup was
visible on the border. The prime minister did, however, promise
future strikes, although they did not seem to be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue the battle against Hezbollah because they
continue the battle against us,'' Netanyahu said. ``I'm not going
to get into operational steps, but we have our planes well laid out
and our targets well chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for a week of guerrilla attacks that left seven
Israelis dead and for the firing of Katyusha rockets on northern
settlements, Israel unleashed one of its sharpest military
offensives since 1996 on Sunday night. Its warplanes traveled deep
into Lebanon to bomb guerrilla strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, almost seemed to
be declaring an invasion of Lebanon when he said on Sunday night
that Israel was prepared, if necessary, to continue assaults ``on
the ground, in the air and from the sea.'' But he was using a
military cliche to assert that the army would be as aggressive as
required.
</P>
<P>
   The army on Monday released Persian Gulf war-style footage of
the bombings to Israeli television, showing buildings exploding in
the crosshairs of the plane's scope.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, a Hezbollah spokesman, Ibrahim Moussawi, said that
the Israeli army had conducted about 12 raids. He said the eastern
part of the Bekaa city of Baalbek, which includes Hezbollah
headquarters, was ``physically damaged, but there were no
casualties.'' Hezbollah's construction company, Jihad al Binaa, was
expected move in quickly to repair the damage, as it usually does
to keep civilian morale from dropping.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Israeli army also bombed the underground bunkers of a
radical Palestinian group in Naame, a city just south of Beirut.
But Moussawi said it has been empty for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always do this one,'' Moussawi said, referring to
previous bombings of the same bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Timur Goksel, the senior adviser for U.N. forces in Lebanon,
said there had been only one raid in the southern zone, calling it
``nothing out of the ordinary'' and ``nothing special.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, on the Hezbollah cable television station in
Beirut, the guerrilla group sought to capitalize on its military
successes. A roadside bomb early on Sunday killed four Israelis,
including a general and a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After a Hezbollah anchorwoman, wrapped in a Muslim headscarf,
reported the raids on the Israelis, advertisements sought fresh
recruits _ anyone, of any religion, they said, who wanted to join
``the resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   With rockets, bombs, grenades and machine guns, Hezbollah is
waging a low-level war to push Israel out of southern Lebanon,
where it has maintained a nine-mile-deep buffer zone since 1985 to
protect its northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Hezbollah has mounted a media offensive of
sorts. Last week, machine gun-toting guerrillas took several dozen
journalists on a tour of the front line in southern Lebanon. They
traveled by bus, albeit with blacked-out windows, sampled Turkish
coffee and croissants and watched a video of Hezbollah's
self-described ``greatest hits'' _including grainy footage of bomb
plantings and searches through rubble for body parts. (The video is
available for $10 from the cable station, Dar al Manar.)
</P>
<P>
   After the deadly bombing on Sunday, a convey of beeping mopeds
and honking cars drove through West Beirut, waving the yellow flag
of the guerrillas and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel on Monday, three of the four bombing victims were
buried. A funeral for the fourth, Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, will be
held on Tuesday. Gerstein, who headed the army's liaison unit with
the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army, was the highest-ranking
officer to die in the southern Lebanon conflict in 17 years.

THE INEVITABILITY OF GEORGE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a growing sense in the Republican Party
and among the political pundits that Gov. George W. Bush is the
inevitable GOP presidential nominee next year even though he has
barely set foot outside Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP governors have already endorsed him, delegates at a
recent California GOP state convention embraced him in absentia,
party bigwigs and organizers are rushing to his side and the polls
show him the clear leader in a crowded nomination field. He beats
Vice President Al Gore, the putative Democratic nominee, in early
trial heats.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. And whoa.
</P>
<P>
   The caboose is getting ahead of the engine here, or at least the
conclusion, ahead of the process. The national political game is
notorious for its impatience, but this is runaway wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for it. Bush has by all accounts been an
effective and well-regarded governor in a large state rich in
campaign contributions. As the son of former President George Bush,
his lineage means instant name identification. He has the benefit
of his father's past experience and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   With two exceptions his possible rivals are a sorry lot. And the
public opinion surveys are signaling that unlike the others he may
be electable.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, wait a minute. Frontrunners don't always go the
distance. Does anybody remember President Edmund Muskie? President
George Romney? President Edward Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   These men too looked like certain winners more than a year
before the primaries and the presidential conventions. But
eventually they actually had to campaign, explain where they stood,
counter their opponents' charges, avoid blunders and rally voters.
The result _ oops.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level Bush may be able to straddle the GOP's major
ideological divisions as he has in Texas, transcending the
religious right's mean-fisted grip on his party and appealing to
Hispanics and other groups traditionally undervalued by
conservatives. Or he may not.
</P>
<P>
   We do not know yet how, or even if, he proposes to do this.
</P>
<P>
   We do not know how the southwestern son of a defeated Republican
president will sell in Iowa, or New Hampshire, or elsewhere in the
country. His speaking style is roughly as exciting as Gore's. In an
era of little political privacy, he has suggested that in his youth
he was less than perfectly behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Although mostly composed of right-wing pipsqueaks, his potential
GOP competitors include two formidable moderate figures _ Elizabeth
Dole, a former two-time Cabinet officer, and Arizona Sen. John
McCain, a much-respected campaign finance reformer. Bush may well
be ahead in organizing and fund-raising, but that's just the
beginning. Texas Sen. Phil Gramm was wallowing in campaign money at
a similar early period before the 1996 campaign, but it did him
little good with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the ghosts of campaigns past.
</P>
<P>
   After his landslide re-election as Michigan governor in 1966,
George Romney instantly became the favorite for the 1968 Republican
presidential nomination. He didn't last through the first primary
in New Hampshire _ cut off at the knees by an unwise comment that
he had been ``brainwashed'' about Vietnam and by the quiet
maneuvering of that supposed has-been, Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The next presidential campaign, in 1972, quickly did in a
Democratic frontrunner, Muskie, who had been the 1968 vice
presidential nominee. Before the primaries, Muskie not only led the
Democratic pack but beat President Nixon by 5 percentage points in
the polls. Then the press said he cried in New Hampshire (he always
insisted snowflakes had dampened his cheeks), and that was that.
The weakest candidate, George McGovern, won the privilege of being
wiped out by Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Sen Edward Kennedy was the favorite of the Democratic
Party, which had already given up on a remote and inadequate
President Jimmy Carter. For months, the political spin touted
Kennedy as his party's popular savior.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kennedy finally ran, he couldn't articulate why he
chose to take on an incumbent Democrat. He split the party, lost
the primaries and handed a softened-up Carter over to a conquering
Ronald Reagan. And so, the pining for a second Kennedy presidency
for a decade and a half ignominiously died.
</P>
<P>
   Some frontrunners do succeed. This is not to dismiss Bush, but
merely to urge caution. Hold the horses a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Governor Carter in 1976,
Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 sailed to
victory with only minor scares. Others barely fended off surprises
_ the classic example being former Vice President Walter Mondale in
1984, who didn't seal the Democratic nomination for president until
the last primary round.

   RUSSIA-FASCISM (Moscow) _ How dangerous a threat is posed by
neo-fascism is one of the main questions under debate in Russia. It
is not difficult to make a comparison between Russia today and
pre-Hitler Germany _ a collapsed economy, an electorate that feels
bitter and betrayed, a weak central government. But for all the
scare talk, Russia's neo-fascist groups are still small and
marginal. Some experts maintain that they are creatures of the old
KGB, while others argue conspiratorially that they are used by the
authorities to whip up pre-election anxieties that will drive
voters back into the embrace of the political establishment. By

   CREDITCARD-SHIFT (Undated) _ Your credit card company, and your
interest rate, may not be the one you think it is. Tens of millions
of Americans have been facing a stark choice _ to take new terms or
leave them _ as the credit-card business rapidly consolidates into
fewer and larger hands. About 32 million accounts were sold last
year, mainly by regional banks like PNC, Keycorp, First Maryland
and First Union. That is more than four times as many as in 1996.
Because many people have multiple accounts, the sales involved some
20 million consumers. The figures do not include transfers
resulting from mergers. By Robert D. Hershey Jr. 1,800 words.

<P>
   KAJIADO, Kenya _ Naataosim Mako fiddled with the edge of the
desk and fluffed up her skirt, more than a little embarrassed to
talk so barely about her young life.
</P>
<P>
   But these were the facts: For her hand in marriage, a friend of
her father gave a small fortune of a dowry, 10 cows, four goats,
more than 200 quarts of home-brewed beer, more than 6 pounds of
sugar and a sack of rice.
</P>
<P>
   He was about 30 years old, she said. She was only 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still young,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Naataosim, foal-thin in her green school uniform, is 10 now.
This is her second year in the A.I.C. Girls Primary Boarding
School, where she is a pupil rather than a very young bride. The
school, on a dusty plateau in southern Kenya, is circled by a
chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, meant not to deter
thieves but the fathers of the girls from sneaking them away.
</P>
<P>
   The school has become a haven for girls seeking to escape early
marriage, a practice not at all unusual among the Masai, perhaps
the most fiercely traditional and independent of the 42 tribes in
Kenya. And so, the school has found itself at the heart of an
unending argument here about how the modern world is gaining ground
on traditional life in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Masai may still dress in plaid shawls, but more and more
they are giving up nomadic life, as their land is parceled off and
the plains fill with houses. The Kikuyu, the largest tribe, have a
saying that sums up the inching forth of change: Even the Masai are
wearing underwear now.
</P>
<P>
   But many Masai families do not understand why that change must
extend to one of their most precious and pliable resources, their
daughters. And that has made it hard for the school, where
three-quarters of the girls are Masai, and its headmistress,
Priscilla Nangurai.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are more problems than successes,'' she said by
way of weary introduction to her school. ``They feel that when a
girl goes to school she gets spoiled because she gets to a point
where she is equal to the men. But she's not supposed to be equal.
She's not supposed to make her own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men are afraid of that, of their not getting married at
all,'' she added. ``To them that is like you are an outcast. A
woman should get married. She should have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the fence, which went up six years ago, as well as rules
that allow families to visit the girls only two times each term.
During Mrs. Nangurai's 18 years there, the school has become well
known for taking in girls in trouble. Some are victims of sexual
assault. One girl who will enroll soon is the daughter of a woman
killed in December by her husband, a policeman, a case that has
heightened concern about domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nangurai said she is not on a crusade to destroy Masai
culture, even though she has been accused of that. Despite her
abhorrence of female genital cutting, for example, she said she
does not try to stop it. Nearly all her students have undergone one
form of genital cutting or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them at least to do it on the holidays,'' she
said, ``so the girls can have some time to heal before they come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Nangurai said some people have softened on the
school, it was clear from interviews around the town of Kajiado
that there is much suspicion of education for girls. Nantayio
Sonto, 35, a market vendor, said girls were more respectful in the
``older'' days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the girls of today, once she goes to school and gets an
education, she will not listen to her elders,'' she said. ``She
might even elope.''
</P>
<P>
   The school was founded in 1959 by Protestant missionaries from
the African Inland Church, though it no longer supports the school.
The idea was that the Masai could leave their daughters behind for
schooling while the rest of the family followed their cattle to
fresh grazing lands. The school is now financed through fees from
parents who can pay and grants from outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   From 20 girls at the start, the number had grown to 412 by the
time Mrs. Nanguria became headmistress in 1981. But she said there
was still much suspicion about the school, so much that she had to
recruit for first-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 650 girls there, and many of their stories follow
a similar script.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father wanted to marry me off,'' said Jedida Nkadoyo, who
was only 10 when her father mysteriously forbade her to go to
school in her home village. A week later, she said, her mother told
her, ``Today you are going to your husband's place.'' Her dowry was
one cow, a crate of bottled beer and 40 liters of home brew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a girl who is going to school so I can get my education,''
she said she told her father. ``My father said, `That's nonsense.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage lasted one day, and by some circumstance she is
still not completely aware of, she ended up at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Shuaka was 14 when her father told her she was to be
married one day after she came home from school. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I was just playing,'' she said. ``He said, `You are
going to married because you are old enough to get married now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the start, her father would not visit her at the school. But
slowly he came, just as, Mrs. Nangurai said, people are slowly
changing their minds about the school. He does not talk about
marriage anymore. She wants to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen now that I have done a good job,'' she said. ``He
has said it is very important for me to be educated.''

COMMENTARY: IS KOSOVO WORTH IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should the U.S. get involved in Kosovo? The answer is a
qualified ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   First some background. What is Kosovo? Kosovo is another nasty
Balkan civil war, in this case between the Muslim Kosovar
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo Province, and the
Orthodox Serbs, who make up the other 10 percent of Kosovo, which
is itself part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The second point we need to stress again is, how do civil wars
end? Usually in one of three ways: 1) They end with a hard
partition, as in Cyprus. 2) They end with a soft partition under a
hard fist, as in Lebanon, where the Christians and Muslims now mix
under a Syrian fist. 3) Or, they end like the American Civil War,
with one side vanquishing the other and dictating the future.
That's how civil wars end. They do not end with both sides saying
``I'm OK, you're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, I have always favored the partition option,
whether in the Balkans or the Middle East. I think people need to
live apart before they can live together. Nevertheless, the
U.S.-NATO position in Bosnia was that they could not tolerate a
hard partition. So the civil war in Bosnia ended, like Lebanon,
with a soft partition under a hard fist, and that hard fist is the
American-led NATO force in Bosnia. The U.S.-NATO position is that
Kosovo should be handled the same way. There should be a soft
partition, with Kosovo remaining in Serbia, but with the Kosovars
being given real self-rule for the near future _ all protected by
the hard fist of NATO. That is the peace accord both sides rejected
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But if they accept, you ask, is it worth our making a difference
to quell this particular Balkan civil war, and can we make a
difference at a reasonable cost sustainable with the American
people?
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether it is worth making a difference in
Kosovo, the answer is yes _ we do have a strategic and humanitarian
interest in not allowing this Kosovo-Albanian conflict to get out
of control. As the Balkan expert Herbert Okun likes to observe:
``Bosnia implodes. Albania explodes.'' There is real reason to
believe that if left untended, the Kosovo problem will suck in
Albanians from four surrounding regions _ Macedonia, Montenegro,
northern Greece and Albania _ in ways that will be highly
destabilizing, lead to a large number of refugees, infect
Greek-Turkish relations and sour intra-NATO relations. You cannot
care about the future of NATO, and the stability of Southern
Europe, and then say we have no interest in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But can we actually make a difference at a reasonable cost? Only
if both parties accept some version of the peace deal that has been
offered. But if the parties are simply too committed to testing
their strength, or not exhausted enough yet, or too caught up with
their own fantasies, or too divided to make a decision to accept
this peace deal, then we cannot make a difference at a reasonable
cost and we should not interpose ourselves on the ground. We should
focus instead on building a firewall around this conflict to
prevent its spreading.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovars eventually agree to the NATO plan, but the Serbs
still refuse, then every pressure, short of a NATO invasion, should
be mobilized to bring the Serbs around, and NATO should not
hesitate to use air power to restrain the Serbs from ethnically
cleansing Kosovo. But NATO is not going to invade Serbia to impose
a settlement _ at least three NATO members, France, Italy and
Greece, would not approve.
</P>
<P>
   If both parties eventually come to their senses and accept a
peace deal, should America contribute peacekeeping troops? Yes.
Since the deal calls for the Europeans to commit 25,000 troops and
the U.S. only 4,000, it means the Europeans are assuming the lion's
share of responsibility. Getting the Europeans to take such
responsibility is, in itself, a U.S. interest. The U.S. is and must
remain a European power and therefore it cannot remain entirely
aloof from a Kosovo deal. Contributing 4,000 troops is not beyond
the means, or the interests, of America as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: It's worth keeping the peace in Kosovo, if
there's a peace to keep. If there's no peace to keep, we should
work with our allies to quarantine the area, so its toxic impact on
the rest of Europe is minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Either we patrol a fence between the warring parties _ if they
are ready to stop fighting _ or we build a fence around them, if
they are not.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who will soon become
Nigeria's first elected president after 16 years of military
dictatorships, is an anomaly in this country's recent history, and
a man of apparent contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   One of eight generals to have ruled Nigeria since independence
from Britain in 1960, he is best known as the only one to have
given up power voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent where ethnic identity is a critical piece of
self-definition and has been the basis of countless conflicts, he
is trusted by Nigeria's northern Hausa-Fulani, while many of his
fellow Yoruba in the south look at him askance.
</P>
<P>
   Having caused resentment for governing with a strong hand before
1979, the year his first presidency ended, he also gained respect
after being jailed in 1995 as an outspoken critic of the military
dictatorship. He was released from prison only eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded in the rest of Africa and in the West as a defender of
democracy, he is mistrusted by many Nigerians for his military past
and his links to powerful fellow retired generals who are believed
to have bankrolled his road to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   All those contradictions might prove to be both his strengths
and weaknesses over the next four years of his presidency. At 61 _
he turns 62 later this week _ he is a man at once free of the rigid
molds that have divided Africa's most populous nation and lacking
in the bedrock ethnic support that has been the foundation of most
politicians in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Having presented himself during the campaign as a safe bridge
between the present military government and a future civilian
administration, Obasanjo is to assume the presidency on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of his first presidency in 1979, Obasanjo
established a farm about 35 miles north of here, where he raised
pigs and cultivated bananas. He also cultivated the reputation of
an elder statesman, even as he has kept his image as a
short-tempered, gruff soldier. In a ``Who's Who in Nigeria,'' he
listed his hobbies as ``farming, table tennis, snooker, squash.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance on national television last week, he scored
points with the audience by alluding to a traditional, earthy
Nigerian stew made with ground melon seeds. It was a successful, if
sincere, version of President Bush's political use of pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I like eating pounded yam, especially with egusi
soup,'' he said. ``And you know that I enjoy it more when I eat
with my fingers. It tastes better when you're able to lick your
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was born in Abeokuta, about 60 miles north of here in
the heart of Yorubaland, on March 5, 1937. In the same city, within
a year of his birth, were born two other future Yoruba giants,
Moshood Abiola, the opposition leader and presumed winner of the
1993 presidential election, and Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the creator of
Afro-beat music and social critic. The Yoruba, along with the
Hausa-Fulani and the Ibo, are one of Nigeria's three main ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian, Obasanjo attended Baptist Boys' High School, along
with Abiola. He worked as a teacher for a year before joining the
army in 1958. After receiving training in Britain and India, he
rose quickly within the ranks. During the Biafran civil war, when
the Ibo tried to secede, he was put in charge of a commando unit
that obtained the surrender of a rebel leader, effectively ending
the fighting in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after the longtime military ruler indefinitely
postponed a promised return to civilian rule, Gen. Murtala Muhammad
staged a coup and began a program to hand over power to civilians
in 1979. But after Muhammad was assassinated in a failed coup,
Obasanjo, his deputy, was named president.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Obasanjo stuck to the program of transition. And
in foreign policy, it was under him that Nigeria, emboldened by the
gush of oil money, began flexing its muscles. In international
diplomatic circles, Nigeria became the leading African opponent of
white-ruled regimes in South Africa _ Obasanjo was one of the few
prominent people to visit Nelson Mandela in jail _ Namibia and the
former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. It also became the center of
liberation movements whose leaders operated out of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   After President Carter came to office with an emphasis on human
rights, the two leaders established a relationship that has lasted
to this day. Obasanjo visited Washington in October 1977. Half a
year later, Nigeria welcomed Carter, who became the first American
president to pay a state visit to a sub-Saharan country. Obasanjo
earned lasting esteem when elections were held in 1979 as planned,
and he stepped down for the civilian president, Shehu Shagari.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But to many of his fellow Yoruba, it was the biggest of many
perceived acts of betrayal. The elections had been close and
Obasanjo had called them in favor of Shagari, a northerner, over an
opponent who was a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos and the rest of Yorubaland, Obasanjo is also remembered
for a violent crackdown on students protesting tuition hikes.
Soldiers also continued to use brutal tactics, and one of the most
famous cases involved the late Fela, his fellow native of Abeokuta
and one of the most vocal critics of the military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, under Obasanjo's rule, soldiers burned down Fela's
compound in Lagos and threw his 77-year-old mother out a
second-story window. After his mother died of her injuries, Fela
wrote one of his most famous songs, ``Coffin for Head of State,''
which tells, in street slang, how he and his followers carried the
coffin and tried to present it to the general:
</P>
<P>
   waka waka waka waka we reach dem gate o.
</P>
<P>
   waka waka waka we put the coffin down waka.
</P>
<P>
   waka waka Obasanjo dey there with him big fat stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, many Yoruba have not forgiven Obasanjo for the 1979
elections and his ties to the north. ``He's Yoruba, but he has
deceived us,'' said Afusa Oladunni, a 37-year-old civil servant, as
she voted on Saturday, in a typical comment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo earned northerners' enduring trust by
yielding power to one of their own. And he used the respect he had
earned outside Nigeria to carry out diplomatic missions for the
United Nations and the British Commonwealth across Africa. A decade
ago, he was considered for the position of U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an African leader, with the possible
exception of Nelson Mandela, who is better known or respected by a
multiplicity of international organizations as Obasanjo is,'' said
Carter, who led a delegation of American election monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said it would be crucial for Obasanjo _ who will now
govern the country as an elected president and not as a military
ruler _ to overcome the distrust of the south. ``I think it will be
a handicap for him,'' Carter said. ``How he reaches out to the
groups who did not support him, especially in the south, will have
important consequences for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida _ who is close to Obasanjo and
believed to have contributed greatly to his recent campaign efforts
_ annulled the results of a presidential election that Abiola, the
Abeokuta native and a billionaire businessman, was on his way to
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was imprisoned in 1994 for refusing to renounce his claim
to the presidency; Obasanjo angered his fellow Yoruba when he said
that Abiola was ``not a messiah.'' As Nigeria plunged into crisis
under the repressive regime of Gen. Sani Abacha, Obasanjo became an
outspoken critic of the military government and was himself
imprisoned in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He was released only after Abacha's sudden death last June. In
the bewildering series of events that followed, Abiola died in
July, still under government detention. And a few weeks later, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who had assumed power, announced a timetable
for elections.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement led to many calls inside and outside Nigeria
for Obasanjo to run for the presidency. He is, his campaign argued,
the only Nigerian capable of keeping this fractious country
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great pity that, at every crisis, big or small, people
talk of Nigeria breaking up,'' Obasanjo said last July, four months
before declaring his intention to run. ``The enormous challenge
facing us now is to get beyond these mutual suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Obasanjo has yet to explain how he will meet that
challenge. But it is clearly the one he will face his second time
as president.

HUTCHISON BILL WOULD SNUFF OUT GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO SHARE IN
STATES' TOBACCO FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ County judges from across Texas were on Capitol
Hill on Tuesday pushing legislation authored by Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison that would prohibit the federal government from sharing
in any of the tobacco settlement money negotiated by state and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutchison bill, which is attracting broad support from
Republicans and Democrats, is to get a full airing late next week
in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, she told Harris County Judge Robert Eckels
and other Texas judges in a meeting that she hopes to convince
other lawmakers to sign on as co-sponsors of the bill to help
ensure ``that every dollar obtained by the states (in the tobacco
settlements) stays there.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has been trying since 1997 to share in
some of the hundreds of billions in payments negotiated in deals
between the states and the tobacco companies. The Clinton
administration has argued that it is entitled to some of the money
to help recoup Medicaid payments to the states for the treatment of
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government picks up about 50 percent of each state's
Medicaid costs. But despite the federal infusion of health-related
dollars, state and local officials argue that Washington is not
entitled to any money because it did not participate in litigation
that eventually led to all 50 states reaching deals with the
tobacco industry worth more than $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, is expected to receive about $2.2 billion
from tobacco companies, with an initial payment of about $450
million being made over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston and is the most
populous county in the state with 3.1 million people, &UR;  &LR;  will
receive about $40 million this year, all of it earmarked for county
health care programs that cater to the indigent and working poor
who do not qualify for Medicaid or other kinds of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are dollars that are going to indigent persons who have
nowhere else to turn,`` Eckels said. He added that federal attempts
to intervene in the state tobacco settlements to recoup Medicaid
payments could cost the county millions that have already been
budgeted for various health services.
</P>
<P>
   Eckels said Harris County health facilities now treat about
300,000 poor people a year who have no health insurance. But based
on the county's projected share of tobacco settlement funds in
coming years, county facilities will soon be able to provide
services to more than twice that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the federal government gets its hands on any of that
tobacco money ... it would completely change the kind of services
we're able to provide,'' Eckels said. He suggested that those
revenue losses would have to be made up somewhere else, possibly
from increased property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House rejected a tobacco bill last year
aimed at forcing tobacco companies to reach a settlement with the
federal government. A provision in that bill supported by Hutchison
would have prevented Washington from intervening in settlement
deals between the states and tobacco companies in an attempt to
recoup some of its Medicaid payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow that to happen. We're going to fight
it every step of the way,'' Hutchison told the judges Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican predicted that her bill would pass this
year because it is no longer part of a larger and more complicated
tobacco measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's become more of a states rights issue,'' said one
Hutchison aide, who noted that the senator's bill has been endorsed
by the National Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Eckels agreed. ``I think there's a good chance that her bill
will pass. It's already got 38 co-sponsors, and its going be hard,
I think, for members to go against what the governors and their
local officials are telling them is in the best interest of the
counties.''

BAY STATE GAMBLERS BEAT PATH TO CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts residents spend an estimated $620 million
per year at Connecticut's two Indian-run casinos and visit the
facilities more than gamblers from any other state, according to a
report released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Bay State residents patronizing Foxwoods Resort &AMP;
Casino in Ledyard, Conn., has grown by 9 percent in the past three
years, despite or perhaps because of, the opening of the Mohegan
Sun Casino, in neighboring Uncasville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts residents are the single most important
ingredient fueling the economic engine of Connecticut's two
phenomenally successful casinos,'' said Clyde W. Barrow, director
of the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth's Center for Policy
Analysis, which conducted the study. ``Other than federal income
tax payments, the money spent by Massachusetts residents at
Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos is one of the greatest
out-of-state expenditures of Massachusetts personal income.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is sure to inflame the aleady intense debate over
whether to expand legalized gambling in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass-Dartmouth study was commissioned by the Visions Group,
a consortium of business and community leaders who want to build a
world-class casino and resort on the North Shore's Salisbury Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not the only interested parties looking to the
Connecticut casinos as proof that Massachusetts could become a
gambling gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   The Wampanoag tribe in New Bedford and the state's race tracks,
among others, are also pushing to open up the state to slot
machines or high-stakes bingo at a time when some Beacon Hill
leaders, including House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, seem to be
warming up to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   However, Massachusetts residents, who have seen the Legislature
reject gambling measures in the past, appear to be beating a path,
rather than holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 36 percent of the patrons at Foxwoods are from
Massachusetts, spending $469 million a year at what has become the
world's largest and most successful casino. About 28 percent, the
next largest group of Foxwoods' visitors, comes from within
Connecticut's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Bay State gamblers also make up about 23 percent of the vistors
at Mohegan Sun, spending about $151 million there each year. Only
Connecticut residents visited Mohegan Sun more, representing 48
percent of the patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The ``patron origin analysis'' was conducted between Feb. 11 and
Feb. 15 and is based on a sampling of 6,876 cars and 201 tour buses
at Foxwoods. Likewise, the study looked at the license plates on
6,517 cars and 183 tour buses at Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The center completed a similar study in October 1995 at
Foxwoods, finding that 33 percent of its gamblers were from
Massachusetts. Mohegan Sun opened one year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just over three years, Massachusetts residents
patronization has grown by over 9 percent, while a new casino,
Mohegan Sun, in just over two years of operation, has seen
Massachusetts patrons comprise 23 percent of all its customers,''
Barrow said. ``Clearly, Massachusetts residents are voting for
gaming with their automobiles, buses and pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrow also said the recently announced $950 million expansion
by the Mohegan Sun casino underscores the belief that New England
may be the most ``underutilized'' gaming market in the country,
with an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in annual discretionary
gaming revenue up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the No. 2 casino in a non-traditional gaming region to
make a nearly $1 billion investment in gaming expansion is unheard
of,'' Barrow added. ``Were this Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it
would be big news. For it to happen in the wooded hills of southern
New England, it is absolutely stunning news.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Massachusetts residents are making 7.7 million
visits to the two Connecticut casinos, a number Barrows says will
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods are betting on it.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was the 5.9 percent teaser rate. When that expired,
the interest rate on Tom Moore's PNC Bank credit card jumped to
14.4 percent. Finally it settled at 12.5 percent. Moore, an
illustrator who lives in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   But last week Moore was stunned to find that he was no longer a
customer of PNC, which is based in Pittsburgh, but of a bank in
Oklahoma he had never heard of. Not only that, but his interest
rate had been jacked up to 20.74 percent _ and 24.74 percent on
cash advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the most odious business practice I've ever
seen,'' complained Moore, who is 46.
</P>
<P>
   Odious or not, tens of millions of Americans have been facing
the same stark choice _ to take the new terms or leave them _ as
the credit-card business rapidly consolidates into fewer and larger
hands. About 32 million accounts were sold last year, mainly by
regional banks like PNC, Keycorp, First Maryland and First Union.
That is more than four times as many as in 1996, according to R.K.
Hammer, who runs a card industry advisory firm in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Because many people have multiple accounts, the sales
involved some 20 million consumers. The figures do not include
transfers resulting from mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Big buyers have included Chase, which bought 3.5 billion Bank of
New York accounts last year, and Citibank, which bought AT&AMP;T's
Universal Card. Other buyers are Fleet Financial and Bank One,
which owns First USA, as well as some little-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   Except for low teaser rates guaranteed for, say, six months,
banks have no legal obligation to honor any rates cardholders now
pay and have shown little inclination to do so. But while it is not
unusual for rates to rise 6 or 8 percentage points, they could also
fall. ``It's the natural time to examine the risk and reward of
each'' account, Hammer said, and the result ``could be a repricing
up or down.'' And even when rates stay the same, penalties and
grace periods may change, sometimes to the consumer's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerri Detweiler, a credit-card specialist and consultant
to Debt Counselors, called it scandalous that consumers can so
easily fall prey to the wheeling and dealing of large institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mortgage or car loan were sold, your rate would stay
the same,'' Ms. Detweiler said. ``That's not the case with credit
cards.'' When consumers see an account has been transferred, it is
very important to read the fine print because of a high probability
that the interest rate or some other terms have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 3.5 billion credit-card offers flooding
Americans' mailboxes each year, cardholders would have little
trouble taking their business elsewhere. Often, by paying a fee,
they are even able to transfer balances. But the banks, Ms.
Detweiler added, ``anticipate that a lot of new customers won't pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore acknowledged that a month or two earlier he had received a
mailing that may well have included a notification of the higher
rates but that he had not focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   Credits cards once provided a lush business for regional banks
like PNC, but many are fleeing it now, squeezed by the high costs
of uncollectible debt and a rising number of consumers who pay
monthly balances in full, depriving the bank of interest income.
And the cost is rising for the increasingly sophisticated computer
models that analyze customer usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even at a time of unparalleled prosperity, there is no
letup in the record number of Americans filing for bankruptcy,
raising fears that a business downturn would send bad card debt
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The card business is really becoming a business of scale,''
said Warren G. Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc., a
company in Wakefield, Mass., that studies and rates the nation's
banks. ``A lot of companies are recognizing this and throwing in
the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages and automotive loans are routinely bought and sold,
but this has little impact on borrowers, since the rates cannot
change. But the new owners of credit-card business are free to
impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear, subject only
to the handful of remaining state usury ceilings. They can also
shorten the time for making payments without interest charges,
eliminate grace periods for payments received a few days late and
raise penalties for late payment, now commonly as much as $29.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there is no change in a customer's rate, said
David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. But it is also common for banks to
upgrade the type of account _ to platinum, for instance. Upgraded
accounts sometimes prove to be more expensive in terms of fees and
may carry higher rates as well, although they may offer more
services and the advantage of being with a bigger lender.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Robertson contended, the industry's
ever-more-sophisticated ability to analyze account data has helped
it to tailor new products and cut costs, and these savings may
ultimately be shared with customers. ``This is certainly the heyday
of the credit-card business for the consumer,'' Robertson said.
``Never has there been a better time to find the card that appeals
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is one of those looking for a more-appealing card. After
learning of the sale of his account, he telephoned the new owner,
Direct Merchants Bank in Tulsa. A customer service representative
told him that his was one of a half million PNC accounts
transferred and that if he did not like the new terms, he could
close his account.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly canceled his card but must still pay the higher
interest rate on his $848 balance, which he hopes to pay off soon.
But if he had been running a balance too big to settle fairly
quickly, he would have been forced, with only a few weeks' notice,
to pay a much higher interest rate for some time unless he could
transfer it to a new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build up a substantial amount, you may not be able to
pay it all,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. He called it ``gouging'' when a
credit-card rate is raised sharply for no reason other than a
business deal between large institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Direct Merchants Bank belongs to Metris Cos., a Minnesota-based
marketer of various consumer-credit products, including credit-card
registration and extended warranties on appliances. It was once a
financial arm of Fingerhut Cos., a catalog and telemarketing
concern with which it still has some ties.
</P>
<P>
   Metris is one of the most aggressive of several buyers of
credit-card portfolios being shed by banks, having acquired $1.6
billion worth in the past two years, half from PNC and the rest
from Cleveland-based Keycorp, Mercantile Bancorporation of St.
Louis and Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Metris charges interest rates on its cards ranging from 15.9
percent to 26.9 percent, depending mainly on how it judges a
customer's creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a price-for-risk philosophy'' tailored to individual
customers, said Alfred A. Galgano, vice president for investor
relations, citing what he said are more than 150 combinations of
rates and fees. He said the Metris system for judging risk is more
refined than those of some banks it is buying credit accounts from,
suggesting that at least some customers may find an advantage in
being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Galgano would not say how many former PNC customers, like Moore,
refused to accept Metris' terms, only that there was a ``fair
amount of attrition,'' but no more than expected. He also said that
some PNC customers were no doubt headed for higher rates even had
there been no transfer, either because of the end of an
introductory rate or, say, a deteriorating pattern of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mukri, spokesman for the Comptroller of Currency, which
enforces the notification process for national banks, says he knows
of no serious violations by banks or of consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest resistance tends to come from people who sometimes
carry balances. Those who always pay their cards off immediately
would never be levied the high rates. Those who never pay off their
balances tend to be so financially stretched that they may not
qualify for better rates elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Metris caters mainly to people of moderate income, which Galgano
defined as those earning between $15,000 and $35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In PNC's eyes, Moore belonged to a group of customers it
regarded as geographically incorrect for its business _ that is,
beyond the limits of its physical operations. It announced in
September an agreement to sell these to Metris and then decided
just before Christmas to sell the rest of its credit-card
operation, 3.3 million accounts serviced in Wilmington, Del., to
the Wilmington-based MBNA Corp., the industry's No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate that a bank will pay for a card account ranges
from $50 to $180, depending on creditworthiness and usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Williams, a spokesman for PNC, said that he knew
nothing of how Metris is handling his bank's former customers and
that the bank has no obligation to them. Asked specifically about
Moore's contention that he had been delivered up to sharks,
Williams said he ``would disagree'' with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon to sell a business that has accounts, and
at which point it now becomes the business of the successor,'' he
said. ``The customer by law has to be informed of any change in
terms and has the option not to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as competition for creditworthy customers has put downward
pressure on credit-card rates, profit margins have withered by
two-thirds in the past seven or eight years, said Allen W. Sanborn,
president of RMA, a Philadelphia-based association of bank lenders.
``Some customers you just can't make any money on,'' he said, even
when credit-card issuers raise late fees and other penalties to try
to offset the effect of lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the California analyst, figured that pretax returns to
lenders on card balances has now fallen four straight years, to 2.5
percent in 1998 from 3.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   High fees themselves have now created a backlash, one reflected
in congressional efforts to curb abusive credit-card terms. Rep.,
John LaFalce, D-N.Y., plans to introduce legislation on Tuesday
covering various practices, like hidden rates and aggressive
solicitations, and requiring prominent disclosure of increasingly
heavy penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The measure planned by LaFalce, the ranking minority member on
the House Banking Committee, would give a consumer who is hit with
a higher interest rate the right to pay off the balance at the
earlier terms. ``It's only simple fairness,'' said Gary Luczak, a
spokesman for LaFalce.

FOX ON THE SCENT OF LIVE TALES FROM THE CRYPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geraldo Rivera broke into Al Capone's vault to find an empty
bottle. A year or two later, on Halloween, William Shatner tried to
rouse Harry Houdini from the dead. Not logical, Spock could have
told him.
</P>
<P>
   So TV has a history of beguiling the gullible with deliciously
dumb stunts. But unlike most previous spectacles, Fox's over-gassed
pyramid scheme Tuesday night carries a sort of quasi-scientific
stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt'' will feature a
``flashlight cam'' as Fox, host Maury Povich _ next week on Maury:
cross-dressing pharaohs _ and their Egyptian cronies traipse into a
5,000-year-old, previously undisturbed tomb on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a three-hour tape delay for West Coast viewers.
Still, that's closer to live than anything Fox is likely to find in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is conducting its crypt crawl with the blessing of the
government of Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization and Zahi A. Hawass, pre-eminent
Egyptologist and undersecretary of state of Egypt's Giza Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   But without the blessing, one supposes, of the deceased ancients
who may find themselves on display.
</P>
<P>
   This could happen to any of us. Our mortal remains are peaceably
salted away for five millennia. Then some TV crew barges in for the
purpose of entertaining bored, overweight teenagers halfway across
the globe so ratings will be artificially boosted and local TV
stations can charge more for vaginal disinfectant commercials.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what's happening Tuesday night. Could be a
compelling argument for cremation.
</P>
<P>
   I can't profess expertise, but with Hawass leading the way, Fox
apparently will poke into several dark holes.
</P>
<P>
   It's something about the pyramid of Queen Khamerernebty II and
the sealed Tomb of the Unknown, in the vicinity of the burial place
of Kai, high priest to Senefru, Khafre and Tofu. Wait, sorry, it's
Khufu; Tofu's buried at Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   But however many syllables you want to wrap around it, it comes
down to Hawass, Povich et al. hoping to stumble onto a mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Not many decades ago, Egyptian mummies were so plentiful and
lightly regarded that they were burned for fuel. Now they're the
stars of TV specials.
</P>
<P>
   Count on Fox to milk this event for the whole two hours before
we get a peek at anything nifty. And because it's Fox, I expect
chatter about bloodcurdling ancient curses, as well as old movie
footage of giant mummies lumbering around and creeping out
mustachioed English actors.
</P>
<P>
   Are we scared, or what? Wouldn't it be great if they finally
busted into a tomb, a mummy sat upright with its arms extended and
Povich didn't stop running till he was aboard his plane in Cairo?
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you were expecting pure science? Go give yourself a
good whack on the instep and listen to executive producer Peter
Isacksen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your mother's Egypt,'' Isacksen crowed in a recent
interview. ``I mean, we're going to show it in a really new,
inventive, Fox-like way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned for ``World's Scariest Mummy Chases.''

BILL WOULD REGULATE FIREARMS AS A CONSUMER PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A toy gun, gun control advocates like to point out,
is subject to more regulations than a handgun that kills.
</P>
<P>
   They say they hope that will change Tuesday with the
introduction of a bill to require the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms to regulate guns like any other consumer product, such
as drugs or cars, for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that our government is powerless to regulate
this industry and is unable to warn consumers of the risks guns
pose,'' said Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode
Island, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Senator Robert
Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, guns would be subject to consumer health and
safety regulations. ATF would be able to recall a gun model if it
is defective, set minimum safety standards, require warning lables
and recall a product that is defective or unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the bill's passage are dim in such a gun-friendly
Congress. But, as lawsuits mount against the gun industry, it is
important because it parallels the tobacco industry's fight to
simultaneously fend off legal action in court and a congressional
push to regulate its products.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control supporters hope the bill may eventually figure into
settlement discussions with the industry, even if it fails in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the tobacco industry, the gun industry so far has
rejected attempts to impose consumer and safety regulations on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already a much more heavily regulated industry than
other industries out there,'' said Richard Feldman, president of
the American Shooting Sports Council. ``The last I checked you
didn't need a firearms license to sell a toy gun, and you didn't
need a background check or a fingerprint check to buy a toy gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said lawsuits don't stem from the production of faulty
products as much as from a gun's misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the ATF be testing to see whether children can bite the
trigger off a gun and ingest it?'' he asked. ``We have never been
sued for this. We get sued because the gun does what it is supposed
to do: it is fired, but in the wrong direction, so that it hurts
someone or some property.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun control advocates and others insist that the wave of
lawsuits claiming that firearms are faulty products and that guns
are a public nuisance and a health hazard has come about precisely
because of the absence of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association pointed out, in a letter of support
to Torricelli, that the Governmental Accounting Office reported
that one-third of gun accidents that kill children could have been
prevented by requiring trigger locks and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, senior lawyer at the Violence Policy Center, a
Washington gun control group, pointed out that firearms kill more
Americans every year than all household and recreational products
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step toward ending the gun industry's deadly
immunity from regulation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for legislative action, however, are poor in a
Congress dominated by gun control opponents and National Rifle
Association supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders whether in a Republican-controlled Congress a bill
to give ATF the power to regulate the gun industry has a snowball's
chance in hell,'' said Carl T. Bogus, a professor of law and expert
in product liability at the University of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the bill dies, gun control advocates say it is
essential to have Congress push for concesssions from the gun
industry _ especially in the wake of reports last week that
industry representatives already have begun preliminary discussions
with some of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill provides a ``benchmark'' for what constitutes
``real regulation,'' Rand said, it will help ensure that the
plaintiffs do not let the gun industry off the hook unless it
agrees to be regulated.

   Face-to-face interactions between patient and pharmacist may
become a thing of the past with more people turning to the Internet
to take the bureaucracy out of healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of standing in line at drugstores and waiting for a
pharmacist to hand over prescription drugs, many patients are
opting to order medications online.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore chains like Rite Aid and Walgreens established online
prescription refill services two years ago, enabling patients to
order drugs from the Internet and pick them up when they're ready.
</P>
<P>
   But now one company is claiming to go one step further in
customer convenience by allowing patients to order drugs and
receive a pharmacist consultation via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual'' pharmacy Drugstore.com in Redmond, Wash., started
its online service last week (http://drugstore.com). The store
allows a patient to receive medications in the mail by filling out
information from the doctor's prescription. Customers create a
patient profile by completing online forms about medical
conditions, current medications and known drug allergies.
Drugstore.com pharmacists review the information, contact the
patient's doctor if necessary and alert the customer to the
processing status of the prescription.
</P>
<P>
   When the prescription is ready, customers pay by sending
credit-card information to an encrypted site.
</P>
<P>
   Questions to the pharmacist can be sent via e-mail or phone.
Medications are meant to arrive within five business days.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs that may be abused, such as morphine and
amphetamines, cannot legally be prescribed by e-mail or phone, and
are thus not available through online services.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com boasts better prices than other pharmacies, thanks
to its lower overhead. A 30-day, 10 milligram prescription for the
antihistamine Claritin costs $58.50 plus $4.95 shipping from
Drugstore.com (shipping costs are free if total purchases are more
than $75). Rite Aid and Walgreens stores in San Francisco charge
$77.69 and $76.39, respectively. (Drug prices vary widely from
state to state.)
</P>
<P>
   Andy Stergachis, director of pharmacy services and quality
assurance at Drugstore.com, said the company aimed to provide a
higher level of care than that offered by community pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of convenience and privacy we offer a
better service than most pharmacies. We ask the patient to describe
current conditions and speak to the doctor if anything suggests the
dose is not appropriate or there may be adverse reactions with
other prescription or over-the-counter drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stergachis added that an increasingly Web-savvy population means
that people want to use the Internet as a tool to take charge of
their health, shop around for good prices for prescription drugs
and speak to a pharmacist when and where it is convenient for them.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are getting into the on-line prescription
business. Medicaledge.com in Lawrence, N.Y., started an online
prescription drug ordering service last month
(http://www.medicaledge.com). Customers place orders online and
then either fax in prescriptions or have their physicians call them
in. A second company, Express Scripts in St. Louis, is also about
to launch an online prescription Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone welcomes the advent of online prescriptions.
Carmen A. Di Cello, chief executive officer of the Pennsylvania
Pharmacists Association in Harrisburg and the owner of two
pharmacies, said the Internet's invasion into prescription
medications represented a disturbing trend in patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not selling books, we're selling medications. Patients
need a continuous face-to-face relationship with their pharmacist.
And the pharmacist should be developing relationships with the
physicians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that drug companies are gouging the public
with inflated drug prices and pharmacies are under more and more
pressure to keep their prices low. Instead of initiatives like
Internet drugstores, we should be looking at why pharmaceutical
companies need to mark up their products by as much as 20 to 25
percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many patients, especially older people taking a variety of
medications, require very careful monitoring,'' he said, noting
that one of his own customers mentioned that she had been taking
high doses of aspirin together with a prescription blood-thinner
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't caught that, this woman could have bled to death.
It's the kind of situation that might not be picked up if a
customer's only contact with her pharmacist is over the Internet,''
he said.

U.S. JETS STRIKE IRAQI TARGETS FOR 3RD STRAIGHT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after mounting an attack that Iraq said had
disabled an oil pipeline, American jets attacked a dozen targets in
northern Iraq on Monday. It was the most intense flurry of strikes
since four nights of American and British raids in December,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to what the Pentagon described as Iraqi provocations,
American F-15E jets based in Turkey dropped more than 30
precision-guided bombs in an hour on an array of Iraqi air defense
sites including anti-aircraft artillery, communication centers and
radio towers, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive day of American air strikes in
Iraq, in a pattern of increasingly broad and aggressive attacks by
American and British jets patrolling the no-flight zones in
northern and southern Iraq in the wake of December's raids.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday that American
jets ``may or may not'' have disrupted an oil pipeline between Iraq
and Turkey when they attacked a radio tower in northern Iraq on
Sunday, but that they had not set out to disrupt the flow of oil.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tower was a military target because it was used for
communications by Iraqi forces as they challenged American and
British jets patrolling northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to attacks upon our aircraft by targeting those
facilities that allowed the Iraqi forces to place our pilots in
jeopardy,'' Cohen said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials seemed eager to draw attention to the damage to
undercut the Pentagon's statements that the repeated strikes _ on
average, every other day for two months _ have focused on military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq initially said the attack on Sunday had damaged a pumping
station, but on Monday, when Iraqi officials took journalists to
show them the damage, they took them to a radio tower. Images on
CNN clearly showed damage to the site, though the tower remained
standing. Iraq said that Monday's strikes had caused more damage to
the pipeline and killed at least one civilian.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which runs from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan, carries more than a million barrels of oil a day, half of
what Iraq exports under a U.N. program that allows Iraq's
government to raise up to $5.2 billion every six months to buy food
and medicine. John Mills, a spokesman for the U.N. agency that
oversees the program, said the pipeline was shut down on Sunday
evening, reopened briefly and then shut down again. Communications
sites like the one damaged on Sunday are crucial to operating a
pipeline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the disruption depends on the extent of the damage
at the installation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said American jets would continue to strike as long as
Iraqi forces threatened them. Monday's flurry of strikes began, the
Pentagon said, when Iraqi radar sites tracked American jets, which
is seen as a possible prelude to an attack. Operating under orders
allowing them to strike any military targets, not just those that
challenge them directly, the jets pounded an array of military
sites near Mosul.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who was officially
declared Nigeria's next president on Monday, pledged to foster
democracy in a country where years of corrupt military misrule have
squandered vast oil-wealth and restricted the freedom of one in six
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Final results in Saturday's presidential elections showed the
retired general winning a decisive victory, with 63 percent of the
popular vote. But his rival, Olu Falae, seized on reports of fraud
and irregularities to dispute the results, although he did not say
how far he would take his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome appeared to have been accepted by a nation weary
from 16 years of uninterrupted dictatorships and nine convulsive
months that, at times, threatened to irreparably widen the ethnic,
religious and regional fissures in Africa's most populous land.
Lagos _ a base for Falae and a city that has often expressed its
political displeasure with dramatic violence _ was quiet as night
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Obasanjo _ who will inherit a country on the
verge of economic collapse, with the price of oil plummeting to
generational lows _ the United States, Britain and France issued
statements welcoming the election's outcome. Oil companies from the
three countries have billions of dollars invested in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The vote now holds the promise of democratization for the
country's 108 million citizens, who make up a sixth of the
continent's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election is not the end of democracy,'' the president-elect
told reporters in Abuja, the capital. ``Democracy is a process.
Election is just one important event in the process, and democracy
under my own leadership will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was peaceful but marred by what international
observers described as serious fraud and irregularities including
ballot box stuffing and inflated results in some regions. They said
irregularities occurred on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers described the cheating as not significant enough
to change the election's outcome, especially given the wide margin
of victory. Former President Jimmy Carter, however, wrote to the
independent commission overseeing the elections that because of the
fraud, his team of observers could not ``make an accurate judgment
about the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo acknowledged the existence of irregularities, but
called on Falae, a former finance minister, to accept the outcome
for the sake of national unity. In a letter to the election
commission, Falae urged it not to declare the election's final
results. ``We are convinced that we cannot accord recognition to,
nor accept results secured through such blatant subversion of
popular will,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Falae did not say whether he would pursue his challenge. But
there was little evidence that the outcome would generate the
outrage necessary to give momentum to a formal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos State gave Falae 88 percent of its votes and only 12
percent to Obasanjo, the most lopsided margin of the 36 states and
the federal capital territory of Abuja. But even here, most people
interviewed Monday said they were tired of political fighting and
ready to accept the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not happy about the results,'' said Larry Sule, 33, a
banker, who shared the same birthplace, Abeokuta, as Obasanjo, and
who had voted for Falae. ``But I think we should accept the results
and allow Obasanjo to be sworn in in the name of the transition. If
there is a prolonged dispute, going to the courts, the military
might take it as an excuse to prolong their stay.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The loser should accept it in the spirit of
sportsmanship.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lagos is dominated by the Yoruba, one of the three main ethnic
groups in Nigeria, and both candidates are Yoruba, but because of
his military past and his close ties to northerners, Obasanjo is
mistrusted by many Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly here, the subdued reaction to the outcome was
in marked contrast to the enthusiasm heard among many voters on
election day. The acceptance of Monday's announcement seemed to
reflect the realization that in a country ruled by the military for
all but 10 years since independence in 1960, a transition to
civilian rule and genuine democracy could not happen overnight, and
that, as one taxi driver put it, the worst civilian government is
better than the best military government.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Okotobei, 31, an engineer, voiced the widespread
belief in Lagos that powerful military officers had chosen Obasanjo
and imposed him on the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as it is,'' Okotobei said, ``we should accept the result.
We have to gradually phase these old people out of the system. A
democratic culture is difficult to mechanically put in place. It
has to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   During a weeklong campaign, Obasanjo presented himself as a safe
bridge between a future civilian government and military rulers
ever ready to seize back power. By contrast, Falae sold himself as
a clean break from the military past.
</P>
<P>
   According to the final results released Monday, Obasanjo, the
candidate for the People's Democratic Party, won 62.8 percent of
the popular vote or 18.7 million votes. Falae, who was the joint
candidate for two smaller parties, the All People's Party and the
Alliance for Democracy, garnered 37.2 percent or 11.1 million
votes. There were 53 million registered voters, though election
officials suspected only 40 million were genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's party also retained the dominance it had exhibited in
recent elections for local, statewide and national assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy about it,'' said Jeji Jatay, 88, a farmer near
Abuja, which voted overwhelmingly for Obasanjo. ``I want an
Obasanjo government to help the poor and the farmers. By the grace
of God, the Obasanjo government will be a listening government.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... IOC and USOC.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commission specifically cited scholarships, medical expenses
and living expenses for IOC members and their families _ three
areas where Salt Lake organizers engaged in the most known abuses _
as potential trouble spots that should be banned by both the IOC
and the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen the USOC's oversight of the site-selection
process, the commission urged the creation of an independent Office
of Bid Compliance; a prohibition on bid cities participating in
international assistance programs designed to help athletes in
other countries; and the strict application of rules for
international assistance the USOC itself provides.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about assistance to foreign athletes arose last month
in the ethics report on the Salt Lake effort. That report detailed
how $40,000 in USOC assistance money was used to settle a ``debt''
with a Sudanese IOC member who had voted to support staging the
2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations for the IOC was a proposal that a
``substantial majority'' of its members be elected by national
Olympic committees. It said there also should be more ``public
sector'' representatives and athletes chosen by fellow athletes.
Currently, members are chosen by the IOC itself, with Samaranch
exercising great authority over who is named.
</P>
<P>
   Once elected, IOC members should be subject to periodic
reelection and term limits, the commission said. Now, IOC members
can serve until age 80.
</P>
<P>
   To increase openness, the commission called on the IOC to make
its meetings public whenever possible; disclose the results of
yearly financial audits; and implement and enforce a comprehensive
conflict-of-interest policy and rules on disclosure of all gifts
offered to members.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also urged the IOC and the USOC to work
cooperatively to have the IOC designated a ``public international
organization,'' which could make its members subject to an
international anti-bribery convention adopted by 34 nations _
including the United States _ that took effect Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, because IOC members in nearly all cases are
not considered ``foreign officials,'' their actions in Salt Lake
City are not subject to prosecution under the primary US law
applicable in such instances, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
If, however, the IOC were designated a public international
organization, that law could apply in future such cases on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the IOC would consider the
Mitchell commission's report at a meeting March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, where it is scheduled to consider reforms
and vote on the ouster of members accused of taking improper
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not review the practices of Olympic cities
other than Salt Lake, but Mitchell stressed that many of the
problems had been identified in a 1991 report to the IOC by
officials of Toronto's failed bid to host the 1996 Summer Games.
The Toronto report detailed reports of more than two dozen IOC
members violating rules on travel expenses and airline tickets,
among other alleged abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the
consequences of such improper behavior,'' Mitchell said at the
press conference. ``The Toronto prophesy has come true.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mitchell said he believed the damage done to
the Olympics was severe but not irreparable. Asked how his most
recent effort compared with his work in Northern Ireland, Mitchell
laughed and said: ``That was three and a half years. I hope this
doesn't take that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mitchell on the commission were Kenneth Duberstein, a
former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan; Donald Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association; Jeffrey Benz, a lawyer and former ice skater who is a
member of the USOC board of directors; and Roberta Cooper Ramo,
former president of the American Bar Association.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE REPORT ON OLYMPIC CORRUPTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the principal findings
</P>
<P>
   --The Salt Lake City bid and organizing committees improperly
disbursed things of value in a systematic manner to IOC members,
their relatives, and others to influence or reward a favorable
vote.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC failed to exercise adequate oversight of the Salt
Lake City bid and organizing committees during the selection of
Salt Lake City as a candidate city and as the host city of the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC's governing structure and policies did not effectively
discourage _ and as a result may have encouraged _ a culture of
improper gift giving in the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key recommendations
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC must make fundamental structural changes:
</P>
<P>
   1. A substantial majority of its members should be elected by
the National Olympic Committees, by the International Federations,
and by other constituent organizations. The athlete members should
be chosen by athletes. There should be members from the public
sector who best represent the interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
   2. Its members and leaders should be subject to periodic
reelection with appropriate term limits.
</P>
<P>
   3. Its financial records should be audited by an independent
firm, and the results of the audit disclosed publicly, at least
yearly.
</P>
<P>
   --Bid cities should be prohibited from giving to members of the
USOC or the IOC anything of more than nominal value, and from
directly paying the expenses of members of the USOC or IOC.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC must strengthen its oversight of the site selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC should request the president of the United States to
consider, in consultation with other governments, naming the IOC a
public international organization within the meaning of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, as amended.

`GIFT CREEP' PRECIPITATED OLYMPIC SCANDAL, PANEL CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (s, i and a coding; includes conclusions text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Olympic scandal was spawned by a pervasive
culture of ``gift creep,'' with presents from would-be host cities
growing steadily more extravagant while US and international
Olympic officials ignored or engaged in the abuses themselves, an
independent commission concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, chaired by the former Senate majority leader, George
Mitchell, proposed reforms including stricter controls on
gift-giving by cities vying to stage the Games, greater public
accountability, and diminished contact between bid cities and
international Olympic decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member commission also went beyond its mandate of
focusing on lapses by the United States Olympic Committee by urging
fundamental changes in the International Olympic Committee,
including new rules by which IOC members would be chosen, limits on
their length of service, and the adoption and strict enforcement of
travel, expense and gift rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the Olympic movement has been gravely
damaged,'' Mitchell said at a news conference in New York. ``Reform
must occur on the local, national and international level if that
credibility is to be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference and in an interview afterward, the former
Maine senator chose his words carefully; despite its status as the
most prominent independent panel to review the Olympic scandal thus
far, Mitchell's commission cannot force change. Instead, it can
only hope to win changes by convincing the IOC, the USOC and other
Olympic organizers of their necessity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, drawing on his recent diplomatic experience as a
peacemaker in Northern Ireland, Mitchell sidestepped a suggestion
that he was describing deep-rooted corruption. ``I prefer to use my
own words,'' he said in the interview. ``We believe that it was an
improper gift culture that was widespread and notorious and has to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the report, however, the commission went a step further:
``The culture of improper gift-giving tolerated by the IOC is
potentially illegal and inevitably corruptive. . . . The IOC should
no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate cities to its
members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes to judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound of Canada, vice president of the IOC and chairman
of its committee examining the corruption allegations, said he was
``not surprised'' that the IOC was part of the Mitchell
commission's review. ``We're not perfect by any means,'' Pound
said. `` We've always said the whole question is a two-way street.
Our investigation has shown a climate of major pressure on IOC
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound disputed Mitchell's comment that the IOC was part of an
``improper'' gift culture, as well as the commission's conclusion
that the gift giving was ``corruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have problems with the word `improper,''' Pound said. ``The
IOC is an international organization. It absorbs many cultures
where the giving of gifts is not only proper, but almost
essential.'' He added: ``I do not for a moment accept a broad-brush
characterization of the IOC having a culture of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission stopped short of calling for the removal of the
IOC's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has been widely blamed
for fostering a climate of Olympian excess. Apparently
acknowledging that Samaranch still reigns supreme over the IOC,
Mitchell said: ``We believe the emphasis should be on changing the
system, not on any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the criticism was aimed at the IOC, the USOC
was hardly spared; the commission found that the USOC shares
responsibility for the abuses because it ``failed to exercise
effectively its oversight authority of the gift-giving practices of
the bid and organizing committee in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that ``the USOC did not effectively monitor
the activities of the bid committee's board of trustees or
executive committee.'' The document said that from June of 1991,
when Salt Lake City launched its bid for the 2002 Winter Games, to
June of 1995, when it was awarded the bid, the USOC attended 1 of
23 meetings of the Salt Lake executive committee, and had no
representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Before June of 1995, only one senior staff person of the USOC
attended a meeting of the Board of Trustees. Nor did the USOC make
any attempt to audit bid committee books or records, nor did it
have any representatives working in committee offices, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report suggested that the USOC, by example, had
tacitly endorsed the excessive courting of IOC members. When Salt
Lake was competing with other US cities to win the USOC's
designation as a potential Olympic host, USOC rules prohibited its
members from accepting gifts worth more than $25.
</P>
<P>
   But on visits to Salt Lake, USOC members accepted lodging,
meals, car rentals, entertainment, airfare, ski passes and other
gifts with a total cost approaching $5,000, the commission report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel took pains to present the actions of Salt Lake
organizers in a broader context than an earlier ethics report that
focused solely on the city. For instance, the Mitchell commission
concluded that Salt Lake, on its merits, had earned the right to
host the Games. It also said the improper inducements were often
``triggered by a demand from the taker.'' What Salt Lake organizers
did ``was wrong. But, as we have noted, they did not invent this
culture; they joined one that was already flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials, who created the commission in December to assess
culpability and propose reforms, thanked the panel but withheld a
detailed response until a news conference scheduled for Wednesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent manipulation of the Olympic bid process in the
future, Mitchell's commission proposed that bid cities be
prohibited from giving IOC and USOC members ``anything of more than
minimal value.'' It also suggested that bid cities be banned from
paying the expenses of USOC or IOC members, which instead would be
paid out of central funds administered separately by the IOC and
USOC.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who will soon become
Nigeria's first elected president after 16 years of military
dictatorships, is an anomaly in this country's recent history, and
a man of apparent contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   One of eight generals to have ruled Nigeria since independence
from Britain in 1960, he is best known as the only one to have
given up power voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent where ethnic identity is a critical piece of
self-definition and has been the basis of countless conflicts, he
is trusted by Nigeria's northern Hausa-Fulani, while many of his
fellow Yoruba in the south look at him askance.
</P>
<P>
   Having caused resentment for governing with a strong hand before
1979, the year his first presidency ended, he also gained respect
after being jailed in 1995 as an outspoken critic of the military
dictatorship. He was released from prison only eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded in the rest of Africa and in the West as a defender of
democracy, he is mistrusted by many Nigerians for his military past
and his links to powerful fellow retired generals who are believed
to have bankrolled his road to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   All those contradictions might prove to be both his strengths
and weaknesses over the next four years of his presidency. At 61 _
he turns 62 later this week _ he is a man at once free of the rigid
molds that have divided Africa's most populous nation and lacking
in the bedrock ethnic support that has been the foundation of most
politicians in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Having presented himself during the campaign as a safe bridge
between the present military government and a future civilian
administration, Obasanjo is to assume the presidency on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of his first presidency in 1979, Obasanjo
established a farm about 35 miles north of here, where he raised
pigs and cultivated bananas. He also cultivated the reputation of
an elder statesman, even as he has kept his image as a
short-tempered, gruff soldier. In a ``Who's Who in Nigeria,'' he
listed his hobbies as ``farming, table tennis, snooker, squash.''
</P>
<P>
   During an appearance on national television last week, he scored
points with the audience by alluding to a traditional, earthy
Nigerian stew made with ground melon seeds. It was a successful, if
sincere, version of President Bush's political use of pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I like eating pounded yam, especially with egusi
soup,'' he said. ``And you know that I enjoy it more when I eat
with my fingers. It tastes better when you're able to lick your
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was born in Abeokuta, about 60 miles north of here in
the heart of Yorubaland, on March 5, 1937. In the same city, within
a year of his birth, were born two other future Yoruba giants,
Moshood Abiola, the opposition leader and presumed winner of the
1993 presidential election, and Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the creator of
Afro-beat music and social critic. The Yoruba, along with the
Hausa-Fulani and the Ibo, are one of Nigeria's three main ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian, Obasanjo attended Baptist Boys' High School, along
with Abiola. He worked as a teacher for a year before joining the
army in 1958. After receiving training in Britain and India, he
rose quickly within the ranks. During the Biafran civil war, when
the Ibo tried to secede, he was put in charge of a commando unit
that obtained the surrender of a rebel leader, effectively ending
the fighting in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after the longtime military ruler indefinitely
postponed a promised return to civilian rule, Gen. Murtala Muhammad
staged a coup and began a program to hand over power to civilians
in 1979. But after Muhammad was assassinated in a failed coup,
Obasanjo, his deputy, was named president.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Obasanjo stuck to the program of transition. And
in foreign policy, it was under him that Nigeria, emboldened by the
gush of oil money, began flexing its muscles. In international
diplomatic circles, Nigeria became the leading African opponent of
white-ruled regimes in South Africa _ Obasanjo was one of the few
prominent people to visit Nelson Mandela in jail _ Namibia and the
former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. It also became the center of
liberation movements whose leaders operated out of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   After President Carter came to office with an emphasis on human
rights, the two leaders established a relationship that has lasted
to this day. Obasanjo visited Washington in October 1977. Half a
year later, Nigeria welcomed Carter, who became the first American
president to pay a state visit to a sub-Saharan country. Obasanjo
earned lasting esteem when elections were held in 1979 as planned,
and he stepped down for the civilian president, Shehu Shagari.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But to many of his fellow Yoruba, it was the biggest of many
perceived acts of betrayal. The elections had been close and
Obasanjo had called them in favor of Shagari, a northerner, over an
opponent who was a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos and the rest of Yorubaland, Obasanjo is also remembered
for a violent crackdown on students protesting tuition hikes.
Soldiers also continued to use brutal tactics, and one of the most
famous cases involved the late Fela, his fellow native of Abeokuta
and one of the most vocal critics of the military.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, under Obasanjo's rule, soldiers burned down Fela's
compound in Lagos and threw his 77-year-old mother out a
second-story window. After his mother died of her injuries, Fela
wrote one of his most famous songs, ``Coffin for Head of State,''
which tells, in street slang, how he and his followers carried the
coffin and tried to present it to the general:
</P>
<P>
   waka waka waka waka we reach dem gate o.
</P>
<P>
   waka waka waka we put the coffin down waka.
</P>
<P>
   waka waka Obasanjo dey there with him big fat stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, many Yoruba have not forgiven Obasanjo for the 1979
elections and his ties to the north. ``He's Yoruba, but he has
deceived us,'' said Afusa Oladunni, a 37-year-old civil servant, as
she voted on Saturday, in a typical comment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Obasanjo earned northerners' enduring trust by
yielding power to one of their own. And he used the respect he had
earned outside Nigeria to carry out diplomatic missions for the
United Nations and the British Commonwealth across Africa. A decade
ago, he was considered for the position of U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an African leader, with the possible
exception of Nelson Mandela, who is better known or respected by a
multiplicity of international organizations as Obasanjo is,'' said
Carter, who led a delegation of American election monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said it would be crucial for Obasanjo _ who will now
govern the country as an elected president and not as a military
ruler _ to overcome the distrust of the south. ``I think it will be
a handicap for him,'' Carter said. ``How he reaches out to the
groups who did not support him, especially in the south, will have
important consequences for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida _ who is close to Obasanjo and
believed to have contributed greatly to his recent campaign efforts
_ annulled the results of a presidential election that Abiola, the
Abeokuta native and a billionaire businessman, was on his way to
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola was imprisoned in 1994 for refusing to renounce his claim
to the presidency; Obasanjo angered his fellow Yoruba when he said
that Abiola was ``not a messiah.'' As Nigeria plunged into crisis
under the repressive regime of Gen. Sani Abacha, Obasanjo became an
outspoken critic of the military government and was himself
imprisoned in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He was released only after Abacha's sudden death last June. In
the bewildering series of events that followed, Abiola died in
July, still under government detention. And a few weeks later, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, who had assumed power, announced a timetable
for elections.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement led to many calls inside and outside Nigeria
for Obasanjo to run for the presidency. He is, his campaign argued,
the only Nigerian capable of keeping this fractious country
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great pity that, at every crisis, big or small, people
talk of Nigeria breaking up,'' Obasanjo said last July, four months
before declaring his intention to run. ``The enormous challenge
facing us now is to get beyond these mutual suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Obasanjo has yet to explain how he will meet that
challenge. But it is clearly the one he will face his second time
as president.

EDUCATION REFORM LIKELY TO RENEW PARTY FRICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy is ready to bolster
education like never before, ratcheting up his lifelong commitment
to students with proposals to increase the number of teachers and
salvage flailing schools.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem. Republicans are beating him to it.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after President Clinton urged Congress
during his State of the Union address to ``support what works and
to stop supporting what doesn't'' in education, Republican leaders
have vigorously heeded the call _ and in the process have sparked a
tug-of-war over the issue with Democrats, traditionally keepers of
the education gate.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert demanded a ``smarter partnership on
public education'' during his first weeks on the job. Republican
education bills are on their way in both the Senate and the House.
Last weekend, the Republican radio address was devoted to the
party's ``pursuit to improve education.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, in what may become the first real battle since
the end of impeachment, senators are scheduled to confront
``Ed-Flex'' _ a Republican-originated education flexibility program
designed to expand the power of local communities. It has support
in both parties _ and has been tested in a dozen states _ but many
Democrats, including Kennedy, are loath to see it sail through the
Senate unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many Democrats, fearing the legislation would allow
impoverished students to slip through the cracks, now find
themselves in an awkward position: wanting to put up roadblocks to
a popular education plan. Republicans, on the other hand, are
seizing on education as part of their post-impeachment strategy to
focus on issues _ and may, at least when it comes to Ed-Flex,
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``are trying to have a quick victory, and they're
probably going to get it,'' according to Nina Shokraii Rees,
education policy analyst at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are trying to hold onto this as their issue,'' Rees
said. ``Every poll I see puts Democrats ahead of Republicans on
this issue. But ... Democrats are probably going to have to be a
little more concerned, once Republicans realize how to talk about
education in a very compassionate and serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Ed-Flex bill, co-sponsored by Senators Bill Frist, a
Republican from Tennessee, and Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon,
is written in the language of practicality rather than compassion.
</P>
<P>
   At its core is a simple belief: Public schools that receive
federal funding should spend less time and money on conforming to
government rules, and more time teaching students. To that end,
Ed-Flex lets schools apply for waivers for regulations from seven
federal education programs, including Title I, in which schools
with disadvantaged populations receive government funds.
</P>
<P>
   First conceived by Congress in 1994, Ed-Flex was tested in six
states in 1996, then expanded to 12 states nationwide.
Massachusetts, one of the original six states, has ``taken great
advantage of it,'' according to Interim Commissioner of the
Department of Education, David Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty school districts in Massachusetts have received waivers
since the trial run began _ most of them for Title 1 regulations.
Among them is Wareham, where four waivers have been granted since
1996, and where schools have been able to ``use money in the way we
feel is most effective without the red tape of federal
regulations,'' according to superintendent Wayne Lague.
</P>
<P>
   At the Minot Forest School in Wareham, for example, teachers
funded by Title I were once placed on a separate staff. Students
targeted as disadvantaged were singled out and removed from class
for remedial work.
</P>
<P>
   Now that federal rules are waived, however, the Title I funds
are used to boost the overall workings of the school _ and teachers
are blended into a single staff, allowing for smaller class sizes,
according to Lague.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican, has been a supporter of
Ed-Flex, and has ``chimed in and said it's been a successful
initiative here'' as lawmakers have sought to take it nationwide,
according to his education adviser, Mike Sentance.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats _ including Kennedy, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee _ are not
opposed to the basic concept, and have voted for its trial runs. It
has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, including that of President
Clinton; that is one reason, members of both parties say, that
Republicans have chosen to use Ed-Flex as a vehicle for proving
their ability to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   But there are deep systemic flaws, Kennedy and others believe _
primarily, that without some alterations, the bill will fail to
ensure the funding actually serves disadvantaged students. This
week, as the bill comes up for debate in the Senate, Democrats plan
to attach as many as 12 amendments, which will have the practical
effect of delaying the vote on Ed-Flex.
</P>
<P>
   But to Kennedy, as well as Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle,
there is little choice but to fight for the alterations _ even if
it will be perceived as an effort to stall a popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to provide the flexibility,'' Kennedy said,
using a phrase that has become central to the debate, ``we also
want some accountability.''

CAN MANAGER KNOW EVERYTHING AFTER 2 DAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. Our new manager called us into a meeting on his
second day here and said he had seen enough and knows exactly what
to do. He then read a list of changes to be implemented
immediately. Some make sense, but others are pointless. We were
caught by surprise, and when we asked to meet with him again, he
said that he can't for a while because he's busy. What can we do
now? T.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although your new manager may have ``seen enough,'' it does
not sound like he has heard enough. In today's workplace,
unilateral decision-making tends to generate multilateral
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   However, before automatically concluding that the new manager is
practicing Paleolithic management, it is important to look at the
state of your company, as there can be situations where a more
authoritarian style may arguably be needed, if only for the short
term. For example, the captain of a rapidly sinking ship is not
well-advised to hold a staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the only thing sinking in your company is the
spirit of the employees, you need to set a specific meeting date
with the new manager, the sooner the better. The idea of meeting in
``a while'' is simply a bad idea. You should get your calendar,
approach the manager toward the end of a good day, tell him you
appreciate some of the changes, and then ask him when the best time
is for all of you to meet to discuss the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Let him be the one who talks next. His reaction will tell you if
he is the kind of manager who solves crises or causes them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just finished interviewing a pleasant and affable young man
who seems qualified to work here. However, in reviewing my notes, I
did not write down very much, and I realize that I was doing too
much talking. Should I bring him back for a reinterview, and what
should I tell him? W.M. &QL; 
A. You can certainly bring this applicant back for a reinterview,
and there is no problem telling him that you are interested in
going into more depth in some of the work areas that were touched
upon during your initial meeting.
</P>
<P>
   However, before you rush to bring him back, it is important to
consider a few factors. Some studies have found that interviewers
like applicants in direct proportion to the amount of time that the
interviewers talk. Hence, many applicants are advised to get the
interviewer to do the talking, and your applicant may have played
this card.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, your interviewing style may have caused the
problem. If you meet with him again, the objective should be to
conduct a thorough work history, starting with his earliest jobs,
and moving all the way through the present. The questions should
focus on such issues as responsibilities, likes and dislikes, and
why he left each job. You can add work sample and job knowledge
questions as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that he attempts to interview you instead, politely
try to put him back on track. If he persists, that is data to
consider when determining if he is someone you would like to hire. &QL; 
Q. Although our meetings are supposed to follow a tight agenda,
they regularly get sidetracked by a staff member who focuses on
small-picture issues that relate only to her work. Our manager
allows this person to derail the meeting every time. It is
frustrating to sit through these irrelevant discussions. What can I
say that won't make me sound like I'm not a team player? S.B. &QL; 
A. A true team is open to the concerns, inputs and suggestions of
all the members, so if you fear voicing your ideas, you are not
really on a team in the first place. Most of the people who attend
these meetings are probably just as annoyed by your co-worker's
self-oriented behavior, and your manager's lack of responsiveness.
If this is the case, perhaps those two are the ones who are not
team players.
</P>
<P>
   You can discuss the situation with the small-picture employee,
but there is not much you can say that will cause her to step back
and see the big picture. She is comfortable with her behavior in
the meetings, and apparently the manager is, too.
</P>
<P>
   For this situation to change, you and some of your teammates
should suggest a group discussion to review the ways to make the
meetings more productive. One objective of such a discussion is to
reach a commitment to keep the meetings focused on group-related
matters, with individual matters being discussed in individual
sessions with the manager. This type of approach makes for better
meetings and better teams.

RESEARCH POINTS TO NEW DRUG TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   California researchers say a gene already implicated in breast
cancer appears to play an important role in the development of
prostate cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The finding suggests that a new drug called Herceptin, approved
in September for women with advanced breast cancer, may help combat
prostate cancer, too. Prostate cancer is expected to kill about
37,000 men this year and strike 179,300, according to the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The new research is published in the March issue of Nature
Medicine. In a separate study in the same journal, Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine researchers say they have found a
genetic ``switch'' that may underlie 90 percent of prostate cancers
and may be reversible.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1940s, researchers have known that some cancers,
including prostate cancer, are driven by hormones. In fact, one of
the key treatments for prostate cancer _ along with surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy _ is to deprive the body of hormones
called androgens, by chemical or surgical castration, in order to
slow the growth of tumors.
</P>
<P>
   But if a man with prostate cancer lives long enough, chances are
his cancer will become independent of androgen and learn to grow
again, even if his androgen levels have been kept low. When this
happens, there is no effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no one understood how this independence occurred. But
Dr. Charles L. Sawyers, director of the prostate cancer program at
the University of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles,
said his team now believes that a gene called HER-2/neu, already
known to spur breast cancer growth, is involved. Sawyers said in a
telephone interview Monday that the gene seems to stimulate
androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells, ``even when no
androgen is around.''
</P>
<P>
   The team studied a special strain of mice into which human
prostate tumors were introduced. Initially, these tumors needed
androgen to grow. But as the tumors became androgen-independent,
the researchers noticed that the activity of the HER-2/neu gene was
spontaneously increased. They also showed that by deliberately
giving mice extra quantities of the HER-2/neu gene, the prostate
cancers became androgen-independent.
</P>
<P>
   If the HER-2/neu gene is indeed involved in making prostate
cancer cells androgen-independent, '`we may see a new treatment
modality sooner than we thought,'' noted Dr. Tapio Visakorpi at the
Laboratory of Cancer Genetics at the University of Tampere in
Finland in commentary published with the new study.
</P>
<P>
   The California team is now investigating whether the drug
Herceptin can block this process of androgen-independence.
</P>
<P>
   At Johns Hopkins, Dr. Gary R. Pasternak, director of the
division of molecular pathology, and his team studied tissue
samples from men with prostate cancer. Strikingly, they found that
in about 90 percent, a tumor suppressor gene called pp32, whose
role is to protect against cancer, is turned off in cancerous
tissue, but is still functioning in adjacent, healthy tissue,
Pasternak said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the cancerous tissue, two closely related genes, dubbed the
``evil twins'' and technically called pp32R1 and pp32R2 are turned
on. These genes ``make proteins that are almost identical'' to the
pp32 gene, Pasternak said, ``but they cause tumors. There is
obviously a functional difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be occurring in 90 percent of garden variety
prostate cancer,'' he said. And the same switching mechanism
appears to be involved in breast cancer, he added, although that
research has not yet been published.
</P>
<P>
   The switching from the ``good'' gene to its evil twins suggests
that, through gene therapy or drugs, the switch could be turned
back to the healthy form.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can understand how the switching process works, what
controls it,'' said Pasternak in a prepared statement, ``we can
potentially reverse it. That's our next task.''

ARTS ABROAD: ROMAN A GRIPE STIRS FLAMES AMONG FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Michel Houellebecq is an unlikely new star of French
letters. Slightly built, with thinning hair and a melancholic mien,
he chews nervously on a succession of cigarettes, mumbling when he
is not sighing or silent. He describes himself as a
manic-depressive who becomes excited only when he is writing. His
fiction, which he concedes is fairly autobiographical, reflects a
bleak and loveless world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last fall, with the publication by Editions Flammarion of
his second novel, ``Les Particules Elementaires'' (``Elementary
Particles''), the 40-year-old Parisian suddenly found himself at
the center of ``l'affaire Houellebecq.'' The book was an instant
best seller, with sales exceeding 260,000 to date. But what turned
this success into an ``affaire,'' or scandal, was the passion and
venom with which the book's admirers and critics argued its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides at least agreed on one thing: The book is a frontal
attack on the generation of '68, the French equivalent of the baby
boomers, the middle-aged politicians, businessmen, intellectuals
and the like who are now in power in France. For its fans the book
exposes the empty, confused and frustrated France spawned by the
failed dreams of the 1968 student-protest movement. And its
assaults on so-called ``political correctness'' (another American
import into the French discourse) apparently added to its appeal.
Houellebecq's targets, on the other hand, became his instant
detractors, variously denouncing the book as reactionary,
misogynist, nihilistic and pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   Houellebecq (pronounced WELL-beck) helped things along by giving
countless, often provocative, interviews to newspapers, magazines,
radio and television. When his novel was not short-listed for the
Prix Goncourt last November, he reiterated the familiar charge that
payoffs explain why Goncourt juries invariably reward books
published by three highbrow houses: Editions Gallimard, Grasset and
Seuil. And he later dismissed the winner, Paule Constant's
``Confidence pour Confidence'' (``Secret for Secret''), published
by Gallimard, as mediocre and boring.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents kept tongues wagging. After a bizarre
interview-trial conducted by fellow editors of the literary review
Perpendiculaire, Houellebecq was formally expelled as a founding
member, prompting cries of McCarthyism. The owners of a New Age
campsite called L'Espace du Possible then sought to have ``Les
Particules Elementaires'' seized as libelous for describing the
camp as a kind of free love commune. The author agreed to rename
the campsite Le Lieu de Changement in future editions.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the 394-page novel revolves around two half brothers
whose bohemian mother leaves them to be raised by separate
grandparents as she goes looking for the meaning of life through
sex and meditation. One brother, Bruno Clement, who spends his life
trying to satisfy his sexual obsession through masturbation and
prostitutes, ends up in a psychiatric hospital. The other, Michel
Djerzinski, who feels no sexual desire, culminates his career as a
molecular biologist by eliminating the need for sex and procreation
through human cloning.
</P>
<P>
   The book's generational element is that Bruno was born in 1956
and Michel, like Houellebecq, in 1958. Like the author, they were
children in 1968 and reached adulthood in the early 1980s when the
generation of '68 came to power with the election of France's first
socialist president, Francois Mitterrand. The generation's legacy,
the book maintains, is a France without vision, values or hope.
</P>
<P>
   Houellebecq had already sketched this disaffected view of French
society in 1994 in his first novel, ``Extension du Domaine de la
Lutte'' (literally ``Expansion of the Arena of the Stuggle'')
published in English this month under the title ``Whatever'' by
Serpent's Tail Press, a British company. This 155-page book follows
the narrator and a colleague as they travel the French provinces
giving training courses in computers. The colleague is consumed by
dismay that he is still a virgin at 28. The lonely narrator in turn
views the world with general distaste, a posture that a doctor
finally identifies as depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, then, I'm in a depression,'' the narrator says in
Paul Hammond's translation. ``The formula seems a happy one to me.
It's not that I feel tremendously low; it's rather that the world
around me appears high.''
</P>
<P>
   This book was well received in France, selling a respectable
15,000 copies there and being likened by some critics to Albert
Camus' novel ``The Stranger.'' Houellebecq subsequently published
two books of poetry and one book of essays and interviews, winning
the Grand Prix National des Lettres in 1997. Only with ``Les
Particules Elementaires,'' though, did he become a household name.
(Alfred A. Knopf has acquired it for publication in the United
States.)
</P>
<P>
   Houellebecq attributes attacks on his new novel to the ``pure
and simple jealousy'' of writers not mentioned in an article in Le
Monde listing members of a new generation of literature. In Le
Figaro, this new generation was said to comprise a literary
movement it called ``deprimisme'' (``depressionism''), although
Houellebecq prefers to describe it as new realism.
</P>
<P>
   But some older writers of the '68 generation and intellectuals
who still see the world through the left-right prism also
criticized the book. For them, anyone opposed to abortion, sexual
freedom, environmentalism and European integration has to be
reactionary. In their case against Houellebecq, Perpendiculaire's
prosecuting editors even cited the fact that his expose of the
spiritual desolation of modern life won plaudits from a
conservative Roman Catholic publication.
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing, however, is why ``Les Particules Elementaires''
has proved so popular. The most obvious answer is that many French
share Houellebecq's dark vision of a post-idealistic,
post-ideological France gripped by malaise, unemployment and
growing insecurity, where materialism, hypocrisy and corruption
have long since replaced dreams of a better life. And if people are
looking for someone to blame, why not the generation of '68?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly in his fiction and in interviews, Houellebecq pours
scorn indiscriminately on leftists, rightists, feminists,
environmentalists and anyone who pretends to offer solutions.
``Killing off illusions makes us happier, to know that the past is
dead,'' he said in a recent interview in the offices of Editions
Flammarion. ``People with illusions are stupid. Those with
political illusions are not only stupid but dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   His (or at least his novels') obsession with sex as pornography,
prostitution or at best loveless coupling is in turn seen as a
denunciation of what has happened to human feelings. In his novel
he describes Bruno's visits to popular ``clubs echangistes''
(``exchange clubs'') where couples swap partners and engage in
orgies. But even there, he noted, commercialism is taking over. He
said he visited one club where most guests sat around watching
pornographic movies as a substitute for having sex.
</P>
<P>
   For him that is what sexual liberation has come to: alienation
and solitude. ``The first theory in `Whatever' is that sexual
freedom does not mean that people are equal when it comes to
seduction,'' he said. ``It annoyed me that everyone was talking
about sexuality and ignoring this essential point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The personal nature of his writing has inevitably awakened
interest in its autobiographical content. He admits that much of
his fiction is inspired by his life, although he said that in ``Les
Particules Elementaires'' he sometimes identifies with Bruno and
other times with Michel.
</P>
<P>
   Born on the island of Reunion in 1958 to a mountain guide father
and a hippie mother who were soon divorced, he was raised by his
paternal grandparents outside Paris. ``What I felt was fear of my
father and disgust with my mother,'' he said in a published
interview three years ago. ``It's funny, but she never realized
that I hated her.'' In ``Les Particules Elementaires,'' Bruno's
final revenge is to urinate on his mother's grave.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he recalled, there was ``a panoply of
incomprehensible political movements, leftists, environmentalists,
who awakened in me profound repulsion,'' no doubt setting the stage
for his rejection of traditional politics. The last time that he
voted, he said, was in a 1992 referendum; he opposed the Maastricht
Treaty creating a single European currency and accelerating
European political union.
</P>
<P>
   After studying agronomy at college, he could not find work. He
had begun to write poetry, which gave him some satisfaction, but he
was unemployed for 18 months before being hired as a computer
programmer, an experience that is reflected in ``Whatever.'' He
married, had a child and divorced. He began to drink heavily and
watch television addictively until, as with Bruno in ``Les
Particules Elementaires'' and the narrator in ``Whatever,'' he
checked into a psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, he worked as a computer expert in the French
Parliament, although he says working with computers is a lonely and
depressing activity. He is now on a leave from that job and, after
the financial success of his second novel, evidently has no need to
return. Last month he decided to settle in Dublin, where writers
have always felt at home (and where artists do not pay income tax).
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter how much of a loner he considers himself,
Houellebecq cannot complain that he has not been heard by now. For
his fans he has assumed something of the aura of a guru, although
it irritates him that interviewers ask his views on everything.
``Sartre had opinions on everything,'' he said. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Without sounding any less pessimistic, however, he seems to have
come to terms with his sudden fame. ``I have never published a book
without having the terrifying feeling that no one would ever talk
to me again after reading it,'' he said. ``But it is not exactly
what happens, so perhaps I can't really think that books are
worthless. I have at least done that. It gives me a tiny reason to
think a little more highly of myself.'' &QL;

`GIFT CREEP' PRECIPITATED OLYMPIC SCANDAL, PANEL CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (s, i and a coding; includes conclusions text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Olympic scandal was spawned by a pervasive
culture of ``gift creep,'' with presents from would-be host cities
growing steadily more extravagant while US and international
Olympic officials ignored or engaged in the abuses themselves, an
independent commission concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, chaired by the former Senate majority leader, George
Mitchell, proposed reforms including stricter controls on
gift-giving by cities vying to stage the Games, greater public
accountability, and diminished contact between bid cities and
international Olympic decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member commission also went beyond its mandate of
focusing on lapses by the United States Olympic Committee by urging
fundamental changes in the International Olympic Committee,
including new rules by which IOC members would be chosen, limits on
their length of service, and the adoption and strict enforcement of
travel, expense and gift rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the Olympic movement has been gravely
damaged,'' Mitchell said at a news conference in New York. ``Reform
must occur on the local, national and international level if that
credibility is to be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference and in an interview afterward, the former
Maine senator chose his words carefully; despite its status as the
most prominent independent panel to review the Olympic scandal thus
far, Mitchell's commission cannot force change. Instead, it can
only hope to win changes by convincing the IOC, the USOC and other
Olympic organizers of their necessity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, drawing on his recent diplomatic experience as a
peacemaker in Northern Ireland, Mitchell sidestepped a suggestion
that he was describing deep-rooted corruption. ``I prefer to use my
own words,'' he said in the interview. ``We believe that it was an
improper gift culture that was widespread and notorious and has to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the report, however, the commission went a step further:
``The culture of improper gift-giving tolerated by the IOC is
potentially illegal and inevitably corruptive. . . . The IOC should
no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate cities to its
members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes to judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound of Canada, vice president of the IOC and chairman
of its committee examining the corruption allegations, said he was
``not surprised'' that the IOC was part of the Mitchell
commission's review. ``We're not perfect by any means,'' Pound
said. `` We've always said the whole question is a two-way street.
Our investigation has shown a climate of major pressure on IOC
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound disputed Mitchell's comment that the IOC was part of an
``improper'' gift culture, as well as the commission's conclusion
that the gift giving was ``corruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have problems with the word `improper,''' Pound said. ``The
IOC is an international organization. It absorbs many cultures
where the giving of gifts is not only proper, but almost
essential.'' He added: ``I do not for a moment accept a broad-brush
characterization of the IOC having a culture of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission stopped short of calling for the removal of the
IOC's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has been widely blamed
for fostering a climate of Olympian excess. Apparently
acknowledging that Samaranch still reigns supreme over the IOC,
Mitchell said: ``We believe the emphasis should be on changing the
system, not on any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the criticism was aimed at the IOC, the USOC
was hardly spared; the commission found that the USOC shares
responsibility for the abuses because it ``failed to exercise
effectively its oversight authority of the gift-giving practices of
the bid and organizing committee in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that ``the USOC did not effectively monitor
the activities of the bid committee's board of trustees or
executive committee.'' The document said that from June of 1991,
when Salt Lake City launched its bid for the 2002 Winter Games, to
June of 1995, when it was awarded the bid, the USOC attended 1 of
23 meetings of the Salt Lake executive committee, and had no
representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Before June of 1995, only one senior staff person of the USOC
attended a meeting of the Board of Trustees. Nor did the USOC make
any attempt to audit bid committee books or records, nor did it
have any representatives working in committee offices, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report suggested that the USOC, by example, had
tacitly endorsed the excessive courting of IOC members. When Salt
Lake was competing with other US cities to win the USOC's
designation as a potential Olympic host, USOC rules prohibited its
members from accepting gifts worth more than $25.
</P>
<P>
   But on visits to Salt Lake, USOC members accepted lodging,
meals, car rentals, entertainment, airfare, ski passes and other
gifts with a total cost approaching $5,000, the commission report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel took pains to present the actions of Salt Lake
organizers in a broader context than an earlier ethics report that
focused solely on the city. For instance, the Mitchell commission
concluded that Salt Lake, on its merits, had earned the right to
host the Games. It also said the improper inducements were often
``triggered by a demand from the taker.'' What Salt Lake organizers
did ``was wrong. But, as we have noted, they did not invent this
culture; they joined one that was already flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials, who created the commission in December to assess
culpability and propose reforms, thanked the panel but withheld a
detailed response until a news conference scheduled for Wednesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent manipulation of the Olympic bid process in the
future, Mitchell's commission proposed that bid cities be
prohibited from giving IOC and USOC members ``anything of more than
minimal value.'' It also suggested that bid cities be banned from
paying the expenses of USOC or IOC members, which instead would be
paid out of central funds administered separately by the IOC and
USOC.

ALBRIGHT SCOLDS CHINA ON HUMAN RIGHTS BUT HOLDS OUT HOPE ON JOINING
WTO 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Trying to infuse the troubled relationship between the
United States and China with a new sense of direction, Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright spoke sternly on Monday to the
authorities here about human rights but also encouraged them to
move forward on joining the organization that governs world trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of meetings, Albright told Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
and other senior officials that the United States was disturbed by
their government's crackdown on opposition groups and called on
them to release a number of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights was ``prominent but not dominant,'' said one
administration official, summing up the day.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit came on the heels of the annual report by the
U.S. government that identifies countries with human rights
problems, which was far more critical of China than last year's
report.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright made clear on Monday that the
administration was sticking to an approach that separates human
rights from trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined some time ago that it was not a good idea to
link human rights and trade,'' she said, ``and that we actually
make better progress in both when they are not linked.'' She
emphasized the possibility of membership for China in the World
Trade Organization, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   With relations between Washington and Beijing strained by the
roundup of dissidents, charges that China is trying to hone the
accuracy of its missiles with American technology and a burgeoning
trade deficit, the administration has been eager to sound positive
about China's chances of entering the WTO. Monday's comments about
separating trade organization membership from China's human rights
record were the latest in a series of signals Washington is sending
in an effort to prompt the Chinese to make serious market-opening
offers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge obstacles to reaching an agreement. The
administration would have to win the backing of a good part of the
American business community, which is fractured on the issue of
exactly what markets China must open and how fast. Moreover, China
wants assurances that Congress will drop the annual review of its
``most favored nation'' trade status, an annual congressional
debate over the nature of the economic relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That would require congressional action. And even if the
administration separates China's entry into the trade group from
its human rights record or its role in weapons proliferation, it is
highly unlikely that Congress will separate those issues.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   China has continued a recent series of actions to silence
internal critics of the Communist government by detaining one
dissident late last week and handing down an 18-month sentence in a
labor camp to another, without a trial. A human rights group based
in Hong Kong said on Monday that another dissident planned to form
an independent political party. A recent effort to form such a
party brought several arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit also came as other vexing problems with China
surfaced, including the arrest last week of a Chinese citizen in
California whom federal agents charged with trying to obtain a
component vital to missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, Chinese government officials did not mention
the arrest or other security matters. Instead, they limited their
public criticisms of the United States to its human rights stand.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, with whom Albright spent most of
her time, obliquely warned the United States at a news conference
not to submit a resolution criticizing China's human rights record
at the annual meeting in Geneva this month of the United Nations
Human Rights Commission. He said such ``confrontation'' would not
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is in the midst of a heated internal debate
about whether to go ahead with such a resolution, which is bound to
antagonize the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has characterized Albright's trip as a
``business visit,'' intended to develop a system of regular
meetings between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest level of a constellation of visits to Beijing
in recent and coming days by American officials concerned with
trying to smooth some of the troubled spots in the American-Chinese
relationship and in particular to find a way for China to join the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was here last
week, discussing China's beleaguered economy and its possible route
to membership in the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   China views membership in the World Trade Organization as a
matter of national prestige, and the United States has a virtual
veto over membership in the Geneva-based organization, which is the
rule maker and arbiter in world trade matters.
</P>
<P>
   In return for membership, Washington has insisted that China
provide a detailed schedule for opening its market to foreign
goods. But Chinese officials, facing a severe economic slowdown,
are loath to allow international competitors to go head to head
with decrepit and bloated state-owned enterprises that are laying
off millions of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, is to meet
with Chinese officials in several days to define more closely the
possible terms under which China would gain American support for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sees China's desire for membership as
an opportunity for a tangible accomplishment that could move the
relationship between the two countries forward. The United States
is eager to close a deal in time for a scheduled visit by Zhu to
Washington in early April.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official familiar with Washington's efforts to
get China into the organization said on Monday that it appeared
that Zhu was serious about the talks and understood the positive
aspects of membership.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been contemplating some ``imaginative
transition'' periods for China's entry so that the uncertain
economy here, particularly some sectors including agriculture,
would not be overwhelmed by the immediate lowering of tariffs, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to human rights, the main complaint from China
during Albright's talks was said to be an American proposal for a
missile defense system in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has said that if such a system embraced
Taiwan, its deployment would set off a new arms race and deeply
harm Chinese-American relations. A Pentagon study released last
week portrayed a growing threat to Taiwan from a buildup of
missiles along the Chinese coast facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright countered, according to her spokesman, James Rubin,
that the system, which is in the design stage, was intended to
protect American troops in the region from threats posed by
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   She told the Chinese, Rubin said, that if they improved
relations with Taiwan and stopped their missile buildup near the
island, then the enthusiasm in Washington for the theater missile
defense system would probably wane.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also brought up the Clinton administration's
cancellation last week of a satellite sale to China on the ground
that the purchasing company had ties to the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official said the Chinese expressed less
anger than puzzlement over the cancellation. The Chinese said that
if the United States was interested in reversing its huge trade
deficit with China, the administration should allow the Chinese to
buy high-technology goods. The deficit, which reached an all-time
high of $57 billion last year, is second only to the American trade
deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On a subject that increasingly worries the administration,
Albright urged the Chinese to be more helpful in preventing North
Korea, with whom China has diplomatic and military relations, from
becoming a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese understand it is not in their interest for North
Korea to become a nuclear power, an administration official said,
calling the talks on that subject constructive. But another
official said the Chinese were fairly coy about how much influence
they could or would use with the North Koreans.

 NEW YORK: ... IOC and USOC.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commission specifically cited scholarships, medical expenses
and living expenses for IOC members and their families _ three
areas where Salt Lake organizers engaged in the most known abuses _
as potential trouble spots that should be banned by both the IOC
and the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen the USOC's oversight of the site-selection
process, the commission urged the creation of an independent Office
of Bid Compliance; a prohibition on bid cities participating in
international assistance programs designed to help athletes in
other countries; and the strict application of rules for
international assistance the USOC itself provides.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about assistance to foreign athletes arose last month
in the ethics report on the Salt Lake effort. That report detailed
how $40,000 in USOC assistance money was used to settle a ``debt''
with a Sudanese IOC member who had voted to support staging the
2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations for the IOC was a proposal that a
``substantial majority'' of its members be elected by national
Olympic committees. It said there also should be more ``public
sector'' representatives and athletes chosen by fellow athletes.
Currently, members are chosen by the IOC itself, with Samaranch
exercising great authority over who is named.
</P>
<P>
   Once elected, IOC members should be subject to periodic
reelection and term limits, the commission said. Now, IOC members
can serve until age 80.
</P>
<P>
   To increase openness, the commission called on the IOC to make
its meetings public whenever possible; disclose the results of
yearly financial audits; and implement and enforce a comprehensive
conflict-of-interest policy and rules on disclosure of all gifts
offered to members.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also urged the IOC and the USOC to work
cooperatively to have the IOC designated a ``public international
organization,'' which could make its members subject to an
international anti-bribery convention adopted by 34 nations _
including the United States _ that took effect Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, because IOC members in nearly all cases are
not considered ``foreign officials,'' their actions in Salt Lake
City are not subject to prosecution under the primary US law
applicable in such instances, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
If, however, the IOC were designated a public international
organization, that law could apply in future such cases on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the IOC would consider the
Mitchell commission's report at a meeting March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, where it is scheduled to consider reforms
and vote on the ouster of members accused of taking improper
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not review the practices of Olympic cities
other than Salt Lake, but Mitchell stressed that many of the
problems had been identified in a 1991 report to the IOC by
officials of Toronto's failed bid to host the 1996 Summer Games.
The Toronto report detailed reports of more than two dozen IOC
members violating rules on travel expenses and airline tickets,
among other alleged abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the
consequences of such improper behavior,'' Mitchell said at the
press conference. ``The Toronto prophesy has come true.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mitchell said he believed the damage done to
the Olympics was severe but not irreparable. Asked how his most
recent effort compared with his work in Northern Ireland, Mitchell
laughed and said: ``That was three and a half years. I hope this
doesn't take that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mitchell on the commission were Kenneth Duberstein, a
former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan; Donald Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association; Jeffrey Benz, a lawyer and former ice skater who is a
member of the USOC board of directors; and Roberta Cooper Ramo,
former president of the American Bar Association.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE REPORT ON OLYMPIC CORRUPTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the principal findings
</P>
<P>
   --The Salt Lake City bid and organizing committees improperly
disbursed things of value in a systematic manner to IOC members,
their relatives, and others to influence or reward a favorable
vote.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC failed to exercise adequate oversight of the Salt
Lake City bid and organizing committees during the selection of
Salt Lake City as a candidate city and as the host city of the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC's governing structure and policies did not effectively
discourage _ and as a result may have encouraged _ a culture of
improper gift giving in the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key recommendations
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC must make fundamental structural changes:
</P>
<P>
   1. A substantial majority of its members should be elected by
the National Olympic Committees, by the International Federations,
and by other constituent organizations. The athlete members should
be chosen by athletes. There should be members from the public
sector who best represent the interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
   2. Its members and leaders should be subject to periodic
reelection with appropriate term limits.
</P>
<P>
   3. Its financial records should be audited by an independent
firm, and the results of the audit disclosed publicly, at least
yearly.
</P>
<P>
   --Bid cities should be prohibited from giving to members of the
USOC or the IOC anything of more than nominal value, and from
directly paying the expenses of members of the USOC or IOC.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC must strengthen its oversight of the site selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC should request the president of the United States to
consider, in consultation with other governments, naming the IOC a
public international organization within the meaning of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, as amended.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it sometimes appears as if all good plays book
passage to New York on British Airways, then take heart from the
all-American flight plan of ``Snakebit,'' David Marshall Grant's
finely observed, beautifully acted comedy-drama about the flaming
out of friendship and marriage in a deceptively sunny precinct of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It took several years for Grant, an actor best known for his
Tony-nominated role as an anguished Mormon in ``Angels in
America,'' to secure a production for this play, his first, but his
patience has been rewarded. Under the intuitive stewardship of the
director Jace Alexander, ``Snakebit'' renders Grant's brittle
characters with such insight and wryness that by the play's end,
you may feel that you've been assigned a seat inside their
uncomfortable skins.
</P>
<P>
   The four-character drama had a brief, well-received run in the
fall at tiny Grove Street Playhouse in the West Village; it
reopened Monday night in Union Square at the Century Theater, where
Dean Taucher's realistic mock-up of a sun-dappled bungalow looks
even better. The acutely balanced performances, too, have been
refined with age. David Alan Basche, Jodie Markell, Geoffrey
Nauffts and, especially, Michael Weston have sharpened the elbows
of these variously driven, drifting and dissatisfied souls, whose
proximity to one another seems only to intensify their sense of
anxious isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The events of ``Snakebit'' revolve around a weeklong stay in the
home of Michael ( Nauffts), a gay social worker, by his childhood
best friend, Jonathan ( Basche), and his wife, Jenifer (Ms.
Markell). The clearest source of tension in the household is
handsome, volatile Jonathan, a New York actor who, under
consideration for a part in a major action-adventure movie, spends
much of his time dialing his voice mail, shouting into the phone at
his agent's receptionist and bullying Jenifer, a fragile former
actress who frets continually over her inadequacies as well as over
the lingering illness of the 6-year-old daughter they have left in
the care of a relative in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jenifer's worries about her daughter's health, it seems, can be
traced back a dozen years, to just before her marriage to Jonathan,
when she had a fling with Michael, becoming the last woman he slept
with. The couple's unloading of their problems, however, could not
come at a worse time for Michael, who is struggling with his own
anxieties and losses: his companion, Gary, a radio talk show host
who feigns swaggering heterosexuality on the airwaves, has
abandoned him for a younger man, just as Michael has decided that
he wants to adopt one of his clients, an abused teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the equitable, television-style apportionment of
traumas to the cast members that gives ``Snakebit'' its bite. This
is not ``E.R.'' transferred to a house off a freeway exit. Rather,
it is the play's uncompromisingly rueful picture of these mixed-up
30-somethings, whose harsh emotional lives have browned and thinned
out like unshaded California lawns, that provides the drama with a
suppleness undiscoverable in your average dramatic series.
</P>
<P>
   To Grant's credit, ``Snakebit'' has no cathartic scream-out, the
sort you imagine that Jonathan, the story's alpha-male, is spoiling
for. (The play takes such a dim view of direct conflict, in fact,
that Basche's character is made to seem patently boorish every time
he raises his voice.)
</P>
<P>
   The air of alienation that envelops the bungalow extends in
Grant's imagination to all of Los Angeles, a place for which he
seems to harbor little but contempt. ``This is the most unrelaxing
place I've ever been,'' Jenifer declares, as a leaf blower drones
angrily in the yard next door. Grant sees the deafening gardening
tool as emblematic of life in a ersatz city where meaningful
conversation is forever being drowned out, where all phone calls
involve stomach-churning business decisions, where natives like the
mysterious young man (Weston) who shows up on Michael's doorstep
one day speak in the tongue-tied cadences of the vaguely literate.
</P>
<P>
   There is no weak link in this cast. Nauffts is superb as a
decent man exhausted by disappointment and confused enough by life
to still be half in love with Jenifer, played to perfection by Ms.
Markell, who allows you to see with amazing clarity the gaps in
Jenifer's personality and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Basche is the heavy of the piece, and he handles the role of
resident jerk with a suave relish. Only when he is called upon to
egg the other actors on to the next level of confrontation does he
become too strident; this may have come about as a result of
playing to the larger house. Weston has a variety of choice, funny
moments as the dorky visitor with a hidden agenda. His Valley-boy
flakiness makes him the type of Angeleno to whom New Yorkers love
to feel entirely superior.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is writing about a world with which he is on intimate
terms _ the sendup of Hollywood deal-making, encapsulated in
Jonathan's negotiations, is hilarious _ and he makes an audience
feel smart and entertained in that world, too. That is no small
feat. Whether these are the kinds of people you want in your life
is beside the point. Once you've seen ``Snakebit,'' they're there.

FRENCH, ITALIANS DEFY U.S. IN IRANIAN OIL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Thumbing their noses at American opposition to
investments in Iran, a consortium of French, Italian and Iranian
oil companies announced Monday that they had signed a $998 million,
10-year contract to redevelop a giant oil field there.
</P>
<P>
   Elf Petroleum Iran, a subsidiary of the French oil company Elf
Aquitaine, will be the lead partner in the project, which also
involves a subsidiary of Eni of Italy and National Iranian Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Elf Aquitaine, Thomas Saunders, said the company
expected no retribution from the United States under the Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act, which threatens sanctions against any country that
invests more than $20 million in either country.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached last May between the United States
and the European Union, the Clinton administration agreed not to
apply sanctions against another French oil company, Total, which
proceeded with a $2 billion gas-exploration contract in Iran in
1997 in defiance of the American law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the same treatment,'' Saunders said Monday.

BUSH `MAKING UP MIND' ON WHETHER TO FORM EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is expected to announce
Tuesday that he is forming an exploratory committee to raise money
for a possible presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters Monday at a bridge dedication in San Saba,
Texas, that Tuesday he will answer the question of yes, no or
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the process of making up my mind as to whether I'll
establish an exploratory committee,'' Bush said later in Austin.
``Stay tuned. Something will be happening pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Forming an exploratory committee with the Federal Election
Commission is a preliminary tool used by would-be presidential
candidates to allow them to legally raise money to gauge support
for a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still issue briefs, seeing what the politics are in
the different parts of the country, but raising money is the most
important aspect of an exploratory committee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   With a shortened primary calendar that will require candidates
to campaign and advertise in several major media markets at once,
presidential candidates expect to need about $45 million to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole spent $42 million in
his 1996 primary campaign, according to FEC records. The governor's
father, former President Bush, spent $38 million in his 1992
re-election primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, North Carolina politicians met with Bush at the
Governor's Mansion to urge him to run for president and name
home-state native Elizabeth Dole as his running mate. Mrs. Dole,
wife of the 1996 nominee, recently resigned as head of the American
Red Cross to explore the possibility of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Elizabeth Dole will be Governor Bush's running mate,''
said North Carolina state Rep. Bill Miner. ``There is so much
support for both Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush that we wanted
to make a statement that we hope he is leading the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Miner said the North Carolina lawmakers believe Bush should head
the ticket because he has a proven record of winning election and
re-election in Texas. He said Mrs. Dole has held only appointed
positions. Dole served as a Cabinet official in the Reagan and Bush
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Mrs. Dole ``a fine, fine person'' whom he respects.
But he said he made no commitments to the North Carolina
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand that should I decide to run, a fellow has got
to get nominated before he can even start thinking of naming a vice
president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Senate GOP leader Patrick Ballantine came out of
his meeting with Bush believing the governor will run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that he's going to run. I hope that's not
just wishful thinking,'' Ballantine said. ``I didn't hear him say
that he was going to run, but we're all praying that he does.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina delegation delivered a letter from 15
Republican state senators and 38 of the state's 54 GOP House
members urging Bush to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also met with delegations from Connecticut and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right message, the right definition of a
compassionate conservative to appeal not just in the South but in
the Northeast,'' said Connecticut House Republican leader Bob Ward.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins noted that his state
will have one of the nation's earliest primaries, Feb. 26, 1999,
less than a year from now. He noted that South Carolina provided
former President Bush with a major victory on his road to the 1988
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina is very much Bush country. It will be Governor
Bush country if he decides to run,'' Wilkins.

BREAKING UNITY, 2 BANKS ACCEPT RUSSIAN REPAYMENT TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The unity of a key group of Western banks holding $15
billion in defaulted, short-term Russian treasury debt frayed on
Monday night after two of its members, including the leader, broke
ranks to accept a vaguely defined Russian repayment package of
rubles and new bonds regarded as nearly worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Both Deutsche Bank, which heads the group, and Chase Manhattan
agreed to the Russian terms, said to be worth about 5 cents on the
dollar, or one-twentieth of the face value of the investments.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, a Chase spokesman in London, said his bank had
agreed to exchange only its own holdings _ not those of its clients
_ for the Russian package.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, by contrast, went ahead last Friday and agreed to
the Russian terms for part of the holdings owned by the bank and
some clients.
</P>
<P>
   Russia set off financial turmoil last August when it defaulted
on billions in treasury debt, about a third of that owed to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Russian economy, in the meantime, continues to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers said that there was never much expectation that Russia
would offer full repayment terms, but the terms accepted by
Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan weakened the power of the Western
bankers group to negotiate a better deal. Some members of the group
were particularly angry that Deutsche Bank had not informed them in
advance that it would accept a repayment offer they had all
rejected months earlier as too low.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank argued on Monday that there was no conflict of
interest between its position on the committee and its partial
acceptance of the Russian terms. The move, however, led to a
special meeting of the 19-member bankers group here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers said that the group was divided over the action taken by
Deutsche Bank and Chase in accepting the Russian package. But,
rather than force Deutsche Bank to quit as head of the committee,
the panel resolved to abolish the position altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of the banks opposed to Deutsche wanted to do
something to register their opposition, so the committee will go
forward without a chair,'' said one banker, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another said that Deutsche Bank had been prepared to quit if its
colleagues at the meeting had demanded this, ``but there was some
support for Deutsche's position.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankers said the division continued between those who
favored accepting Russian terms on the ground that ``if you are
going to have a bad deal, it's better to have it sooner then
later'' and others who wanted much tougher action against Russia,
including litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's payment terms affect GKO treasury bills and OFZ Finance
Ministry bonds. Some members of the group oppose the terms, and a
banker who spoke on condition of anonymity said that there was
pressure on Deutsche Bank to resign as head of the committee,
particularly since it had agreed to Moscow's proposal without
keeping its partners informed.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is also head of a separate, so-called London Club
of creditors owed $30 billion in unpaid Soviet-era debt, and there
was speculation that its position on that panel might now also be
called into question by other banks.
</P>
<P>
   The newest debacle is the latest in a long story. Earlier
negotiations collapsed in December, leaving creditors pressing for
better terms and complaining that Russia had not given a detailed
explanation of how any new bonds and ruble payments could be used.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians set a March 5 deadline for acceptance of their
offer with a final date of March 15. But creditors, arguing that
the Russian terms were worth as little as 2.5 cents on the dollar,
pressed for an extension to April 30.

BUSH EXPECTED TO FORM CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has been weighing a
potential presidential bid for months, is expected to announce
Tuesday he will form an exploratory committee that will enable him
to raise money for a potential White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a now-familiar scene played out on the lawn of the
Governor's Mansion, Bush picked up endorsements Monday from
Republican lawmakers in three other states for a possible race.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators from Connecticut and North and South Carolina
dropped by to urge the Republican governor to run for president in
2000. North Carolina is the home state of Elizabeth Dole, another
possible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they got the same answer Bush has now given
countless other times: He's thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut (instinct) is that he will run,'' South Carolina state
Sen. Patrick Ballantine said when asked later if he thinks Bush
will run. ``I hope that's not just wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear him say that he was going to run. But we're all
praying that he does,'' Ballantine added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to edge closer to a White House run by
announcing which way he is leaning on the presidential question. He
is widely expected to say he is forming an exploratory committee,
but he wouldn't discuss his plans Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``Something will be happening pretty
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement on his candidacy, should such a decision
be made, isn't expected until after the Texas Legislature adjourns
May 31.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, lawmakers from around the country have made
their way to Austin to announce their support for Bush. The visits
have allowed the governor to amass a wide variety of endorsements
without having to leave the state to drum up support for a
potential candidacy while the Legislature is in session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm in the process of making up my mind as to
whether or not I will take the process a step further,'' Bush told
reporters Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those calling on the governor Monday cited similar reasons of
past endorsement delegations as to why they want him to run. They
also carried letters signed by a number of their fellow GOP
lawmakers who also want him in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he is the best candidate, the best man for the job.
We believe he has the ability to bring everyone together,'' said
South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he runs,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Rep. David Miner said he and other Bush
supporters aren't totally overlooking Dole in making their
endorsement for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Elizabeth Dole will be Governor Bush's running mate
... We hope he's leading the ticket, and we hope he will consider
Elizabeth Dole at the appropriate time,'' Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Robert M. Ward, minority leader of the Connecticut
General Assembly, said he believes Bush has the right message to
appeal to voters in the South and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday's visits, along with those by other Republican
lawmakers, were spontaneous trips, not orchestrated events planned
by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when people express a desire to come down, it
requires a certain sense of coordination. I don't want people
coming to Texas, and I'm not available for lunch,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-state lawmakers said they had called Bush's
representatives wanting to know how best to show him their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't asked to come. I asked if I could come,'' Wilkins
said.

 (s, i and a coding)  
 NEW YORK: ... IOC and USOC.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commission specifically cited scholarships, medical expenses
and living expenses for IOC members and their families _ three
areas where Salt Lake organizers engaged in the most known abuses _
as potential trouble spots that should be banned by both the IOC
and the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen the USOC's oversight of the site-selection
process, the commission urged the creation of an independent Office
of Bid Compliance; a prohibition on bid cities participating in
international assistance programs designed to help athletes in
other countries; and the strict application of rules for
international assistance the USOC itself provides.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about assistance to foreign athletes arose last month
in the ethics report on the Salt Lake effort. That report detailed
how $40,000 in USOC assistance money was used to settle a ``debt''
with a Sudanese IOC member who had voted to support staging the
2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations for the IOC was a proposal that a
``substantial majority'' of its members be elected by national
Olympic committees. It said there also should be more ``public
sector'' representatives and athletes chosen by fellow athletes.
Currently, members are chosen by the IOC itself, with Samaranch
exercising great authority over who is named.
</P>
<P>
   Once elected, IOC members should be subject to periodic
reelection and term limits, the commission said. Now, IOC members
can serve until age 80.
</P>
<P>
   To increase openness, the commission called on the IOC to make
its meetings public whenever possible; disclose the results of
yearly financial audits; and implement and enforce a comprehensive
conflict-of-interest policy and rules on disclosure of all gifts
offered to members.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also urged the IOC and the USOC to work
cooperatively to have the IOC designated a ``public international
organization,'' which could make its members subject to an
international anti-bribery convention adopted by 34 nations _
including the United States _ that took effect Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   As it now stands, because IOC members in nearly all cases are
not considered ``foreign officials,'' their actions in Salt Lake
City are not subject to prosecution under the primary US law
applicable in such instances, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
If, however, the IOC were designated a public international
organization, that law could apply in future such cases on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the IOC would consider the
Mitchell commission's report at a meeting March 17 and 18 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, where it is scheduled to consider reforms
and vote on the ouster of members accused of taking improper
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not review the practices of Olympic cities
other than Salt Lake, but Mitchell stressed that many of the
problems had been identified in a 1991 report to the IOC by
officials of Toronto's failed bid to host the 1996 Summer Games.
The Toronto report detailed reports of more than two dozen IOC
members violating rules on travel expenses and airline tickets,
among other alleged abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the
consequences of such improper behavior,'' Mitchell said at the
press conference. ``The Toronto prophesy has come true.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Mitchell said he believed the damage done to
the Olympics was severe but not irreparable. Asked how his most
recent effort compared with his work in Northern Ireland, Mitchell
laughed and said: ``That was three and a half years. I hope this
doesn't take that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mitchell on the commission were Kenneth Duberstein, a
former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan; Donald Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association; Jeffrey Benz, a lawyer and former ice skater who is a
member of the USOC board of directors; and Roberta Cooper Ramo,
former president of the American Bar Association.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE REPORT ON OLYMPIC CORRUPTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the principal findings
</P>
<P>
   --The Salt Lake City bid and organizing committees improperly
disbursed things of value in a systematic manner to IOC members,
their relatives, and others to influence or reward a favorable
vote.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC failed to exercise adequate oversight of the Salt
Lake City bid and organizing committees during the selection of
Salt Lake City as a candidate city and as the host city of the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC's governing structure and policies did not effectively
discourage _ and as a result may have encouraged _ a culture of
improper gift giving in the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key recommendations
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC must make fundamental structural changes:
</P>
<P>
   1. A substantial majority of its members should be elected by
the National Olympic Committees, by the International Federations,
and by other constituent organizations. The athlete members should
be chosen by athletes. There should be members from the public
sector who best represent the interests of the public.
</P>
<P>
   2. Its members and leaders should be subject to periodic
reelection with appropriate term limits.
</P>
<P>
   3. Its financial records should be audited by an independent
firm, and the results of the audit disclosed publicly, at least
yearly.
</P>
<P>
   --Bid cities should be prohibited from giving to members of the
USOC or the IOC anything of more than nominal value, and from
directly paying the expenses of members of the USOC or IOC.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC must strengthen its oversight of the site selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   --The USOC should request the president of the United States to
consider, in consultation with other governments, naming the IOC a
public international organization within the meaning of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, as amended.

 &HT;    Lockheed workers set to strike if negotiations break down
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pat Stripling remembers the last strike at the
Lockheed Martin Corp. plant in Marietta, Ga. It happened in 1977
and lasted three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked the picket line with my dad,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stripling, who followed her father into a career at the
plant, is ready to do it again, unless Machinists union leaders and
management come up with a better contract than the one rejected by
workers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent appears to have stemmed more from job security, benefits
and workplace issues than from 3 percent annual raises offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The icing on the cake looked good,'' Stripling said of the
deal, rejected by a 68 percent vote. ``The ingredients were bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the vote, union leaders on Monday sent a five-day
strike notice to plant management. That could trigger a walkout
next week by the union, which represents 4,200 of the plant's 9,200
employees.
</P>
<P>
   A strike at Cobb County's largest private employer, however, can
still be averted if the two sides quickly re-enter negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to sit down and talk with them,'' said Susan
Miles, a company spokeswoman. ``We probably won't know anything
about (a timetable) for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   If talks resume and continue after the five-day strike notice
expires, the union would then have the option of calling a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Bruce, an official at Machinists Local 709, said if talks
resume the union ``will do everything we can to keep people at work
until we get another proposal from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders had endorsed the tentative three-year deal, citing
the pay raises and a boost in retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Stripling said a plan to combine 24 job classifications into
nine was seen as a way to cut jobs. Another controversial item was
a switch to 10-hour-a-day, four-day workweeks for some employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of younger workers that would have day care
problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stripling also said the retirement boost was seen as too meager,
and workers were leery of a tougher attendance policy because the
current policy hasn't been evenly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Plant management is under pressure to boost productivity to
offset high costs and slow sales for the C-130J, an update of the
venerable airlifter built there since the 1950s. In January 280
workers, both union and nonunion, were laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said the labor unrest so far hasn't affected operations at
the plant, which also leads development of the F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it comes at a sensitive time, as Lockheed Martin seeks to
persuade the Air Force to step up C-130J orders and grapples with
cost problems in the F-22 program.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract was reached last month in negotiations
that also included Machinists locals at Lockheed Martin plants in
Sunnyvale and Palmdale, Calif. Workers at the Palmdale plant also
rejected the deal, while it was ratified at Sunnyvale.

`GIFT CREEP' PRECIPITATED OLYMPIC SCANDAL, PANEL CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (s, i and a coding; includes conclusions text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Olympic scandal was spawned by a pervasive
culture of ``gift creep,'' with presents from would-be host cities
growing steadily more extravagant while US and international
Olympic officials ignored or engaged in the abuses themselves, an
independent commission concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, chaired by the former Senate majority leader, George
Mitchell, proposed reforms including stricter controls on
gift-giving by cities vying to stage the Games, greater public
accountability, and diminished contact between bid cities and
international Olympic decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member commission also went beyond its mandate of
focusing on lapses by the United States Olympic Committee by urging
fundamental changes in the International Olympic Committee,
including new rules by which IOC members would be chosen, limits on
their length of service, and the adoption and strict enforcement of
travel, expense and gift rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the Olympic movement has been gravely
damaged,'' Mitchell said at a news conference in New York. ``Reform
must occur on the local, national and international level if that
credibility is to be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference and in an interview afterward, the former
Maine senator chose his words carefully; despite its status as the
most prominent independent panel to review the Olympic scandal thus
far, Mitchell's commission cannot force change. Instead, it can
only hope to win changes by convincing the IOC, the USOC and other
Olympic organizers of their necessity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, drawing on his recent diplomatic experience as a
peacemaker in Northern Ireland, Mitchell sidestepped a suggestion
that he was describing deep-rooted corruption. ``I prefer to use my
own words,'' he said in the interview. ``We believe that it was an
improper gift culture that was widespread and notorious and has to
be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the report, however, the commission went a step further:
``The culture of improper gift-giving tolerated by the IOC is
potentially illegal and inevitably corruptive. . . . The IOC should
no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate cities to its
members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes to judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound of Canada, vice president of the IOC and chairman
of its committee examining the corruption allegations, said he was
``not surprised'' that the IOC was part of the Mitchell
commission's review. ``We're not perfect by any means,'' Pound
said. `` We've always said the whole question is a two-way street.
Our investigation has shown a climate of major pressure on IOC
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound disputed Mitchell's comment that the IOC was part of an
``improper'' gift culture, as well as the commission's conclusion
that the gift giving was ``corruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have problems with the word `improper,''' Pound said. ``The
IOC is an international organization. It absorbs many cultures
where the giving of gifts is not only proper, but almost
essential.'' He added: ``I do not for a moment accept a broad-brush
characterization of the IOC having a culture of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission stopped short of calling for the removal of the
IOC's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has been widely blamed
for fostering a climate of Olympian excess. Apparently
acknowledging that Samaranch still reigns supreme over the IOC,
Mitchell said: ``We believe the emphasis should be on changing the
system, not on any individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the criticism was aimed at the IOC, the USOC
was hardly spared; the commission found that the USOC shares
responsibility for the abuses because it ``failed to exercise
effectively its oversight authority of the gift-giving practices of
the bid and organizing committee in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that ``the USOC did not effectively monitor
the activities of the bid committee's board of trustees or
executive committee.'' The document said that from June of 1991,
when Salt Lake City launched its bid for the 2002 Winter Games, to
June of 1995, when it was awarded the bid, the USOC attended 1 of
23 meetings of the Salt Lake executive committee, and had no
representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Before June of 1995, only one senior staff person of the USOC
attended a meeting of the Board of Trustees. Nor did the USOC make
any attempt to audit bid committee books or records, nor did it
have any representatives working in committee offices, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report suggested that the USOC, by example, had
tacitly endorsed the excessive courting of IOC members. When Salt
Lake was competing with other US cities to win the USOC's
designation as a potential Olympic host, USOC rules prohibited its
members from accepting gifts worth more than $25.
</P>
<P>
   But on visits to Salt Lake, USOC members accepted lodging,
meals, car rentals, entertainment, airfare, ski passes and other
gifts with a total cost approaching $5,000, the commission report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel took pains to present the actions of Salt Lake
organizers in a broader context than an earlier ethics report that
focused solely on the city. For instance, the Mitchell commission
concluded that Salt Lake, on its merits, had earned the right to
host the Games. It also said the improper inducements were often
``triggered by a demand from the taker.'' What Salt Lake organizers
did ``was wrong. But, as we have noted, they did not invent this
culture; they joined one that was already flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials, who created the commission in December to assess
culpability and propose reforms, thanked the panel but withheld a
detailed response until a news conference scheduled for Wednesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent manipulation of the Olympic bid process in the
future, Mitchell's commission proposed that bid cities be
prohibited from giving IOC and USOC members ``anything of more than
minimal value.'' It also suggested that bid cities be banned from
paying the expenses of USOC or IOC members, which instead would be
paid out of central funds administered separately by the IOC and
USOC.

IOC PANEL WEIGHING FATE OF 10 IN SLOC SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's investigative panel, still
pondering the fate of 10 more members linked to the Salt Lake
payoff scandal after meeting last weekend in Switzerland, will make
its decision by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had a remarkable degree of consensus,'' said
Richard Pound of Canada, who chairs the six-man panel. ``But as far
as new expulsions are concerned, we haven't gone there yet. Where
the line is to be drawn _ that's the area we're wrestling with
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine IOC members have resigned or have been forced out, in the
worst case of corruption in modern Olympic history. Any other
guilty members are expected to be expelled when the full body meets
on March 17 and 18 at Olympic headquarters in Lausanne. ``Our hope
remains that we can deal with all of the cases at that session,''
Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave of alleged wrongdoers, which Pound wryly called
``The Gang of Ten,'' covers a wider spectrum of improprieties,
ranging from cash payoffs to Super Bowl trips to plane tickets to
Budapest for family members. ``They're not of such a severe nature
as the ones we saw in the first slice in January,'' said Pound.
</P>
<P>
   But since the IOC rules allow only for expulsion, warning or
exoneration of members, the panel has been wrangling over how to
weigh the various offenses. ``When the charter was drafted, nobody
gave any thought to nuancing the sanctions,'' Pound said. ``There's
no in between. That's what we're dealing with.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least half a dozen more International Olympic
Committee members are under suspicion for improprities in the Salt
Lake City bribery scandal, the head of an IOC inquiry panel said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend meeting at IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, the head of the six-member commission said they were
trying to reach a consensus on the fates of 13 members still under
investigation, as well as the ``half-dozen or so'' new names to
emerge in the widening scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The additional members were not identified in a massive Salt
Lake City's board of ethics report issued last month. However, the
ethics board sent documentation that could link them to
inappropriate gifts, said Dick Pound, the Canadian lawyer who heads
the IOC's investigation panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Salt Lake board of ethics indicated they had partial
information with respect to certain gifts and benefits,'' Pound
said. ``They sent some working papers. There are a half-dozen or so
new names that are not otherwise there. So we will ask them what
they are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional names raises the total number of IOC members
under suspicion of misconduct in the bidding for the 2002 Winter
Games to 30, or more than a quarter of the 115-member organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very serious problem,'' Pound said. ``It is serious
for the future of the IOC, and if we don't get it right it may
start to spill out to the Olympics themselves. We are taking this
situation very much to heart. I regard it as a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said his panel will recommend changes in the
site-selection process, establishment of an ethics committee with
outside membership and even changes to the structure of the IOC.
Pound said the commission is considering term limits for IOC
members and further limits on gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to look very carefully at the way we are
organized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he hopes to send the commission's recommendations to
the IOC's 11-member executive board and IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The commission can recommend that members be expelled, warned or
exonerated. If accepted by the board, the proposals will go to the
full IOC session at a special general assembly March 17-18.
</P>
<P>
   Nine IOC members already have resigned or been ousted in
connection with cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and
other inducements offered by Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend meeting focused on the six new previously
unidentified members and on three additional members that remained
under investigation after the commission's own quick investigation,
as well as 10 new names that appeared in the Salt Lake report.
</P>
<P>
   Pound reiterated the IOC's support for its beleagured president,
although he opened the door to a possible early departure for the
78-year-old Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along it is very important to have the captain
of the aircraft at the controls as you are going through the
turbulence,'' he said. ``Once the crisis is solved, he may decide
to carry on for the balance of his his term and he may decide to do
something else.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the fashion set gathers in Europe this week to preview fall
collections, cashmere sweatshirts and fur ponchos will dominate the
runways. But hanging in the background is a nasty battle that has
erupted as one luxury goods maker, LVMH, tries to gain control of a
smaller rival, Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   On one level this battle has developed into a personal clash of
style titans. Team Gucci consists of Domenico De Sole, its chief
executive, and Tom Ford, the designer of the hour. Together they
have rebuilt Gucci Group NV from near-bankruptcy to a fast-growing
fashion darling, and they say they would rather leave than hand
over partial control to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   In Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA, they have a formidable opponent. Through a mix of savvy and
ruthlessness, he has built a conglomerate of luxury brands that
sell liquor and duty-free goods as well as clothing and perfume,
and he has said he will not take no for an answer _ even if winning
Gucci means losing De Sole and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has seen many a brutal takeover battle, Arnault
sounds naively perplexed and truly hurt that De Sole and Ford are
resisting. ``What we want is so moderate,'' Arnault said in a
telephone interview last week from his Paris office. ``Why are they
being so brutal?''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the personal pyrotechnics, larger stakes loom. Gucci is
red hot right now, and buying it might give a needed jolt to
Arnault's staid empire, which has been hit hard by the Asian
economic crises. But Gucci feels that being sucked into such a
corporate culture would be death. Both may be right, but both
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunes can reverse daily, as each side tries increasingly
drastic tactics. The short version is this: In the last 18 months,
LVMH has swiftly brought its holdings of Gucci stock to 34.4
percent, from as little as 5 percent, and LVMH moved in January to
pick a Gucci director. Gucci, which is based in the Netherlands for
tax reasons but has most of its operations in Italy, then mounted a
surprise defense, granting employees options to buy up to 37
million new shares with interest-free loans. The new employee stock
plan, whose trustees are appointed by De Sole, then moved to buy 20
million shares _ a stake equal to LVMH's. The tactic will dilute
LVMH's stake to about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH, calling the move a usurpation of shareholder rights, is
challenging it in court. The Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam
Court of Appeals will hear the case Wednesday and could issue a
ruling the same day that will determine whether Arnault will have
the votes at a shareholder meeting on March 23 to lead the House of
Gucci as he wants, or whether De Sole will have effectively warded
off his attack.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this upscale altercation comes down to Arnault's
motives. Arnault says his interest is simple: in the short term,
acquiring a stake in a sound and growing business; in the long
term, increasing Gucci's profit margins by combining back-room
operations like advertising and distribution. He brags that LVMH's
profit margins on leather goods are a staggering 48 percent,
compared with Gucci's 24 percent, and he says LVMH and Gucci have
something to teach each other about fashion management and
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault makes little secret of wanting a piece of Gucci's sex
appeal. The Italians, led by houses like Gucci and Prada, have
rivaled the French in fashion leadership lately. At LVMH's
ateliers, Arnault fought back by installing an army of talented,
media-friendly young designers _ like John Galliano at Christian
Dior, Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe and
Michael Kors at Celine. While all have ignited headlines, none have
generated the creative and commercial alchemy that Ford's sexy
'70s-inspired clothes have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to gain being in touch with Italy as a creative
world and as a business world,'' Arnault conceded with as much
grace as Gallic pride allowed. ``The Italians are very dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   From his point of view, Arnault has bent over backward to retain
Gucci's stellar management team. In interviews and press releases,
the normally laconic French executive has praised Ford lavishly,
even though the two have yet to meet. In private talk days before
the stock plan was born, he said he agreed to De Sole's demand that
he nominate just one board member, not the two or three that he
says he had intended to _ and that any stake over 10 percent
allowed him to. He further agreed to buy no more stock until a
shareholder meeting could be held.
</P>
<P>
   What De Sole says he wants is simple: fair play for all. Arnault
wants eventually to take control of Gucci by buying a majority
stake, not by making a tender offer to all shareholders. U.S.
courts have rejected this strategy, known as a creeping takeover,
because of its obvious drawbacks for remaining stockholders. But it
is common in Europe and, for Arnault, a favored method for taking
control without paying a premium for all the stock.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, though born in Italy, was educated at Harvard Law
School, married an American and is an American citizen. He says it
offended his American sense of fair play that Arnault could jilt
minority stakeholders. Arnault ``has never paid 100 percent for
anything,'' he said in an interview in New York last week. ``That
is unacceptable.''

HANCOCK TO REVAMP SALES SYSTEM, REMOLD STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a bold move that could make insurers more like stock
brokerages and mutual fund `supermarkets', John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. said Monday it would revamp its sales system to
remold staff agents into modern financial advisers peddling a
broader array of products.
</P>
<P>
   The change marks the first time a life insurance company will
sign contracts with independent agents that officially allow them
to sell other companies' investment products. Many independent
agencies _ self-run businesses closely allied with a single insurer
_ illicitly vend other firms' products behind the backs of their
main sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's move underscores the demise of the old-fashioned
in-house insurance agent, one of the best-known symbols of the
business. It also illustrates the pressure faced by insurers to
compete in a marketplace in which consumers increasingly demand a
wider selection of products from more than one company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its change, Boston-based Hancock, one of the nation's
15 largest life insurers, will phase out its 850 career agents _
staff salesmen who sell Hancock-only products. Those agents in July
can either join the ranks of some 2,150 `general' Hancock agents _
independent contractors affiliated with but not formally employed
by Hancock _ or leave. Around five percent of career agents
probably won't make the transition and will leave Hancock, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving Hancock's revamp is the fact that general agents are
less costly than in-house ones and can reach customers whom staff
agents cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hancock's new system, housed under a new Hancock
distribution unit called Signator Financial Network Inc., customers
who walk into a Hancock-affiliated agent will not only be able to
buy life insurance and mutual funds, but also long-term care
insurance and annuities _ all manufactured or distributed by
Hancock and nine other insurers, including Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. and Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of agents are locked in the past,'' said Signator's
chief executive, Rob Marra. ``But people are more interested in a
variety of products and say to themselves, `I don't really need an
insurance agent, I need a financial adviser.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Hancock's mutual fund arm has been selling other
companies' funds for years, the new system bolsters the array of
products Hancock will offer. ``It's the path many companies will be
taking,'' said analyst Arthur Fliegelman of Moody's Investors
Service. Hancock also sells insurance directly and through banks
and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   While not yet comparable to mutual fund `supermarkets' such as
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Hancock's new system has a similar pattern.
It also resembles that of brokerages, which have moved to become
financial advisory outfits offering multiple products.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock hopes that more agent-financial planners will choose to
affiliate with Hancock, giving the company more access to new
customers. For their part, the agents are able to offer clients a
bigger variety of products, a major competitive edge for them.
Hancock and the agents split commissions generated from sales.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which oversees $120 billion in assets, will require its
career agents to acquire certification by one of three financial
planning accreditation organizations. Now, instead of a staff
salesman who sells a middle-income client a couple of insurance
policies throughout his lifetime and collects one-time fees,
Hancock affiliates will focus on wealthier customers _ those with
incomes of at least $75,000 who need advice as well as insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Hancock had nearly 8,000 career agents to its
current 3,000, of which one third are staff and the rest are
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock plans to cast off its mutual form of ownership, in which
policyholders are nominal owners of the company, and issue public
stock in 2000. While Marra said Signator could in theory be spun
off and taken public some day, he said no such plans were currently
in the works.

 UNDATED: is unacceptable.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   De Sole also sees sinister motives in LVMH's actions. Since Ford
and De Sole took Gucci public in 1995, sales have exploded, to $1
billion in 1998 from $264 million. At the same time, sales for
Louis Vuitton, the LVMH brand that Gucci most directly competes
against, grew only to $1.4 billion, from $1.1 billion. ``Clearly,''
De Sole said, ``there is great value on his part in just stopping
Gucci.'' He added, ``While Arnault was telling Tom and me how much
he loved us, he went to one of our shareholders and told them he
would have his `eyes and ears' on our board. I can't let them have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Gucci shareholders agree with De Sole's foreboding and
several are almost apoplectic about LVMH's machinations. Sewall F.
Hodges, a senior vice president of Scudder Kemper Investments,
which holds 4 percent of Gucci, said, ``The risk posed by a
competitor on the board, particularly someone from LVMH, which has
shown it can't keep pace, is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnault scoffs at the notion that this a plot to thwart Gucci.
``Would you put $1.5 billion in something that you want to
destroy?'' he asked. ``I think what is happening is De Sole does
not want the pressure of being pressured to improve profit
margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and De Sole say they would agree to work for LVMH if
Arnault made a ``fair offer'' for all the stock. De Sole gave
Arnault a dollar figure, which he would not disclose but which is
surely far higher than $68.875 a share, the market price as of
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange for Gucci's registered
shares, each of which represents one ordinary share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in interviews both have said flatly that independence
would be preferable. And now, at least, both can barely conceal
their reluctance to work for Arnault. De Sole bristles at the
thought that he could learn from Arnault's management style,
pointing out that LVMH's total profit margins are 9 percent, well
below Gucci's 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no precedent under Dutch law for Gucci's stock
plan tactic, it is hard to predict how the court might decide. If
the five-judge panel rules in Gucci's favor, it would be hard for
Arnault to acquire more shares. Still, he has said that he will not
disappear. ``We'll be there a long time after Mr. De Sole
retires,'' he said. ``We are still Gucci's No. 1 shareholder.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the court does rule in Arnault's favor, he is likely to
continue increasing his stake and push through his nominations to
the board. It is questionable under such circumstances whether De
Sole would be asked to stay on. The once cordial relationship
between Arnault and De Sole is in shreds. ``Ask him if he will
stay,'' Arnault snapped, then softened and added: ``We'll try to
work with him. We'll give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Arnault still hopes Ford will stay on. ``He's
exceptionally good for Gucci,'' he said. ``Without him, it's less
of a good investment.'' Although Arnault and De Sole have had
several communications in person and by phone and fax in the last
two months, Arnault has yet to speak with Ford. ``I sent him a
memo,'' he said. ``He gave it to M. De Sole.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether fashion's dynamic duo could
be split up. De Sole does not think it is possible. He says he and
the designer are ``best friends.'' When Gucci started getting red
hot, De Sole told his two daughters that tickets to the biannual
runway shows were too precious to give to family. They went around
his back to Ford, who let them in backstage and allowed them to
drape models and otherwise soak up the glamour.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Ford confirmed the magic of the
relationship, saying he could not imagine working in the industry
without De Sole. But asked bluntly if he would quit if LVMH raised
its stake in Gucci, Ford paused. ``I'd have to evaluate the
situation,'' he said. ``Not only do I feel loyalty to shareholders,
but we have built this company. I hired a lot of these people. It
would be a hard decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's position, clearly, is tougher than it appeared at first.
He enjoys an extraordinary amount of creative freedom for someone
whose name is not on the door of a fashion company. He designs
Gucci's women's collection, men's wear, accessories and store
layout, and he directs the company's advertising and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   This would be hard to replicate elsewhere. For that matter, it
might be hard to replicate at LVMH. Arnault has made it clear that
he believes not every designer deserves to be so involved. ``It's
one thing to design fantastic clothes and hype them,'' he said.
``It's something else to meet the customer, look at shoes, buy
leather.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Arnault, who fought a brutal battle for
LVMH years ago, is not prepared to walk away even if all of Gucci's
talent does. ``We have already invested a lot of money,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives, used to sudden entrances and exits of
designers, foresee a diminished, though not finished, Gucci without
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is an important resource at most luxury stores. ``We'd be
concerned if he left because Tom has given the brand the
personality that appeals to customers,'' said Dawn Mello, president
of Bergdorf Goodman, a subsidiary of Neiman Marcus. As head of
Gucci in the early '90s, it was Ms. Mello who set the stage for
Gucci's rebirth as a coveted brand, and who hired Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Still, plenty of companies thrive beyond their creators. In
fact, one need look no further than Gucci, which was founded by the
Gucci family in 1923. ``You look at great companies, and they go
on,'' said Michael Gould, chairman of Bloomingdale's, a unit of
Federated Department Stores. ``When people have a vision and they
build a business on a solid foundation, it will continue to grow.''

HIGH COURT TAKES UP CLASH OVER WORKPLACE-BIAS DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., S.C.) (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after Congress added teeth to the basic
federal law against discrimination in the workplace, the Supreme
Court on Monday took up one of the most important questions under
the expanded law: When can employees who have proved that they were
victims of discrimination win damages sufficient to punish their
employers?
</P>
<P>
   After years in which prevailing employees were entitled to no
more than back pay and reinstatement in their old jobs, Congress
provided in 1991 that those who proved intentional discrimination
were entitled to compensation for their pain, suffering and future
lost wages. Further, the expanded Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 provided that employers who acted with ``malice'' or
``reckless indifference'' could be ordered by a jury to pay
punitive damages of up to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   To that requirement for punitive damages, the federal appeals
court here, in a bitterly divided 6-to-5 opinion, last year added
another: that the employer be shown to have engaged in ``egregious
discriminatory conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for a woman who won her sex discrimination case and
then lost her chance for punitive damages told the justices Monday,
``We don't think the courts are at liberty to add'' another
prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Egregious conduct' is not a possible interpretation of any
provision in the statute,'' the lawyer, Eric Schnapper, told the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration joined the appeal on behalf of
Schnapper's client, Carole Kolstad, who was a high-ranking
executive with the American Dental Association when she lost a
desired promotion in the organization's Washington office to a man
with less seniority. The evidence showed that Ms. Kolstad had not
been seriously considered for the position. The jury found
intentional sex discrimination and awarded her $53,000 in back pay,
but the trial judge refused to let the jury consider whether to go
further and award punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the punitive
damages ruling, the full court said the district court had been
correct in not sending the punitive damages claim to the jury,
because the evidence ``does not show the kind of egregious
discriminatory conduct necessary for the imposition of punitive
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling on the standards for punitive damages
will affect a broad array of discrimination cases. In addition to
sex discrimination, Title VII covers discrimination on the basis of
race and religion, and a later federal discrimination law, the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, borrowed the Title VII
language on damages. Discrimination claims under the Fair Housing
Act will also be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its practical importance, the case, Kolstad vs. American
Dental Association, No. 98-208, also offers an interesting window
on the judicial process. Although those who call themselves
judicial conservatives often declare that it is a judge's job to
apply law rather than make law, it was the conservatives on the
appeals court who added the concept of egregious behavior to the
statute that Congress wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the administration's Supreme Court brief on Ms. Kolstad's
behalf, Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman asserted that the appeals
court ``was not free to reconsider'' the congressional policy
judgment that ``all unlawful intentional discrimination undertaken
with malice or reckless indifference to federal law is inherently
deserving of punishment through an award of punitive damages.''
</P>
<P>
   During the argument Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia appeared
particularly frustrated by the inability of the defendant's lawyer,
Raymond C. Fay, to provide a clear definition of egregious conduct
in the context of the statute, or to say where in the law itself
the concept might be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by an egregious act?'' Scalia demanded,
adding, ``The act only covers firing, not murder or torture or
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay replied that an egregious act could be an act of
discrimination that puts the victim ``into a horrible mental
state.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer drew an intervention from Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. ``Punitive damages doesn't turn on whether the plaintiff
is thin-skinned, does it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia then exclaimed: ``I have it! Firing on Christmas Eve.
That does it!''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the argument, when Fay complained that under the view
of Ms. Kolstad's lawyers, virtually all cases of intentional
discrimination would go to the jury on the question of punitive
damages, Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked him, ``Isn't that what the
statute says?''
</P>
<P>
   Working in the defendant's favor, however, is the Supreme
Court's general dislike of punitive damages, as expressed in a
number of recent decisions. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist both expressed concern Monday that the
law made an award of punitive damages almost automatic once the
fact of discrimination was proved.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wondered aloud whether it would be
fair to subject a company to punitive damages for denying a job to
a pregnant woman in the ``good faith'' belief that it was in her
best interest not to undertake those particular duties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a separate development at the court Monday, the justices
agreed to hear an appeal by environmental groups in a case that
could determine the usefulness of the ``citizen suit'' provisions
that are part of many federal environmental laws. In providing for
recovery of lawyers' fees and litigation costs, Congress intended
to expand enforcement of the laws by encouraging private suits
against environmental violators.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw Environmental
Services, No. 98-822, a company that was discharging mercury and
other hazardous waste into a South Carolina river changed its
behavior soon after environmental groups brought suit under the
Clean Water Act. Although the federal District Court in Columbia,
S.C., fined the company $405,000, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Richmond, Va., ordered the case dismissed as moot
because there was no ongoing violation of the law. Under this
interpretation, plaintiffs lose the right to recover their fees and
costs if their success comes too soon.

PANEL REVIEWING BILLS TARGETING MINORITY FINANCIAL RECORDS,
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A House committee is considering two open
government bills with potentially far-reaching implications for
minority contracting and executive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Robert Talton, R-Pasadena, filed a bill that would
repeal a measure passed in the 1997 Texas Legislature exempting
certain financial records of applicants to minority contracting
programs from public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Talton, who said he filed the bill at the request of a
constituent, told the House State Affairs Committee on Monday that
any firm seeking government contracts should be willing to open
their books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make my tax returns public, I have always done that,''
Talton said. ``I think that if you're going to do business with us,
you ought to have your open records.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the 1997 law has allowed city officials to withhold
from public scrutiny the financial information supplied by
applicants to the city's Minority, Women and Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the law complain that firms benefiting from the
city's affirmative action contracting program have been able to
shield their financial status, giving fuel to claims the program
benefits wealthy contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, vice chair of the
House committee, noted that Anglo males who compete for city and
state contracts have no similar requirement to open their books to
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that we are targeting specific businesses and
making them provide more information than others,'' Turner said.
``If it's such good government, let's get the same information from
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner noted that the 1997 law did more to ``even the playing
field'' by shielding such information.
</P>
<P>
   Roy McQueen, publisher of the Snyder Daily News, told the
committee that the Texas Press Association and the Texas Daily
Newspaper Association favor Talton's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill include business groups, such as the Texas
Association of Mexican American Chambers of Commerce, and the Small
Businesses United of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations claim that making such information public
again would allow competitors access to minority and women-owned
firms' financial information.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim that fewer firms will seek public contracts if
they are forced to make their tax returns and bank statements
public, and that such a requirement amounts to a penalty against
certified contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure before the committee would require all
governmental entities to electronically record their closed,
executive sessions.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Arthur Reyna, D-San Antonio, said his bill is aimed
at prohibiting governmental bodies from discussing improper items
in secret _ rather than allowing public access to issues discussed
in executive session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no elected official who is afraid of having
their executive sessions recorded,'' Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows elected bodies to go into closed session and
discuss real estate, personnel and litigation matters only, and
either record the meeting or follow a certified agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a very disciplined body not to discuss other matters
once they get into executive session,'' McQueen said.

   State Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, concurred and added, ``I
think we all agree the certified agenda is completely bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   McQueen said the news organizations he represents do not
necessarily seek access to the real estate, personnel and
litigation matters discussed in lawful executive session _ rather,
they wish to deter unlawful discussions by requiring the use of
recording devices.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members, however, agreed the bill needs some
fine-tuning on how long such tapes would be stockpiled, and under
what guidelines the information they contain would be made public.

INDIAN TRIBES' PROTESTS AGAINST BISON SLAUGHTER INTENSIFY

<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ As a few hundred people
watched beneath the snow-dappled peaks on the northern edge of this
park, Gary Silk, a Lakota Sioux, stripped to the waist. As he stood
in the numbing wind, in the shadow of the giant stone arch that
greets visitors here, other members of his tribe made two incisions
in his back with a surgical scalpel, inserted a stick in each
wound, and tied a buffalo skull to each stick with long ropes.
Then, as 100 or so Indians sang and drummed and played an eagle
bone flute, Silk danced around a large circle dragging the skulls
through the mud and grass behind him.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour of dancing, Silk stopped and someone sat on
the skulls. Silk grabbed a horse's tail and the animal pulled away,
ripping the sticks from his bloody wounds. Then, as people wept,
Silk joined the singing and drumming.
</P>
<P>
   The intense religious ceremony, performed this weekend for the
first time in 100 years, was part of a protest against the
slaughter of bison that leave Yellowstone Park each winter. While
two mild winters have allowed the slaughter to diminish, the
protest against the killing has increased.
</P>
<P>
   The herd of 2,400 in the park are consider the last free-roaming
bison, though domestic herds are found throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers fear that when the bison wander out of the park and
onto state and federal land in Montana, where winter is less harsh,
they will transmit a disease called brucellosis to cattle. So,
under state policy, once the animals leave the park, they are
tested for the disease and if they test positive are either shot or
shipped to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The last two winters here have been mild, with little snow, and
few animals have left the park. So far this year 17 bison have been
shipped to slaughter, and 500 animals have been hazed back into the
park. Last year 11 animals were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But during the winter of 1996-1997 nearly 1,100 animals were
shot by state agents or shipped to slaughterhouses, inspiring the
latest intensifying round of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service has been inundated with mail and phone calls
imploring them to halt the killings, and a recent draft
environmental impact statement on the subject drew 65,000 public
comments. Environmentalists and animal protection groups have gone
to federal court to stop the killing, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   This year members of a small group of animal activists called
Buffalo Nations moved near the park and tried to disrupt the
trapping and shipping of bison by blocking the capture and erecting
tall tripods out of logs in the path of the people loading the
animals. Several have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   For the ceremony on Saturday, about 40 traditional Lakota made a
20-day, 507-mile pilgrimage, on foot, on horseback and in pickup
trucks, from their reservation in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
They were joined by some 60 other traditional Indian leaders from
around from the nation, including the Southern Ute, Apache,
Tuscarora and the Nez Perce.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux, the Nez Perce, the Crow and other tribes all hunted
bison on the plains in and on the Yellowstone Plateau, and the
animal was central to the cultures, providing food, shelter and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prophecy says that if the buffalo disappear, our people
will disappear,'' Joseph Chasing Horse, a Sioux spokesman, told
those in attendance. ``Pray for the children and the grandchildren
of the two-legged animals, for we know not what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Montana Department of Livestock say they have
no alternative to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to save as many bison as possible,'' said Arnold
Gertonson, the Montana State Veterinarian. ``We hate to shoot them.
But we're protecting Montana's brucellosis-free status.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and some scientists say bison pose no threat
to cattle and that there has never been a case of the disease being
transmitted in the wild. But a recent study by the National Academy
of Sciences found a small, but real, risk of transmission of the
disease to cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some progress has been made toward creating more habitat for
bison outside of the park. On Feb. 11, the Church Universal and
Triumphant, which owns a ranch adjacent to the park, sold 6,000
acres to public ownership. And the U.S. Forest Service has arranged
to have 900 or so cattle that graze on public land west of the park
out of the area until a month after the bison are gone, which
should remove some of the risk of transmission. But that still
leaves 1,100 cattle on private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue has turned on about 2,000 cattle,'' said Jon
Catton, a spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an
environmental group in Bozeman, Mont.

 &HT;    N.C. tobacco growers demanding relief
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Among the hundreds of hand-scrawled signs
hanging from tractors in Monday's motorcade of North Carolina
tobacco farmers, the message on Thomas Hall's green John Deere put
it simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``For sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old farmer from Black River, N.C., is trying to sell
all three of his tractors. He hopes to raise enough money to reduce
his $250,000 debt and have some left over to plant tobacco this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Without tractors of his own, Hall would need the help of a
neighbor, a humbling proposition for the fourth-generation farmer.
But, Hall said, ``I've got to do whatever I can to get rid of this
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a frightening season for the growers of tobacco,
traditionally the South's most lucrative crop. But profits are
evaporating, and farmers are looking desperately for financial help
in an era when public sympathy for the tobacco industry is hard to
muster.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' plight in North Carolina, the nation's largest
flue-cured tobacco producer, illustrates how the once-comfortable
lifestyle afforded by the golden leaf is disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our last chance, maybe our last stand,'' Keith Parrish
shouted at the early morning crowd of 1,000 farmers and their
families preparing for the motorcade of 500 tractors, lined up like
tanks headed into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted atop the tractors, American flags and green banners
emblazoned with golden leafs whipped in the cold wind. ``We're not
greedy _ we're desperate,'' read one of the many signs plastered on
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and anger drove farmers to organize the slow-moving, noisy
parade that clogged traffic from the state fairgrounds to the state
legislative building in downtown Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco farming groups are seeking at least half of the $4.6
billion that the state of North Carolina expects to receive over 25
years from last fall's $206 billion national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley helped negotiate the
historic settlement between 46 states, including Georgia, and the
four biggest U.S. cigarette makers. The companies agreed to pay
$206 billion in exchange for relief from states' lawsuits seeking
reimbursement for the costs of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Easley proposed that half the state's share go to rebuild
communities hurt by tobacco's demise, and the other half to health
care programs. The state Senate approved that plan last week, and
the state House plans to take it up in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Farm leaders are urging North Carolina's Legislature to
designate at least half of the $4.6 billion as direct compensation
to farmers and the holders of tobacco quotas, which gives farmers
federal permission to grow and sell the crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want economic viability for farm families, not
re-development of North Carolina's landscape,'' read a petition
that tobacco farm leaders delivered Monday to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the $4.6 billion, cigarette companies have pledged an
additional $2 billion to North Carolina tobacco farmers and their
communities. But farmers said they need more than $2 billion amid
declining cigarette consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the federal goverment has slashed by 35
percent the acreage of tobacco that farmers can grow. Farmers said
that translates roughly into a 35 percent reduction in their
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I survive this year, I'll be lucky,'' said Randolph County
farmer Grover Burgess, 62, who sold two tractors to raise money.

BUSH EXPECTED TO FORM CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has been weighing a
potential presidential bid for months, is expected to announce
Tuesday he will form an exploratory committee that will enable him
to raise money for a potential White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a now-familiar scene played out on the lawn of the
Governor's Mansion, Bush picked up endorsements Monday from
Republican lawmakers in three other states for a possible race.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators from Connecticut and North and South Carolina
dropped by to urge the Republican governor to run for president in
2000. North Carolina is the home state of Elizabeth Dole, another
possible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they got the same answer Bush has now given
countless other times: He's thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut (instinct) is that he will run,'' South Carolina state
Sen. Patrick Ballantine said when asked later if he thinks Bush
will run. ``I hope that's not just wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear him say that he was going to run. But we're all
praying that he does,'' Ballantine added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to edge closer to a White House run by
announcing which way he is leaning on the presidential question. He
is widely expected to say he is forming an exploratory committee,
but he wouldn't discuss his plans Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``Something will be happening pretty
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement on his candidacy, should such a decision
be made, isn't expected until after the Texas Legislature adjourns
May 31.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, lawmakers from around the country have made
their way to Austin to announce their support for Bush. The visits
have allowed the governor to amass a wide variety of endorsements
without having to leave the state to drum up support for a
potential candidacy while the Legislature is in session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm in the process of making up my mind as to
whether or not I will take the process a step further,'' Bush told
reporters Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those calling on the governor Monday cited similar reasons of
past endorsement delegations as to why they want him to run. They
also carried letters signed by a number of their fellow GOP
lawmakers who also want him in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he is the best candidate, the best man for the job.
We believe he has the ability to bring everyone together,'' said
South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he runs,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Rep. David Miner said he and other Bush
supporters aren't totally overlooking Dole in making their
endorsement for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Elizabeth Dole will be Governor Bush's running mate
... We hope he's leading the ticket, and we hope he will consider
Elizabeth Dole at the appropriate time,'' Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Robert M. Ward, minority leader of the Connecticut
General Assembly, said he believes Bush has the right message to
appeal to voters in the South and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Monday's visits, along with those by other Republican
lawmakers, were spontaneous trips, not orchestrated events planned
by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when people express a desire to come down, it
requires a certain sense of coordination. I don't want people
coming to Texas, and I'm not available for lunch,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-state lawmakers said they had called Bush's
representatives wanting to know how best to show him their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't asked to come. I asked if I could come,'' Wilkins
said.

THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR Y2K TRADING TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street is going back to the future. On Saturday,
about 400 brokerage firms, banks, exchanges and other institutions
will push the clocks on their computers forward to Dec. 29 as the
first stage in a full-scale test of their readiness to trade
stocks, bonds and other securities in the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in July, when a core group of 28 Wall Street firms
performed a trial run, the meticulously scripted tests will cover
the first trades to settle in the new year, including options that
expire Jan. 22. Because the $270 billion securities industry has
been a pacesetter in dealing with potential Year 2000 computer
problems and the July experiment went well, any major disruptions
found in the tests would puncture recent optimism that banks,
utilities and other critical parts of the business infrastructure
can make the transition to next year without significant
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime practice of
programming dates in computers with two digits for the year, like
99 for 1999. Some computers and software interpret 00 as 1900
instead of 2000 and others cannot interpret 00 at all, leading to
crashes or faulty data.
</P>
<P>
   Securities companies began dealing with such problems sooner
than most, partly because the need to handle long-term loans and
bonds had alerted them to the hazards of two-digit coding. Domestic
securities firms will end up spending $5 billion to correct the
problems, according to the Securities Industry Association, which
has been coordinating correction and testing efforts since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of tests will cost the association about $10
million and the participants as much as $100 million, according to
Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the association. About
5,000 people will be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dress rehearsal for the real event,'' Kittell said.
``We expect to come through with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to involving many more brokers and much higher
volumes than the trial run in July, the new tests will add about 30
large and small pension fund managers and other institutional
investors into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are representing thousands of buy-side institutions, and
we have worked hard to get a representative sample,'' said John
Panchery, the association's Year 2000 project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference with July _ and the reason the tests will run
only on Saturdays from March 6 through April 24 _ is that many
participants will be using the computers they rely on for daily
operations, not the separate systems set up especially for testing
that were used in the trial run.
</P>
<P>
   The tests will start with mock trades that would be made on Dec.
29, 1999, and settled on Jan. 3, the first business day in the year
2000. On March 13, the test scripts will switch to Dec. 30 and the
following Saturday to Dec. 31. The most crucial day in the test,
Jan. 3, 2000, will be tested on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The testing cycles will end on the following two Saturdays with
a simulation of Jan. 4, 2000, a date that mutual funds need to
completely exercise their processing systems, and a simulation of
Jan. 22, 2000, the first date in the new year when options will
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the industry could still run into problems even if
the tests go flawlessly. To start with, there are many other
potentially disruptive dates, especially Feb. 29, 2000, a leap day
that many programs do not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing was to test an entire trading cycle
over several days,'' Panchery said. Collectively testing individual
days like Feb. 29 would be too expensive and complicated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the securities industry is setting a group testing
standard that most others cannot hope to duplicate. Electric
companies, for example, are planning a major test in April that
will simulate various disruptions so that companies can see how
well prepared they are to cope with them in a coordinated fashion,
but they will not touch the systems that are actually generating
power and controlling the grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to run a test of multiple utilities of any
size and still have enough backup facilities to serve customers if
something trips up,'' said Eugene F. Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the
National Energy Reliability Council.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the power industry is relying on tests by individual
utilities of their power plants and control systems and on small
joint tests, such as an effort later this month (March) involving
Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey; the organizations
that control distribution of power in New York and the mid-Atlantic
states, along with AT&AMP;T and Bell Atlantic, which are the key
suppliers of vital communications links to the utilities.

IOC PANEL WEIGHING FATE OF 10 IN SLOC SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's investigative panel, still
pondering the fate of 10 more members linked to the Salt Lake
payoff scandal after meeting last weekend in Switzerland, will make
its decision by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've had a remarkable degree of consensus,'' said
Richard Pound of Canada, who chairs the six-man panel. ``But as far
as new expulsions are concerned, we haven't gone there yet. Where
the line is to be drawn _ that's the area we're wrestling with
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine IOC members have resigned or have been forced out, in the
worst case of corruption in modern Olympic history. Any other
guilty members are expected to be expelled when the full body meets
on March 17 and 18 at Olympic headquarters in Lausanne. ``Our hope
remains that we can deal with all of the cases at that session,''
Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave of alleged wrongdoers, which Pound wryly called
``The Gang of Ten,'' covers a wider spectrum of improprieties,
ranging from cash payoffs to Super Bowl trips to plane tickets to
Budapest for family members. ``They're not of such a severe nature
as the ones we saw in the first slice in January,'' said Pound.
</P>
<P>
   But since the IOC rules allow only for expulsion, warning or
exoneration of members, the panel has been wrangling over how to
weigh the various offenses. ``When the charter was drafted, nobody
gave any thought to nuancing the sanctions,'' Pound said. ``There's
no in between. That's what we're dealing with.''

MIRROR REJECTS TRINITY'S SWEETENED BID
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Mirror Group PLC, which owns one of Britain's
oldest tabloids, rejected a sweetened offer of $1.53 billion on
Monday from Trinity PLC, the country's biggest regional newspaper
group, and said it was talking with a rival suitor.
</P>
<P>
   The developments escalated the probability of a takeover battle
in Britain's cutthroat newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about the future ownership of Mirror Group, which
publishes both the daily and Sunday Mirror tabloids, increased
following the ouster of its chief executive, David Montgomery, on
Jan. 26 after a bruising public feud between him and board members
and stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Group had shrugged off earlier offers from both Trinity
and and its rival _ Regional Independent Media, which is owned by
Candover Investment Trust, a venture capital organization backed by
George Soros, the financier, and a unit of Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A previous offer from Trinity valued Mirror Group stock at 160
pence ($2.50) a share, or about $1.2 billion. Last January, Mirror
Group rejected an offer from Candover based on a share price of 200
pence. That offer valued the group at around $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity said its latest offer of equity and cash valued Mirror
stock at 210 pence a share _ a premium of 3.4 percent over Monday's
closing price of 203 pence. Takeover offers in recent months have
pushed Mirror Group stock from a low of 136 pence last October.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Mirror Group said Trinity's offer of 40
pence cash plus 0.35 percent of a Trinity share for each Mirror
share represented `'an inadequate premium for a change of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinity said it was surprised at Mirror Group's response.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a regional British newspaper chain bidding for a
national newspaper would once have been unusual. But regional
chains have prospered in recent years as a result of cost-saving
consolidation, while the brutal competition among national
newspapers has been costly to them. Before his resignation,
Montgomery, the former Mirror Group chief executive, said the daily
Mirror had slipped to third place behind the Daily Mail and Rupert
Murdoch's top-selling Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity, by contrast, said Monday that its profit last year was
up 43 percent, to around $101 million, on a 5.4 percent increase in
sales to $564 million, which analysts attributed to strong
advertising revenue. The figures slightly exceeded expectations.
Trinity's share price gained 2.5 percent, to 498 pence.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the two national tabloids, the Mirror Group publishes
several Scottish and regional newspapers and operates a cable
television channel, Live TV. But it is also burdened with debt from
the days of its former owner, Robert Maxwell, who drowned at sea in
1991. It later emerged that Maxwell had raided the Mirror's pension
fund to divert the equivalent of about $35.2 million into other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who took over as chief executive in 1992, had been
widely credited with reviving the Mirror Group's fortunes, but, in
the process, lost favor among both institutional investors and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror Group said on Monday that it was still in discussions
with Regional Independent Media, which began talking with Mirror
last month. There were unconfirmed newspaper reports Sunday that
the Mirror Group was anticipating an offer worth $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal must be approved by British competition regulators.
Regional Independent Media indicated Monday that it might await
regulators' approval before making a formal bid.

FDA REJECTS SERONO LAB'S DRUG FOR MS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serono Laboratories Inc. suffered a major blow Monday by failing
to obtain permission from the federal government to sell its
multiple sclerosis drug in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the US Food and Drug Administration marks a
major victory for Biogen Inc., Serono's main competitor in the
$500 &UR;  &LR; million-a-year market for multiple sclerosis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., and Serono, of Norwell, Mass.,
manufacture beta interferon, a drug used to slow down the
debilitating neurological disease. Biogen's drug is called Avonex
and has been on the US market since 1996, while Serono makes Rebif.
Avonex and Rebif are chemically identical.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling delivered to Serono on Friday and disclosed
Monday, the FDA said Biogen maintains the exclusive right to sell
beta interferon in the United States until 2003 under the Orphan
Drug Act, a law that grants marketing exclusivity to companies that
develop drugs for certain, rare diseases, including multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As today's FDA ruling makes clear, Rebif does not offer
greater efficacy or safety and does not provide a significant
addition to patient care,'' said Jim Vincent, Biogen's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, however, technically leaves the door open for
Serono to obtain a waiver from the Orphan Drug Act by demonstrating
that Rebif is clinically superior to Avonex. So far, Serono has
spent more than $100 million to develop the drug, which is only
available in Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Serono has tried to argue, so far to no avail, that Rebif is
different from Avonex in three ways. While Avonex must be mixed
with a sterile solution before it is injected into the muscle,
Rebif comes pre-mixed in syringes for injections beneath the skin.
More importantly, Serono said Rebif comes in several doses, while
Avonex is only approved for one dose. Serono executives have argued
that stronger doses of beta interferon work better for patients
with more advanced multiple sclerosis. Its research, however, did
not include head-to-head trials comparing Avonex and Rebif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serono will continue its discussions with the FDA on the
outstanding orphan drug issues to determine how it can make Rebif
available to MS patients as soon as possible,'' said Hisham Samra,
Serono Laboratories' president.
</P>
<P>
   Serono is a subsidiary of the Geneva-based Ares-Serono Group,
the world's largest fertility drug maker.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen's stock soared 6 1/8 Monday on the Nasdaq to 102 1/4 on
anticipation of the FDA ruling, which was not made until after the
stock market closed.

 &HT;    Judge gives go-ahead to profit freeze
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge in New York Monday continued a freeze
of $2.5 million from the sale of stock in companies connected to a
Madison, Ga. man and a storefront on that small, east Georgia
town's Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Securities Exchange Commission asked the U.S.
District Court to issue a temporary restraining order to keep
Glittergrove Investments from transferring abroad money from the
sale of Citron and Electronic Transfer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC claims Glittergrove and seven other offshore entities
are represented by Peter C. Lybrand, a 34-year-old Madison man
previously known as Peter C. Tosto.
</P>
<P>
   Tosto is somewhat of a mystery man. He has been working for more
than two years out of a Madison storefront connected to five public
companies whose trading was suspended by the SEC for 10 days Jan.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Press releases about the companies _ Citron, Electronic Transfer
Associates, Polus, Smartek and Invest Holdings Group _ list a phone
number that rings at 115 S. Main St. in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Tosto has been elusive and does not answer repeated phone
inquiries or knocks on the door of his Madison office and
residence, a Victorian mansion down the street from his office.
</P>
<P>
   In stopping trading of his companies, the SEC questioned the
quality and quantity of information available to investors. On the
heels of a series of press releases, Citron's stock rose from $1.25
on Dec. 30 to $21 on Jan. 25. The SEC claims Tosto arranged for the
public sale of 30,500 Citron shares between Jan. 15 and 26. That
sale netted $886,000. The rest of the $2.5 million came from sales
of Electronic Transfer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, before the federal agency could stop it,
$350,000 from the sale of Citron and Electronic Transfer Associates
was transferred overseas by Glittergrove, an Irish corporation that
Tosto represented in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The money was transferred to other overseas companies that Tosto
allegedly represented.
</P>
<P>
   Just one episode
</P>
<P>
   The Glittergrove case is one chapter of what could be a sizable
book on Tosto's history with securities regulators. Federal court
and agency documents reveal:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1991, Tosto pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy
to commit wire fraud. The then-27-year-old received a three-year
suspended sentence with three months in a halfway house and 200
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, Tosto was permanently barred by the SEC from
associating with any securities broker, dealer, investment company
or investment adviser after his dealings with a Colorado company.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, after he had set up shop in Madison, Tosto was
ordered to pay a $1.1 million fine in connection with a kickback
scheme involving shares of San Diego Bancorp. However, he testified
that he didn't expect to pay more than a fraction of that. SEC
officials, reached Monday, could not confirm whether any part of
the fine has been paid.
</P>
<P>
   _ In May 1998, Tosto pleaded guilty to securities manipulation
charges in federal court in Manhattan. He is awaiting sentencing in
that case and is cooperating with the government. He was released
on his own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
   A low-profile figure
</P>
<P>
   Despite a central role in public lawsuits, Tosto exists mostly
in black and white. He does not return phone calls from reporters.
His senior picture is his only appearance in the 1982 yearbook of
West Babylon High School on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with former business associates and Tosto's own
testimony in late 1997 offer some clues.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination in federal court in New York in December
1997, Tosto said that during 1996, he conducted a radio show and
put out investor newsletters. Tosto testified that agents with the
SEC and U.S. Attorney's office were aware of those activities and
finally told him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Tosto's testimony under cross-examination came in a 1997 civil
case filed against him by a company named Advanced Lighting
Solutions Inc. and others to reclaim control of 10 percent of the
company. A settlement was reached, but it has not yet been carried
out, according to the president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   David Gothard, president of Advanced Lighting Solutions, said he
met Tosto about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gothard and partner Bruce Gordon were trying to raise money for
their Las Vegas-based company. One way to do that is to buy a shell
company, a public company that has no operations. The private
company becomes public by merging with the public shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put the word out that I was looking for a shell,''
Gothard said in a telephone interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. ``It's a small community. There's not a lot
of people who do this. They all talk. But after I got in bed with
this guy, I realized he's been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gothard said his first hint of trouble came when he tried to
file the paperwork to sell shares of the company in New York.
Gothard said the state Attorney General's office told him some of
Tosto's history.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Gothard said he went to Tosto's office on
West 30th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Peter, `How in the world? All this I'm hearing
here.' I said, `How do you sleep at night?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Dave, I have immunity. They won't touch me.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tosto nor his lawyer, Steven Kaplan, could be reached
for comment.

BILL TO ALLOW SUNDAY LIQUOR SALES ADVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bill that would allow all stores to sell liquor on
Sundays has taken a major step forward, with legislators saying
current restrictions are not fair.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Government Regulations Committee recommended 8-7
Monday that the full House pass the legislation, which would give
all communities the option to permit package stores to open seven
days a week. Currently, only cities and towns within 10 miles of
the Vermont or New Hampshire borders have that choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Package Store Association has not taken a
position on the matter, lobbyists for liquor companies are laying
low, and mom-and-pop alcohol retailers are split _ mostly along
geographic lines _ on Sunday openings. But propelling the issue on
Beacon Hill is a Superior Court judge's ruling in August that the
current law is arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge Margaret Hinkle came in a suit brought
against the state by North Shore package store owners who claimed
the law, enacted in 1990, put them at an unfair disadvantage to
stores closer to the border. The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Daniel Bosley, House chairman of the committee,
had opposed the idea of seven-day operations, but he cosponsored
the new bill, saying the issue needed to be settled in wake of
Hinkle's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would not have done anything if it weren't for the
court case last year in Ipswich,'' Bosley said. ``We need to
clarify the law. Since there are stores that have been open who
would suffer adverse impact, I filed a bill to open all the
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosley and other lawmakers believe it would be wrong to pull the
plug on stores who can currently make Sunday sales. The solution,
he says, is to give all communities the option.
</P>
<P>
   Not all package store owners like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Although those just beyond the 10-mile buffer established in
1990 near the northern border feel they are being hurt as a result
of the Sunday ban, those in Southeastern Massachusetts, for
example, do not believe they are at a competitive disadvantage
because stores in Rhode Island are closed Sundays too.
</P>
<P>
   The local option bill would require shop owners who choose to
open on Sunday to pay employees time-and-a-half and make work
voluntary on that day. Package stores could not open before noon.

BILL SEEKS EVIDENCE OF RACIAL `PROFILING' BY STATE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seeking to determine if hard data support persistent
anecdotal evidence of racial ``profiling'' of motorists, lawmakers
want to require the state attorney general to break down the race,
gender, and age of drivers involved in routine traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   A bill filed Monday by Senator Dianne P. Wilkerson (D-Roxbury)
would commission a two-year analysis of the number of minorities
stopped by police officers in Massachusetts and investigate whether
the stops resulted in a search, an arrest, or a seizure of
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that needs to be talked about,'' said
Kristine Glynn, Wilkerson's legislative aide. ``People have called
in to report an abnormal amount of traffic stops for minorities,
mostly young black men,'' both in and outside the senator's
district, Glynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would mimick studies requested in New Jersey and
Maryland, follows complaints by two black law-enforcement agents
who said they were harassed in separate incidents by Reading
police. In addition, the New Jersey State Police superintendent,
already under heavy criticism for alleged racial profiling by
troopers there, was fired Sunday by Governor Christine Todd Whitman
after a newspaper report in which he said minorities are more
likely than whites to be involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson's proposal is backed by Representative Byron Rushing
(D-Roxbury). ``There is so much anecdotal information about this
that, inside the black community, it has gotten a name: DWB, or
driving while black,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson's concerns also are shared by Representative Benjamin
Swan, a Springfield Democrat who has filed a bill to prohibit law
officers from the ``arbitrary'' investigation of people based on
race, age, gender, and several other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Swan, who is black, says his family has direct experience with
unjustified traffic stops. His son, Benjamin Swan Jr., 39, a
computer specialist at Smith &AMP; Wesson in Springfield, said in an
interview Monday that he had been stopped three times for no
apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing said he would urge Wilkerson to add a requirement that
police departments, on their own, begin compiling profiles of
motorists involved in traffic stops. Brookline police began the
practice two years ago, in response to concerns raised within the
community about the makeup of the 20,000 motorists stopped by town
officers each year.

AMAZON.COM SITE TELLS USERS OF BOOK PROMOTION PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to complaints from customers, Amazon.com retooled its
popular online bookstore on Monday so that it would disclose when
publishers pay money to subsidize titles that are highlighted or
featured with favorable reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company used a note on its home page to invite
readers to ``learn about co-op placements,'' the jargon of the
publishing industry for advertising payments made to bookstore
chains or large independent stores to feature titles in prominent
sites in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the term ``co-op placements'' might be unclear to the
average reader, David Risher, Amazon's senior vice president for
product development, said the company struggled over what term to
use and temporarily settled on the phrasing after consulting with
publishers. He said the company was still prepared to ``tweak'' the
wording to make it more clear.
</P>
<P>
   When the co-op placement icon is clicked, the viewer is offered
a list of more than 30 categories of books in which particular
titles have been subsidized by publishers. In the nonfiction
category, for instance, publishers paid to promote ``Perfect
Murder, Perfect Town,'' Lawrence Schiller's exploration of the
JonBenet Ramsey murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it decided to make the disclosure after customers
expressed qualms about the practice taking hold at the online
bookstore, which had distinguished itself with its editorial voice
and staff recommendations. The concerns were expressed after The
New York Times disclosed the practice last month.
</P>
<P>
   Risher said the response of consumers to the disclosure of the
practice was ``almost surprising in its intensity'' and that many
consumers simply wanted the company to be more open about the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end we only want to display the books that our
customers want to know about,'' Risher said, stressing that the
co-op dollars from publishers would not influence Amazon's choice
of books to highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's big online competitor, Barnesandnoble.com, has also
begun seeking co-op advertising dollars from book publishers. Its
system of alerting readers is more traditional, with advertising
promotions appearing only on the left band of its home page and
highlighted graphically as advertisements, according to Ben Boyd, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times maintains links between its online book
review and Barnesandnoble.com, receiving commissions for sales.

 &HT;    It's not Atlanta, no way
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The people who brought you the Atlanta Olympics _
motto: ``We're Cleaner than a Tub of Lye, Y'all'' _ have made it
formal.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, hard look at themselves, they have concluded that,
yes, as a matter of fact, they are beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wrongdoing,'' Billy Payne wrote to Juan Antonio Samaranch,
as part of a response to the International Olympic Committee's
investigation of its grimy bid process. ``Atlanta won the games
`fair and square,' in an honorable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. What a relief to know that we were an island of purity in
a sea of corruption. Guess that pretty well settles that.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon the cynicism, but what other option is there? This
soul-search carried no weight. It came with no documentation,
ACOG's records still hidden away like J. Edgar Hoover's evening
gowns. It ultimately had all the meaning of a eulogy written in
advance by the dearly departed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disservice to history to ask that we accept on faith
that the Atlanta bid process was perfectly clean, even as certain
IOC members came to expect the big favor and the serious grease
everywhere else. ``Take our word for it'' stopped being an
acceptable explanation several presidencies ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Atlanta effort was most exceptional, ethically
speaking, this continued secrecy and in-house arrogance makes
buying any of it awfully difficult. The natural question remains,
``What are they hiding?'' Not, ``Why can't we just move along?''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, this kind of institutional whitewashing
is a disservice to those who might actually want to fix the bid
process. Assuming the IOC is at all serious in its investigation,
it needs some facts to act upon. All the Atlanta response provided
was fluff. A little institutional methane was not exactly the fuel
for change called for here.
</P>
<P>
   You just know that Samaranch would love to sit on this, just
like his old buddy, Francisco Franco, taught him. Fight all
challenges right up to the moment he draws his last breath, that's
how the generalissimo handled such matters. Samaranch doesn't need
any more allies, witting or not.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, another report was issued, this by a United States
Olympic Committee ethics commission. (Atlanta, by the way, was
mentioned only once, in passing). It made several recommendations
for altering how cities are awarded Olympic Games, which probably
will get passed along to the IOC's in-basket.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas seemed to make perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   Like allowing bid cities to give only cheap gifts, the kind the
media usually gets. They'll just love all those flimsy backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like permitting no receptions or galas. Let them eat take-out.
</P>
<P>
   Like regularly electing the IOC membership instead of giving
them job security a pope would envy.
</P>
<P>
   Like establishing an Office of Bid Compliance, to audit every
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic flame must burn clean once ag ain,'' the report
grandly concluded.
</P>
<P>
   By not opening themselves to any serious scrutiny, the Atlanta
organizers would seem satisfied with maintaining the current smudge
pot. That's the appearance, which does nothing with the problem but
give it a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Olympic movement needs now is more
self-congratulation.

   &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  compared herself to  &UR; Princess Diana &LR;  in an
interview published in the Sunday Mirror of Britain. ``I was also
wronged by a man who said he loved me,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although she admitted ``I'm not a princess in the royal sense,''
she said she sees herself ``in a similar situation. ... Remember, I
was in love with him. I was trapped, too. I had a lot of pressure
on me, and like Diana, I had nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the budding of her relationship with Clinton, when
she walked into his office in a short green skirt, and he
complimented her on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like it?'' asked Lewinsky, to which she says he replied,
``I'd like to see what's underneath it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I lifted my skirt and showed him, and he said, `Nice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mirror reporter  &UR; Andrew Golden  &LR; talked with Lewinsky in New York
as she was beginning her book collaboration with  &UR; Andrew Morton &LR; ,
who had previously written about Diana. It may have been Morton who
brought up the similarities, in an effort to put Lewinsky at ease.

   &UR; YOUNG MR. CLINTON IN ENGLAND &LR;

<P>
   Feminist ground-breaker  &UR; Germaine Greer &LR;  spoke at Warwick
University in England recently and told the story of a 1969
encounter with  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; , who was studying in England as a
Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speaking at the Oxford Union,'' she said in the
Telegraph of London. ``There was an annoying red-faced American in
a seersucker suit arguing that equality in the workplace was all
that women really want. So I told him that what I really wanted was
the right to be hairy, the right to my own secretions and the right
to my own protuberances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only much later I discovered who the red-faced American
was.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether Greer's story was an altered version of
the one she told in 1992, when Clinton was first elected. She said
then that she had been expounding on the virtues of sex with
working-class men as opposed to sex with bourgeois men. During the
question period, she said, Clinton piped up with, ``In case you
ever decide to give bourgeois men another chance, can I give you my
phone number?''

 &HT;    La Nina could mean more severe weather for Ohio
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Twenty five years ago, as La Nina was disrupting
weather patterns around the globe, a killer tornado struck Xenia,
Ohio, leaving 33 dead and more than 300 homes destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, La Nina is back. And the tempestuous weather system may
again bring greater risk of severe tornadoes to Ohio and other
states, according to a study by Purdue University researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Agee, professor of atmospheric sciences, and graduate
student Suzanne Zurn-Birkhimer, analyzed tornado patterns state by
state from 1916 to 1996. When they compared El Nino, La Nina and
normal years, they found a number of states had more tornadoes
during La Nina years.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino, an unusual warming of the water in the eastern Pacific
Ocean, eased last May after disrupting weather around the world for
more than a year. But rather than returning to normal, the ocean
cooled sharply into a condition known as La Nina, the opposite of
El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Certain areas _ including Indiana, western Kentucky, western
Tennessee, and Mississippi _ averaged almost twice as many
tornadoes during the La Nina years as in El Nino years. And the
tornadoes tended to be more severe, according to Zurn-Birkhimer and
Agee.
</P>
<P>
   Other states at risk are Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina,
North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Iowa, Illinois,
Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study has been done by a reliable source and, at this
point, no studies refute this,'' said John DiStefano, science and
operations officer for the National Weather Service in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   However, because weather is affected by many variables, ``you
could end up with a season that has fewer tornadoes than average,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While 1974, when the Xenia tornado struck, was a La Nina year,
so was 1989 when Ohio was hit by only two tornadoes with winds
averaging 113 mph or greater, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1965 - a year that was not affected by La Nina -
there were 18 significant tornadoes in the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a statistical study,'' DiStefano said. ``It's not a
prediction. It's not a forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nina could produce more tornadoes because it pushes the
subtropical jet stream north, bringing warm and moist air with it.
That change can provide the necessary threshold of heat and
moisture to build severe thunderstorms, said Zurn-Birkhimer, one of
the authors of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings, no extra emergency precautions are being
undertaken, said Ed Kovar, executive director of the Miami Valley
Emergency Management Authority.
</P>
<P>
   As March ushers in Ohio's peak season for tornadoes, Kovar
advises residents stay tuned to radio and television for severe
weather warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people feel if they don't have a siren, they can't
hear a warning,'' Kovar said. ``But a radio or TV is just as good
as a siren.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city of Dayton's proposed plan to deactivate its
emergency warning siren will leave a void in the system, ``it's not
as catastrophic as people think,'' Kovar said. ``A siren system is
an outdoor warning system. It's not meant to warn people indoors.

US PASSIVITY DURING GUATEMALAN DIRTY WAR HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of a UN-supported commission probing
Guatemala's dirty war blasted the United States Monday for training
the Central American country's forces in the arts of terror and
then turning a blind eye as it conducted a genocidal campaign
against the indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian Tomuschat, a German professor of international law
who headed the three-member Historical Clarification Commission on
Guatemala, praised the Clinton Administration for declassifying
more than 1,000 secret documents that helped the panel do its work,
and for providing more than $1.5 million in financing for the
investigation. The commission was created by agreement between the
Guatemalan government and rebel groups in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not wish to say that the US government bears direct
responsibility for any act of genocide,'' said Tomuschat at a press
conference. But ``the United States knew perfectly well what was
going on. It raised no objection and it continued its support for
the Guatemalan army.''
</P>
<P>
   UN officials and human rights advocates say the 3,600-page
report released last week, based on 9,000 interviews and a trove of
US intelligence cables, represents the most thorough account of the
excesses of the Guatemalan military during its 30-year war against
Cuban-backed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   It found that the United States agencies knew far more about
atrocities committed by the Guatemalan army and its notorious death
squads than the US has publicly acknowledged. According to the
report, government forces were responsible for 93 percent of the
200,000 Guatemalans killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This the authoritative truth about what happened in
Guatemala,'' said Alvaro de Soto, a senior adviser to UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Senior UN officials said that courts inside or outside Guatemala
are now free to prosecute the military leaders who oversaw the most
brutal phase of the civil war _ including General Romeo Lucas
Garcia and General Rios Montt _ for the crime of genocide.
Tomuschat added that a national amnesty, established as part of the
country's UN-brokered peace process, does not shield the military
from answering for their alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Tomuschat said in an interview that an intelligence cable
released by the United States documented the role of the Central
Intelligence Agency in helping the Guatemalan police plan the 1996
kidnapping of 28 leaders of the Communist party.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist politicians were never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   The report also charged a subsidiary of Coca-Cola Co. with
mounting a bloody campaign that led to the death of dozens of trade
unionists in the 1970s. Tomuschat said labor leaders at the
Coca-Cola factory in Guatemala were routinely kidnapped and killed
to crush a budding labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years the Coca-Cola subsidiary in Guatemala pursued
mercilessly the trade union movement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of President Jimmy Carter severed links with
the Guatemalan government in 1977, but the report suggests that US
intelligence agencies maintained cordial ties with the Guatemalans,
providing them with intelligence on the bloody counterinsurgency
campaigns in the Guatemalan highlands.
</P>
<P>
   In one cable, the CIA described a Guatemalan army campaign in
the Ixil Triangle, an indigenous region in northwestern Guatemala.
At the time, US officials were officially barred from dealing with
the Guatemalan army, according to a senior US official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commanding officers of the units involved have been
instructed to destroy all town and villages which are cooperating
with the guerrilla army of the poor and eliminate all sources of
resistance,'' the CIA cable stated. ``The army can be expected to
give no quarter to combatants and noncombatants alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite long-standing American support for successive military
governments, the Guatemalans didn't always view the United States
as their friend. When the United States raised concerns about
Guatemala's human rights record in 1993, the generals' apparent
response was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   A senior US official in Guatemala reported his suspicion that a
unit under the command of the presidential chief of staff, Col.
Juan Jose Marroquin, was responsible for killing several local
employees of the US Agency for Development in retaliation for the
US criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only last week,'' recalled a State Department Bureau of
Intelligence and Research report dated Nov. 21, 1983, ``three USAID
Guatemalan contractors were murdered, possibly as an example to the
US not to meddle in human rights issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report came days before President Clinton's
March 8 visit to Guatemala, but White House national security
spokesman David Leavy said he didn't expect the issue to come up
during the first presidential trip to Guatemala since Lyndon
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president's message was designed to bolster the
peace process, promote human rights, fight drug trafficking and
foster democratic institutions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acknowledged previously that several Guatemalan
individuals with whom the CIA was associated carried out serious
human rights violations,'' said Leavy. ``And we have taken a series
of measures to ensure human rights in future intelligence
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Archive, a Washington organization that
helped the commission obtain the classified documents, gave the
Clinton Administration high marks for cooperation. However, it
faulted the Pentagon for failing to provide any useful information
on Guatemala's human rights record.

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a speech in Chicago last week, the chairman and
chief executive of Coca-Cola Co. made references to several popular
films of different eras, including ``Being There'' and ``From Here
to Eternity,'' when describing his company's experience overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He left out ``Suddenly, Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Coca-Cola, long the paragon of American
consumer-products companies, began to feel the effects of a global
battering that is without recent parallel. Sales volumes have
fallen in many countries, profits are flat or falling, and the
company is trying to manage its way through more simultaneous
crises abroad than at any time since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Brazil teetering on the edge and threatening to take
Mexico and the rest of Latin America with it, Coca-Cola's damage
control has moved into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Coke's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas
Ivester is scheduled to make a rare appearance at a conference
hosted by Merrill Lynch for dozens of portfolio managers, who hold
the keys to billions of dollars in investment funds. Such
appearances are usually delegated to others, like the company's
chief financial officer, James Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, a 20-year company veteran and a principal mechanic
behind the Coke machine, is expected to try to reassure investors
at the Manhattan conference that the long-term outlook for his
company remains positive. After his scheduled remarks, he will
answer questions from those attending the ``by invitation only''
event.
</P>
<P>
   His message may be a tough sell. Even though stock analysts
acknowledge the organizational strength of Coke, they say most
investors are looking for more short-term security than the company
can provide. Last week, several Wall Street analysts reduced their
1999 earnings forecast for Coca-Cola to about $1.45 a share, down
sharply from the $1.95 estimate many had made before the company's
fortunes began to slide in August. It is also about the same as
what the company earned last year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price, which is down nearly 5 percent for the year,
fell 25 cents Monday, to close at $63.625. It is off sharply from
its July high of $88. Ivester, whose normal travel schedule borders
on the frenetic, has been spending an unusual amount of time making
the company's case to his business peers. Last Thursday, during an
address to the Economic Club of Chicago, he spoke enthusiastically
about Coke's prospects. ``I have to chuckle sometimes when I read
that some analyst is fretting about our `global exposure,'''
Ivester told the group in his measured Georgia twang. ``I hate to
tell them, but that's the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism, he went on to say in a speech that included various
movie analogies, ``doesn't usually begin with steel mills or
automobile plants. It begins with consumer goods. Even in
developing countries, many people can afford a Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts beg to differ, especially when it comes to Brazil,
Coke's No. 3 market in case volume. ``Brazil is definitely a
challenge for them in 1999,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, who is one of the few voices
urging people to invest in Coke now (her rationale is that the time
to buy Coke stock is when the company hits a rough patch). ``And
they didn't have a great 1998.'' Many analysts expect volume in
Brazil to fall five to 10 percent this year, particularly as people
feel they don't have the disposable income to shell out for pricey
American soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the currency has plummeted in value, even spectacular
growth in Brazil would be diminished on the balance sheet. Bill
Pecoriello, a stock analyst for Sanford Bernstein, predicts that
the real's downturn will reduce Coke's earnings more than the 6
percent he had originally forecast, given the rest of the global
risk facing the company. The company reported that currency
devaluation worldwide reduced earnings by 9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pecoriello expects case volume in Brazil to fall 13
percent this quarter, far worse than the 3 percent decline in the
fourth quarter of last year. Global volume will grow by 4 to 5
percent, he predicts, down from the 6 percent growth recorded last
year and well off the 7 to 8 percent growth target of Coca-Cola's
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Coke doesn't adjust marketing spending for the volume
shortfall, margins should come under additional pressure,''
Pecoriello wrote in a note to investors last week, referring to the
company's worldwide operations. He rates Coca-Cola stock as
``market perform,'' while Coke's chief rival, Pepsico, is rated
``outperform,'' the highest ranking. And while he predicts that
Coke's earnings for this year will come in at $1.46, he cautions:
``There's still risk in our numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Marc Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, said Brazil is
one symptom of what may be a very large problem for Coca-Cola.
``I'm growing increasingly concerned that the growth rate of the
company is slowing,'' he said, citing compound EPS growth of just
under 13 percent for the 1990s _ not the 15 percent the company has
repeatedly promised.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia and Venezuela, volume is also in a downward spiral,
off more than 16 percent in the fourth quarter. And Colombia shows
signs of a shrinking demand for soft drinks overall, said Laura D.
Meizler, a Latin American beverage analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney. ``Substitute products have been growing,'' she said, noting
that malt drinks are among them.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for shareholders is that a personal appearance by
Ivester tends to have a soothing effect on the skeptical, who find
comfort in his command of the business and his breadth of
experience. ``One of the virtues of a 113-year-old company is that
we've traveled over bumpy roads before,'' Ivester declared in
Chicago. ``We have seen the movie before.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that around the world _ in Japan, Russia,
Germany, Colombia, Venezuela, South Africa, Brazil, to list just
the big box-office names _ the epic is only in the first reel.

 &HT;    Cameron shows promise
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy

<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Mike Cameron swung at the first pitch thrown in
an intrasquad game Monday afternoon and grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Bad, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   His next time, he doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Good.
</P>
<P>
   His third time he pushed a letter-perfect bunt past the
pitcher's mound and beat it for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Good, very good.
</P>
<P>
   The affair was an intrasquad game involving the Cincinnati Reds
in Ed Smith Stadium on a postcard-type day witnessed by 900 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The game lasted eight innings, with a team managed by Dave
Collins playing a team managed by Donnie Scott to a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron, who is working often with Collins on The Art of Leading
Off , bunting, baserunning and outfield play, heard an earful from
Collins after swinging at Brett Tomko's first pitch of the game and
grounding out.
</P>
<P>
   Said Collins, ``I told him, 'Kid, that's a breath of fresh air
for their pitcher _ one pitch, one out. Nobody on our team knows
what he is throwing or how he is throwing. As a leadoff hitter, a
lot of times you have to take the count to two strikes. If you
don't do it, you'll find yourself hitting eighth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Collins knows. He was a leadoff hitter. He had superior speed.
He was a bunter. He was an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron put himself back in good graces with his base-hit bunt
his third time up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has wheels, he has to use them,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon, an observer for both teams, was pleased
with Cameron's bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was great and he has to try that at least once
a game,'' McKeon said. ``We knew when we got him he was quick and
he has to use it in games. On AstroTurf all he has to do is push it
past the pitcher and they aren't going to throw him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron realizes he has to be more patient if he wants to beat
out Pokey Reese for the leadoff spot. It's something on which he
has to concentrate, ``Because I'm naturally aggressive and don't
want to be too passive. I plan to bunt according to the situation.
That one was a perfect time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Collins team trailed, 4-0, in the fifth, but Stan Belinda
gave up a two-run home run to Phil Hiatt. With the Scott team on
its heels, Cameron bunted for the hit. Then he tried to steal
second, but was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was safe,'' he said. ``We'd just scored two runs and I
wanted to bunt and steal to keep things going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an aggressive afternoon and McKeon was pleased. . .until
a baseball writer from Milwaukee walked into his office after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell Phil Garner (Milwaukee's manager) that we're going
to turn our guys loose on the bases,'' McKeon said. ``We have some
runners this year. . .and we haven't turned Barry Larkin and Pokey
Reese loose yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams Monday tried seven stolen bases with three
successes _ two by Chris Stynes and one by Mark Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be aggressive this year and turn 'em loose on
the basepaths,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hiatt's home run from the Collins team, catcher
Jayhawk Owens hit a two-run homer in the sixth that tied the game.
Cameron had two hits and Hal Morris had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Branson, Mark Lewis, Jason Hardkte and Rod McCall each had
two hits for Scott's team. Cameron, Aaron Boone, Sean Casey and
Dmitri Young were the only regulars who played, but Larkin, Reese,
Greg Vaughn and Eddie Taubensee are scheduled to play today's
intrasquad game.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere, who started for Collins, gave up three runs and five
hits in two innings, but two runs were unearned. Tomko, starting
for Scott, gave up no runs and one hit in two innings.

HOUSE LEADER TESTS PLAN TO CURTAIL SOCIAL PROMOTION IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Senate plan to curtail social promotions of
failing students underwent a tough test of its own Monday from a
House education leader who says it should also require mandatory
kindergarten with a hefty $500 million price tag.
</P>
<P>
   A major overhaul, envisioned by state Rep. Paul Sadler,
D-Henderson, would radically alter the social promotions bill that
sailed through the Texas Senate last month and is key to Gov.
George W. Bush's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, chairman of the House Public Education Committee that
grilled backers from the governor's office about the plan Monday,
plans to sponsor the bill in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Key for Sadler is that the Senate bill, which targets
kindergartners with reading problems for early intervention and
remedial help, leaves out 30,000 Texas children not enrolled in
kindergarten. Under Texas law kindergarten attendance is not
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the lives of very small children. It just
seems to me we should take some time and think through this very,
very carefully,'' Sadler told two Bush aides testifying in favor of
the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said many of the 30,000 Texas children who don't attend
kindergarten each year are likely among those who can't pass the
state's standardized test by grade three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we even know who these 30,000 kids are?'' Sadler asked,
wondering whether they are rural or urban, minority or economically
disadvantaged. ``How can we fashion a solution to the problem if we
don't know who the kids are? That's what has troubled me from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office, meanwhile, called Sadler's proposed
kindergarten initiative costly and said it should not be tacked on
as a condition of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe the social promotion bill should be a stand-alone
bill,'' Bush said at a Monday press conference. ``I do believe the
social promotion bill that came out of the Senate is a good strong
piece of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler would increase the price tag of the proposal from $203
million _ slated for extra remedial classes and teacher training _
by adding another $500 million to pay for 30,000 more
kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a $5.3 billion surplus. What difference does it make
_ if this is really the number one educational priority of our
state _ what difference does it make if it costs $200 million as
you've outlined or it costs $450 million?'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate Bill 1, sponsored by state Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, mastery of grade-level academic skills are required by
third, fifth and eighth grades before a child is promoted to the
next level.
</P>
<P>
   It designates $203 million for teacher training and remedial
classes to help young children with learning difficulties. Help
would continue in the early school years in the hopes that fewer
children would fail the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills by
third grade. A child who still failed the test after three chances
would be subject to repeating third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Last week groups representing Hispanics and African Americans
argued that plan would discriminate against minority students.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston, was skeptical about low-income
parents' ability to participate in a grade placement committee
called for in the Senate bill. That provision would allow a
unanimous ruling of a parent, teacher and principal to promote a
child even after three failing grades on the TAAS test.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, you might have to chose from checking on how
Johnny is doing in school or your job,'' Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, raised statistics he said have
shown children's TAAS tests improving over time even though they
might have failed in the earlier grades.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said while 42,000 Texas students failed the third-grade
TAAS test in 1997, the failures dropped sharply to 32,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10,000 student drop in a year's time is very significant. If
we continue at that rate, before this bill even goes into place,
we've eliminated the social promotion problem,'' he said.

ADOBE'S NEW PAGE-LAYOUT PROGRAM CHALLENGES QUARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Adobe Systems Inc.'s shares hit a four-year
low last year, Quark Inc. floated an informal, and unwelcome, offer
to buy the company. On Tuesday, Adobe will return the favor with
the introduction of a new program long known by its code name, K2,
now called InDesign, but referred to by nearly everyone in the
publishing industry as the Quark-killer.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe executives do not use that term themselves, but they make
no bones about attacking Quark in its core market for high-end page
layout software. Rather than an update of Adobe's familiar
Pagemaker program, InDesign is an entirely new product, the
company's first in five years. Adobe contends that the program
offers greater flexibility than Pagemaker or Quark, while providing
tighter integration with Photoshop and Illustrator, its
market-leading programs for processing photos and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adobe's shares fell $2.8125 on Friday to close at
$40.25 amid a general selloff of technology shares, they remain
well above September's low of $23.625, as improved revenue and
earnings have lent credibility to the company's turnaround effort.
Monday, shares dropped another 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called InDesign an impressive product that should add
to Adobe's revenues later this year, but they said such programs
were often adopted slowly.
</P>
<P>
   InDesign is scheduled to ship in late spring, with versions for
the Macintosh, Windows NT and Windows 98, at an estimated retail
price of $699. Adobe is shipping an updated version of Pagemaker,
version 6.5 Plus, available March 15, at $499, or $99 for upgrades
from previous versions. Adobe is also rolling out new versions of
GoLive, the Web authoring tool it acquired earlier this year, and
Acrobat, its software for producing so-called portable documents,
which can be read on any system.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world has long been split between integrated
systems, from companies like Atex and SII, which typically run on
minicomputers or mainframes, and desktop systems, like Quark and
Pagemaker, which run on Macintoshes, personal computers and
PC-based servers. Adobe is positioning InDesign as a kind of bridge
between these two worlds, designed to stand on its own in smaller
installations, or to be bundled with integrated systems for larger
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have been testing so-called alpha and beta versions of
InDesign for a year, and John Warnock, Adobe's chairman and chief
executive, said he had no doubt it was partly the product's
visibility that prompted last year's overture from Quark. ``They
see a freight train coming their way,'' he said. ``They saw our
stock price as low, so why not try to knock it out with a
pre-emptive offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Gill, Quark's founder and chairman, said it was the
combination of the stock price and existing products, not InDesign,
that attracted his attention. ``I had forgotten about K2 when we
did the offer, which doesn't mean plenty of people didn't remind me
about it,'' he said. ``There are a couple of features it has that
are really neat, and a lot of features that have been in Quark
Express for some time. I assume they're going to do a good job, but
I don't think we're going to lose market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Two characteristics distinguish InDesign from previous page
layout programs, one of which will be evident to any user, the
other more important to developers who want to add capabilities to
the program.
</P>
<P>
   First, InDesign can work with any images created in Photoshop or
Illustrator, which saves an intermediate step of exporting a
picture or a graphic to some generic format, and allows much
greater manipulation without exiting the program. InDesign's user
interface is identical to that of Photoshop and Illustrator, so it
will look and work in familiar ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most publishers, including Quark shops, already use Photoshop
and Illustrator, said Jay Vleeschhouwer, a computer industry
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The target market for K2 is one
which Adobe has a lot of familiarity with, and which is already
using its other products,'' he said. ``Adobe will not be coming to
these high-end users as an unknown quantity by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, unlike Pagemaker and Quark, whose
architectures date to the 1980s, InDesign was written using modern
modular software design. The core program occupies just 1.6
megabytes, a fraction of the computer memory demanded by most
desktop applications these days, and all major functions are
performed by plug-ins, as on a Web browser. This means that Adobe
can add or upgrade portions of the program easily, but, more
importantly, that third parties can easily add value to InDesign by
creating custom plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can as a developer use the components of K2 and integrate it
very tightly into a true newspaper work flow system,'' said Don
Oldham, president of Digital Technology International, in
Springville, Utah, a leading system integrator for the newspaper
industry. ``The thing that Adobe has done that Quark doesn't is to
open their development environment to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the plug-in capability and the integration with Photoshop
and Illustrator appeal to Jeffrey Fulton, technology director for
Time Inc.'s Business Information Group, which has been testing
InDesign for a year. With Quark, you always had to ``plan your work
so that you had all your image work done before you went to page
layout,'' he said. ``People are just fed up with Quark Express, so
that they're ready for something really new,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Adobe needed developers like Digital
Technology if it was to meet Quark head on. ``Because Adobe doesn't
have all of the pieces yet, they need to get these other developers
to support them,'' said Mark Walters, editor of The Seybold Report
on Internet Publishing. ``The plug-in architecture is critical to
attracting the mass of developers that have been following Quark.
The product has a strong feature set, but by itself that isn't
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Good technology is not enough either, said Suzanne Snygg, an
analyst with Dataquest. ``The biggest issue for Adobe is the matter
of standards. Once you commit to a program like Quark Express,
companies and people are reluctant to change, just because of the
pain factor,'' she said. ``Just because a product is best doesn't
mean people will change.''

 &HT;    Delphi reaches out to non-GM companies
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Delphi Automotive Systems on Monday made its first
public appearance since becoming an independent company last month
and let the world know that its prepared to do business with any
automaker, not just General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman and chief executive, said
the world's largest maker of auto parts is increasing its non-GM
business by 10 percent each year and expects that rate to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work for General Motors any more. I resigned from that
company,'' said Battenberg at the Society of Automotive Engineers
International Congress in the downtown's Cobo Hall. ``We currently
do business with all the world's major manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   GM easily remains Delphi's largest customer, but Battenberg's
presentation to the international media was littered with
references to Delphi's business deals with GM's chief rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals range from Delphi making sliding doors for 1999 Ford
and Toyota mini-vans to supplying advanced climate control
technology systems for DaimlerChrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Battenberg also cited major contracts that Delphi has received from
other major automakers, including a $550 million deal with Navistar
International and other truck makers to supply modular doors for
the North American and European truck market.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi and its automotive technology are accustomed to taking
center stage at SAE, but it was obvious that this year's
presentation focused on showing its employees and competitors that
it will survive without GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving our operating performance through technology, or any
other means, obviously hinges on employee and union involvement,''
Battenberg said. ``To date, our unions have been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi employs 15,000 people at seven plants in the Miami
Valley, more than any other metropolitan area in the U.S. The
plants, make everything from engine mounts to brakes, and overall,
are in better financial standing that at any time in the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Dayton-area plants have some key (labor) agreements in
place and by staying competitive the have a chance to produce much
of the technology seen here,'' said Guy Hachey, president of
Delphi's chassis division, which is headquartered in Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff left Delphi, which generated $28.5 billion in
revenue last year, as the world's 25th largest company and
transformed the Dayton area from a GM to a Delphi stronghold.
Delphi, headquartered in Troy, Mich., has 200,000 employees and
operates 169 plants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spinoff, Delphi's stock has remained flat, hovering
around $18 per share. But Battenberg was quick to defend the
stock's performance on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   At a social event on the eve of SAE, Battenberg presented a
chart that showed Delphi's stock has outperformed any other
automotive supplier and the S&AMP;P 500 since the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have held our own in what's been a down period for the
industry,'' Battenberg said

 &HT;    Glenn honored in Ohio
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who conquered the vast nothingness of space has now
conquered Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   NASA on Monday officially changed the name of the Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland to the John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis
Field. A formal dedication ceremony is tentatively set for May 14.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the name change were planted by U.S. Sen. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, whose suggestion for honoring the first American to
orbit the Earth was approved by the Senate in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. DeWine felt it was certainly an appropriate and fitting
tribute to Sen. Glenn to name the NASA facility in the state of
Ohio for him,'' DeWine spokesman Charles Boesel said. He said the
change will ``recognize his achievements not only in space but on
Earth, too.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hairston, director of external programs at the research
center, said the name change underscores the center's hybrid nature
as a space and aeronautics site. ``It's a plus for us because it
gives us the visibility as a hybrid center,'' he said. ``This is a
great thing for northeast Ohio and for the NASA center.''
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1941, the center was named in 1948 for the late George
William Lewis, research director for the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics. Boesel said the name change was designed
to preserve the honor to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 10 NASA centers in the nation and focuses on
aeronautical propulsion, space propulsion, space power, satellite
communications and microgravity sciences in combustion and fluid
physics. The center uses 2,100 civil service employees and 1,500
contractors at the 24 major research labs on its 350-acre Cleveland
site and a 6,400-acre site in Sandusky.

 &HT;    Wright Flyer to get test
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ The wind tunnel where aeronautical
researchers are preparing to test a replica of the Wright Flyer is
like a gigantic cave.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through a large doorway into the test chamber, you feel
a cold wind blowing out of the tunnel. Once you're inside, the air
feels calm but cold. The wide floor curves upwards on each side to
form walls that arch high overhead. The room is 80 feet wide and 40
feet high, but special acoustical paneling makes it eerily silent.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the floor sits a wood and fabric wonder, a
close copy of the kite-like airplane the Wright brothers flew at
Kitty Hawk, N.C. on Dec. 17, 1903. Working around it is a small
group of volunteers, most of them dressed in blue jumpsuits adorned
with patches that say ``Wright Flyer Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, the group hopes to power up the giant wind
tunnel and start gathering scientific data that will tell them just
how well _ or poorly _ the Wright brothers' invention flew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to this for 20 years,'' said
project member Bud Chamberlain, a retired aeronautical researcher
who flew B-24 bombers in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The wind tunnel is a part of NASA's National Full-Scale
Aerodynamics Complex at the Ames Research Center here on Moffett
Field. It's the world's biggest wind tunnel facility. NASA is
cooperating with the Wright Flyer Project, which is an activity of
the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, an association of professional aeronautical and
aerospace researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The group had hoped to start testing Monday, but last-minute
adjustments required the flyer to be removed from its delicate
perch on the wind tunnel's pedestal-like ``sting,'' which supports
it and measures forces during the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's going to be (re)mounting and checking out and getting
everything ready,'' NASA facility manager Pete Zell said.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel was not running Monday, but its huge chambers were
open to the outside air, and natural atmospheric movements around
the complex caused breezes to flow through it, Zell said. The
enormous steel structure of the complex chills during the night,
making the air inside cold ``like an underground cellar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright Flyer Project started when another Wright Flyer
replica built by the AIAA chapter perished in a fire in 1978. The
chapter decided to build a new replica and fly it at Kitty Hawk in
2003, the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Project members say the Wrights themselves knew their 1903 flyer
was not a stable flying machine. This model was built to find out
just how the original flyer handled. The data project members
gather from it will help them build another machine that visually
resembles the original machine, but with just enough changes to
make it safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Grimm, a retired wind tunnel researcher who is a member of
the project team, said the flyer is unlike anything the NASA
researchers are used to seeing in their immense tunnel, which has
been used to test full-size models of fighter jets and other
aircraft at up to nearly half the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to working with metal airplanes, and here they
are with this fabric and wire thing,'' he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The test itself is a simple task, Zell said, but mounting the
flyer is tricky. The flyer has a wingspan of about 40 feet and
weighs about 1,000 pounds, but it rests on a four-inch balance
about six feet above the tunnel floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun from the standpoint that it's so unique,''
he said.

 &HT;    Peace Corps observances honor volunteerism
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Today's celebration of Peace Corps Day in Ohio
and across the rest of the country has personal meaning for Gov.
Bob Taft, who served as a volunteer in Tanzania in East Africa from
1963 to 1965 and is the first former volunteer to serve as a state
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste served as Peace Corps
director but was not a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those opportunities that gives back far more to us
than we give to other people,'' said Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Taft will celebrate in Peace Corps fashion by reading to
students at Avalon Elementary School in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing his favorite volunteering, which is reading to
kids,'' said Mary Anne Sharkey, Taft's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, nearly 10,000 current and former volunteers today
are scheduled to discuss their overseas experiences in classes
across the country to commemorate the Peace Corps' 38th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 volunteers have served in 132 countries since
the Peace Corps began. Ohio, with 6,462 present and former
volunteers, ranks sixth among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Taft had lots more than reading and discussing to do as a
teacher in the Tanzanian town of Missungwi. He and another Peace
Corps volunteer and four Tanzania teachers ran a boarding school
for 200 seventh and eighth graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught English, math, geography, art and coached the girl's
basketball team,'' said Taft. ``We took turns kind of being in
charge of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no electricity or running water in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gas lamps, pressure lamps,'' recalled Taft, who had a
papaya tree in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Taft, who came to Tanzania after graduating from Yale, learned
to speak Swahili and also played goalie on a local soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very good,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   He also made friendships with the students that have continued
to this day. Taft still recalls Salvis Shiponya, one of the
school's brightest students, who invited Taft to his home for an
overnight visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to visit and it was a little circle of huts,'' Taft
said. ``They had one bed in the place. They insisted that I take
the bed. They heated hot water for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Taft prepared to leave, his hosts honored him with a valuable
present - a live chicken that Taft later would enjoy for a meal. In
planning for the trip, Taft had forgotten to consider the
hospitality he was likely to receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really bring them a gift,'' said Taft. ``I had a
Swiss Army knife . . . I gave them my Swiss Army knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft rode his bicycle back to the school with the chicken on the
back in a cage, ``squawking all the way home.''
</P>
<P>
   As a college student at Yale in the early 1960s, Taft said he
was caught up in a ``very exciting time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a new president who was discussing volunteerism.'' Taft
said.
</P>
<P>
   That president was John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Taft came from
one of the nation's most politically famous Republican families.
His great-grandfather William Howard Taft had been a Republican
president and chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. His
grandfather, Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft, had been known as ``Mr.
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft's father, Robert Taft Jr., had just been elected to the
U.S. House as a Republican when his son entered the Peace Corps and
later went on to serve in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure my family was real delighted when I joined the
Peace Corps in 1963,'' said Taft. His father, however, ended up
going to Tanzania to visit his volunteer son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great thing,'' said Taft.
</P>
<P>
   While the Peace Corps was inaugurated by a Democratic president,
it now is embraced by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is bipartisan,'' said Taft. ``I think it does
transcend politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While Taft is the first former volunteer to serve as a governor,
there are six former volunteers in Congress, including Dayton's
Tony Hall who served in Thailand. Hall is one of three Democrats.
The three others are Republicans. Donna Shalala, U.S. secretary of
health and human services, also served as a volunteer in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 34 years since Taft, 57, ended his Peace
Corps service, but the memories remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think teaching, talking, being on my feet, trying to explain
things clearly to students who didn't know English that well, just
the opportunity to be of service, I think that was significant,''
said Taft.

clinics. And many young, single and healthy people, even those with
reasonable incomes, simply take a calculated risk that they will
never need to see a doctor at all. The problem is particularly

DESIGN OF LIGHT TRUCKS MAY CAUSE 2,000 EXTRA DEATHS A YEAR, STUDY
SUGGESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The height and stiff frames of sport utility vehicles,
pickup trucks and vans are making them unusually deadly to people
in other vehicles on the nation's roadways and caused about 2,000
extra deaths in traffic accidents in 1996, federal regulators said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing an extensive statistical study as well as the results
of crash tests, regulators said the design of these so-called light
trucks _ not just their weight, as auto makers have contended until
very recently _ posed dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of light trucks, which now account for
half of new vehicle sales, ``presents a growing safety problem that
needs to be addressed,'' said Thomas Hollowell, a senior researcher
at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, at the
opening here on Monday of the annual convention of the Society of
Automotive Engineers, an industry trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Martinez, the agency's administrator, did not attend the
convention but issued a statement here saying that ``today's
research highlights the fact that, regardless of weight, vehicle
design can play a major role in aggressivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers have said until recently that light trucks
inevitably cause more deaths in the vehicles they hit than cars do
because the light trucks weigh more, not because of their design.
Americans want to drive large vehicles, and big vehicles will
always outweigh smaller vehicles, the auto makers have said.
</P>
<P>
   But that attitude has begun to shift, and auto makers' safety
experts were far less critical of Monday's studies than they might
have been two years ago. ``I'm skeptical, but I need to go through
it,'' said Terrence E. Connelly, General Motors' North American
safety director, adding that ``there are factors that make trucks
less compatible with cars in a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Connelly, Don Vander Lugt, presented a separate study
here concluding that at least when vehicles are struck in the side
by any vehicle, the stiffness, height, width and curvature of the
striking vehicle's front end were each more important than the
striking vehicle's weight. But GM officials continued to maintain
that weight was very important in frontal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, regulators distributed the results of four
side-impact crash tests, their first effort to test what happens
when light trucks hit cars. They found that a Ford Explorer did the
most damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the test results released on Monday, a Chevrolet Lumina
midsized sedan, a Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, a Chevrolet
S-10 pickup and a Dodge Caravan mini-van were each crashed at 35
miles an hour into the front, driver's-side corners of Honda Accord
sedans moving in nearly the opposite direction at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer again did the most damage while the Lumina did the
least, Hollowell said. The Explorer did more than three times as
much damage as the Lumina to the heads of the crash dummies in the
driver's seat of the Accord. The Explorer also did twice as much
harm to the chest and neck of these dummies, which were wearing
seat belts and were protected by air bags that deployed
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher, said the crash test
results were not grave. None of the crash dummies suffered injuries
from the light truck that are likely to be fatal, although some of
the dummies suffered potentially permanent leg injuries, he said.
Frontal collisions are less deadly than side-impact crashes.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the test also showed that the Explorer nearly
rolled over after hitting the Accord, teetering on two wheels for a
moment before coming down on all four wheels. Sport utility
vehicles roll over nearly four times as often as cars, according to
another study released here; spinal injuries from traffic accidents
usually occur because a vehicle has rolled over. Ford officials
said they would have to study the videotape before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   At a safety conference last summer Martinez alluded to the
possibility that light trucks were causing as many as 2,000 extra
deaths a year but did not discuss the relative roles of weight and
design. The death toll was confirmed for the agency by a
statistical study of traffic deaths in 1996 conducted by Hans
Joksch, a safety expert at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at how many car occupants would have survived
if they had been hit not by sport utility vehicles, pickups or vans
but by cars that weighed as much as the light trucks that struck
them. The 2,000 extra deaths represent 5 percent of the 40,000
Americans who die annually in highway traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Prasad estimated last April, using methods similar to Joksch's,
that there were 1,000 extra deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Ford took the first step in addressing the design
mismatches criticized by regulators. The company said its next
sport utility vehicle, which will be the world's largest, will have
hollow steel bars below the front and rear bumpers that are
designed to prevent the big vehicle from riding over cars in
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hollowell said on Monday that while regulators had not tested
the device, it was ``a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A separate paper on Monday, written by two private researchers
with a grant from Ford, found that occupants of sport utility
vehicles on average fare no better than car occupants in crashes.
But belted occupants of sport utilities do somewhat better in
crashes than car occupants, belted or otherwise, while unbelted
occupants of sport utilities fare the worst because they are likely
to be thrown through windows if their vehicles roll over.
</P>
<P>
   The crash test involving the Caravan produced a surprising
result that, regulators said, was unrelated to their research into
vehicle compatibility in traffic accidents. The Caravan's passenger
side air bag heavily damaged the crash dummy's neck and probably
would have killed a real passenger. The agency used a dummy that
simulated a short woman; air bags have been killing about 20 short
women and children a year, while saving hundreds of lives annually,
according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Gruber McLean, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler AG,
which makes the Dodge Caravan, said the company was worried about
the test's outcome and wanted to see the details. Only Dodge,
Plymouth and Chrysler mini-vans from the 1996 and 1997 model years
use the air bag system involved in the crash test, Ms. McLean said.
She added that the company was outraged that safety regulators had
waited eight months after the test before releasing the results.

MARKETS CLOSE MIXED AFTER UNUSUALLY LIGHT TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fresh signs of strong economic growth preyed on the
bond market again Monday, pulling down stock prices early, but
major market gauges pared their declines and closed narrowly mixed
on unusually light volume.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected gain in the index of manufacturing
compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management led
to wholesale selling in the bond market. In its survey, the
association said its index during February climbed to 52.4, the
first time the index had risen above 50 since last May. A reading
above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 9/32, to
94 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, rose to 5.66 percent from 5.57 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in yields pushed long-term rates back to levels
last seen in August, before Russia defaulted on its debt
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the themes everyone talked about earlier in the decade
was that the bond market helped to self-regulate the economy,''
said Lou Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole mechanism was ignored in the second half of last
year,'' he said. ``The bond market ignored the ongoing strength in
the U.S. economy, and that stimulated absolutely stratospheric
performance in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, like
housing. Now bond yields have gone back to levels where mortgage
applications will slow.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deterioration in bond prices, fears about the
high prices of technology shares caused problems for stocks early
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to the surprise of some, the market rallied and closed
little changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.20 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 9,324.78. Hurt by a pounding in Intel
shares, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.17 points, or
nearly two-tenths of a percent, to 1,236.16. But the Nasdaq
composite index managed to rise 7.15 points, or three-tenths of a
percent, to 2,295.18. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company
stocks gained 2.13 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 394.39.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was reminiscent of that old Timex watch
commercial,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald. ``It takes a licking but keeps on ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Allyn, director of listed trading at Jeffries &AMP; Co., said,
``We are still in this push-pull, rip-tear environment, where the
market has violent swings but doesn't end up going very far.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, a relatively sparse 699.5 million shares
changed hands. On the Nasdaq market, where volume has routinely
approached 1 billion shares lately, just more than 771 million
shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, trading activity tends to pick up at the start of a
new month as pension funds and other institutional investors put
fresh money into their stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But given the uncertainties about market valuations and the
state of the economy, analysts said, it was not altogether
surprising the pace of business has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The bond and stock markets will pay particular attention to
Friday's employment report from the Labor Department. ``Who wants
to make a big commitment in front of the employment numbers?''
Meehan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts are expecting the report to show a rise in nonfarm
payroll employment of 250,000, but they are bracing for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers have come in above consensus for the last three
months,'' Crandall said. ``There would be a certain amount of
relief if we got through the report with no nasty surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about slowing sales of personal computers, set off last
week by a report from Compaq Computer, continued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the biggest maker of computer chips, led the S&AMP;P 500
index lower, dropping 2~, to 117 1/16 after Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette cut its ratings on the stock. Compaq fell 2, to 33\. And
IBM lost 1], to 168].
</P>
<P>
   But financial stocks, which have never fully recovered from last
summer's sell-off, did well. So did companies whose performance is
tied to a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, Citigroup gained 2{, to 61\; American
Express rose 3, to 111{, and Chase Manhattan was up 1[, to 80}.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction
equipment, was the best-performing component of the Dow. It gained
3|, to 49 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, the No. 1 auto maker, gained 9/16, to 83. And
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum company, gained ~, to 41].
</P>
<P>
   Not all technology stocks suffered Monday. Microsoft rose 1|, to
151}; Cisco Systems gained 1|, to 99 7/16, and Lucent Technologies
rose 1 5/16, to 102~.
</P>
<P>
   Many big Internet stocks also did well. Yahoo gained 6|, to
160[, and Amazon.com rose 4~, to 133.

DENIAL AND FEAR: LIFE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peggy Parraga, a part-time massage therapist from
Queens, divides her life into two phases: the time when she and her
family had health insurance, and now, when they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, she had a baby at Our Lady of Mercy Medical
Center in the Bronx, which accepted her managed care plan, offered
good prenatal care and even served her and her husband a
celebratory champagne dinner. In 1996, pregnant again but
uninsured, she could afford only a clinic at Elmhurst Hospital
Center, and endured a chaotic and unpleasant delivery by a doctor
she had never met.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parraga said she used to be good about checkups for her
family. Now, her husband, a draftsman whose employer stopped
offering insurance several years ago, has aches and pains that he
cannot afford to have checked. ``It has really made a big
difference in my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To live without health insurance is to linger between denial and
fear. It means ignoring the little pains and dealing with the
unmanageable ones in a frantic way. It is knocking wood for good
health while knowing that the worst medical calamities can show up
at the most inconvenient times.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the uninsured cobble together an approach of avoiding
care whenever possible, and when it is not possible, using hospital
emergency rooms or pay-as-you-can clinics. Some of them resort to
sharing medications with other family members, and others just live
with an aching cough they hope will go away. Some choose their
medical battles _ say an annual mammogram _ and pay upfront for
them; others dodge their bills and hope not to get caught.
</P>
<P>
   And many young, single and healthy people, even those with
reasonable incomes, simply take a calculated risk that they will
never need to see a doctor at all.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the uninsured are not the poorest of the
poor, who tend to be covered by Medicaid, the government health
insurance program for the indigent. Indeed, of the 43 million
Americans without health insurance, 75 percent work at least part
time, but are not offered insurance through an employer or cannot
afford their contribution. And their numbers are swelling, as the
price of insurance rises _ especially for small businesses _ and as
more people move from welfare to jobs where there are few benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in New York, where 19.1
percent of the state's residents under 65 _ or roughly 3 million _
are without health insurance, compared with a national average of
17.6 percent. Three-quarters of them work. (The rest tend to be
students, children and early retirees.) And the ranks of the
uninsured are growing faster in New York than in the nation as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because New York has a large working population
of illegal immigrants, and a plethora of small entreprenurial
companies, like those in the new electronic media, that are too new
and unstable to offer benefits. Further, New York is home to a
disproportionate number of people who toil in the visual and
performance arts, many of whom put together a living with part-time
or free-lance work without benefits. The state has about 1.5
million part-time workers, second only to California, according to
the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. For many of the uninsured,
individual coverage can be prohibitively expensive, or too meager
to be worth the cost. Those costs vary wildly: $100 a month for
no-frills coverage to $400 a month and up for extensive benefits
similar to an employer's package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am wary of the monthly expense,'' said David Wickland, who
works four days a week as an office temp and paints the rest of the
week in his Brooklyn studio. ``Anything that I could afford would
basically be for just the most minimal ambulatory care. At $100 a
month, I am unable to justify it. I don't go to doctors when there
is an option not to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For the occasional emergency, going without coverage can work.
Wickland, who earns roughly $33,000 a year, fell off a ladder
recently and fractured his femur. He called several clinics until
he was referred to the public Gouverneur Skilled Nursing Facility,
Diagnostic and Treatment Center, where a long wait and confusing
maze of transfers and paperwork finally resulted in care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really chaotic,'' he said. ``People speaking several
languages were running everywhere; it was very mixed up. I had to
wait a couple hours in this waiting room, and it was strange to see
that people were in a lot of pain waiting for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   For $80 and a card that would allow him to come back for a
checkup, he considered himself a satisfied customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that if something like that came up I would have
some place to go, and I was relieved it was available,'' he said.
``But it also made me leery about going on without health
insurance. There are certain things like teeth care, or a mole that
should be looked at, and I just can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with complicated or chronic health problems, this
strategy often fails.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Brooks at first blush seems to be the perfect candidate for
scraping by without insurance. She is 27, lives with her mother in
Harlem and works 35 hours a week with disabled people, netting
about $1,200 a month. Checkups and annual dental appointments are
within her financial reach, and she is happy that she no longer has
to rely on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But her health problems are daunting: She has severe asthma, a
defective heart valve, a chronic gastrointestinal disorder and
anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Under Medicaid, she would go to a medical office at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Manhattan for most of her ailments and for dental
care, and she took advantage of the hospital's cardiac care center.
</P>
<P>
   But now, she must pay $74 per visit to Mount Sinai, a figure
computed from a stack of pay stubs she dragged to a recent visit.
Visiting the cardiac center is out of the question now, as are many
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So she borrows asthma drugs from her mother and has taken to
swallowing over-the-counter antidotes for her intestinal problems.
(``It makes things bearable.'') She hit her head recently and had
to go to the emergency room. In trying to come up with $600 to pay
for it, she has ignored a phone bill. ``I like working,'' she said.
``But it is frustrating because I cannot afford to get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mental health problems, which need constant attention, get
perhaps the shortest shrift. Yolanda Bako, who is 52, has worked as
an off-track betting clerk for three years. She works 20 hours a
week and until just recently was not eligible for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Her medical home is Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, a public
hospital 12 blocks from her cramped apartment. The hospital offers
a clinic with a sliding scale of fees, where she goes for
everything from a sore throat to urinary tract infections to
depression.
</P>
<P>
   But getting good care for the latter has been the most
problematic. She has taken 20 different antidepressants in the last
few years, she said, and when she goes to Jacobi's psychiatric
clinic, a different doctor sees her each time.
</P>
<P>
   When she told one of them she felt suicidal, she was told to go
to the hospital's in-patient unit, where she said she was kept for
eight days and emerged without a diagnosis or plan. ``I was the
closest thing to a rational person there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Total bill: $14,000, none of which she could pay. Her bank
account was impounded, and she has battled her way through hospital
administrators and courts to sort out a payment plan, which she
admits she has not always honored. ``This is supposed to be the
cheapest hospital around,'' she said. ``I didn't understand how it
could be so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone interviewed said that in a pinch, the emergency room is
the place to head for care. ``They scold me,'' said Mrs. Parraga,
who sometimes takes her children there when they have high fevers.
``But I just can't sit home with a sick baby.''
</P>
<P>
   City hospital emergency rooms do not just offer a poor choice
for those who seek to use them as doctors' offices; they are a
severe drain on the system. When there are wages to garnish, as in
the case of Ms. Bako, it can be done. But more often, care for the
uninsured is written off as bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Marcos, president of Health and Hospitals Corp., which
runs the city's 11 public hospitals, regularly cites the uninsured
as the largest economic drain on his system. Of the city's
uninsured population, 71 percent seek care through his hospitals
and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a health care world that all the philosophers these days
want to make into a competitive marketplace, these are nonpaying
customers,'' said James Tallon Jr., president of United Hospital
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki recently vetoed a bill that sought
to enrich Health and Hospital Corp.'s charity pools by $100
million, and he has said he is interested in earmarking only a
small portion of the tobacco settlement money for the uninsured. In
the meantime, those without insurance take services they are not
equipped to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin sheepishly admits he is part of the problem. At
43, he stitches together a living of about $30,000 a year with
writing and roofing. While repairing a roof last year, he got a bad
splinter that became infected. He has yet to pay the $150 bill for
a tetanus shot at a hospital in Yonkers, near his home. The bill
has been turned over to a collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to live like that,'' he said. ``But I am not
making a lot of money right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of preventative care is largely viewed as one of the
most serious medical issues affecting the poor. The stories are
well known among policy- makers, like the women who show up in the
emergency room with horrible coughs and are diagnosed with advanced
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that even people who can afford insurance
and choose to forgo it are missing out on preventative care. Adam
Coti, who is 30, estimates that he makes around $65,000 a year
between his two jobs as a Web page designer and a free-lance
circulation consultant, depending on how much work he gets.
</P>
<P>
   He is tilting toward one of the fastest-growing groups of
uninsured Americans: Households with annual incomes of $75,000 or
more accounted for half the increase in the number of the uninsured
last year, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Cotti's logic works like this: He gets an ear infection each
winter, which costs him roughly $150 after a clinic visit and a
prescription. This is cheaper than the $250 in monthly premiums he
was offered for a very basic insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   But his father died of colon cancer, which is often hereditary,
easily diagnosed and curable if caught early with the recommended
annual test. ``My mother reminds me that I need to spend up to
$1,000 for a general checkup,'' he said. ``I don't believe in
skimping on that. It has to be done. I want to make sure that `one
of these days' doesn't turn into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest fear is a catastrophe. ``I am not looking for the
best insurance in the world,'' Coti said. ``I'll take a huge
deductible. But one out-of-control cabdriver mad at his dispatcher
hits the pedal, and I am in trouble. I go bike riding, and there
are a couple of steep hills where I live, and I think to myself,
`You don't have insurance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Pearlman has come up with an unusual solution to the
expense of health insurance: When it comes time to go the the
doctor, she simply leaves the country. Ms. Pearlman, who works as
an adjunct professor at Columbia University and does free-lance
computer work, has been uninsured since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she was on a writers' retreat in Merida, in the
Yucatan region of Mexico, when she had a dental emergency. What she
found was so fantastic, she said, that she decided to go back. She
has had dental work that would have cost $2,000 at home for $200,
and blood tests for $10. She has received checkups and the like
each of the six times she returned there, and twice went there just
to get some minor surgery. The doctors are first rate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to discovering other health care systems in
other countries,'' she said. ``Because I have no hope of availing
myself to the care system in America.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS SCANDAL HAS NO LIFE IN THE PUBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before a single page of another special report on the
Lewinsky-long Olympic scandal was unveiled on Monday in New York,
one could hear Bud Greenspan editing it all out of his next
documentary film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Games as a higher form of the human spirit,''
Greenspan said after dropping by a midtown hotel to hear more about
the Olympic lowlifes who demanded bribes and purchased votes. ``The
number of people engaged in illegality and immorality is small. I'd
rather spend my time with the 90 percent that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch and George Mitchell, the former Senate
majority leader, are apparently not on Greenspan's list. Problem or
solution. Corrupter or reformer. To the eclectic filmmaker, they
are all bureaucrats in blazers, politicians in suits, all belonging
on the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the athletes, always about the athletes,''
Greenspan said. ``The Olympics are two weeks in never-never land.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what they have been revealed to be the rest of the
year. Never mind that Mitchell, as chairman of a U.S. Olympic
Committee commission, claimed on Monday that the Olympic movement
has been ``gravely damaged'' in the wake of the Olympics-for-sale
turpitude. In the view through Greenspan's lens, the athletes will
train, the networks will come. From Sydney to Salt Lake, the Games
will go on.
</P>
<P>
   If Samaranch and his International Olympic Committee really
wanted to make a statement that would resonate for decades, they
would expel every delegate who took a bribe and take the 2002
Winter Games out of Salt Lake. That would cost plenty, though, and
as Mitchell said, the Olympics are ``big business,'' an incongruity
that shrinks in the company of its ancient and long-dead ideal. So
unless the underwriting sponsors get religion and make more than an
obligatory stink, the IOC will graciously accept all these ethics
reports, and unilaterally make its own rules. The
bureaucrats-in-blazers, as always, will be left with the
responsibility of policing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that people around the world are just as concerned
as we are,'' said Mitchell, when asked why other bidding countries
might consider his committee's recommendations to better control
future bidding. ``We do not believe that Americans have a monopoly
on morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, we have recently been distracted from our
duties as moral monopolists, fitting a certain coach-choker into
the Knicks' championship puzzle. And while this Olympic mess has
undoubtedly been a gut-wrenching experience in Salt Lake City, I
have not detected much local outpouring of anxiety. As sports
scandals go, let's be honest, this one isn't playing in the pubs.
</P>
<P>
   This last assertion cannot be proved, or polled, but Christopher
Russo, the Mad Dog on WFAN, sports talk radio in New York, is still
waiting for his first Olympic call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one in all these months _ can you believe that?'' the Dog
barked on Monday on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Russo admitted that this has been a busy talk winter, with the
Jets, and Sprewell, and Roger Clemens. On the list of topics, he
rated the Olympic mess somewhere below the possibility of Rey
Ordonez hitting .260 this season for the Mets. NBC's Dick Ebersol
was a guest last week, and the Salt Lake story did come up. Not a
single caller took the cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares,'' Russo said. ``People are so used to scandals,
and this one doesn't have anything to do with New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like, say, the one that involves the city's mayor and his
inexplicable desire to build almost as many new taxpayer-financed
sports stadiums as there are crumbling schools. Donald Fehr, the
baseball union chief and a member of Mitchell's commission, was
nice enough to explain the difference between that kind of ``big
business'' and the Olympic, nonprofit sort, but I left the news
conference doing the simple math. A few hundred thousand dollars
worth of graft to get the Olympics does not equal hundreds of
millions to keep the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Mitchell report conveniently takes the
sanitized position that, in the final analysis, Salt Lake's
``superior presentation'' won it the Olympics, not the payoffs.
This eminently debatable opinion is made for talk radio, if only
anyone really cared.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan happens to be right. The Olympics are about the
athletes and their stories, about two weeks of television from some
exotic, never-never land. Olympians are the ultimate disposable
heroes, serving up a giant sports feast every two years, on paper
plates. When it's over, all we want is the garbage thrown out, and
hauled far, far away. &QL;

REPUBLIC BANK TO ELIMINATE 560 JOBS IN REORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republic New York Corp., battered late last year by its
losses in volatile overseas markets, said on Monday it planned to
eliminate about 560 jobs, or about 7 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said that 384 of the job cuts would be layoffs, while
127 positions would be eliminated through contract arrangements
that include new job offers for those employees. The rest of the
cuts would be through attrition and a hiring freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts are part of a broader reorganization over the next
18 months aimed at refocusing the bank on its global private
banking business and other niche businesses such as currency
trading. Republic said it planned to close its securities trading
and derivatives businesses and would take a pretax charge of $97
million in the first quarter to account for the reorganization. It
will also incur $7 million in pretax expenses in the quarter,
primarily related to ending some employee-benefit programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republic said the moves should result in about $42 million in
pretax savings this year. In trading Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange, shares of Republic rose 37.5 cents, to $45.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Republic is controlled by Edmond J. Safra, a legendary banker
whose family has been involved in the industry for more than 150
years, but who has been struggling with Parkinson's disease.
Safra's poor health has led to speculation that he might be
grooming Republic for a sale, something the bank declined to
comment on but which investment bankers and analysts consider to be
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nephews in the family who are poised to assume
leadership, so I'd be very surprised if Edmond Safra is preparing
to sell the bank,'' said Judah Kruashaar, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. ``They're just trying to cut the fat out of a highly
paternalistic company.''
</P>
<P>
   Republic, which earned $117.5 million, or $2.07 a share, in the
first quarter last year, suffered more than $190 million in trading
losses in the third quarter because of errant bets on Russian
securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian losses were an unusual, though not unheard of, blow
for Republic, the nation's 19th-largest bank, with about $50
billion in assets. Safra, 66, who is also chairman of Safra
Republic Holdings SA, a private European banking unit of Republic,
owns 28.5 percent of Republic New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republic has a traditional consumer branch network in
New York, its more sophisticated businesses are in private banking,
precious metals trading and financial services it performs for
securities firms and highly volatile hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republic said its reorganization would seek to expand its
private banking business, which has always thrived internationally
but has not grown as quickly as planned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're in a cost-cutting and revenue-building mode,''
said Marni Pont O'Doherty, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods
Inc. ``The potential for Republic to generate better revenue growth
is there but they still have a way to go.''

RUIZ URGES IMPROVEMENTS WHILE REFLECTING ON CHANGES IN TEXAS
PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See PRISONS-TEXAS, which will move shortly) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ David Ruiz, the inmate whose name is
synonymous with prison reform in Texas, has lived the past 11
years, locked alone in a 6-by-9-foot cell 23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   It has given him plenty of time to reflect on conditions behind
bars _ conditions he played a key role in changing with the
30-page, handwritten lawsuit he filed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   And while much has improved, Ruiz says now, much remains the
same, particularly abusive guards and poor medical attention.
Although he was unaware that Senior U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice recently held three weeks of hearings on prison
conditions, Ruiz would be in favor of the judge's ruling Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate said that he hoped the judge would not abandon the
case that triggered both reforms and the largest prison expansion
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be bitter and hateful,'' said the 56-year-old
convict, his forearms bearing the scars of repeated self-mutilation
with razor blades while behind bars. ``All that is over. Some years
back I made a commitment to God. I know I made a big change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was one of 13 children born in Austin to migrant farm
workers. A fifth-grade dropout who later became one of the state's
most prolific jailhouse lawyers, he has spent the better part of
his life in lock-up. He was first sent to reform school at age 12.
His first prison sentence came at age 18 when he robbed an Austin
store and stole a car. Paroled, he was soon picked up for robbery
again.
</P>
<P>
   Now sentenced to life as a habitual offender, his home is the
Estelle Unit, located just outside Huntsville in the tiny community
of Riverside. There, he has been held in administrative segregation
_ where he is virtually isolated from all other prisoners _ since
he last returned to the Texas prison system in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Normally smiling, his eyes dancing and his thoughts spilling out
in a rush of words, Ruiz's demeanor changes when he talks about his
solitary lifestyle. The cadence of his speech slows, the smile
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of ad seg,'' he says, his eyes clouding, his voice
choking. &UR;  &LR; ``Can you imagine being in a little room 23 hours a day
for 11 years?''
</P>
<P>
   The one hour a day he is let out of his cell, he is escorted _
his hands cuffed behind his back _ to a caged recreation yard for
60 minutes of playing basketball, doing chin-ups, walking, jogging
or whatever _ all by himself. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``You walk around and look up at the sky and wish and hope.
Hope for a better tomorrow,'' he said. ``Very few can feel the
effects that being confined (in isolation) this long has.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is in solitary confinement, prison officials say, because
his membership in the Mexican Mafia prison gang and his lawsuit
make him a target. Ruiz contends he is not a member of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``big change'' he says he has made in prison, Ruiz
says he is more tolerant of his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to file a grievance on every little thing, but now I
don't, because I know everyone makes mistakes,'' he said while
pulling out an accordion file and displaying his latest verbal
sparring with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   His latest beef is with a correctional officer who placed a
long-distance collect phone call to his wife, Rose. Ruiz was told
that the woman who answered refused to accept charges. He believes
the guard either intentionally misdialed or lied to him. The
rejection of the phone call means another 90-day wait before he can
try to call his wife again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was done to do, like, mental torture on me, so I
would think, `Why doesn't she want to talk to me?''' Ruiz said.
``That is cruel. To a person in the free society, it might not seem
like much, but to someone in prison it means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As further proof of his personal transformation, Ruiz says he
quit doing drugs 13 years ago. Yet his ``travel card'' _ a packet
of information outlining his medical needs, disciplinary
infractions and other detail about his confinement _ indicates he
has been disciplined often for possession of drugs and other
contraband, as recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a prison stint in the late '60s that Ruiz met a
lawyer who helped him draft a challenge to his robbery conviction,
and Ruiz the writ-writer was born. In 1972, he scrawled the now
legendary lawsuit against prison conditions, detailing complaints
of extreme crowding, lack of medical care, and abusive and
oppressive ``building tenders'' (inmate guards) who sometimes raped
and killed other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that medical care has improved since then, ``but I
don't know how much better. I can't agree with TDCJ that it's
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said prisoners with AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis suffer
the most from inconsistent care, and that some doctors routinely
dismiss most prisoners' health complaints as malingering. He does
not respond, however, to a question of whether prisoners get better
medical care than poor people who are not imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges that some prison guards treat offenders
respectfully, he contends that others _ particularly young officers
from small towns in East Texas ``who come in with a macho attitude
_ are still abusive to felons. Inmates frequently are assaulted by
guards even when the prisoners are handcuffed, Ruiz claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're disliked by some officer, then you're in danger,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is challenging his classification in
administrative segregation by renouncing membership in the Mexican
Mafia _ a gang he insisted at least as far back as 1992 that he had
never joined. But last week, he admitted that he had agreed to be
the mafia's legal adviser during a time when he was in federal
prison, where he was housed because of concerns for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, shortly after he was returned to state custody, Ruiz
told the Houston Chronicle he feared for his life. He said another
prisoner told him he had been offered $25,000 to kill him, and that
he had been attacked by a federal prisoner in Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Now he downplays TDCJ's insistence that he needs protection from
other prisoners, claiming it's a ``bogus'' assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in danger all my life,'' he said last week. ``I'm in
danger of being killed every day by some crazy inmate or some
officer.''

 &HT;    Panel gives recommendations on Olympic gift-giving
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General News and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A commission formed to take a hard look at U.S.
cities' bidding practices for the Olympic Games placed the blame
for the festering scandal squarely on the International Olympic
Committee and suggested widespread reform to eliminate ``a broader
culture of improper gift-giving.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee ethics panel, chaired by former U.S.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, released a 53-page report
Monday that examined the ``troubling events in Salt Lake City and
other host cities'' and recommended ways to avert such abuses in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibiting gifts of more than nominal value, paying for travel
to bid cities through a central fund administered by the USOC or
IOC and establishing a national office of bid compliance are some
of the recommendations. The panel also believes that the IOC should
open its financial records to the public and that its members
should be subject to elections and term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intense competition to host the Olympic Games coupled with
the multi-billion-dollar enterprise'' of hosting the Games ,'' the
report said, ``have exposed the weaknesses in the movement's
governing structures and operational controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said his committee did not investigate Atlanta's
winning bid for the 1996 Games because it was ``not essential for
the purposes for which this commission was created.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did criticize the IOC for not heeding a warning sounded
in 1991 by Toronto, which lost to Atlanta and complained of the
flaws in the process: ``The Toronto prophesy has come true. As a
result, credibility of the Olympic movement has been gravely
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who has been in
charge of the organization's internal inquiry, said that he does
``not for a moment accept any broadbrush characterization of IOC as
a culture of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he has not read the Mitchell report but will soon.
The IOC is under no obligation to adopt any of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some genuine suggestions for improvement,''
he said. ``We're not saying we're perfect by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said a ban on gifts would be considered. ``You could knock
off a lot of the problems by saying, 'No gifts,''' Pound said,
``but a golf shirt saying Salt Lake City doesn't seem to me to be
something to make the earth shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the panel found that Salt Lake City, in conjunction with the
USOC, did try to sway votes through a training program for Sudanese
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In a hand-written note, Tom Wilkinson, assistant executive
director of the USOC, said that use of a grant to train the
Sudanese athletes did not look ``like a wise investment unless IOC
votes are involved!!!'' Later, he commented that ``a deal is a deal
and Sudan delivered . . . . May need Sudan again in future. Don't
burn bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Afredo LaMont, the USOC's director of international relations
and protocol, resigned in January.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC's top officials will address the Mitchell report
Wednesday at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Turanchik, leader of the joint Florida bid for the 2012
Olympics from Tampa, St. Petersburg and Orlando, said he and the
other seven hopeful U.S. cities are already operating under strict
controls by the USOC, which must approve each press release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have tight rules that were occasionally
burdensome,'' he said, ``than a wide open free-for-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bid papers are due in 395 days, and the USOC will select its
candidate city in the fall of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Rosen writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS OF USOC RECOMMENDED CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: Prohibit bid cities from giving to IOC or USOC members
anything of more than nominal value, and from directly paying their
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: IOC members are prohibited from accepting gifts valued
at more than $150, and $50 for USOC members. Bid cities pay for all
travel.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The USOC should establish an independent Office of Bid
Compliance, prohibit cities from having or participating in any
international assistance program, strictly apply the criteria for
the award and administration of its international assistance fund
and strengthen its Bid Procedures Manual.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: There is no bid compliance entity; bid and candidate
cities have worked with the USOC in the international assistance
program, and sometimes initiated their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The IOC should elect a substantial majority of its
members nominated by outside sports organizations. Athlete members
should be chosen by athletes. Public sector members should best
represent the interests of the public. Members should be subject to
periodic re-election with appropriate term limits. Financial
records should be audited by an independent firm and the results
disclosed publicly. Appropriate gift-giving rules and strict travel
and expense rules should be adopted and vigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC elects its members at the recommendation of the
executive board. Members elected before 1966 serve for life; those
elected after 1966 serve until age 80. Only the IOC can expel a
member. All IOC financial records are closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The USOC should request the president of the United
States to consider naming the IOC ``a public international
organization'' to make it comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC is not subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The IOC should not award the Olympics to any country
that has not taken steps to enact a law that applies the principles
of the Anti-Bribery Convention of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, signed by 34 governments, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC is not subject to the Anti-Bribery Convention.

 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General News and (s) Sports categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A commission formed to take a hard look at U.S.
cities' bidding practices for the Olympic Games placed the blame
for the festering scandal squarely on the International Olympic
Committee and suggested widespread reform to eliminate ``a broader
culture of improper gift-giving.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee ethics panel, chaired by former U.S.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, released a 53-page report
Monday that examined the ``troubling events in Salt Lake City and
other host cities'' and recommended ways to avert such abuses in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibiting gifts of more than nominal value, paying for travel
to bid cities through a central fund administered by the USOC or
IOC and establishing a national office of bid compliance are some
of the recommendations. The panel also believes that the IOC should
open its financial records to the public and that its members
should be subject to elections and term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intense competition to host the Olympic Games coupled with
the multi-billion-dollar enterprise'' of hosting the Games ,'' the
report said, ``have exposed the weaknesses in the movement's
governing structures and operational controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said his committee did not investigate Atlanta's
winning bid for the 1996 Games because it was ``not essential for
the purposes for which this commission was created.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did criticize the IOC for not heeding a warning sounded
in 1991 by Toronto, which lost to Atlanta and complained of the
flaws in the process: ``The Toronto prophesy has come true. As a
result, credibility of the Olympic movement has been gravely
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who has been in
charge of the organization's internal inquiry, said that he does
``not for a moment accept any broadbrush characterization of IOC as
a culture of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he has not read the Mitchell report but will soon.
The IOC is under no obligation to adopt any of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some genuine suggestions for improvement,''
he said. ``We're not saying we're perfect by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said a ban on gifts would be considered. ``You could knock
off a lot of the problems by saying, 'No gifts,''' Pound said,
``but a golf shirt saying Salt Lake City doesn't seem to me to be
something to make the earth shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the panel found that Salt Lake City, in conjunction with the
USOC, did try to sway votes through a training program for Sudanese
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In a hand-written note, Tom Wilkinson, assistant executive
director of the USOC, said that use of a grant to train the
Sudanese athletes did not look ``like a wise investment unless IOC
votes are involved!!!'' Later, he commented that ``a deal is a deal
and Sudan delivered . . . . May need Sudan again in future. Don't
burn bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Afredo LaMont, the USOC's director of international relations
and protocol, resigned in January.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC's top officials will address the Mitchell report
Wednesday at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Turanchik, leader of the joint Florida bid for the 2012
Olympics from Tampa, St. Petersburg and Orlando, said he and the
other seven hopeful U.S. cities are already operating under strict
controls by the USOC, which must approve each press release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have tight rules that were occasionally
burdensome,'' he said, ``than a wide open free-for-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bid papers are due in 395 days, and the USOC will select its
candidate city in the fall of 2002.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS OF USOC RECOMMENDED CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: Prohibit bid cities from giving to IOC or USOC members
anything of more than nominal value, and from directly paying their
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: IOC members are prohibited from accepting gifts valued
at more than $150, and $50 for USOC members. Bid cities pay for all
travel.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The USOC should establish an independent Office of Bid
Compliance, prohibit cities from having or participating in any
international assistance program, strictly apply the criteria for
the award and administration of its international assistance fund
and strengthen its Bid Procedures Manual.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: There is no bid compliance entity; bid and candidate
cities have worked with the USOC in the international assistance
program, and sometimes initiated their own programs.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The IOC should elect a substantial majority of its
members nominated by outside sports organizations. Athlete members
should be chosen by athletes. Public sector members should best
represent the interests of the public. Members should be subject to
periodic re-election with appropriate term limits. Financial
records should be audited by an independent firm and the results
disclosed publicly. Appropriate gift-giving rules and strict travel
and expense rules should be adopted and vigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC elects its members at the recommendation of the
executive board. Members elected before 1966 serve for life; those
elected after 1966 serve until age 80. Only the IOC can expel a
member. All IOC financial records are closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The USOC should request the president of the United
States to consider naming the IOC ``a public international
organization'' to make it comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC is not subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.
</P>
<P>
   PROPOSED: The IOC should not award the Olympics to any country
that has not taken steps to enact a law that applies the principles
of the Anti-Bribery Convention of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, signed by 34 governments, including
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENT: The IOC is not subject to the Anti-Bribery Convention.

 &HT;    Indiana developer pays $1.7 billion for Weeks
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Weeks Corp., a Norcross, Ga.-based real estate
investment trust that has been rapidly growing in metro Atlanta and
the Southeast, is being acquired for $1.7 billion by Duke Realty
Investments Inc. of Indianapolis, a large developer. Both
specialize in office and industrial properties.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is seen by some analysts as Duke's bet that the
Southeastern market, softened by increased construction, will
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term these are solid markets, but the question is whether
Duke is buying markets that are on the way down or are they buying
at the bottom,'' said Kevin Lampo of Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks needed new markets and new capital if it were to maintain
its growth rate, said Jay Leupp, managing director and senior real
estate analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``This gives
shareholders both access to Midwest and Northeast markets as well
as a stronger balance sheet with an investment grade rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Ray Weeks Jr. said his company has been talking with
Duke for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies approved the deal Sunday, Weeks
said. Shareholders will vote in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks will become vice chairman, president and chief operating
officer and remain in Atlanta. Weeks Vice Chairman and Chief
Investment Officer Tom Senkbeil will become chief investment
officer for the new company, Duke-Weeks Realty Corp., based in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks' shares, which have suffered from concern that supply will
outstrip demand for its properties, were down 18 percent over the
past 12 months. They rose $1 Monday to close at $28.
</P>
<P>
   The price will be 1.38 shares of Duke for each share of Weeks,
or $28.89 a share based on Duke's closing price Monday of $20.93
3/4. Duke will assume $254 million of preferred stock and $654
million of debt. Leupp said net asset value of Weeks' properties is
$28 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke's timing is very good,'' Leupp said. ``Duke is getting
better pricing in buying the entire Weeks portfolio than it would
trying to put it together in the private market one asset at a
time.'' The acquisition comes amid a 15-monthlong slump in REIT
stocks that has hampered their ability to raise capital for
acquisitions and development.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila McGrath, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said
the deal could be the one that leads to a domino effect of a
long-anticipated consolidation in the REIT industry.

JUDGE REJECTS TEXAS' PLEA TO BE FREE OF FEDERAL SUPERVISION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See PRISONS-RUIZ) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Constitutional rights of Texas inmates are
routinely violated despite 20 years of judicial oversight and
official promises to improve prisoner treatment, senior U.S.
District Judge William Wayne Justice ruled Monday, rejecting the
state's latest plea to be relieved of federal-court supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said solitary confinement remains horrific for
mentally ill and other inmates; vulnerable prisoners are
unprotected from rape and assault; and guards rely on ``malicious
and sadistic'' excessive force to control the state's nearly
150,000 incarcerated offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But acknowledging gradual improvement in some facets of prison
operations, Justice said he found nothing unconstitutional about
medical and psychiatric care for inmates, even though it is at
times inadequate and negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Although prisons ``are designed to punish,'' Justice said when
someone is sentenced to confinement in the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, ``an offender should not _ and must not _ be
sentenced to a term of enslavement by gangs, rape and abuse by
predatory inmates, or excessive force by prison employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn said the ruling, which followed
three weeks of testimony from prison officials, hired experts and
complaining inmates, would be appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a class-action case filed in 1972 by inmate
David Ruiz, whose complaints led to sweeping changes in prison
conditions beginning in the late 1970s. By 1992, Justice said there
were enough improvements to warrant ending his oversight in all but
a few areas of prison operations, including use of force and the
solitary-confinement cells known as administrative segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a 1996 federal law aimed at curtailing federal-court
jurisdiction over state prison systems, Texas legislators and
Cornyn asked Justice to reconsider his stance. But in his 167-page
opinion and accompanying orders, Justice said Texas has failed to
live up to its previous promises to end certain unconstitutional
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying inmates claimed they were repeatedly raped, beaten
and robbed without consequence; others claimed they were brutalized
by guards and ignored when they sought medical help. Several
claimed they paid gang members with commissary credits and sexual
favors to avoid victimization, with tacit approval of guards.
</P>
<P>
   Justice said the ``conditions of confinement in administrative
segregation; failure to provide reasonable safety for assaulted and
abused inmates and excessive use of force by correctional officers
in Texas prisons violate the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge stated that the new federal law, known as the Prison
Litigation Reform Act, cannot be applied retroactively to the Ruiz
case. And even if it did, there are enough on-going constitutional
violations to justify his retaining an oversight role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurisdiction of this civil action will be retained, until such
time as the court determines that full and complete relief from
these constitutional violations has been obtained for the plaintiff
class (inmates),'' his ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, registering no surprise at the outcome, said he was
disappointed, though he believes the ruling was necessary to set up
a final showdown in appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months into my administration, we have succeeded in doing
what has not been done before _ and that is, getting a final
appealable decision on federal court oversight of our Texas prison
system,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all along have felt this was a first step in a process that
would ultimately end at the Fifth Circuit,'' he said. ``And that's
where we head next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means we lost this battle, but we are hopeful about
winning the war,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Board of Criminal Justice Chairman Allan Polunsky likewise
disagreed with Justice's conclusion, saying, ``enough is enough.
It's time to quit wasting time and money on this needless lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Justice has held on to this case for a quarter of a
century. It is time for him to let go and stop what is from this
point on a totally unwarranted intrusion into the authority of the
Texas Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky added, ``We feel strongly that Texas prisons meet all
constitutional mandates as a safe, clean and humane system, and in
fact in many areas exceed what is required.''
</P>
<P>
   The two state lawmakers who intervened in the case to press for
its termination heaped other criticisms on the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Justice has made it very clear through his past actions
that he feels the federal government can do a better job of running
our prisons than the state can,'' said Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown,
R-Lake Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's realistic to believe we will ever totally
eliminate problems within our prison system. However, the bottom
line is we have been in compliance for years. It's time to end this
unfair oversight,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, who launched the legal quest
with Brown nine years ago, said ``the finish line is finally in
sight for the people of Texas to end all federal control over the
prison system.'' That finish line, he said, is the day when ``we
the people will run the prisons, not a federal judge and some
lawyers from San Francisco'' _ a reference to the California-based,
court-appointed attorneys for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's bulky legal memorandum supporting his order said there
have been ``remarkable'' improvements in prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truly, much has changed,'' Justice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, plaintiffs and defendants alike look back with horror
at the way the system used to be. Plaintiffs and defendants alike
may also look back with pride at how much the system has changed,''
Justice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, transformation does not, in and of itself, a
constitutional institution make,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling prisons' health-care system, which relies heavily
on hospitals and medical schools based in Galveston and Lubbock,
barely passed muster with Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is determined that TDCJ's medical and psychiatric care
systems, while at times plagued by negligent and inadequate
treatment of members of the plaintiff class, are not so
deliberately indifferent to inmates' physical and mental health
needs as to be unconstitutional,'' Justice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extreme deprivations and repressive conditions of
confinement of Texas' administrative segregation units, however,''
do violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment,
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, inmates ``still live under conditions allowing a
substantial risk of physical and sexual abuse from other inmates,
as well as malicious and sadistic use of force by correctional
officers,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And despite its ``institutional awareness'' of those conditions,
the prison system ``has failed to take reasonable measures to
protect vulnerable inmates from other, predatory prisoners and
overzealous, physically aggressive state employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the judge lauded the system's efforts to ``punish, reform,
and rehabilitate society's offenders.'' He wrote the system
``employs many conscientious public servants _ individuals who
recognize that prisons must not only punish wrong-doers but also
attempt to improve them.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by saying ``it is hoped that these same public
servants, in light of the evidence produced before this court,
recognize that similar improvement is required of the prison system
itself.''

LOOKING FOR A BACKUP ROLE, KANELL VISITS REEVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Kanell met on Monday with Coach Dan Reeves at the Atlanta
Falcons offices to discuss a free-agent contract that would make
Kanell the backup to the often-injured starting quarterback, Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   When Kanell was released by the Giants last month, he said he
admired Reeves' offensive system. Reeves said he was in the market
for a backup and felt Kanell would be a good fit. Kanell has said
he knows he will have to accept a reserve role wherever he signs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Giants Stadium, Brian Williams, the center who has
missed the last two seasons because of an eye injury, returned to
the locker room Monday, taking the first steps in a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me goose bumps,'' he said. ``It's a dream come true.
My wife said I'm not allowed to complain about anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After being accidentally poked in the eye at the 1997 training
camp, Williams suffered from double vision that prevented him from
playing. Giants doctors tried several surgical procedures and
treatments for a year, but Williams' vision did not improve enough
until late in 1998 when a final surgery corrected the most
debilitating problem in Williams' recovery _ double vision when he
looked up, as he would in a football stance.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the double vision has diminished by about 75
percent, which he felt was more than good enough to attempt his
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to get my body back in football shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants on Monday also worked out tight end Pete Mitchell, a
free agent who played for Jacksonville last season. &QL;

ADVERTISING: MERCEDES-BENZ CONSOLIDATES ACCOUNT AT OMNICOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Texas, Calif., Minn.)  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the most closely followed recent advertising
stories took another surprising turn Monday when Mercedes-Benz of
North America decided to consolidate its account at Omnicom Group
by hiring Merkley Newman Harty in New York and other shops that are
part of the Diversified Agency Services division of Omnicom to
handle marketing assignments with billings estimated at $125
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz made its decision just three weeks after the
fraying ties with its agency since November 1993, Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS in New York, finally broke with the dismissal of Lowe
and two affiliates, effective on April 30. The decision came after
a brief competition for the prestigious account that pitted Omnicom
against True North Communications, another giant agency company
that like Omnicom already works for the Mercedes-Benz parent,
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had detailed meetings with both partners,'' Joe Eberhardt,
vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J.,
said in an interview at the company's glitzy flagship showroom in
midtown Manhattan. Omnicom, he added, ``offers what we are looking
for, a platform for us to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is indicative of the major trend remaking Madison
Avenue as huge agency companies like Omnicom offer increasingly
diverse services to meet the needs of multinational clients.
Merkley Newman will work with Omnicom siblings like Rapp Collins
Worldwide, handling duties like direct marketing; Alcone Marketing
Group, for promotions; Pentacom, for media buying, and the
Designory, for graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mercedes-Benz joins a long list of automotive
brands looking to Omnicom agencies for creative work. They include
Dodge, Isuzu, Nissan and Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about this opportunity,'' said John Wren,
president and chief executive at Omnicom in New York, who joined
Eberhardt for the interview. The Omnicom agencies that already
handle automotive accounts include BBDO Worldwide, DDB Needham
Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is also a huge step up for Merkley Newman, a
creatively focused agency with billings estimated at $165 million,
which Omnicom spun off from the venerable Doremus &AMP; Co. in New York
almost six years ago. Merkley Newman will handle advertising,
creative services and strategic and account planning for
Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the United States and Canada _ an
account that immediately becomes Merkley Newman's largest, just as
DaimlerChrysler is Omnicom's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't be happier,'' said Parry Merkley, president at
Merkley Newman in New York. ``What else could I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions will now get under way, he added, about such
``logistical implications'' as whether Merkley Newman will add to
its staff of 130 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other Merkley Newman clients include BellSouth Corp., Citigroup,
Forbes Inc. and Mars Inc. The agency is hoping, Merkley said, that
Mercedes-Benz will not deem it a conflict that Merkley Newman also
handles the account of BMW motorcycles, sold by a principal
Mercedes-Benz rival, BMW AG.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Merkley Newman also typifies the ability of
behemoths like Omnicom to manage their holdings for maximum
effectiveness. In May 1994, Merkley Newman was devastated by the
loss of what was then its largest client when IBM consolidated more
than 40 accounts at the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group
PLC in New York. An independent agency the size of Merkley Newman
probably would have been forced to close, but Omnicom's resources
helped keep the doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays off in this kind of instance,'' Merkley said,
expressing how ``grateful'' the agency was ``for Omnicom's
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The comity generated by the broadening ties between Omnicom and
Mercedes-Benz is in stark contrast to the enmity stirred by the
dismissal of Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic Group
of Cos. Interpublic is suing Marvin Sloves, the former co-chairman
of Lowe, hired as a consultant after he retired on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of Sloves, long a favorite of Mercedes-Benz
management, was a principal reason for the dismissal of Lowe,
underscoring the continued importance of personal relationships
between clients and their agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always happy with the creative end product that
Mercedes-Benz and Lowe put into the market place,'' Eberhardt said,
referring to himself and Michael Jackson, president and chief
executive at Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we parted ways was because of the challenges in the
process,'' he added. ``It became harder and harder to turn out that
great creative product.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about mounting industry speculation that Mercedes-Benz
wanted Sloves to join the agency that was awarded the creative and
strategic assignments, Eberhardt replied: ``Marvin Sloves has not
been a part of any discussions with True North or Omnicom. He was
never intended to play a role in this. He has a contractual
relationship with Lowe.''
</P>
<P>
   Wren and Merkley echoed those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Sloves, reached at home Monday, said, ``I've heard nothing,
nothing, nothing from Omnicom.'' He also described himself as
``terribly sad'' that Interpublic would pursue legal action against
him, adding: ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm still a consultant at
Lowe. I don't want anything to happen to the agency. My name is
still on the door, at least for now.'' (The final ``S'' in ``SMS''
is for Sloves.)
</P>
<P>
   Nick Camera, vice president and general counsel at Interpublic
in New York, confirmed a report this week in the trade publication
Adweek that Interpublic had ``commenced proceedings against
Sloves'' regarding ``certain matters related to his employment and
consulting agreement.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Moses Silverman, a lawyer for Sloves, said that Interpublic was
seeking a hearing for breach of contract before the American
Arbitration Association as well as an injunction in New York state
Supreme Court prohibiting Sloves from soliciting Lowe accounts or
employees. Silverman said that a preliminary injunction had been
denied; Camera again declined to comment.
</P>

CONE'S SEARCH LEADS HIM TO ACUPUNCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ David Cone was stationed along the left-field line
on Monday at Legends Field, lobbing a baseball to Roger Clemens.
Cone flipped the ball, he floated it and he even shot-putted it
from distances ranging from 30 to 90 feet. But he never fired the
ball with any vigor. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is tiptoeing through another spring training with the
Yankees, which means there are renewed questions about his
surgically repaired right shoulder and about his 36-year-old arm.
Since Cone has been deliberate about his approach and creative
about ways to strengthen his arm, the intrigue about whether he can
continue to be a formidable pitcher for the Yankees merely
intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cone is always testing different arm angles and grips,
he is also trying out different ways to keep his shoulder sound and
manage the pain he feels. He is undergoing acupuncture treatments
four or five times a week, he gets frequent massages, he has heat
applied to his shoulder, he exercises with a curved barbell
designed for pitchers and he is cautious about not overtaxing his
arm in any way. More than any Yankee, Cone is worth watching
because he is doing so much just to try to be himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always searching for a better way to work out the arm,''
Cone said. ``It's very tough to train a pitcher's arm and to
basically tell it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cone received extensive medical treatment on his shoulder
to pitch in the 1998 post-season, and since he has chronic
tendinitis, he is trying to discover the best methods for remaining
healthy. If that means having needles poked into his shoulder and
electrical currents sent through his body, Cone will do it. After
working 2,396 and two-thirds innings in his career, Cone admitted
that he ``will do anything'' to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I admire about him is he wants to keep
doing what he's doing,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``I know he
researches and then gives it a shot. He's adventuresome. That's the
way he pitches. That's the way he's doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Cone being adventuresome, or is he desperate? Cone
insisted that his arm ``feels fresh'' and that it is premature to
evaluate him based on Sunday's sluggish throwing session and on the
careful way he is treating his arm. After going 20-7 and pitching
207 and two-thirds innings last year, Cone had hoped that the
questions would vanish. But Cone is also realistic and, as he
experiments with practices like acupuncture, they might even
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to find a way to stay strong in September and
October,'' Cone said. ``I have no doubts that I can still pitch and
be consistent and do what I did last year. It's a question of
holding up again. I'm trying to take steps now to insure that I'll
be able to hold on longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture is Cone's newest method. This involves the insertion
of needles into specific points in the shoulder to stimulate the
immune system. Rather than just inserting the needles, the
acupuncturist might apply heat to the area or stimulate it with a
low dose of electricity. Cone spent Sunday searching the Internet
for an acupuncturist in New York so he could schedule appointments
during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did quite a bit of research, almost to the point of
obsession in trying to define the problem I have and trying to find
measures to alleviate the problem,'' Cone said. ``I've done a lot
of research on acupuncture. It's no miracle cure, but I think it
can help control the tendinitis problem I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, said that
Cone's health is always a concern, especially after he had aneurysm
surgery in 1996 and shoulder surgery in 1997, Torre said he was not
worried about Cone's methodical manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's caring for himself,'' Torre said. ``It's a good idea.
He's felt good every time he's pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone ended his long-tossing session with Clemens before any
other pitcher on Monday. Once again, he was being different and
being careful. It is only March, but Cone wants to be pitching with
little pain in October. The Yankees want Cone to make it until
then, too, so they will be studying his valuable arm and his new
routines closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing all these questions for the last six
years,'' Cone said. ``It's really nothing new for me. People
thought I was going to blow out a long time ago.''

PARAGUAY PARALYZED BY POLITICAL CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay _ This small landlocked country in the heart
of South America has just reached a major milestone in the life of
any nation: its first 10 years of uninterrupted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets here there are no streamers, posters or other
reminders to suggest that the February anniversary brought joyful
celebration or even relief. Instead, the graffiti here feature
obscene gestures and demand that a handful of politicians across
the political spectrum be hauled off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is paralyzing this poverty-stricken nation and
could bring the impeachment of the second popularly elected
president of the decade of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The clash grows out of President Raul Cubas Grau's defiance of a
Supreme Court order to send a close political ally back to prison.
The ally, Lino Oviedo, a retired general, is accused of leading an
unsuccessful coup attempt against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in
1996, after Wasmosy had dismissed Oviedo and he refused to leave
the barracks. After Oviedo had won the primary for the governing
Colorado Party, Wasmosy had him arrested, and he was sentenced to
10 years in prison. Soon after he became president in August, Cubas
freed his friend by decree.
</P>
<P>
   The president's action was hardly a surprise. He had been
Oviedo's vice-presidential running mate in the elections last year
and became the presidential candidate only after Oviedo had been
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Cubas, an uninspired speaker, appealed to voters as the shadow
of the former general.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a judge here refused to prosecute the president for
refusing to send Oviedo back to jail. But he sent the prosecutor's
case on to Congress, the first step in a possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is too early to say how the case will fare, Cubas
appears to be growing increasingly isolated. On Friday, the
ambassadors from most of Paraguay's regional trading partners met
him over lunch. But the Argentine ambassador stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador, Maura Harty, spent three hours last
Tuesday evening meeting with Vice President Luis Maria Argana. A
spokesman for the embassy denied that Ms. Harty had discussed a
possible Argana government and insisted that the meeting was
routine. But Paraguayans read the meeting as a highly visible show
of support for Argana.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans, new to the workings of democracy, are not sure
where the limits of the conflict lie. Some fear that it could set
off a move to hold power by force. Others say they believe that
Argana will maneuver to take over the presidency. Persistent street
demonstrations, although largely peaceful, have raised fears of
civil violence.
</P>
<P>
   The nation now has the trappings of democracy, with periodic
elections, a constitution and separate branches of government. But
there is little confidence in the independence of the courts and
the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay regularly figures among the most corrupt countries in
surveys by organizations like Transparency International, which
issues annual reports. The official economy, at $10 billion, is
dwarfed by an underground economy centered on counterfeit goods,
arms and drug smuggling that is generally estimated at $12 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Palau, who oversees a center that maintains archives from
the military dictatorship, said the crisis could drag on
indefinitely and inconclusively. ``This is an improvised country,''
Ms. Palau said.
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere of uncertainty, investment is at a standstill.
Stores remain virtually empty, and public works appear to have
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people believe in democracy?'' Ms. Palau asked. ``How
can they believe in anything when the president simply decides to
ignore an order of the court and nothing happens?''
</P>
<P>
   The currency, the guarani, has lost 25 percent of its value in
the last month. Tax collections this year are 21 percent below
expectations, and international reserves have shrunk to less than
$800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alfredo Boccia Paz, a hematologist in Asuncion, said the
crisis seemed to have paralyzed the economy and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can continue like this for a long time,'' Paz said. ``We'll
reach the end of the year poorer and with people still talking
about the same things.''

GROUP ALLIES WITH AFL-CIO TO FORM LARGEST DOCTORS UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to regain power lost to HMOs, 15,000 doctors
joined a new alliance Monday formed by an AFL-CIO union and
promised to fight managed care by spending $1 million over the next
year to bring thousands of discontented physicians into their fold.
</P>
<P>
   The National Doctors Alliance, a newly formed affiliate of the
1.3 million-member Service Employees International Union, said it
would spend the following year recruiting doctors who, because of
managed care, are facing longer hours, delayed reimbursements, work
speedups, or interference with patient care and medical diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The move fuels the growing trend of unionized doctors and is
designed to give them the backing of the giant AFL-CIO. That
strength could threaten the ability of HMOs, which employ nearly 50
percent of the nation's 680,000 doctors, and force them to yield
power over both salary issues and quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also comes amid growing consumer dissatisfaction
with managed care and its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major agenda is to organize every employed doctor in this
country,'' said Dr. Barry Liebowitz, the new president of the
doctors alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed with the SEIU Monday, the Doctors'
Council will join with 11,500 members in two SEIU affiliates _ the
9,000-member Committee of Interns and Residents and the
2,500-member United Salaried Physicians and Dentists. Based in
Washington, D.C., the SEIU currently represents 600,000 registered
nurses, medical technicians, home health aides and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new alliance will bring all of these doctors into the
AFL-CIO, forming the largest union for doctors ever,'' said
Liebowitz. ``We will not only better represent physicians, we also
better represent the interest our patients, which is becoming
increasingly lost in today's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Both labor and medical experts described the addition of the
doctors as a breakthrough, noting that other professionals who had
shunned unions in the past might now take a second look at the
AFL-CIO and its 79 member unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represnts a new kind of futuristic thinking by the
AFL-CIO,'' said James Green, a labor historian at the Labor
Resource Center at UMass-Boston. ``There was a time when labor felt
white collar workers were too individualistic to be interested.
This takes organizing to a new level, to doctors, who were
considered an elite group of professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   But while salaried phsycians are pushing to unionize, some
independent doctors are finding their hands are tied. These
doctors, who represent about half of the nation's physicians, or
340,000, are considered independent contractors and are restricted
from joining to form a bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now in Congress could change that. Filed by California
Republican Representative Thomas Campbell, it would allow doctors
to form coalitions to engage in contract negotiations with HMOs and
health care insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, doctors continue to join new associations
and unions in record numbers in a push to give themselves more
clout when bargaining with HMOs. Many are salaried physicians who
are concerned about reimbursements, working conditions, hours, and
patient care. In all, about 45,000 physicians or 6 percent of the
nation's 680,000 doctors, are now members of unions, up from 25,000
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of unionized doctors is expected to increase as
big unions such as the SEIU, the American Federation of Teachers,
and the International Association of Machinists look to organize
other salaried physicians who, like healthcare workers everywhere,
are struggling to come to grips with managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Approximately 50 percent of all US doctors work in
managed care systems or earn more than half their income from
salaried positions, including some who have small private
practices, say medical experts. Among new medical school graduates,
however, 80 percent work for a salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the HMOs are paying people slowly, they are
decreasing their fees to people, and they are creating incentive
systems _ almost like the old industrial piece work systems where
doctors in clinics and some hospitals must work a certain number of
hours and see a certain number of patients to get paid,'' said Mark
Levy, executive director of the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that if you make, for example, $90,000 as a
pediatrician, the HMO will say, `If you see X number of patients, I
will pay you $90,000, or if you see more than X, I will pay you
$110,000,' '' he continued. ``This creates speedup, or a fast-track
system. It also means that if you spend extra time with a sicker
patient and his family, it could come out of your pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said doctors are also angry because, in some situations,
HMOs have reversed doctors' decisions or changed prescriptions for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Monday, Liebowitz sounded more like a
labor leader than a doctor when he announced that the new alliance
would ``demonstrate, litigate, legislate, and negotiate to make
sure patients rights are upheld. . . . Whatever it takes, we will
do to stop the denial of health care, the denial of access and the
corporatization of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebowitz told reporters that the alliance's first major effort,
aside from organizing, would be to go after managed care plans that
override a doctor's diagnoses or decision.
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrew Stern, president of the SEIU, ``We intend to
organize, but the organizing will be fueled by our concern for
patient care. People are beginning to understand that they need to
prepare themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement is gaining momentum. This month the American
Medical Association is expected to give a thumbs up to a union
organizing plan it began reviewing last year.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has said it could, by June, begin organizing doctors at
Tulane University's teaching hospital, a move that has surprised
some hospital administrators. The AMA, which has seen membership
drop from 50 percent of US doctors in 1975 to just 35 percent
today, is hoping its efforts will bring in younger residents and
interns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, physicians and their patients find themselves in a
very stressful environment due to mounting pressures in the health
care marketplace, including managed care,'' said Nancy W. Dickey,
president of the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we do not believe that traditional trade union
practices ensure the integrity of the patient-physician
relationship or help physicians achieve the best decisions for
quality health care in this country.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was the 5.9 percent teaser rate. When that expired,
the interest rate on Tom Moore's PNC Bank credit card jumped to
14.4 percent. Finally it settled at 12.5 percent. Moore, an
illustrator who lives in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   But last week Moore was stunned to find that he was no longer a
customer of PNC, which is based in Pittsburgh, but of a bank in
Oklahoma he had never heard of. Not only that, but his interest
rate had been jacked up to 20.74 percent _ and 24.74 percent on
cash advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the most odious business practice I've ever
seen,'' complained Moore, who is 46.
</P>
<P>
   Odious or not, tens of millions of Americans have been facing
the same stark choice _ to take the new terms or leave them _ as
the credit-card business rapidly consolidates into fewer and larger
hands. About 32 million accounts were sold last year, mainly by
regional banks like PNC, Keycorp, First Maryland and First Union.
That is more than four times as many as in 1996, according to R.K.
Hammer, who runs a card industry advisory firm in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Because many people have multiple accounts, the sales
involved some 20 million consumers. The figures do not include
transfers resulting from mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Big buyers have included Chase, which bought 3.5 million Bank of
New York accounts last year, and Citibank, which bought AT&AMP;T's
Universal Card. Other buyers are Fleet Financial and Bank One,
which owns First USA, as well as some little-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   Except for low teaser rates guaranteed for, say, six months,
banks have no legal obligation to honor any rates cardholders now
pay and have shown little inclination to do so. But while it is not
unusual for rates to rise 6 or 8 percentage points, they could also
fall. ``It's the natural time to examine the risk and reward of
each'' account, Hammer said, and the result ``could be a repricing
up or down.'' And even when rates stay the same, penalties and
grace periods may change, sometimes to the consumer's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerri Detweiler, a credit-card specialist and consultant
to Debt Counselors, called it scandalous that consumers can so
easily fall prey to the wheeling and dealing of large institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mortgage or car loan were sold, your rate would stay
the same,'' Ms. Detweiler said. ``That's not the case with credit
cards.'' When consumers see an account has been transferred, it is
very important to read the fine print because of a high probability
that the interest rate or some other terms have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 3.5 billion credit-card offers flooding
Americans' mailboxes each year, cardholders would have little
trouble taking their business elsewhere. Often, by paying a fee,
they are even able to transfer balances. But the banks, Ms.
Detweiler added, ``anticipate that a lot of new customers won't pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore acknowledged that a month or two earlier he had received a
mailing that may well have included a notification of the higher
rates but that he had not focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   Credits cards once provided a lush business for regional banks
like PNC, but many are fleeing it now, squeezed by the high costs
of uncollectible debt and a rising number of consumers who pay
monthly balances in full, depriving the bank of interest income.
And the cost is rising for the increasingly sophisticated computer
models that analyze customer usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even at a time of unparalleled prosperity, there is no
letup in the record number of Americans filing for bankruptcy,
raising fears that a business downturn would send bad card debt
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The card business is really becoming a business of scale,''
said Warren G. Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc., a
company in Wakefield, Mass., that studies and rates the nation's
banks. ``A lot of companies are recognizing this and throwing in
the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages and automotive loans are routinely bought and sold,
but this has little impact on borrowers, since the rates cannot
change. But the new owners of credit-card business are free to
impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear, subject only
to the handful of remaining state usury ceilings. They can also
shorten the time for making payments without interest charges,
eliminate grace periods for payments received a few days late and
raise penalties for late payment, now commonly as much as $29.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there is no change in a customer's rate, said
David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. But it is also common for banks to
upgrade the type of account _ to platinum, for instance. Upgraded
accounts sometimes prove to be more expensive in terms of fees and
may carry higher rates as well, although they may offer more
services and the advantage of being with a bigger lender.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Robertson contended, the industry's
ever-more-sophisticated ability to analyze account data has helped
it to tailor new products and cut costs, and these savings may
ultimately be shared with customers. ``This is certainly the heyday
of the credit-card business for the consumer,'' Robertson said.
``Never has there been a better time to find the card that appeals
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is one of those looking for a more-appealing card. After
learning of the sale of his account, he telephoned the new owner,
Direct Merchants Bank in Tulsa. A customer service representative
told him that his was one of a half million PNC accounts
transferred and that if he did not like the new terms, he could
close his account.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly canceled his card but must still pay the higher
interest rate on his $848 balance, which he hopes to pay off soon.
But if he had been running a balance too big to settle fairly
quickly, he would have been forced, with only a few weeks' notice,
to pay a much higher interest rate for some time unless he could
transfer it to a new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build up a substantial amount, you may not be able to
pay it all,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. He called it ``gouging'' when a
credit-card rate is raised sharply for no reason other than a
business deal between large institutions.

 &HT;    Payne denies wrongdoing in response to IOC
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)By
Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne reiterated Monday
his position that there was ``no wrongdoing'' in Atlanta's campaign
for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to an International Olympic Committee inquiry
into bid improprieties, Payne acknowledged exceeding the maximum
$200 guideline on gifts for IOC members, but characterized the
expenditures as gestures toward friends and ``within the range of
customary exchanges'' made by competing cities.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's response was made public the same day an ethics panel
appointed by the United States Olympic Committee recommended an
overhaul of the IOC and the site selection process.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, decried a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' and said
gifts of any value to IOC members should be outlawed. It also urged
the IOC to elect rather than appoint its members and make its
financial records public.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid was free of improper inducements, scholarship
programs, associations with agents or excessive multiple visits by
IOC members or their families, Payne stated in a letter sent Friday
to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the games for Atlanta by establishing friendships _
that was our primary strategy from day one,'' Payne said Monday.
``Our work with the members of the IOC was based on personal
relationships and our desire to establish the necessary trust to be
awarded this magnificent event.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's personal letter accompanied the U.S. Olympic Committee's
formal response to the IOC's investigation into the bid efforts of
candidate cities from 1996 through 2006. The USOC told the IOC it
has no plans to investigate Atlanta's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials launched its investigation in the wake of bribery
allegations that tarnished Salt Lake City's winning bid for the
2002 Winter Games and snowballed into the worst scandal in Olympic
history. At least 24 IOC members have been accused of receiving as
much as $1.2 million in cash, scholarships, medical care and lavish
gifts during that city's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, an IOC executive board member heading the
committee's investigation, said Monday that 27 cities have sent
reports in ``varying degrees of detail.'' Those reports implicate
no members not already under scrutiny for improprieties in Salt
Lake City, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we expected . . . some of the same fish were feeding in the
same pond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound's six-member ad hoc committee spent two days reviewing the
reports from the cities that bidded for the Games. He said he hoped
the inquiry panel would wrap up its investigation in the next few
days and make recommendations to the IOC executive committee before
its general assembly meets March 17-18.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's two-month investigation into the Salt Lake City bid
was aimed at making recommendations for future bids. Salt Lake's
misconduct, Mitchell said, was ``part of a broader culture of
improper gift-giving in which candidate cities provided things of
value to IOC members in an effort to buy their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not excuse or condone those from Salt Lake City who did
the giving. What they did was wrong. But ... they did not invent
this culture; they joined one that was already flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Atlanta bid has come under increased
scrutiny. The city's Olympic organizers continually have promised
they did nothing wrong in lobbying IOC members, but they have
refused to open their bid records to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have acknowledged giving gifts that exceeded the
price guidelines, such as golf clubs, a sports coat, a bulldog and
extra first-class airline tickets so the children of some IOC
members also could visit Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials maintain the gifts did not violate IOC rules
because the limit was just a guideline and other bid cities were
doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Payne acknowledged for the first time that some
IOC members came to Atlanta more than the single visit allowed
under IOC rules. But he contended the visits were stopovers on the
way to or from official visits to other cities, or came at the
request of Atlanta bidders seeking an IOC member to appear at
special functions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, organizers hosted 29 IOC members in two groups
before and after they attended their annual meeting in Puerto Rico
in September 1989. The entire group was invited, even though
several members had already made an official visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made the side trip were treated to a demonstration of
the city's enthusiasm for the bid effort: the Aquatic Sports
Festival, a three-day U.S.-USSR swim meet; a water polo tournament
featuring the national teams of Cuba, Canada and the United States;
and a Labor Day 5K ``Run for the Bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne also said in his letter that some members brought more
than one guest with them at the expense of the Atlanta bid
committee_ another violation of bid rules. The additional companion
was, in each case, a member's child, he indicated. ``We believe
those visits were justified,'' he wrote the IOC president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there was no wrongdoing on the part of the IOC
members or the (Atlanta bid committee) during the bid process for
the 1996 games,'' Payne wrote. ``Atlanta won the games 'fair and
square' in an honorable manner.''

   Direct Merchants Bank belongs to Metris Cos., a Minnesota-based
marketer of various consumer-credit products, including credit-card
registration and extended warranties on appliances. It was once a
financial arm of Fingerhut Cos., a catalog and telemarketing
concern with which it still has some ties.
</P>
<P>
   Metris is one of the most aggressive of several buyers of
credit-card portfolios being shed by banks, having acquired $1.6
billion worth in the past two years, half from PNC and the rest
from Cleveland-based Keycorp, Mercantile Bancorporation of St.
Louis and Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Metris charges interest rates on its cards ranging from 15.9
percent to 26.9 percent, depending mainly on how it judges a
customer's creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a price-for-risk philosophy'' tailored to individual
customers, said Alfred A. Galgano, vice president for investor
relations, citing what he said are more than 150 combinations of
rates and fees. He said the Metris system for judging risk is more
refined than those of some banks it is buying credit accounts from,
suggesting that at least some customers may find an advantage in
being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Galgano would not say how many former PNC customers, like Moore,
refused to accept Metris' terms, only that there was a ``fair
amount of attrition,'' but no more than expected. He also said that
some PNC customers were no doubt headed for higher rates even had
there been no transfer, either because of the end of an
introductory rate or, say, a deteriorating pattern of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mukri, spokesman for the Comptroller of Currency, which
enforces the notification process for national banks, says he knows
of no serious violations by banks or of consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest resistance tends to come from people who sometimes
carry balances. Those who always pay their cards off immediately
would never be levied the high rates. Those who never pay off their
balances tend to be so financially stretched that they may not
qualify for better rates elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Metris caters mainly to people of moderate income, which Galgano
defined as those earning between $15,000 and $35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In PNC's eyes, Moore belonged to a group of customers it
regarded as geographically incorrect for its business _ that is,
beyond the limits of its physical operations. It announced in
September an agreement to sell these to Metris and then decided
just before Christmas to sell the rest of its credit-card
operation, 3.3 million accounts serviced in Wilmington, Del., to
the Wilmington-based MBNA Corp., the industry's No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate that a bank will pay for a card account ranges
from $50 to $180, depending on creditworthiness and usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Williams, a spokesman for PNC, said that he knew
nothing of how Metris is handling his bank's former customers and
that the bank has no obligation to them. Asked specifically about
Moore's contention that he had been delivered up to sharks,
Williams said he ``would disagree'' with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon to sell a business that has accounts, and
at which point it now becomes the business of the successor,'' he
said. ``The customer by law has to be informed of any change in
terms and has the option not to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as competition for creditworthy customers has put downward
pressure on credit-card rates, profit margins have withered by
two-thirds in the past seven or eight years, said Allen W. Sanborn,
president of RMA, a Philadelphia-based association of bank lenders.
``Some customers you just can't make any money on,'' he said, even
when credit-card issuers raise late fees and other penalties to try
to offset the effect of lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the California analyst, figured that pretax returns to
lenders on card balances has now fallen four straight years, to 2.5
percent in 1998 from 3.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   High fees themselves have now created a backlash, one reflected
in congressional efforts to curb abusive credit-card terms. Rep.,
John LaFalce, D-N.Y., plans to introduce legislation on Tuesday
covering various practices, like hidden rates and aggressive
solicitations, and requiring prominent disclosure of increasingly
heavy penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The measure planned by LaFalce, the ranking minority member on
the House Banking Committee, would give a consumer who is hit with
a higher interest rate the right to pay off the balance at the
earlier terms. ``It's only simple fairness,'' said Gary Luczak, a
spokesman for LaFalce.

JETS SIGN TESTAVERDE TO A GUARANTEED DEAL WORTH $19.47 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To no one's surprise, Vinny Testaverde officially
became the Jets' quarterback of the future on Monday, and he is
only 35.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, whose strong performance last season was no less
surprising than the Jets', signed a three-year deal that included
an upfront bonus of $6.2 million and millions more in guaranteed
income _ an unusual development in a sport in which most contracts
are not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Testaverde signed for $19.47 million in a three-year
deal. Incentives, most of them based on team performance, could
swell the contract to $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Testaverde's base deal is almost 50 times what his
boyhood idol, Joe Namath, signed for as a Jets rookie in 1965.
Namath's headline-making $427,000, three-year contract included a
Lincoln Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's agent, Mike Azzarelli, laughed on Monday when asked
whether the quarterback who took the Jets to the American
Conference championship game in January would get a bonus car, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him the Hawker instead of the Lincoln,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawker is a 10-seat jet plane that Testaverde bought for
several million dollars and will use in the off season to commute
from Tampa, Fla., to Jets workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Making those 40 workouts were important to Coach Bill Parcells,
who said it was a ``deal-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells especially wanted his quarterback to be part of the
hard work that often draws players even closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that tough talk, however, Parcells' infatuation with
Testaverde was obvious. The coach enjoyed the finest quarterback
performance in club history with 29 touchdowns to only 7
interceptions. And the Jets finished atop their division for the
first time since 1969, when they were still part of the American
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Parcells and his salary-cap guru, Mike Tannenbaum,
came up with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they cut Vinny after the first year,'' Azzarelli said, ``he
is still guaranteed $14,970,000. If they cut him after the second
year he is guaranteed $16,670,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzarelli said that the only player in pro football with similar
contract guarantees is Jake Plummer, who recently signed a $29.7
million deal with the Cardinals that includes a $15-million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Azzarelli said, Testaverde's contract could
theoretically be worth a grand total of $59 million, since it
includes an option for an additional four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets benefited in a way by making it a seven-year deal. That
allows them to prorate the signing bonus over those seven years.
Thus, the hit against this year's salary cap will be under $2
million, including Testaverde's salary. That could enable the Jets
to make a significant offer to Steve Atwater, the Broncos' Pro Bowl
free-agent safety.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Atwater visited the Jets last week and told
Parcells he was impressed with the coaching staff, whom he had met
during the Pro Bowl week in Hawaii. Atwater's agent, Steve
Schaffer, said he was waiting for the Jets to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, signing a 35-year-old quarterback to such
a deal might have seemed ludicrous. But the current generation of
quarterbacks includes John Elway, who led the Broncos to a second
straight Super Bowl title at age 38, and Dan Marino, whose Dolphins
made the playoffs behind his 37-year-old arm.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had bittersweet memories Monday. His father, Al, who
lived in Elmont, N.Y., not far from the Jets' camp, died recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few weeks have been a roller-coaster,'' he said.
``The one thing I'm grateful for is that my father saw a great
season after I was away from the family for 11 years.''

 &HT;    Payne denies wrongdoing in response to IOC

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne reiterated Monday
his position that there was ``no wrongdoing'' in Atlanta's campaign
for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to an International Olympic Committee inquiry
into bid improprieties, Payne acknowledged exceeding the maximum
$200 guideline on gifts for IOC members, but characterized the
expenditures as gestures toward friends and ``within the range of
customary exchanges'' made by competing cities.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's response was made public the same day an ethics panel
appointed by the United States Olympic Committee recommended an
overhaul of the IOC and the site selection process.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, decried a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' and said
gifts of any value to IOC members should be outlawed. It also urged
the IOC to elect rather than appoint its members and make its
financial records public.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid was free of improper inducements, scholarship
programs, associations with agents or excessive multiple visits by
IOC members or their families, Payne stated in a letter sent Friday
to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the games for Atlanta by establishing friendships _
that was our primary strategy from day one,'' Payne said Monday.
``Our work with the members of the IOC was based on personal

 Web Sites That Track Portfolios  &HT;

   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I own 10 stocks and would like to start tracking them on
my home computer. I'd like to keep a record of the price I paid for
each stock and the number of shares, with automatic price updates
every day. I don't want to have to enter the price changes myself.
Is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It certainly is. There are dozens of Web sites that
offer the kind of portfolio-tracking mechanism you need. This is
another of those online miracles that would have been unthinkable a
decade ago but now are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   If you are trading through an online broker, there's a good
chance it has a portfolio monitor. Palo Alto's E-Trade offers
portfolio tracking not only to its customers, but also to
noncustomers who register on its Web site at  &LR; www.etrade.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   America Online also provides a portfolio monitor. If you are a
subscriber, click on the ``Keyword'' icon and then type
``Portfolio.''

   You also can track your portfolio on a number of free financial
Web sites. As good as any is the one maintained by Stockpoint of

   Tapping 401(k) for a Home
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that a person can withdraw up to $10,000 from an
Individual Retirement Account without paying the 10 percent penalty
if the money is applied toward the purchase of a first home. My
husband has $12,000 sitting in a 401(k) plan he opened with a
former employer. Can he withdraw $10,000 from the 401(k) to use
toward our first home, or must we roll the money into an IRA and
then withdraw it to avoid the penalty?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: As you suspected, you first must roll over the money into
an IRA. That's because the law doesn't permit penalty-free
withdrawals from a 401(k) plan for the purchase of a home.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can withdraw $10,000 from a 401(k) on the grounds
of financial hardship. You then must legitimize _ I hesitate to say
``launder'' _ the money for homebuying purposes by rolling it into
an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me to explain why Congress has forced you to go
through this cumbersome routine. I couldn't even guess.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can avoid the penalty by following the two-step
routine, you still must pay taxes at your normal rate on the money
you withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Thanks to a new law, this happens to be the last year
in which you will be allowed to roll over 401(k) ``hardship'' money
into an IRA. If that 401(k) money is going to make the difference
between your buying a home or not, then you have fewer than 10
months to act.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Stock Directly
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in buying stock directly from companies that
interest me, rather than paying brokerage commissions. I'd like to
find out which companies will sell to me and how to contact them.
Is there any single source that will provide this information?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG (63584 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: Try the ``Directory of Dividend Reinvestment Plans,'' from
Horizon Publishing. It costs $7.95, and you can order it online at
 &LR; www.horizonpublishing.com &LR; , or by snail mail at Horizon Publishing
Co., 7412 Calumet Ave., Hammond, Ind. 46324. The directory spells
out the pertinent details about each company's DRIP and gives
addresses and telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,000 companies that will sell you stock directly.
However, in most cases you must buy your initial shares through a
broker. After that, you can increase your holdings by reinvesting
your dividends through the company. Most companies also will let
you send in extra cash to supplement your purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy directly from companies only if your shares are
registered in your name rather than a broker's ``street'' name.
</P>
<P>
   While you won't incur brokerage commissions when you invest
through the companies, some of them charge processing fees of their
own. In some cases, those fees can exceed the cost of a
deep-discount brokerage commission. Bristol-Myers, for example,
charges a fee of up to $5 when you reinvest dividends, and up to
$25 when you make a supplemental cash investment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most online brokers charge less than $20 per trade
and some charge less than $10.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, about 100 companies let you buy shares
through their DRIPs at discounts ranging from 3 to 10 percent of
the current market price. That's something your broker won't let
you do.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature of DRIPs is that you can buy a fraction of
a share if the amount of your quarterly dividend isn't enough to
cover the price of a full share.

MARTINEZ HAS DOUBTS ABOUT BROTHER RAMON PLAYING IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ While Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette
acknowledged Monday that the team is close to signing the
surgically repaired Ramon Martinez, the pitcher's younger brother
and best friend, Pedro Martinez, said he still has reservations
about the former Dodger star coming to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still concerned about that,'' Pedro said Monday in the Red
Sox clubhouse, ``but it's up to him. He'll know what he will have
to put up with in Boston. I know I didn't feel good when they booed
me, and I don't know how he'll react. He's never been booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy rehabbing and coming off an injury, I'm afraid people
will be expecting too much and trying to compare him to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not done yet. He could change his mind at the last minute
and go somewhere else. It would be great to play with him, but if
goes somewhere else, I'll be happy with that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon and Pedro Martinez pitched together for two seasons with
the Dodgers until Pedro was traded to the Montreal Expos after the
1993 season. The architect of that deal was Duquette, then with the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last season, when asked if he'd like to be reunited
with Ramon, Pedro said that had always been his dream, but he
didn't want his brother coming to Boston and hearing boos, the way
Pedro did after a couple of rough outings. Martinez also reacted
negatively when several fans were hard on Bret Saberhagen during a
game in which he struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, who won 123 games in 11 seasons for the Dodgers,
was off to an outstanding start last season (7-3, 2.83 ERA) until
injuring his shoulder. He underwent surgery to repair a torn
rotator cuff in his shoulder last June, and the club elected to
give him a $600,000 buyout rather than pick up a $5.6 million
option on his contract for the 1999 season. Martinez was eligible
to file for free agency, did not do so, but became one anyway when
the Dodgers did not tender him a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez expressed anger at what he perceived to be Dodger
slights toward his brother, who won 20 games for LA in 1990, won 15
or more games in three other seasons, struck out 18 in one game in
1990, and threw a no-hitter against the Florida Marlins in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he feel mistreated? They did mistreat him, like always,''
Pedro Martinez said. ``The guy gave his life to the Dodgers and
they didn't appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ramon comes back and has a chance to be an even better
pitcher, so they will see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and top aide Eddie Haas went to see Ramon Martinez
throw last month in the Dominican Republic, and were one of a
number of teams asked to submit a bid for the player's services,
even though he may not be ready to pitch until July. Sports
commentator Peter Gammons said he was told by officials of three
clubs that the Red Sox had offered Martinez, who turns 31 on March
22, $2 million for this season, $5 million for the year 2000. Those
officials said they believed Martinez would take that offer.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would not confirm the figures, but indicated that the
sides were close to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite there yet,'' Duquette said. ``If we were to
get a pitcher, certainly Ramon is a dependable starting pitcher.
We'd hope he would make a contribution at some point in the season.
This would be more for later on this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid is in pretty good shape and he's determined to come
back and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez said he has not spoken with his brother since
Saturday. Among the other teams that expressed interest in Ramon,
he said, were the Padres, Cardinals, Indians, Angels, Rockies, and
Diamondbacks. The Dodgers also sent someone to see him throw in the
Dominican. Ramon Martinez only recently began to throw off a mound
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were going to practice this winter, there were always
two or three guys there to see him,'' Pedro said.
</P>
<P>
   New Red Sox reliever Mark Guthrie, who spent the last 3 1/2
seasons with Martinez in Los Angeles, said, ``He's as good as there
is when he's healthy. He's as hard to hit as Pedro is. They have
little bit different styles, but he can get it up there pretty
good. He makes it move, he cuts it, sinks it, and has a great
changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough. The Dodgers picked up Kevin Brown. Ramon is the
same pitcher to me. And he's a warrior. He throws 130, 140 pitches
a game, or at least he did when he was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good guy in the clubhouse, respected by everybody.
He's a proven winner, and an easy guy to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an upside to Ramon Martinez coming to Boston, his
brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays with me, he has a pretty good chance of being
comfortable,'' said Pedro. ``We're best friends, and I think he'll
have a lot of fun playing with me. Now that he doesn't have
anything to look forward to in LA, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't want to come over, fine. If he does, that will
be more than fine. Even then, I have my concerns. It's so late in
his career, he has been so good for so long and he's never been
booed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK. We'll put up with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have also been talking with the youngest of the
baseball-playing Martinez brothers, Jesus Martinez, a lefthanded
pitcher who last pitched in the Marlins' system. He is coming off
arthroscopic shoulder surgery, and Pedro said it might be in
Jesus's best interests to sign elsewhere. ``This staff is pretty
full,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette joked that perhaps Ramon should feel some urgency about
signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ramon wants to sign, he'd better hurry up,'' Duquette said,
``because in a couple of years we have to pay Pedro $12 million.''

 Worried About Stocks? Try Buying Insurance  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Do you think stocks are so grossly overvalued that we might be on
the verge of a ferocious bear market?
</P>
<P>
   Do you fear that the Year 2000 crisis could disrupt the U.S.
economy indefinitely and wipe out much of your portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are common among stock investors these days _
particularly those who are getting up in years and wonder whether
they will be able to pass along a good-size estate to their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market looks iffy, many investors prefer to keep
their assets in safe, slow-growing investments such as U.S.
Treasuries and money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Few people realize that there is another safe alternative that
can protect your portfolio from plunges, yet allows you to profit
from any stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
   It is a form of term insurance called portfolio-protection
insurance, offered by three major insurers _ American Skandia,
Prudential and Sunamerica. It guarantees that your heirs will get
no less than you paid for your portfolio. If at the time you die,
the value your portfolio is less than the cost, the insurer will
make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   One big drawback is that the insurance can be used only to
protect investments in mutual funds offered by the insurer itself.
You can't use it to protect other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the mutual funds offered by Prudential and
Sunamerica have been poor-to-average performers over the years, and
American Skandia's funds are only a year or two old, according to
Russ Kinnel, a mutual fund analyst with Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   For a $100,000 portfolio, the insurance costs $100 to $500 per
year, depending on the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   If you die during the year and the value of your portfolio has
sunk to $95,000, the insurance company pays your heirs the $5,000
difference.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the value of the portfolio has risen to $105,000
and the insured dies, the insurance company pays nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance ``makes good sense'' for older people who
otherwise would be too scared to keep money in the stock market,
says Danville financial planner Richard DelMonte. It will protect
their portfolios on the downside while allowing them a
theoretically unlimited upside if stocks perform well.
</P>
<P>
   DelMonte figures that the insurance also would make sense for
people of any age who are gravely ill. They are eligible to buy the
insurance because the insurers do not require physical exams or
medical forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew you had only two or three years or less to live,
it would be a no-brainer,'' he remarks. ``You could invest
aggressively and still protect your heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   For healthy, young people, on the other hand, this kind of
insurance seems a dubious investment. They would pay premiums year
after year after year, and the benefits might not be worth the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of INSURE02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  With the Sunamerica plan, you pay an annual premium equal to 0.2
percent of the covered assets _ $200 for a $100,000 portfolio _
regardless of your age.
</P>
<P>
   American Skandia charges 0.3 percent of assets, regardless of
age. Prudential charges 0.1 percent of assets for policyholders
under age 60, 2.5 percent for those under  &LR; between 60 and 70 and
0.5 percent for those ages 70 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The annual premium is based on the value of your portfolio when
you're renewing the policy. Because this is term insurance, you
won't build up any cash value. And if you don't pay the premium
each year, your heirs get zip.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes by, your coverage goes up a minimum of 5 percent a
year under the American Skandia and Prudential plans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you start with a $100,000 portfolio and by the
second year its value has fallen to $95,000, your coverage
automatically will go up to $105,000. But your premium will be
based on $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, your portfolio has gone up to $110,000 at the end
of one year, your premium _ and your coverage _ will be based on
$110,000.
</P>
<P>
   The annual 5 percent step-ups continue until you reach age 80 or
until your minimum coverage is twice the initial investment _
$200,000 in this example _ whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sunamerica plan, the minimum coverage is stepped up by
only 4 percent annually _ also to a limit of twice the initial
investment. With this plan, too, the step-ups end when the
policyholder reaches age 80.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, the 4 and 5 percent annual step-ups won't help
much. That's because stock prices historically have appreciated by
an average of more than 9 percent per year, including dividends.
</P>
<P>
   So in an average year, a $100,000 portfolio would increase in
value to about $109,000. Boosting the basic coverage to $104,000 or
$105,000 wouldn't cover the full value of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The Prudential and American Skandia plans have another potential
benefit: Once the value of your portfolio rises to a certain level,
your coverage can never go lower, no matter what happens to the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if your original $100,000 investment shoots up to
$150,000 after one year, that becomes your minimum coverage for as
long as you continue your coverage, even if the value of your
portfolio later plunges. Any further gains also get locked in,
though you'll also pay a higher premium at renewal time.
</P>
<P>
   The step-up feature of the Prudential and American Skandia plans
lets you lock in huge portfolio gains, such as those enjoyed by
many stock-fund investors during the tremendous bull run of the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of INSURE02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Sunamerica plan doesn't contain this extra protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do it because we felt it would be too confusing and
because we wanted to be able to provide coverage at a more
attractive cost,'' says a Sunamerica spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   If you find this kind of protection tempting, keep in mind that
this is basically disaster insurance and that the disaster may not
happen _ at least during your lifetime. In that case, you will have
squandered your premiums.
</P>
<P>
   People can never predict with certainty what the stock market
will do or where it will be on the day they die.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers don't know either, but their actuaries have sorted
through the historical evidence and calculated portfolio-protection
premiums that they think will profit the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did historical testing and believe that the pricing is
valid,'' says Michael Murray, vice president and national sales
manager of the American Skandia fund group.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, the insurance probably is overpriced for
most buyers.

 Sun Will Offer Chip Designs For Free  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sun Microsystems will announce today that it is making the
blueprints for its microprocessors available to developers for free
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ a first for the semiconductor industry _ is designed
to spur an increase in the manufacturing of chips for new computers
and handheld consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sun of Mountain View designs chips for its own workstations and
computer servers, as well as for devices like digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   However, it does not manufacture them, relying instead on
outside sources such as Texas Instruments, IBM, NEC and Fujitsu.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, third-party manufacturers have had to pay Sun in
advance for the right to use and modify its technology. Under the
new arrangement, licensing fees will kick in only when a developer
takes a Sun-based product to market.
</P>
<P>
   Sun hopes that by not charging developers for access to its chip
designs, it will be better able to compete against MIPS and ARM,
which also design chips for small computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're MIPS or ARM, your business model is predicated on
getting money up front. But that kind of licensing has slowed the
market's growth,'' said Sun spokesman Russell Castronovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``there will be no risk to developers'
involvement. They can take a peek at the architecture without
making a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is an extension of Sun's recent decision to
make its software technology available for free to developers.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes this will promote the creation of new products
based on Sun's Solaris operating system and its Java and Jini
networking software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said developers can register immediately for access to the
chip technology, which will be available for downloading in the
coming months.

ALCATEL SET TO ACQUIRE XYLAN FOR MORE THAN $1.7 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, France, U.K.)  (lh) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding its presence in the computer networking market,
Alcatel of France, one of the world's biggest makers of telephone
equipment, has agreed to acquire Xylan Corp. for more than $1.7
billion in cash, executives close to the deal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to announce the agreement Tuesday, the
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan is a fast-growing maker of equipment for linking computers
in corporate and institutional networks and has been making inroads
into selling more complex gear to telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel, meanwhile, has been trying to expand beyond its roots
in traditional and wireless telephone systems and into the
blossoming data communications market. Acquiring Xylan would give
that effort a quick boost.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of telephone and data technologies in recent
years has spurred an equally vigorous realignment among the
companies that make advanced communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lucent Technologies Inc., North America's biggest
maker of phone equipment, agreed to spend $20 billion to acquire
Ascend Communications Inc., a data networking player. And last
year, Northern Telecom of Canada acquired Bay Networks Inc. for
$9.1 billion. At the same time, Cisco Systems &UR;  &LR; Inc., the data
communications giant, has been trying to win business from the big
phone carriers that are Lucent's and Northern Telecom's traditional
customers.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Alcatel and Xylan would be the second significant
acquisition in the communications equipment arena in two days.
Monday, General Electric of Britain said it had agreed to acquire
Reltec Corp. for about $1.7 billion in cash. General Electric of
Britain, which is not related to General Electric Co. of Fairfield,
Conn., is one of Britain's biggest manufacturing companies and is
looking to expand in the telecommunications equipment business.
</P>
<P>
   Reltec, based in Cleveland, makes products called digital loop
carriers, which expand the capacity of local telephone networks.
Reltec's shareholders, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.,
which owns 81.5 percent of the company, would get $29.50 in cash
for each of their shares. General Electric of Britain would also
assume Reltec's debt of about $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis acquired control of Reltec for $475 million in
1995. The company initially offered stock to the public last year
at $29 and the shares rose as high as $49.125. But the company's
stock price suffered after it warned last year that its
third-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan's public shareholders are set to do better than Reltec's.
Xylan first offered stock to the public in 1996 for $26. Alcatel
has agreed to pay about $37 in cash for each share of Xylan,
executives close to the agreement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel and Xylan declined to comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shares of Xylan rose 43.75 cents Monday, to $26.9375 in Nasdaq
trading. But there was a surge in demand Monday for Xylan call
options, which could become quite valuable after a deal is
announced. After failing to rise much above $20 since last
November, Xylan's shares have jumped by more than 30 percent since
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Xylan, Alcatel would get more than technology. In
the data communications market a well-oiled sales force and strong
distribution channels can be as valuable as the latest hot product.
When Alcatel made its only previous significant data communications
acquisition, of Packet Engines Inc., a private company, last fall
for $315 million, that deal did not significantly enhance Alcatel's
sales force in the United States. But an acquisition of Xylan
would.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel followed a similar strategy last June when it agreed to
acquire the DSC Communications Corp. for $4.4 billion. DSC was one
of Reltec's competitors in the business of selling digital network
gear to local phone companies. Alcatel acquired DSC largely to
inherit DSC's strong relationships with the U.S. local phone
giants.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel is believed to have been advised by Lehman Brothers.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which was the lead manager for Xylan's
initial public offering, is believed to have advised Xylan.

PATTERNS: BADGLEY MISCHKA FILLS A VOID 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the sports-utility minimalism overrunning
fashion now, it should come as no surprise that there is an
unquenched thirst for dress-up daytime suits. Who, after all, is
thinking of the ladies who lunch? The omission has pushed Badgley
Mischka to add a daytime collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sportswear designers didn't do a lot of suits this
year,'' James Mischka said. ``Everything was softer and about
putting different pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. In an effort to stay au courant, pretty-suit
stalwarts like Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass and Christian LaCroix
have been showing more youthful sporty mixes rather than tailored
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Like every Seventh Avenue designer, Mark Badgley and Mischka
know a void in the market when they see one. And they have filled
it beautifully: gray pinstripe suits with built-in curves and
feminine touches like gray ribbon on the sleeves; a demure, tweed
dress, and wool suits with opulent fur collars. Prices are $1,700
to $2,700. The clothes will be in stores, including Saks Fifth
Avenue and Neiman Marcus, in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also trying to get a younger couture customer,'' Badgley
said, pointing to a white coat in double-face wool, tweed trousers
and black turtleneck. Several daytime dresses have evening-wear
counterparts and handbags to match. The handbag collection includes
a small tweed hobo bag with a jeweled butterfly about to take
flight, and a pouch, in burgundy velvet and jet, suspended from a
silver chain. The handbags cost $400 to $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very modern when the girl doesn't wear any
jewelry _ there's just the beaded gown, and the little bag is the
jewelry,'' Badgley said.
</P>
<P>
   LAUREN'S YOUTH MOVEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced on Monday by Polo Ralph Lauren to
purchase Club Monaco is not the only way the designer is going
after a young audience. Lauren is also about to court the newly
hot, hip and young customer (or the ``I know what you did last
summer'' audience) under his name.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, he will relaunch Ralph by Ralph Lauren, aimed at 16-
to 24-year-olds. If the name sounds familiar, it is because Ralph
by Ralph Lauren existed until last year as a hip bridge line. There
were several problems, though _ the first being that hip bridge is
an oxymoron. Second, when the bridge category _ essentially career
suits and jackets costing $300 to $800 _ began collapsing last
year, several brands, including Ralph, experienced difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than produce the collection under Polo Ralph Lauren, his
own company, as he did before, Lauren is relaunching Ralph as a
licensed collection under Jones New York. Jones has had remarkable
success with Lauren by Ralph Lauren, a less-expensive version of
Lauren's moneyed English style. The move is part of a wider
strategy by Jones, which also wants to reach a younger audience. A
few weeks ago, Jones purchased the Todd Oldham fashion business.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Ralph will range from $19.50 for a top to $168 for a
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL ELEGANCE
</P>
<P>
   When women think about what to wear for the millennium, they are
not thinking about designers' visions of war and space-walking.
Millennial fashion is shaping up to mean sumptuous evening wear,
retailers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be dressed like space people,'' said Erin
Carmack, manager of fashion presentation for Neiman Marcus, which
has already seen an upturn in evening-wear business. ``It's taffeta
ball gowns _ the more elaborate, encrusted ball gowns that we
haven't seen in a while,'' she said, adding that Oscar de la Renta,
Badgley Mischka and Carmen Marc Valvo are going to be important
there.
</P>
<P>
   Women are buying for the at-home party and the over-the-top
gala, said Kenneth E. Downing, vice president of corporate public
relations for Neiman's. ``There's going to be a huge buildup to
it,'' he said. ``It's much more than one day.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saks, Badgley Mischka and Ralph Lauren are at the forefront.
``We feel it's an even more important category than it normally
would be,'' a spokeswoman said.

AFTER FIRING CHIEF, WHITMAN DENIES TROOPERS ARE BIASED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Md., Conn.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A day after firing the head of the New Jersey
State Police for making racially offensive remarks, Gov. Christie
Whitman on Monday defended her administration's response to charges
that state troopers use ``racial profiling'' to single out black
and Latino drivers and said she would move quickly to restore
public confidence in the force.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman's swift move to oust State Police
Superintendent Col. Carl A. Williams was praised by most civil
rights leaders as an important first step, they emphasized that
more was needed to be done to address bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes clear to us that the problems facing the State
Police are deep and pervasive,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson,
executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey.
``Colonel Williams is not just a superintendent but a veteran of 35
years, and it is difficult for us to believe that the thoughts
expressed in that interview have not trickled down to the rank and
file of the state police.''
</P>
<P>
   The political fallout may yet complicate the appointment of
Attorney General Peter Verniero to the state Supreme Court. Whitman
nominated him to the court last week.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero, who oversees the state police department, has been
criticized for not acting quickly or forcefully enough after
troopers shot three unarmed minority men last April during a
traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. He has also been
criticized for representing the troopers in an appeal of a 1996
court case in which a state judge found evidence of widespread
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division is
investigating the state police. Several Democratic lawmakers Monday
joined the Black Ministers Council in calling for the state
Legislature to delay its vote on Verniero's court appointment until
that investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Williams and Verniero are equally at fault for
procrastination on the growing litany of profiling complaints, yet
one is out of a job and the other is poised for one of the most
coveted positions in the state,'' said Assemblyman LeRoy J. Jones
Jr.. a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, the minority leader, said that all 16
Senate Democrats agreed that the confirmation should wait. But
Republicans hold control of the Senate, with 24 seats, and all that
would be required for confirmation is a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero issued a public statement Monday condemning Williams'
remarks as ``insensitive and inappropriate.'' But he declined to
discuss how Williams' dismissal might affect his nomination to the
state Supreme Court, saying that he did not want to politicize the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she believed Williams was correct when he stated
that there is no clear evidence that troopers engage in profiling,
but she said his public comments, published in The Star-Ledger of
Newark on Sunday _ that most drug traffickers are black or Latino _
were so insensitive that he had seriously damaged the credibility
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a racist,'' Whitman said. ``But I don't
believe he saw how insensitive his comments were. That's part of
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' political demise came after 10 months of escalating
complaints that the state police use discriminatory and illegal
tactics to single out minority drivers in search of narcotics
traffickers. Williams, who was appointed by Whitman shortly after
she took office in 1994 after a decorated career as a trooper, has
steadfastly denied that the practice exists, and publicly bristled
last month when Verniero announced that he would undertake an
extensive review of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Sunday in the Star-Ledger, Williams
ridiculed the notion that police should not take race into
consideration when trying to search for possible drug couriers.
During the interview, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago the president of the United States went to
Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go
to Ireland. He didn't go to England. Today, with this drug problem,
the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most a member of a
minority group that's involved with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams declined a request for interviews on Monday, and Lt.
Col. Michael Fedorko, the acting superintendent, spent the day
meeting with top commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said John Hagerty, a State Police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is not the only state to face allegations of racial
profiling. Delaware, Connecticut and Maryland's state police
departments have been named in lawsuits charging that minority
drivers are pulled over more often than white ones are.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the public fiasco caused by Williams' comments are an
embarrassment to Whitman, it also offers her a new opportunity to
seize the initiative in an issue that has dogged her administration
for nearly a year. After the shooting in April, the Whitman
administration ordered that patrol cars be equipped with video
cameras to record all traffic stops, and has expanded a recruitment
effort to bring more minorities and women onto the force.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of new allegations of profiling have continued to
emerge, including several from current and former troopers who have
filed discrimination lawsuits against the state police and say they
were trained to pull over drivers based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing public complaints in recent years, the State
Police have refused to release public details of the disciplinary
actions against troopers and have resisted suggestions that
troopers note the race of motorists they stop, making it difficult
to document patterns of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Newark, Kevin Keenan, acting executive
director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, urged Whitman to create a database of the race of all
motorists stopped by troopers, and an ``early warning system'' to
ferret out troopers, as well as local police officers, who might be
racist, psychologically unfit, or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   With the dismissal of Williams, who had become the most fiery
defender of the State Police, Whitman must find a more temperate,
politically sensitive leader for the 2,700-member force. The
governor said the list of potential candidates should include
civilians, as well as uniformed law enforcement officers, and
minorities, although she said she would not limit the search to
minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights leaders and representatives of black law
enforcement officers say it will take far more than a new commander
to remedy those a State Police culture that they say has
contributed to racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   William Buckman, a lawyer whose lawsuit led to a judge's finding
in 1996 that black drivers are 4.85 times more likely to be stopped
than whites on the southern half of the New Jersey Turnpike, said
that only the governor and the Justice Department can force the
insular police force to adopt the kind of changes that are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is a major component of New Jersey State Police
thinking,'' Buckman said. ``The governor opted for spin control.
Something much more must be done than firing one state scapegoat.
It is about time for this historic and decades-old problem to come
to an end.''

U.N. PANEL CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL TO TRY TOP KHMER ROUGE
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.N. panel has recommended that a new
international tribunal be convened to try about a dozen senior
Khmer Rouge officials on charges of crimes against humanity while
they ruled Cambodia, according to diplomats and senior
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the recommendation, a separate Cambodian truth commission
would consider all other cases.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the growing tensions between China and the
United States, the Chinese have told administration officials who
are actively lobbying for a tribunal that Beijing will veto the
idea if it is brought before the U.N. Security Council, these
officials said. The Khmer Rouge relied almost exclusively on
Chinese support during their reign that led to the deaths of nearly
two million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has always emphasized it defers to the domestic decision
of Cambodia,'' said a senior Clinton administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The only way the Chinese will
not veto this is if the Cambodian government goes to the U.N.
Security Council and asks for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation for a tribunal was given to the Cambodian
prime minister, Hun Sen, last week, but will not officially be made
public for several weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In contradictory statements over the last two months, Hun Sen
has alternatively complained that the world is at least a decade
late in condemning the Khmer Rouge, has given half-hearted support
for an international tribunal, and has questioned whether a trial
would lead to new violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hun Sen has grown closer to China, signing
five new agreements in Beijing last month that provide Cambodia
with increased trade and economic benefits. Meanwhile, Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China said last month in Bangkok that
Western nations, especially the United States, had come up with the
idea of trying the Khmer Rouge, which he said was inappropriate
since ``these are internal problems of Cambodia'' and should be
decided only by the Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has outmaneuvered the United States once again,'' said
Stephen R. Heder, a Cambodia scholar at the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London. ``It's highly unlikely that Hun Sen can
be turned around. He's been prepared to have a trial or not have a
trial depending on the highest bid, and China and its friends are
willing to give him economic benefits, security guarantees and
general diplomatic support that the United States can't offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, however, does contain a way to circumvent a
possible Chinese veto. The proposed International Criminal Tribunal
for Cambodia could be put before the U.N. General Assembly for a
vote should it be blocked in the Security Council. But the five
permanent members of the Security Council, including the United
States, are wary of setting such a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Written by three outside experts, the proposal for a Cambodia
tribunal includes innovations based on the experiences in
Yugoslavia, Rwanda and South Africa, among other countries,
according to officials. To set up the tribunal quickly and to save
money, the offices of the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda would be used. The trial of the top dozen or more officials
would be held outside Cambodia, either at the Hague, in Manila or
in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   The truth commission, which was the idea of Thomas Hammaberg,
the U.N. secretary general's special representative on human rights
in Cambodia, would be established in Cambodia and would allow
Cambodians to have a full airing of what went on in one of this
century's worst cases of mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good balance of the twin imperatives of justice and
national reconciliation,`` said Craig Etcheson, program director of
The International Monitor Institute and the former head of the
Cambodian Documentation Center. ``You establish a record through
the tribunal and at the same time you allow Cambodians to feel that
their suffering has been acknowledged and to find their way to
reach social reconciliation within their community.``
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen also said he is reticent about approving a tribunal
because world powers ignored his requests for nearly two decades to
set up a Khmer Rouge trial, waiting until it suited the timetable
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1991, Cambodia was hostage to the Asian cold war,
and the United States, among other countries, would not officially
acknowledge that the Khmer Rouge had committed mass killings for
fear of upsetting China. Thereafter, the Khmer Rouge signed a peace
treaty with the other warring parties in the Cambodian civil war,
and other countries were reluctant to upset Cambodia's delicate
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1997 that a real push began, stimulated in part
by Hun Sen and his then co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh. They petitioned the secretary general that June asking
``for the assistance of the United Nations and the international
community in bringing to justice those persons responsible for the
genocide and crimes against humanity during the rule of the Khmer
Rouge from 1975 to 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that Cambodia did not have the ``resources or the
expertise'' to conduct a trial on its own, Hun Sen argued in this
letter that ``only in this way can this tragedy be brought to a
full and final conclusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, however, Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh and his
ardor for a trial has cooled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   There is little dispute over which Khmer Rouge leaders should be
tried and whether there is sufficient evidence to convict them. At
the top of the list is Nuon Chea, second to Pol Pot, the head of
the regime, followed by Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan. Nuon Chea and
Khieu Samphan turned themselves in to Hun Sen's government last
December and are living in a western Cambodian city with other
Khmer Rouge defectors. Ta Mok is at large in the jungles of western
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against the Khmer Rouge has been growing since
their government was overthrown in 1979 and has been collected
through the Cambodia Documentation Center under a grant from the
State Department in cooperation with Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary General Kofi Annan has yet to read the proposal,
senior U.N. officials say he is worried about the precedent set by
the arrest in Great Britain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary general is listening to the Pinochet argument
that it is better to bury the mistakes of the past,`` said one
senior U.N. official.

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ In this aristocratic old city where fortunes have
been made from mere cloth, just about all the Milanese have fashion
on their minds, if not necessarily on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, what one hears as the Italian collections for fall
enter their third day, with an excruciatingly pretentious show at
Prada, is that fashion is spinning faster and faster toward a kind
of meaninglessness. It is not just the ferocious pace of change _
this season that all-important shoe, next season another one _ that
brings fashion perpetually to a dead stop in its own tracks. It's
that by being arcane and overly self-referential, it has pushed
itself into the margins of most people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Five or 10 years ago, a designer could show a woman a new
proportion, a better fabric, and she could understand that _ even
approve of it _ because it brought honest change into her life. But
who could understand the logic of wearing, as Miuccia Prada
suggested on Monday, a squashed-toed, high-heeled shoe that made
even her models look deformed, as if they were walking pigeon-toed
on chewing gum?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the edge of fashion as we know it being really out of
fashion,'' said Tom Ford, whose show for Gucci is on Tuesday.
``Most women I know _ and this is a horrible thing to say as a
designer _ do not wear current clothing. They wear some amazing
thing they found in a flea market, maybe something from last
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Ford is one designer who has kept pushing things to
the uppermost limit, and he knows that. ``Fashion has become so
hyped, so big, and everything, as we know, has become so
homogenized and globalized, which we're partly to blame for,'' he
said over the weekend. ``But, now, in order to keep fashion alive,
things need to seem individual. Each piece in a collection needs to
have enough character of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the problem, Giorgio Armani said on Monday
morning before his streamlined Emporio show. ``Today, you can have
a style that is exalted in the press, but which is very different
from the reality of what people actually buy,'' said Armani, who
among high-fashion designers is one of the top two or three money
makers at retail. It irritates him that the fashion press seems to
get increasingly behind a single viewpoint. ``They say, `No
jewelry! No stockings!''' Armani added, looking nonplused. ``Why,
why? In the end, you will have nothing left. It's a snobbism that's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Milan shows have hit a kind of snag. Armani finessed all
that business about what's new by presenting a tightly edited
Emporio collection of sportswear separates _ slim trousers in nylon
or padded and quilted fabrics; shearling coats and parkas; layers
of hooded tops and cotton fleece; touches of sharp color, like a
peak of an electric-blue layer against charcoal. As a collection
with a lot of utility overtones, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it
was had a lot of polish, and Armani's models seemed to actually
enjoy wearing the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And Prada? After several years of tremendous influence, Prada
now seems in danger of becoming a parody of itself. Many of Ms.
Prada's clothes were beautiful _ an olive-green suede jacket, for
instance, with leaf appliques, and a rustic-looking toggle coat in
a sage twill wool with appliques in leather. Some of her
hide-and-fur coats were intriguing as well, particularly a long
black belted fur coat with padded nylon sleeves unzipped at the
shoulders. But that's as far as one's patience stretched as Miss
Prada buckled long transparent coats with arty grommets over
leggings and bikini briefs. The torpor of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Narciso Rodriguez didn't have many ideas _ sculptured wool
sheaths, a fitted sleeveless top with a glaze of beading, a tunic
with slim trousers _ but they were all on the money. He translated
his mix of black and nude hues right down to his stilettos. But it
was his layering of a sleeveless fur top over a crinkly tunic and
taupe trousers that summed up his modern verve.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Lenny Kravitz was in town for Donatella Versace's
Versus show on Sunday, and the late-night birthday party she gave
afterward for Ingrid Sischy of Interview magazine, did nothing to
slow the frenetic pace. But Milan seems to like a frenzy, or at
least to accept it. On Saturday, the usual promenade of
well-dressed Milanese along the Via Montenapoleone, where the
fashionable stores are, reached such a crush that the police had to
keep cars out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the Versus show, Ms. Versace said she was
taking a different approach with her secondary line: ``Before, it
was much younger and, in a way, much cheaper, in fabrics. What
really counts now is quality and distinction.'' Like Ford, she
favors a mix of items that a customer can adapt to her personality.
``I think of the Versus girl as someone who walks around changing
the channels of a radio,'' Ms. Versace said. ``A little
rock-and-roll, a little something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace's show was a tour de something, all right. It had a
tough, sharp sex appeal that wasn't vulgar _ unless you count a
sprinkle of glitter up the back seam of a pair of trousers. There
was a wink here to asymmetrical hemlines and a nod there to a
silhouette based on having something wrapped around the waist, like
a jacket. Ms. Versace veiled electric colors with black chiffon,
and casually mixed them with sequined skirts, lace-cut leather, and
photo-transfer prints. She made everything look easy without
forsaking her glam edge. Some slick cosmetic pink coats told that
story.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the stuff one sees at secondary shows is too
marginal, too hopelessly derivative for fashion editors to care one
way or the other. They're waiting for the big shows, Armani, Gucci
and so on, to give the collections tone, to create a kind of
glorified hook that everyone can hang on to and go swinging into
fall with. Bohemian glamour. Post-modern mayhem chic. They're
almost in cahoots in that way. In the meantime, one must go and see
what Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have cooked up at D &AMP; G,
and Gianfranco Ferre at GFF.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from some obi-like belts and white shirts, which are a
signature, Ferre seemed to have as much contact with this GFF
collection as vermouth passing over vodka. Which is to say it
appeared to be designed by young assistants, who apparently were
under the impression that nobody in this crowd had ever seen a Rei
Kawakubo or Yohji Yamamoto show. The cuts and proportions looked
very Japanese, as they say, from the high-waisted kimono coats in
rustic colors to uneven hemlines and some exquisitely hokey dresses
in white gazar furrowed with piano wire.
</P>
<P>
   To what end? Ferre is too solid a Milanese designer to get hung
up with this kind of karaoke couture, and as for the idea of taking
a plain jersey dress and attaching hanks of papery white fabric
along the seams _ well, don't ask. It brought to mind the agony of
seeing a gorgeous woman with a piece of Kleenex stuck to her heel.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone other than a fashion editor would probably look at the D
&AMP; G show and run screaming into the Sunday traffic. It was as if
Messrs. Gabbana and Dolce were literally dressing dolls. There were
rosebud printed tops in cotton underwear jersey, leopard boots and
aqua blue tights with butterflies on them, fuzzy minis in
rubber-duck yellow, a diaper pin holding closed a frumpy cardigan,
teddy bear appliques _ the whole thing thrown together with the
gleeful fury of a rotten little girl right before she decides to
set Barbie on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But it was fun. The designers caught the spirit, if not the
mentality, of young customers. They also made marvelous use of
denim, creating skirts and trousers with flies and pockets at both
the waist and hem, so that if a girl felt like walking on her
hands, her skirt, at least, would still be upright.

SOLVENT INHALATION SUSPECTED IN AUTO DEATHS OF 5 TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER HEIGHTS, Pa. _ The impact of the car crash tore bark off
a tree along U.S. Route 1, and now sad words are written there as a
memorial to the five girls who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of five juniors from nearby Penncrest High School
dying in a late-afternoon car accident on Jan. 29 was horrific
enough for this area of middle-class suburbs southwest of
Philadelphia. By all accounts, the girls were exemplary citizens,
bright students and popular.
</P>
<P>
   But neither residents of the area nor school officials nor,
least of all, the parents of the girls, were prepared for what
followed last week: a report from the Delaware County medical
examiner's office that the driver of the car, Loren Wells, 16, of
Media, had inhaled a chemical solvent that could have impaired her
judgment. Further analyses found that three of the other girls had
inhaled as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were finally getting back to normal,'' said Laird Warner,
the superintendent of the school district. ``Then this hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts who study drug use by young people say sniffing or
inhaling chemicals _ young people call it huffing _ is one of the
most common forms of drug use among teen-agers starting to
experiment, and one of the most potentially dangerous, capable of
inflicting serious damage to the heart, brain, lungs, liver and
kidneys that sometimes causes death.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalants are easier to find and cheaper to buy than marijuana
and alcohol because the chemicals are found in hundreds of everyday
products, from paint thinners and cleaning fluids to marking pens
and aerosol cans of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, inhaling may arouse little suspicion among relatives
and friends unless a major medical problem develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a silent epidemic,'' said Harvey Weiss, executive
director of the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition, a private
nonprofit organization based in Austin, Texas. ``It is silent
because people don't talk about it, and the numbers of people who
use these substances is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are school-aged children. Annual national surveys by the
University of Michigan to measure illicit drug use by 8th-, 10th-
and 12th-grade students found that chemical inhalants were the most
widely tried illicit drug among 8th-grade students from 1991
through 1995, before marijuana moved into first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent study, for 1998, 20.5 percent of eighth-grade
students admitted to having tried an inhalant, compared with 22.2
percent who admitted trying marijuana. The survey found that 11.1
percent of the eighth-grade students surveyed had used an inhalant
in the past year, compared with 16.9 percent who had used
marijuana; and 4.8 percent had used an inhalant in the past month,
compared with 9.7 percent for marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalant use drops off as teen-agers move on to greater use of
marijuana and alcohol. The 1998 survey found that 8.0 percent of
10th-grade students and 6.2 percent of 12th-grade students said
they had used inhalants in the past year, while 31.1 percent of
10th-grade students said they had used marijuana in the past year
and 37.5 percent of 12th-graders did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers say we have got a large number of kids using a
wide spectrum of inhalants,'' said Dr. H. Westley Clark, director
of the Center for Substance Abuse, an agency of the Department of
Health and Human Services in Bethesda, Md. ``Some defy the
imagination. But the issue is not to criminalize the use or ban all
the substances. The issue is to make parents and kids aware and
deal with the root causes of the use of these substances.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Haviland, principal of Penncrest High School, which has
about 1,300 students, said beer is typically the intoxicant of
choice among the students. He said neither teachers nor school
administrators ever suspected that students were involved with
inhalants.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers said the car could have been traveling more than
70 miles an hour, well above the posted limit of 55. But even after
autopsies of the crash victims revealed the presence of a toxic
inhalant, parents of the dead teen-agers did not want to accept the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dimitri Contostavlos, the Delaware County medical examiner,
said Miss Wells had been ``under the influence'' of diflouroethane,
a chemical component of Duster II, a spray that is used to clean
computer keyboards. Contostavlos' toxicology report included the
finding only because investigators found an empty can of Duster II
in the Chevrolet Corsica that Miss Wells was driving.
</P>
<P>
   A law-enforcement official familiar with other tests said the
autopsies of at least three other girls found the same substance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his report on Miss Wells, Contostavlos concluded that
``driver impairment, with the loss of control on a straight road in
daylight, in good weather, with no other traffic involved, resulted
not from youthful inexperience and a dangerous stretch of road, but
primarily from intoxication due to inhalation abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement this week, the parents of Miss Wells and
the other girls _ Tracy Graham, 17; Rachel Lehr, 17; Shaena
Grigaitis, 16, and Rebecca Weirich, 16 _ contended that ``it seems
clear to us that there is inconclusive evidence that our children
intentionally abused the cleaning agent involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents proposed that the substance had been airborne. They
declined further comment, asking that they be allowed to ``resume
the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Contostavlos, who tested the parents' theory on himself by
sitting in a car and releasing a can of the cleaner, said he stood
by his findings.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the parents' response reflects a common situation. A
1997 survey by the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that 91
percent of parents talked to their children about substance abuse
but fewer than half said they ever talked about inhalants. And 95
percent said they believed their children had never used inhalants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult situation,'' said Ann Brown, chairman
of the safety commission. ``Even the best of parents don't realize
there could be a danger, that a child could even die on the first
sniff.''

 &HT;    Texas plan would have customers foot bill for cleaner air
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas electric utility customers would get
cleaner air and get to pay for it, too _ as much as $1.4 billion _
under a proposal announced Monday by Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, and
endorsed by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sibley's proposal, electric utilities that voluntarily add
pollution equipment could pass the
</P>
<P>
   costs of doing so along to customers.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted into law, the proposal could help areas that violate
federal clean air standards and those _ such as Austin _ near
violation from having to take such steps as limiting the expansion
of businesses in order to prevent more pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   At most, Sibley said, the proposal would cost ratepayers less
than $1 a month, and could be as little 50 cents a month, depending
on the utility. To achieve the same reduction in pollution through
stricter automobile pollution controls, Sibley said, would cost
three times as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an opportunity here, in a very cost effective
manner, to take some really
</P>
<P>
   significant strides in reducing the (pollution) emissions in the
state of Texas,'' Sibley said
</P>
<P>
   after a meeting of the Special Senate Committee on Electric
Utility Restructuring, which is
</P>
<P>
   considering opening the electric industry up to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bush said Sibley's proposal ``builds on the
early successes of our voluntary
</P>
<P>
   program to reduce emissions in Texas, and I hope legislators
will join me in strongly supporting
</P>
<P>
   it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Austin area would benefit generally from cleaner air,
the proposal would not apply to Austin Energy and other city-owned
electric utilities because they are governed by their own
</P>
<P>
   city councils, not state government.
</P>
<P>
   Austin already has volunteered to meet the federal clean air
standards for the four units at
</P>
<P>
   Holly Power Plant and one at Decker Power Plant that are
``grandfathered'' from compliance because of their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do like this'' it's a real good deal,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith, Texas director of Public Citizen, a public interest
group, founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund said the
organization wanted more details before
</P>
<P>
   commenting on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said he would provide details within a week as an
amendment to his bill to deregulate the
</P>
<P>
   electric utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's proposal grew out of a recent joint report by the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation
</P>
<P>
   Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which
jointly studied the cost of upgrading the pollution equipment on
Texas power plants, including those grandfathered from the state's
permit program, which took effect in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The commissions, whose analysis included 162 power plant units,
concluded it would cost about
</P>
<P>
   $1.4 billion to upgrade both those that had been grandfathered
and those in non-attainment and near
</P>
<P>
   non-attainment areas to reduce nitrogen oxides, a key component
in forming ground-level ozone, by
</P>
<P>
   about 70 percent. Ozone is a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the consumer would be about 82 cents a month for 10
years to retire the debt, the commissions estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal figures into the deregulation bill because Sibley
would add the $1.4 billion to the
</P>
<P>
   so-called ``stranded costs'' that the utilities would collect
from ratepayers for plants that cost
</P>
<P>
   more to build than they would be worth in a competitive market.
Sibley's bill would allow the utilities to collect all those
stranded costs, now estimated at about $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Also, environmentalists have warned that competition could
encourage utilities to make heavier use of grandfathered plants
unencumbered by expensive pollution equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The utility would have to show that adding the pollution
equipment to an existing plant was better financially than simply
building a new plant, said Pat Wood, chairman of the utility
commission.

U.S. INQUIRY CAUSES EBAY STOCK TO FALL
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online auction site Ebay, which has already gained the
attention of New York City consumer officials, now says it is under
federal investigation for ``possible illegal transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a terse release about the inquiry late
Friday, withholding details about the substance ``to protect the
investigations,'' but saying that it was ``fully cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   It said an unspecified branch of the federal government
requested company documents on Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock split 3-for-1 Monday, and closed at $323,
down $11 from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ebay announced that it would ban the sale of
firearms on the site, effective this Friday. That move came in
response to a report that weapon sales, governed in the off-line
world by a complex set of rules that differ from state to state,
were impossible to monitor in the geographically boundless online
community.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the company have also confirmed in recent weeks
that they are cooperating with the New York City Department of
Consumer Affairs, which is investigating accusations of fraudulent
activity on the part of a seller of sports memorabilia through
Ebay.

   MILAN, Italy _ Scientists say the polar icecap is melting, but
designers on both sides of the Atlantic are under the impression
that next winter will be cold and blustery. At least it seems so
because they are showing styles that swathe the throat in toasty
warm fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Most coats and jackets come with turtlenecks or funnel necklines
high enough to cover the chin. Cowls on knitwear are so generous
they can be pulled over the head, like the original monks' cowls.
Anything collarless is shown with a scarf or muffler wound closely
around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bareness of strapless evening dresses is often balanced
by a woolly scarf, usually in wool or cashmere that matches the
dress but sometimes in a gutsier weight. Perhaps designers have
been inspired by the way women have made their own fashion
statements this winter, wrapping themselves in pashmina mufflers,
for both day and evening. &QL;

COLLINS HANDLES MEDIA BLITZ IN FIRST GIANTS APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Kerry Collins made his first public
appearance at Giants Stadium on Monday, a 15-minute,
stand-in-the-pocket performance that had the new Giants quarterback
earnestly answering questions about his drinking habits, his
passion for football, accusations that he once used a racial slur
and how he felt being the highest-paid backup in the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   It was a full docket for a debut. Although Collins did not
revisit a troubled past with relish, in his responses he did more
than backpedal and, in the end, it appeared he survived a
pressuring rush his first time out.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, Collins was off to find a New Jersey apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who signed a four-year, $16.9-million contract last
month explained how he had convinced the Giants' management that he
was worth the risk, despite two declining seasons that included
many off-the-field woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm tired of the negative perception of my life,''
Collins said. ``There have been some issues I've had to address,
stuff I've been carrying around for a long time, and I've taken the
steps to address them. They are things I'm still working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to take a long, hard look at yourself. But I'm
more comfortable now than I have been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to be more specific about what he learned in his
self-examination, Collins was forthright on two subjects, less so
on most others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My alcohol use is the thing that is brought up most often and
it's something that I looked at, along with other things,''
Collins, who was arrested for driving under the influence last
year, said. ``I feel alcohol may have played too much of a role in
my life. I feel that alcohol played a role in some of the problems
that have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been evaluated and the doctors did not diagnose me as
an alcoholic. But my goal is to be the best quarterback I can be,
and alcohol plays no part in that. Alcohol is not going to play any
role in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to tell his side of the story in a 1997 incident when two
of his Carolina Panthers teammates accused Collins of using a
racial slur at a training party, Collins said it was something in
his past that he did not want to elaborate on.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins added: ``To my dying day I'll deny that I'm a
racist. People who know me know how I feel about things and know
the kind of person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his fateful meeting with Carolina Coach Dom Capers
last October, the meeting that led to his release by the Panthers,
Collins essentially had no comment. Capers' version has been that
Collins said he no longer had the heart or desire to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been enough said about that,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Monday, Giants Coach Jim Fassel said he had talked to
everyone involved in that episode and it did not prevent him from
supporting the Giants' decision to sign Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what happened,'' Fassel said. ``I'm comfortable with
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Collins said that despite a contract that makes him the
highest-paid Giant in average annual salary by nearly $1 million,
he understood that he was the backup to the starting quarterback
Kent Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was made clear to me from the first meeting with the Giants
that Kent was starting,'' Collins said. ``Everybody wants to play
but I realize there's a long road ahead of me. I've got a lot to
improve. That's where my focus is. I have to get better and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who led the Giants to a5-1 finish last season when he
replaced Danny Kanell, was angry and shocked last month when he
heard the Giants had signed Collins. Monday, Graham said he met
with Collins in the Giants' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine between us,'' Graham said. ``I've let my
feelings be known but it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other Giants, Graham said Collins' problems in Carolina
should not affect his welcome with his new teammates.
</P>

PANEL HEADED BY EX-SENATOR PROPOSES NUMEROUS REFORMS IN OLYMPIC
LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' that has enveloped
the Olympic movement, a United States Olympic Committee commission
recommended a menu of reform on Monday that ranged from
democratizing the election of International Olympic Committee
members to public disclosure of its finances.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel, formed in December after revelations of
cash payments and gift-giving by Salt Lake organizers to IOC
members, concluded that the Games had suffered significant damage
and that their survival depended in part on the willingness to
adopt some of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In one of its strongest recommendations, the panel, chaired by
the former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, called on President Clinton
to declare the IOC a ``public international organization'' and thus
make bribing its officials punishable under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also concluded that the U.S. Olympic Committee had
done virtually nothing in its role of overseeing the Salt Lake bid
and recommended instituting strict rules governing the committee's
responsibilities, including an independent compliance committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Olympic movement has been badly damaged by the
revelations to date,'' Mitchell said, ``and while I don't believe
the damage is irreparable, it could have adverse implications if
they don't undergo meaningful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, who was majority
leader of the U.S. Senate, was released 16 days before a special
IOC session in Lausanne, Switzerland, that was called for a vote on
an in-house investigation's recommendations to expel members and
reform some of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, the IOC vice president who was chairman of his
organization's investigation, said: ``If this is what we have to do
to prevent this situation from happening again, then we'll look at
it. We're looking at everything we can do to reform this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he expected to release by the end of the week the
number of additional IOC members the investigative panel will
recommend for expulsion at the meeting. On Jan. 24, he recommended
six expulsions but still had three more to investigate. In
addition, 10 more members who were named by the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee's ethics panel are also under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working toward a consensus,'' Pound said. Of the 10 new
names cited by the Salt Lake Olympic Committee panel, Pound's panel
has spoken to three members in person and two more by phone and
received letters from the rest defending their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stop the bleeding by March 17,'' he said. ``Death
by a thousand cuts isn't much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission said the IOC's secretiveness and lack of
accountability fostered the Salt Lake committee's belief that only
financial largess would guarantee its ability to host the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not excuse or condone those from Salt Lake City who did
the giving,'' Mitchell said. ``What they did was wrong. But, as we
noted, they did not invent this culture; they joined one that was
already flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the IOC missed a golden opportunity to
initiate reform eight years ago when the organizers of Toronto's
failed bid to host the 1996 Summer Games offered evidence of
financial abuses by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell report described as ``prophetic'' a warning by the
Toronto group that visits by IOC members to bid cities are
precisely where ``the IOC runs the greatest risk of its image being
tarnished and its integrity eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's commission came down harder on the IOC, recommending
a broad restructuring of the Swiss-based organization, than on the
U.S.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an organization that is unaccountable,
secretive, self-perpetuating and oligarchical, you have created the
occasion for possible abuse,'' said Richard Hibey, counsel to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pound investigation attempts to wrap up its work by March
17, one Olympic official who demanded anonymity said a part of the
IOC's defense of some of its accused members will be that Salt Lake
officials were so persistent in offering gratuities that there was
no choice but to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Willingly or not, the IOC members were part of a highly
organized gift-giving campaign that the Mitchell commission
believes was widely known to the trustees and executive committee
members of the Salt Lake bid and organizing committees. An
independent Salt Lake ethics panel investigation pointed fingers at
Thomas Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake Olympic
Committee, and David Johnson, a former senior vice president, as
the officials primarily responsible for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mitchell commission called that conclusion into
question. ``It strains credulity,'' the report said, ``to believe
that so many responsible citizens could participate in such a long
and highly public campaign to influence IOC members and spend so
much money in the process but that only Messrs. Welch and Johnson
were aware of the improprieties surrounding these activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the commission were Donald Fehr, executive
director of the major league baseball players union; Roberta Cooper
Ramo, former president of the American Bar Association; Kenneth
Duberstein, President Ronald Reagan's former chief of staff, and
Jeffrey Benz, a lawyer and a former member of the U.S. figure
skating team. The commission relied mainly on documents to prepare
the report; it interviewed 11 witnesses, but many key players
refused to testify on advice of their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In its litany of reforms, the Mitchell commission sought to
eliminate the possibility that the missteps of the Salt Lake
officials could be repeated. Although its suggestions are
nonbinding, its recommendations for the IOC included these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Subjecting members to term limits, periodic re-election and
conflict-of-interest policies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadening the membership of the IOC with more public sector
members and more members elected by their national Olympic
committees or athletic federations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opening meetings to the public whenever possible and requiring
an independent auditor to disclose its annual financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring that all IOC members' visits to Olympic bid cities
be paid for by the IOC or the member, and prohibiting candidate
cities from paying for IOC members' travel or accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also suggested specific reforms for the USOC,
including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Barring cities from spending money on IOC members or any
international organizations from the time they are competing to be
the U.S. candidate city for the Olympics to the time they are the
organizing committee for the Olympcs and for two years after the
organizing committee work is completed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting any candidate cities from using grant money from
the USOC's international assistance fund, as the Salt Lake
committee did.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating an office of bid compliance, to oversee the bidding
processes for potential candidate cities.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee is expected to respond to the report
on Wednesday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the IOC investigates improprieties in past Olympic
bids, Billy Payne, the former head of the 1996 Atlanta Summer
Olympics, insisted in a letter dated last Friday and released on
Monday that ``we are unaware of any action on the part of the IOC
members or on the part of the Atlanta Organizing Committee that
cast doubt on the integrity of the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne admitted that while some gifts to IOC members exceeded the
$200 limit for candidate cities, ``they were within the range of
customary exchanges during that competition.''

U.S. PLANS TO BUILD PLANTS TO PROCESS TONS OF URANIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ky.)  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department plans to announce this week
that it wants to build two plants, at a cost of nearly $200 million
each, that will gradually turn 1.5 billion pounds of depleted
uranium into marketable products or waste that can be safely
stored.
</P>
<P>
   The uranium is now stored in canisters that can leak and give
off toxic gas. The plants would process the uranium in a way that
officials hope could help pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The uranium, which is not highly radioactive, could be converted
into a form useful for wrapping highly radioactive substances like
reactor waste. The fluorine with which it is mixed could be sold
for industrial use in petrochemicals, glass etching or steel
processing, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The government spends millions of dollars a year to scrape and
paint the canisters in a losing battle against rust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing that's happened in ages,'' said Donna
Goodman, a hazardous waste inspector with the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and one of a small group of specialists who have
been campaigning for better handling of the waste, leftovers of
production of uranium for nuclear power and for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the waste dates from the Manhattan Project, the secret
World War II program to develop the atomic bomb, in the early
1940s. Some of the canisters, in fact, carry the Manhattan
Project's initials.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Goodman and others noted that it was not clear where the
money to operate the factories, estimated at $50 million or more a
year, would come from.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law passed last year, the federal government is holding
about $373 million for the factories. It is asking private
companies for their proposals to use the money to build them.
</P>
<P>
   The money was paid over the last few years by customers of
plants that were then owned by the government and that process
uranium for use in nuclear reactors, sorting out the type that
splits easily, uranium 235. In addition, after the government sold
those plants in a public stock offering last year, the new private
entity that manages them, the United States Enrichment Corp., paid
another $66 million to the government to handle the waste produced
after privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The ``depleted'' uranium that remains after most of the uranium
235 has been removed is almost entirely uranium 238, a material
that is mildly radioactive and toxic; it is mixed with fluorine, a
chemical that forms a compound with uranium that can be turned to
gas for processing. But the compound, solid at room temperature,
gives off a toxic cloud when it contacts water.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hope that private companies will propose using the $373
million to build factories that will whittle away at the inventory
over 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested to see what industry does propose,'' an
Energy Department official said. ``We're looking for industry to
give us ideas and input.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who sponsored the law setting aside
the $373 million, said on Monday in a statement that he was
``encouraged that the Department of Energy has taken a first step
in soliciting industry interest to begin cleanup'' at two uranium
enrichment plants in Paducah, Ky., and Portsmouth, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell said that Congress was still waiting for the
Energy Department ``to come forward with a detailed legislative and
budgetary proposal to solve this environmental nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Energy Department has avoided doing anything with
the waste by declaring that it was not waste at all, but assets,
despite the fact that there was no market for the material in its
current form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only an asset if you change it to something else,'' said
one Senate aide with experience in the issue. ``Right now it's
hardly what we'd consider an asset, but we're going to make the
most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials are eager to pay for at least part of the operating
costs by selling recovered materials. They point out that depleted
uranium is about 30 percent more dense than lead, and very good for
shielding highly radioactive materials like spent nuclear fuel,
even if the uranium itself is slightly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Starmet, of Concord, Mass., has a plan to use
pellets of depleted uranium in place of the pebbles used to
strengthen concrete; the product, which it calls Ducrete, blocks
radiation three to four times better than the same thickness of
concrete, according to Donald T. King, manager of sales and
contracts at the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the uranium would have to be ``close to free'' to make the
product competitive in the marketplace, King said. He said that the
Energy Department might be willing to give the uranium away to be
free of storing it.
</P>
<P>
   The fluorine, on the other hand, could be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars. It makes up about a third of the inventory of
700,000 metric tons (about 1.5 billion pounds) and sells for up to
$1,500 a metric ton in some chemical forms.
</P>
<P>
   King said his company, which works with uranium-fluorine
compounds at the Energy Department's Savannah River Site near
Aiken, S.C., was already carrying out ``fluorine mining'' on a
laboratory scale and was working toward building a pilot-scale
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The department's announcement will ask companies like Starmet
what they would build, what chemical form the uranium and the
fluorine would take and how they would market the materials.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most optimistic experts believe that sales would
merely help offset operating costs, not cover them.
</P>
<P>
   One consultant who has worked on the matter and spoke on the
condition of anonymity said operating costs were a big problem.
``To say it's `not clear,''' the consultant said, ``is understating
it.''

BERRA FINDS A PERFECT FIT AT YANKEES' CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Yogi Berra visited Legends Field on Monday and the
first thing Joe Torre did was place a Yankees cap on the Yankee
legend's head. It looked right and it also enabled Berra to shield
the sun as he sat between Torre and Coach Don Zimmer during an
intrasquad game. The Yankees were on the field and so was Berra.
Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't worn a baseball cap in a long time,'' Berra said.
</P>
<P>
   While Berra did not admit it, he probably has not worn a Yankee
cap since George Steinbrenner unceremoniously dismissed him 16
games into the 1985 season. Since Steinbrenner apologized to Berra
for the atrocious way he had treated him and ended almost 14 years
of friction in a meeting on Jan. 5, Berra feels comfortable being a
Yankee again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was getting cheated by this whole thing,'' Torre
said. ``There's a lot of things he enjoys that he didn't get the
chance to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Berra is doing them. Torre said Steinbrenner wanted to have
Berra throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium with Joe
DiMaggio, if he is healthy, and the 73-year-old Berra said he would
oblige if he was asked. Berra would not confirm that he would
attend Old-Timers' Day, but it is likely Steinbrenner and Torre can
convince him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' said Berra, who also sat in
Steinbrenner's private box.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Berra was happy to be back, he was candid when
someone asked him if he always knew he would make amends with
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Berra said. ``He called. He called and
apologized. He said the right things. If he didn't, I wouldn't be
here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who has been in the organization since 1986 and
had never met Berra, asked if he could meet the Hall of Famer.
Berra showed Williams and Derek Jeter the special ring the Yankees
received for winning five consecutive World Series titles from 1949
to 1953 and the two players acted like 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys can do it if you stay together,'' Berra told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' said Williams, who signed a
seven-year, $87.5 million deal last November.
</P>
<P>
   Berra looked at Jeter and said, ``I don't know about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams quickly countered by saying, ``He'll be here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Berra shuffled away, muttering about how he could never
play Williams' guitar because his fingers were too stubby. &QL;

it seems so because they are showing styles that swathe the throat

MENTAL INSTITUTION SHAKEN BY DOCTORS' ARRESTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLK, Pa. _ The vast complex of handsome brick buildings sits
high on a hill and far off a two-lane rural road, providing an air
of mystery to the place, even a sense of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most days of the last 102 years have passed quietly
here in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania with few outsiders
ever knowing much about what happens inside the Polk Center, the
largest of the state's eight institutions for the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are beginning to learn. In a case reminiscent of
scandals of a generation ago, six doctors who worked at the center
were arrested on Friday on charges arising out of a two-year
investigation after three patients died in unusual circumstances in
1996 and 1997. Two doctors were charged with negligent care that
led to the deaths of three patients through misdiagnoses and
delayed treatment. Two of the three who died had been placed in the
center as children and had lived there for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   A third doctor was charged with ``gross and reckless omission in
care'' that left a patient ``in danger of death,'' and all six
doctors were accused of improper care and abusive treatment of 21
other patients for sewing up lacerations without using anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sad and disturbing case,'' said Mike Fisher,
the state attorney general, describing the results of an
investigation that began after the first death, almost three years
ago. ``These doctors were entrusted with the care of some of our
most dependent citizens,'' he said. ``Yet they broke that trust by
neglecting or abusing their patients, abuse that resulted in pain,
suffering, sickness and even death.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the doctors said Monday that they intended to plead
not guilty if preliminary hearings in the next several weeks
determine that enough evidence exists to try them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenfield, who is representing five of the doctors,
predicted that the state would fall well short of making a case,
saying, ``There was no criminal activity by any of these
physicians.'' Rosenfield characterized the prosecution as a
political gambit by Fisher to raise his profile for a future run
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a ridiculous charge,'' said Kevin Harley, a spokesman
for Fisher. ``It's nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling health-care complexes like the Polk Center, which
opened in 1897 as the State Institution for the Feeble-Minded of
Western Pennsylvania, are slowly becoming anachronisms. Recent
trends in housing and care for mentally retarded people include
placing them in small group homes or community settings near family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pagni, a spokesman for the state's Department of Public
Welfare, said that in 1966, when the need in Pennsylvania for large
institutions treating the mentally retarded was at its peak, more
than 13,000 people lived in 10 centers in the state. Polk, which
once housed as many as 3,500 residents, now has 576, some as young
as 30, others well into their 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, a collection of more than 20 stately and well-kept
buildings, is also the biggest employer in the town, with 1,200
workers who commute from communities near Erie to the north and
Pittsburgh to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the only restaurant in Polk, Laurie's Cafe _ one
of three businesses in town, along with Lori L's Beauty Shop and
Jimmy's Main Street Market _ Laurie Bowlin knows many of the Polk
employees from serving them lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Polk Center didn't exist, there would be no little Polk,''
Ms. Bowlin said, referring to the town of about 100 people. ``It's
a nice little place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowlin said townspeople had no idea any problems were
brewing at the center until last Friday, when television crews
began arriving in nearby Franklin to cover Fisher's announcement.
It was only then that the charges against the six doctors came to
light, coming out of the two-year investigation in which Fisher's
office sent in outside doctors to examine records and interview
other Polk personnel to learn what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the actions taken against the doctors, state
officials said the investigation led to improvements at all centers
in Pennsylvania where the mentally retarded live, like new training
techniques for the staff, modernized communication systems and
better surveillance of residents.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   The most serious of the criminal charges in the case were filed
against two of Rosenfield's clients, Dr. Cesar P. Miranda, 68, of
Butler, Pa., and Hyunchel J. Shin, 74, of Pittsburgh. Both face
felony counts of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment
for actions leading to the deaths of three patients.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda and the four other defendants _ David R. Byers, 54, of
Waldron, Ark., Louka T. Makkar, 50, of Youngstown, Ohio, Samir M.
Moussa, 47, of Meadville, Pa., and Donald G. Stitt, 84, of
Greenville, Pa. _ face misdemeanor charges of assault and neglect
for using staples and sutures to seal wounds without the use of
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these residents could not express pain or discomfort
to the doctors,'' Fisher said in a statement without elaborating.
``However, there is no excuse for circumventing normal medical
procedures. Just because they can't express pain doesn't mean they
can't feel pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the fatal cases, which led to felony charges of
involuntary manslaughter, involved a 31-year-old woman, Deborah
Carnes, a patient of Miranda who investigators found was suffering
from respiratory problems, fever and low-blood pressure on July 19,
1996. The investigators said Ms. Carnes ``should have been treated
immediately'' with intravenous fluids and oxygen and transferred to
a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they found that Miranda had ordered Ms. Carnes to an
X-ray room. When her conditioned worsened, she was transported to a
hospital, but she died on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, in March 1997, another patient of Miranda's,
Eugene Rozgonyi, died as a result of what investigators said was
``grossly and flagrantly negligent'' care. Investigators found that
Rozgonyi, who was 62 and had lived at the Polk Center for 55 years,
had abdominal pains throughout the day but was not examined by
Miranda until midnight, when Rozgonyi's temperature had fallen to
82 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda kept him under observation for more than four hours with
no treatment other than measures to warm him before he was
transferred to a local hospital at dawn, investigators said. Given
a more thorough examination there, Rozgonyi was found to be
suffering from intestinal obstruction, hypotension and finally a
heart attack. He died six hours later, on March 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shin was charged in the death of John Hoover, who was 60 and
lived at Polk for 53 years. Investigators said Shin delayed for
three weeks ordering a brain scan after he had recorded symptoms
that indicated that Hoover had severe damage to his brain, injuries
that led to his death on Aug. 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Rosenfield's clients, Byers, was charged with one
felony count of reckless endangerment for errors in treatment of a
patient, Randall Miller, who was suffering in 1995 from pneumonia.
Investigators said Byers prescribed penicillin but it was
discontinued after several hours when the patient had an allergic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   They said Byers failed to treat Miller with anything else, which
resulted in a worsening of his condition and a prolonged
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda and Shin were dismissed from their jobs after the
investigators' reports reached the attorney general's office. Byers
quit, and Stitt retired, leaving only Mossa and Makkar working at
the institution on Friday, when they were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa, who is facing 16 misdemeanor counts for inserting
sutures without anesthesia in seven patients, was irate over the
charges. Speaking from his home in Meadville, he accused state
officials of engaging in ``a conspiracy'' in trying to rid Polk
Center of civil service doctors and replacing them with doctors who
work for a private health-care organization in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa acknowledged the charges against him but insisted that
they did not violate any regulations, charging that even the
doctors from the health-care group did the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just trying to sell our positions,'' Moussa said.
``They want to give our shop to a private agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Sadosky, who was brought in as the institution's
director 18 months ago, said the state had signed a contract with a
private organization. But Sadosky denied any effort to run off
state doctors, saying, ``the investigation had absolutely nothing
to do with anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadosky added: ``We've done many things to fix the problems.
With a place this large, there are always issues to fix.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Talbert, a legendary doubles champion who defied
diabetes and went on to wear many hats and gain 33 national titles
over six decades of tennis prominence, died Sunday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert had been in declining health since sustaining a broken
shoulder and pelvis, and later undergoing hip-replacement surgery,
as the result of a mugging at a La Guardia Airport taxi stand in
1992 while on his way home from the U.S. Tennis Association's
annual board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert, who was found to have diabetes at age 10, had been
warned away from the playing fields but became fixated on the
noncontact sport of tennis as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He was a singles finalist at the U.S. Championships, as the U.S.
Open was then known, in 1944 and 1945, losing each time to Frank
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to claim eight doubles titles at that event, and
he became the Open's tournament director from 1971 to 1975 and from
1978 to 1987. He served in a transitional era, the Grand Slam event
having moved from Forest Hills to the hard courts at Flushing
Meadows in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   As an official, Talbert was instrumental in the adoption of the
sudden-death tie breaker, an innovation that was initially
unpopular with most players but received raves from spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew a player who bought a ticket,'' he said in
defense of his successful lobbying for the tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   As a singles player, as a doubles partner, as a Davis Cup team
member and as the Davis Cup team captain for five years, Talbert
was a stylish tactician of the sport that helped him transcend the
lifelong limitations enforced by diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   He was best known for playing the right side next to his
favorite partner, the spirited Gardnar Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the forehand, I played the backhand, and if I was
the power behind the partnership, he was surely the stylist up
front,'' said Mulloy, who reached six U.S. National doubles finals,
one short of a team record, alongside Talbert. ``Billy was the
greatest doubles player we ever had, and he was a great friend; for
10 years there wasn't another American team that could beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbert and Mulloy captured four of the six U.S. finals they
reached, claiming titles in 1942, 1945, 1946 and 1948, the same
year they clinched the Davis Cup championship for the United States
with a victory over the Australian team of Billy Sidwell and Colin
Long.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert collected nine major doubles titles, four of them in the
U.S. mixed event with Margaret Osborne duPont, with whom he set a
record by winning consecutive championships from 1943 to 1946. He
won the French doubles championship in 1950 with the 20-year-old
Tony Trabert, a fellow Cincinnatian for whom he served as mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert's Davis Cup career as a player began in 1946 and
concluded in 1952-53, when he was the team's playing captain. He
was 2-0 in singles and 7-1 in doubles. As a Davis Cup captain, a
role he held until 1957, Talbert was 13-4, and his team won the
championship in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert was unapologetic about being a relatively unregimental
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A party guy, a liberal captain, so I am,'' he said, ``but
these guys are all adults, and they want to win as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit I had a whale of a time when I played tennis,'' said
Talbert, who never missed a tournament or a post-match celebration.
``I went to every party that they had.''
</P>
<P>
   William Franklin Talbert III, a native of Cincinnati, entered
the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1967. He was also active
in parlaying his tennis contacts into the business world, becoming
executive vice president of United States Banknote Corp., a
financial printing firm, in 1964. He remained with the company
until his death.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Open's tournament director, Talbert was involved in
several colorful episodes, from the sublime to the absurd. It was
Talbert who decided to put the ingenue Chris Evert onto the stadium
court in 1971, and it was Talbert who removed the chair umpire,
Frank Hammond, and reinstated Ilie Nastase from default during a
riotous match against John McEnroe in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert wrote an autobiography, ``Playing For Life,'' and a
history of the U.S. men's singles championships, ``Tennis
Observed,'' with Pete Axthelm. He wrote ``The Game of Singles in
Tennis'' and ``The Game of Doubles in Tennis'' with Bruce Old.
</P>
<P>
   His is survived by two sons, Pike and Peter, and two
grandchildren. His wife, Nancy Pike, a former editor at Vogue and
Life magazines and a fashion model, died in 1995.

RALPH LAUREN BUYING CASUAL CLOTHING RETAILER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)  (lh) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Polo/Ralph Lauren Corp., the fashion design and
retail company, said Monday that it would acquire Club Monaco Inc.,
a Canadian-based specialty retailer that sells designer look-alike
casual apparel, for $52.5 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, the chairman and chief executive of Polo/Ralph
Lauren, which has annual sales of $1.6 billion, said he was
attracted to the relatively small Club Monaco as a growth strategy.
Club Monaco has annual sales of about $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren said he believed the chain, which offers fashion basics
with a European flair at prices well below name designer wear,
would experience explosive expansion in the next decade. ``It has a
real sense of style at a good price,'' he said. ``I see it as a
very large company, like Banana Republic or even Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Polo/Ralph Lauren will pay $13 (Canadian) a share, or $8.62
(U.S.), for approximately 6.5 million shares in Club Monaco common
stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. That price represents
an 18 percent premium of Club Monaco's closing price of $11
(Canadian) on Friday. Club Monaco shares closed Monday at $12.65.
Polo/Ralph Lauren will also assume $25 million to $28 million
(U.S.) in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Club Monaco's stock has been soaring since its low of $3.25
(Canadian) on Oct. 30. But it is still below its all-time high of
$16.50 in November 1997. The stock went public in March of that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Many retail analysts see the acquisition as a way to capture
customers not normally attracted to the clean all-American look of
the Ralph Lauren line, without alienating his loyal base of
supporters. Jennifer Black, executive vice president of Black and
Co., said, ``He is trying to create a venue for that hip customer
age 15 to 25, so that it doesn't send mixed messages'' to his
customers with more classical tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is highly unusual for a design house to purchase a
retail chain devoted to selling clothes that are not its own, and
the news seemed to make Wall Street queasy. Shares of Polo Ralph
Lauren declined 43.75 cents to $19.50 Monday. ``The stock is down
because people view this as an admission that they have to look for
other growth vehicles'' beyond their brand, said Faye Landes, a
retail analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Club Monaco will be managed as a stand-alone subsidiary, the
companies said. That means Polo/Ralph Lauren will not design Club
Monaco merchandise or try to improve the bottom line by combining
back-room operations like distribution or purchasing, although
Lauren did say executives at his company felt Club Monaco would
benefit from their experience in sourcing overseas and in brand
building.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Newman, vice chairman and chief operating officer,
said, ``This is not about cost savings or synergies, this is
primarily about growth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joseph Mimram, the founder and chief executive of Club Monaco,
has signed a five-year contract to remain with the company. The
deal was approved by the boards of both companies, but is still
subject to Canadian regulatory review.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also nearly doubles the number of stores in the
Polo/Ralph Lauren stable. The company currently manages some 30
stores. It also operates 100 outlet stores. Club Monaco has 59
stand-alone stores in Canada and 13 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren's aggressive expansion of retail operations
comes at a time when the company has been struggling to repair
operations in its own stores. The firm posted a 14 percent decline
in profit in its third quarter due to markdowns forced by late
deliveries of inventories.

MINIMED OPENS STRONG, THEN FADES FOR MILD GAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in medical devices maker MiniMed Inc.
opened up nearly 15 percent Monday, only to come quickly tumbling
back to earth for a one-day gain of just under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The short-lived, opening bell boost came from a pile of weekend
buy orders prompted by news late Friday that a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel had recommended approval of a MiniMed
blood glucose sensor for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening at $97.875, the issue fell steadily as
institutional investors, perhaps better informed than individual
buyers, sold the stock, according to analyst Sam Chang at
investment bank Volpe Brown Whelan. Shares ended the day up $1.6875
at $86.9375, for a gain of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of press over the weekend that talked about
this (glucose sensor) as the product that will revolutionize
diabetes,'' Chang said. ``As a result, a lot of people jumped on
the bandwagon. But the institutions realized this is still a niche
product, and sold into the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA panel said Friday it would recommend approval of the
sensor, but said Los Angeles-based MiniMed should conduct more
tests on the device. The FDA is not bound by the panel's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor, which can be worn for up to three days at a time, is
the first to provide continuous testing of diabetics' blood sugar
levels. The company hopes it will eliminate the need for finger
pricks that diabetics must now conduct up to three times per day to
draw blood for testing.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA does approve the product, it will initially be only
for use in a physician office setting. A device for use by
consumers is still at least two years away, Chang said. In
addition, for even the office version to get approval, the FDA
panel recommended MiniMed conduct further tests.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the panel said MiniMed should further study use
of the device in minorities and people with Type II diabetes. The
bulk of previous test subjects were white, Type I sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed officials said they were pleased by the panel's
recommendation and that they look forward to moving ahead on
development and marketing of the sensor.

<P>
   First there was the 5.9 percent teaser rate. When that expired,
the interest rate on Tom Moore's PNC Bank credit card jumped to
14.4 percent. Finally it settled at 12.5 percent. Moore, an
illustrator who lives in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   But last week Moore was stunned to find that he was no longer a
customer of PNC, which is based in Pittsburgh, but of a bank in
Oklahoma he had never heard of. Not only that, but his interest
rate had been jacked up to 20.74 percent _ and 24.74 percent on
cash advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the most odious business practice I've ever
seen,'' complained Moore, who is 46.
</P>
<P>
   Odious or not, tens of millions of Americans have been facing
the same stark choice _ to take the new terms or leave them _ as
the credit-card business rapidly consolidates into fewer and larger
hands. About 32 million accounts were sold last year, mainly by
regional banks like PNC, Keycorp, First Maryland and First Union.
That is more than four times as many as in 1996, according to R.K.
Hammer, who runs a card industry advisory firm in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Because many people have multiple accounts, the sales
involved some 20 million consumers. The figures do not include
transfers resulting from mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgages and automotive loans are routinely bought and sold,
but this has little impact on borrowers, since the rates cannot
change. But the new owners of credit-card business are free to
impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear, subject only
to the handful of remaining state usury ceilings. They can also
shorten the time for making payments without interest charges,
eliminate grace periods for payments received a few days late and
raise penalties for late payment, now commonly as much as $29.
</P>
<P>
   Big buyers have included Chase, which bought 3.5 million Bank of
New York accounts last year, and Citibank, which bought AT&AMP;T's
Universal Card. Other buyers are Fleet Financial and Bank One,
which owns First USA, as well as some little-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   Except for low teaser rates guaranteed for, say, six months,
banks have no legal obligation to honor any rates cardholders now
pay and have shown little inclination to do so. But while it is not
unusual for rates to rise 6 or 8 percentage points, they could also
fall. ``It's the natural time to examine the risk and reward of
each'' account, Hammer said, and the result ``could be a repricing
up or down.'' And even when rates stay the same, penalties and
grace periods may change, sometimes to the consumer's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerri Detweiler, a credit-card specialist and consultant
to Debt Counselors, called it scandalous that consumers can so
easily fall prey to the wheeling and dealing of large institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mortgage or car loan were sold, your rate would stay
the same,'' Ms. Detweiler said. ``That's not the case with credit
cards.'' When consumers see an account has been transferred, it is
very important to read the fine print because of a high probability
that the interest rate or some other terms have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 3.5 billion credit-card offers flooding
Americans' mailboxes each year, cardholders would have little
trouble taking their business elsewhere. Often, by paying a fee,
they are even able to transfer balances. But the banks, Ms.
Detweiler added, ``anticipate that a lot of new customers won't pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore acknowledged that a month or two earlier he had received a
mailing that may well have included a notification of the higher
rates but that he had not focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   Credits cards once provided a lush business for regional banks
like PNC, but many are fleeing it now, squeezed by the high costs
of uncollectible debt and a rising number of consumers who pay
monthly balances in full, depriving the bank of interest income.
And the cost is rising for the increasingly sophisticated computer
models that analyze customer usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even at a time of unparalleled prosperity, there is no
letup in the record number of Americans filing for bankruptcy,
raising fears that a business downturn would send bad card debt
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The card business is really becoming a business of scale,''
said Warren G. Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc., a
company in Wakefield, Mass., that studies and rates the nation's
banks. ``A lot of companies are recognizing this and throwing in
the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are also making changes. For example, Ikea, the
Swedish furniture company, retains its blue-and-yellow credit cards
but switched the servicing of customer accounts to Citibank last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, there is no change in a customer's rate, said
David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. But it is also common for banks to
upgrade the type of account _ to platinum, for instance. Upgraded
accounts sometimes prove to be more expensive in terms of fees and
may carry higher rates as well, although they may offer more
services and the advantage of being with a bigger lender.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Robertson contended, the industry's
ever-more-sophisticated ability to analyze account data has helped
it to tailor new products and cut costs, and these savings may
ultimately be shared with customers. ``This is certainly the heyday
of the credit-card business for the consumer,'' Robertson said.
``Never has there been a better time to find the card that appeals
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is one of those looking for a more-appealing card. After
learning of the sale of his account, he telephoned the new owner,
Direct Merchants Bank in Tulsa. A customer service representative
told him that his was one of a half million PNC accounts
transferred and that if he did not like the new terms, he could
close his account.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly canceled his card but must still pay the higher
interest rate on his $848 balance, which he hopes to pay off soon.
But if he had been running a balance too big to settle fairly
quickly, he would have been forced, with only a few weeks' notice,
to pay a much higher interest rate for some time unless he could
transfer it to a new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build up a substantial amount, you may not be able to
pay it all,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America. He called it ``gouging'' when a
credit-card rate is raised sharply for no reason other than a
business deal between large institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Direct Merchants Bank belongs to Metris Cos., a Minnesota-based
marketer of various consumer-credit products, including credit-card
registration and extended warranties on appliances. It was once a
financial arm of Fingerhut Cos., a catalog and telemarketing
concern with which it still has some ties.
</P>
<P>
   Metris is one of the most aggressive of several buyers of
credit-card portfolios being shed by banks, having acquired $1.6
billion worth in the past two years, half from PNC and the rest
from Cleveland-based Keycorp, Mercantile Bancorporation of St.
Louis and Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Metris charges interest rates on its cards ranging from 15.9
percent to 26.9 percent, depending mainly on how it judges a
customer's creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a price-for-risk philosophy'' tailored to individual
customers, said Alfred A. Galgano, vice president for investor
relations, citing what he said are more than 150 combinations of
rates and fees. He said the Metris system for judging risk is more
refined than those of some banks it is buying credit accounts from,
suggesting that at least some customers may find an advantage in
being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Galgano would not say how many former PNC customers, like Moore,
refused to accept Metris' terms, only that there was a ``fair
amount of attrition,'' but no more than expected. He also said that
some PNC customers were no doubt headed for higher rates even had
there been no transfer, either because of the end of an
introductory rate or, say, a deteriorating pattern of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mukri, spokesman for the Comptroller of Currency, which
enforces the notification process for national banks, says he knows
of no serious violations by banks or of consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest resistance tends to come from people who sometimes
carry balances. Those who always pay their cards off immediately
would never be levied the high rates. Those who never pay off their
balances tend to be so financially stretched that they may not
qualify for better rates elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Metris caters mainly to people of moderate income, which Galgano
defined as those earning between $15,000 and $35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In PNC's eyes, Moore belonged to a group of customers it
regarded as geographically incorrect for its business _ that is,
beyond the limits of its physical operations. It announced in
September an agreement to sell these to Metris and then decided
just before Christmas to sell the rest of its credit-card
operation, 3.3 million accounts serviced in Wilmington, Del., to
the Wilmington-based MBNA Corp., the industry's No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The going rate that a bank will pay for a card account ranges
from $50 to $180, depending on creditworthiness and usage patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Williams, a spokesman for PNC, said that he knew
nothing of how Metris is handling his bank's former customers and
that the bank has no obligation to them. Asked specifically about
Moore's contention that he had been delivered up to sharks,
Williams said he ``would disagree'' with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not uncommon to sell a business that has accounts, and
at which point it now becomes the business of the successor,'' he
said. ``The customer by law has to be informed of any change in
terms and has the option not to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as competition for creditworthy customers has put downward
pressure on credit-card rates, profit margins have withered by
two-thirds in the past seven or eight years, said Allen W. Sanborn,
president of RMA, a Philadelphia-based association of bank lenders.
``Some customers you just can't make any money on,'' he said, even
when credit-card issuers raise late fees and other penalties to try
to offset the effect of lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the California analyst, figured that pretax returns to
lenders on card balances has now fallen four straight years, to 2.5
percent in 1998 from 3.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   High fees themselves have now created a backlash, one reflected
in congressional efforts to curb abusive credit-card terms. Rep.,
John LaFalce, D-N.Y., plans to introduce legislation on Tuesday
covering various practices, like hidden rates and aggressive
solicitations, and requiring prominent disclosure of increasingly
heavy penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The measure planned by LaFalce, the ranking minority member on
the House Banking Committee, would give a consumer who is hit with
a higher interest rate the right to pay off the balance at the
earlier terms. ``It's only simple fairness,'' said Gary Luczak, a
spokesman for LaFalce.

 &HT;    Sports writer dies in crash
 &HT;    By Scott Marshall
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Veteran Atlanta Journal-Constitution sports writer Tom
McCollister died Monday in a two-car crash near his home in
Lilburn, Ga., police said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred at 3:18 p.m. at the intersection of U.S. 29
and Rockbridge Road, said Jim Canupp, a Gwinnett County police
accident investigator.
</P>
<P>
   McCollister, who at one time was the sports editor for The
Atlanta Journal, covered all types of sporting activity during his
career. He recently transferred to the newspaper's Gwinnett bureau
after a three-year assignment covering NASCAR, said assistant
managing editor for sports Don Boykin.
</P>
<P>
   McCollister was an avid golfer who covered the PGA Tour for many
years. His writings included a book, ``Golf in Georgia,'' and he
was looking forward to covering the Masters Tournament in Augusta
again this year, as he had done several times in the past, Boykin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was an important part of the Journal-Constitution sports
department and the Atlanta sports community for many years,''
Boykin said. ``He was a terrific journalist, but an even better
person. He will be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollister, 61, was driving a red 1989 Toyota Camry north on
U.S. 29 when he merged into a left-turn lane to cross the
southbound lanes of U.S. 29 onto Rockbridge Road, Canupp said.
</P>
<P>
   McCollister turned into the path of a black 1978 Chevrolet
Camaro that was being driven south on U.S. 29 by Tanja Colleen
Franklin, 30, Canupp said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's car, which was traveling at about 40 mph, struck the
passenger side of McCollister's car, Canupp said. McCollister, who
police said was wearing an automatic shoulder harness but not a lap
belt, was rushed to DeKalb Medical Center, where he was pronounced
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin was listed in stable condition at DeKalb Medical Center
on Monday night, a hospital spokesman said. Her injuries were not
life-threatening, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed in the accident.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER LOSES 2 EXECUTIVES TO RIVAL FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Two senior executives from DaimlerChrysler Corp.
joined Ford Motor Co. on Monday, the latest in a series of
departures of executives from the former Chrysler Corp. since its
merger last November with Daimler-Benz AG.
</P>
<P>
   When Daimler and Chrysler merged, the combination was presented
as a merger of equals. But the merger is increasingly viewed in the
auto industry as a takeover by the German company. The loss of
executive talent is particularly unusual in an industry in which
managers have traditionally worked their entire careers at a single
company.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine Germans and only two Americans among the
executives reporting to the two co-chairmen, Juergen E. Schrempp,
Daimler's former chairman, and Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's former
chairman. The merger agreement also calls for Eaton to remain for
no more than three years before Schrempp becomes the sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas T. Stallkamp, DaimlerChrysler's president, said in a
statement on Monday evening that the departure of the two senior
vice presidents would not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a competitive industry, and while we obviously hate to
lose any management talent, it is a reflection of the strength and
wide-ranging business capabilities that exist in our company,''
Stallkamp said. ``We continue to be confident that DaimlerChrysler
will become the best company in the industry and will offer
enormous opportunities to all our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamel T. Rushwin, DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president for
international manufacturing and minivan assembly operations, will
become Ford's vice president for advanced manufacturing
engineering, effective Monday, Ford announced. Chris P. Theodore,
DaimlerChrysler's senior vice president for platform engineering,
is joining Ford to become its vice president for large and luxury
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rushwin had helped keep DaimlerChrysler at the top of the
minivan market, while Theodore had a sterling reputation as a
planner of new vehicles. They are the latest in a long list of star
executives to leave. Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's vice chairman and
the man credited with much of the automaker's success in the 1990s
through the introduction of new and more daringly designed models,
retired last summer before the merger; although he was more than a
year over Chrysler's retirement age of 65, the company had tried to
hold on to his expertise as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Pawley, Chrysler's executive vice president for
manufacturing and one of the most highly regarded manufacturing
executives in the auto industry, retired early at the end of last
year. And Stephen Harris, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for
public affairs, moved to General Motors Corp. last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives were crowing on Monday evening. ``The experience
and expertise that Shamel and Chris bring to Ford will add
exceptional depth to an already strong team,'' said Jacques A.
Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive officer. ``They will
help in leading the company toward our vision of becoming the
world's leading consumer company that provides automotive products
and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore succeeds Kenneth Kohrs, who will retire on June 1 after
more than 37 years with Ford, while Rushwin replaces Roman J.
Krygier Jr., who became Ford's vice president for engines and
transmissions on Jan. 1.

 FDA OKs Palo Alto Firm's Psoriasis Drug  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Palo Alto biotech firm will announce today that it has received
Food and Drug Administration approval to start selling a foam to
treat psoriasis of the scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wiggans, chief executive of Connetics Corp., said he
expects to start selling the foam under the brand name of Luxiq
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got the (FDA approval) letter, I got on the phone
and hired 16 dermatology salespeople,'' Wiggans said.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.4 million people in the United States suffer from this
condition of severely dried and flaky skin. Approximately 200,000
new cases are reported annually. Most cases are reported among
Caucasians, with women slightly outnumbering men.
</P>
<P>
   Current remedies include a variety of creams and lotions, both
over the counter and by prescription. Luxiq would enter the market
as one of the prescribed remedies, competing with similar
prescription creams or lotions that can cost $50 to $100 per
canister. Wiggans said the competing creams leave the hair feeling
greasy. He said Luxiq will spray on like shaving cream and be
absorbed into the scalp with less telltale residue.
</P>
<P>
   Connetics, which currently has a staff of 85, lost $26 million
last year on sales of $9 million. But even before yesterday's FDA
approval was announced, the stock briefly flirted with a 52-week
high of $9.25 before closing at $8.88 _ a big jump for an issue
that traded at $2 in October.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggans attributed the recent stock momentum to Wall Street
interest in Connetics' research into a treatment for scleroderma, a
disease that creates scar tissues on the inside and outside of the
body. It can be life-threatening. Currently there are no effective
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggans said Connetics' stock started to ascend in December as
it became apparent the company would start the final, or Phase III,
round of clinical trials on a possible treatment for Scleroderma.

RIVIERA BY YACHT  
 JAZZ IN SAN JUAN  
 SOUTH AMERICAN CRUISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 7)
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By JOSEPH SIANO  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)We would like to charter a yacht with a crew
(including a cook) for about a week to sail from Nice, France, to
Portofino, Italy. There will be six adults in our group. Can you
provide names of any yacht-chartering operations? _ Sandy Potholm,
Harpswell, Maine.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Although you could find a yacht-chartering company in Nice,
you will probably have more success a little farther east in a
higher-rent neighborhood, Monaco, or a few miles to the west around
Antibes.
</P>
<P>
   One yacht company in Monaco is Camper &AMP; Nicholsons. Pierre
Hurel, its charter broker, says that the price will depend on the
vessel's size and whether it's a motor yacht or a sailing yacht
(the former is more expensive because of the fuel and larger crew
required).
</P>
<P>
   Hurel suggests that for six passengers and crew, you would need
a motor yacht between 65 and 111 feet. The smallest yacht would
have one double-bed cabin and two twin-bed cabins. The three-member
crew would consist of a captain-engineer, a cook-deckhand and a
steward.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost about $20,000 a week plus 20.6 percent value-added
tax. On top of this sum, you would need to send about 25 percent of
the base charter fee in advance to cover food, fuel and port
charges, or about $5,000 in this case; this amount is not subject
to the VAT.
</P>
<P>
   A 62-foot sailing yacht, he said, would cost about $14,000 a
week plus the VAT, or about $3,000, and provisions. It would
require a two-member crew: a captain and a cook-deckhand. For more
room, a 111-foot sailing yacht would cost about $37,000 for a week,
plus tax and provisions, and you would have a crew of six: a
captain, cook, mate, engineer and two others who are the nautical
version of flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Hurel also suggests that you will enjoy your week along the
Riviera much more if you expand your selection in ports of call,
since it only takes 10 hours to go from Monaco to Portofino, and
the only place worth a stop along the way is San Remo, Italy. He
recommends adding Cannes, St.-Tropez and the picturesque Iles
d'Hyeres, just off Toulon. Or, he said, you could start in Monaco
and include Corsica as well as Portofino, although for this trip he
recommends a motor yacht because of its faster speed. You may
contact him at Camper &AMP; Nicholsons, (377) 97.97.77.00, fax (377)
93.50.25.08, on the Web: www.cnconnect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Ringsing, charter broker at Fraser Yachts, (377)
93.10.04.60, fax (377) 93.10.0.97, in Monaco, said that you might
avoid the VAT if you can find a smaller commercially registered
yacht, but she could think of only two of these. She suggests a tip
of 5 to 10 percent of the basic charter fee, to be given to the
captain, who distributes it to the crew.
</P>
<P>
   In Nice, you can try Three-B Yachting, (33-4) 93.56.55.05, fax
(33-4) 93.89.66.00, where Dominique Poirier recommends either a
130-foot motor yacht for about $29,500 for a week, plus tax and
provisions, or a 75-foot motor yacht (about $22,400). Each has a
crew of eight. Fuel for the longer yacht will cost about $10,000,
the shorter about $5,900.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the amenities each yacht offers, including
air-conditioning and water sports gear. &QL;

   Q. (italics)I'm interested in attending the Heineken Jazz
Festival in San Juan. I know it's sometime in June, but I cannot
seem to find any information about dates, prices, performers and
sites. Can you help? Also, I'd like to rent a villa in San Juan. _
Barbara L. Fields, New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. This year's Puerto Rico Heineken Jazz Fest will be June 10 to
13. All performances will be at Parque Sixto Escobar, at the
entrance to Old San Juan. The stage will be in a track and field
stadium alongside the beach; folding chairs will rent for $1.
</P>
<P>
   The first three days, performances will start at 8 p.m. On June
10, the lineup is the Afro Rican Jazz Ensemble and The Rippingtons,
featuring Russ Freeman. On June 11, there will be three performers:
the Charlie Sepulveda Sextet; the Jazz Messengers: the Legacy of
Art Blakey, with Randy Becker, among others; and Poncho Sanchez.
The next evening, Ralph Irizarri Timbalaye is scheduled (though not
yet confirmed), along with the Manhattan Transfer.
</P>
<P>
   And on June 13, a Sunday, the final concert at 5 p.m. will
include the Elaine Elias Trio.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket good for all four performances is $47.50; call
Entertainment and Marketing Group at (787) 277-9200, fax (787)
277-0552. Rico Sun Tours, (800) 844-2080, sells a package that
includes tickets, transportation to and from the concerts, a beach
chair and tours.
</P>
<P>
   For short-term vacation rentals, you can try San Juan Vacations,
(800) 266-3639; the Web site is www.sanjuanvacations.com. Or call
Palm View Realty, (888) 957-7256, www.palmviewrealty.com.
</P>
<P>
   Package tours that include the festival are offered by
Interisland Tours, (800) 245-3434, starting at $799 a person,
double occupancy, with round-trip air fare from New York, four
nights in the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde, tickets, chairs, transfers
each day and sightseeing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like to take a cruise to South America that
includes at least Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, but I cannot
seem to find any. Do you know of some? _ Irving Greene, East
Brunswick, N.J.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. You just missed the boat, literally, for this season. Holland
America's Noordam is scheduled to depart Sunday from Valparaiso,
Chile, on a 16-day cruise around Cape Horn that includes the
Chilean fjords, a passage through the Strait of Magellan, Tierra
del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Rio.
Its next cruise goes from Rio to Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   But don't despair. You can start planning now for similar
cruises on the Noordam next year. The 1,214-passenger ship, which
entered service in 1984 and was renovated last year, is tentatively
scheduled to make six 16-day trips around South America, according
to Janis Goller, a Holland America spokeswoman, with departures
from Jan. 3 to April 8, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on departure date, you will either be going from Rio
to Valparaiso or in the reverse direction. Nondiscounted fares for
this year's cruise ranged from $4,385 to $7,555 a person, based on
two to a cabin, plus air fare from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because you'll be sailing in the Southern Hemisphere, the time
of year when you are most likely to find South America cruises
available is our winter and spring. To get a better idea of exactly
what ships and ports of call will be available next season, see a
travel agent.

 Gilead Buying NeXstar for $550 Million  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Gilead Sciences Inc. of Foster City said yesterday that it would
pay $550 million in stock and debt to acquire NeXstar
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Boulder, Colo. Both biotech firms
specialize in infectious diseases and cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead would pay roughly $17.48 in stock for each NeXstar share,
a premium of about 27 percent over NeXstar's Friday close of
$13.81.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead plans to keep its name and management, while acquiring
revenues from two of NeXstar's marketable drugs and control over
the firm's 135-person European and Australian sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Copithorne, an analyst with Prudential Securities in
New York, called the deal a ``mild positive'' for Gilead. Before
the merger, she hadn't expected Gilead to become profitable until
2001. But if Gilead gets NeXstar's $100 million in current
revenues, she thinks Gilead could head into the black a full year
earlier, earning 20 cents a share in 2000 instead of losing 55
cents that year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Copithorne said Gilead would acquire a European
sales force in one fell swoop. She said that could be crucial to
Gilead, which hopes to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval later this year to sell a new anti-AIDS drug called
Preveon. It also will ask European drug regulators to OK Preveon
for sale. Having a European sales force would keep Gilead from
having to surrender a lion's share of the royalties to a European
partner, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Thomas Dietz with Pacific Growth Equities in San
Francisco also thought the deal made sense for Gilead but
questioned whether the Foster City firm overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   He said biotech firms generally sell for three to four times
their revenues when the purchaser is a large pharmaceutical
concern. The complicated $550 million deal, in which J. P. Morgan
represented the buyer and Morgan Stanley the seller, values NeXstar
at more than five times current revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco investment banker Steve Burrill said it is
tough to armchair-quarterback such deals, especially if Gilead can
hasten its own profitability while controlling European sales of
its hoped-for AIDS drug.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GILEAD02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Gilead CEO John Martin will run the combined companies. NeXstar
Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer Larry Gold will report to
Martin. A NeXstar spokeswoman said no job cuts are planned
immediately, but analysts suggested that if the ax does fall, it
would most likely come down in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead shares slipped 50 cents yesterday to close at $40.75,
while NeXstar jumped $1.31 to $15.13 after the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

 Silicon Valley IR Consultant Settles SEC Insider-Trading Case  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Illegal insider trading isn't limited just to suits in boardrooms
and executive suites.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can corrupt investment bankers, accountants,
lawyers, journalists, financial printers and, yes ... investor
relations professionals. In fact, a case involving one of their own
has Bay Area investor relations professionals _ folks who deal with
stockholders and analysts _ rocking on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   In a little-noticed story that nearly slipped through the local
news filter, Pleasanton investor relations consultant Lisa Herbst
agreed two weeks ago to settle an insider trading case with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It is the first case against an
investor relations person pursued by the San Francisco office of
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Without conceding guilt or receiving exoneration, Herbst agreed
to settle a case in which the SEC charged her with illegally
trading stock in three high-technology companies that were her
clients at various junctures. Between 1995 and 1998, Herbst
allegedly used nonpublic information to trade on Adobe Systems of
San Jose, Asyst Technologies of Fremont and Splash Technology
Holdings of Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her settlement, Herbst agreed to return all profits
from her stock trades with interest and pay a penalty. Total
damage: $32,799.
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize the weight of the settlement, the money
Herbst owes is the same amount that she would pay if she had been
convicted in a trial, points out David Bayless, the SEC's top
administrator in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His point is crystal clear. IR folks better think twice about
how and when they invest in their clients' stock. Or more
important, whether it's prudent to invest in a client's stock at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is significant because it is against an IR person,''
Bayless notes. ``Companies have to have confidence and trust in
these people so that they don't steal information and trade on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the capper: Herbst wasn't an unknown innocent, or at
least one would think that she was in a position to know better.
Herbst was a two-term president of the Silicon Valley chapter of
the National Investor Relations Institute, which subsequently has
voted to oust her as the top officer of that local organization _
one that is responsible for setting the standards of this
increasingly influential profession.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET02 (75769 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The SEC (settlement) was a surprise. (And) we felt that any
type of judgment made it difficult for anyone in a leadership
position to continue'' in such a role, says Carol Kaplan, acting
president of the Silicon Valley chapter of NIRI.
</P>
<P>
   Thus on February 19, the NIRI valley chapter's board voted to
toss Herbst from office and suspend her membership from an
organization in which she held a leadership post of some kind for
about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the valley NIRI board needed to send a message that its
membership isn't rife with insider traders. But what's interesting
here is that Herbst refused the board's offer to resign. Kaplan
would not discuss the particulars of Herbst's dismissal.
(Incidentally, Herbst has requested a hearing on March 10 before
the national NIRI board to defend her membership in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, Herbst contends that her settlement in no
way demonstrates any admission of guilt. And therefore, she thinks
that she should still be president of the valley chapter of the
NIRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt (the board's) vote was unwarranted,'' says Herbst. ``As
in any case, there are two sides to the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Herbst, she can't tell her side of the insider
trading story. Herbst's consent decree with the SEC prohibits her
from commenting about her case.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, without going into greater detail, the allegations
laid out by the SEC make compelling references to trades that
Herbst made during sensitive time periods seemingly based on
privileged information.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Herbst, who runs her own one-person IR firm,
argues that she didn't have the deep-pockets to afford the hefty
legal bills that would have resulted from a protracted fight with
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``A settlement is a settlement. But nothing is black and
white,'' Herbst says.
</P>
<P>
   So why did she settle if she implies that she wasn't guilty?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat naive at understanding the complete (SEC
investigation) process,'' Herbst says. ``This has been nothing but
a bad experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET02 (75769 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One thing is certain, no investor relations consultant or
executive should think that their stock trades are too small to
cross the SEC's radar.

 &HT;    Georgia Dome, big crowds enhance tournament
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Final Four comes to the Georgia Dome in 2002,
the Southeastern Conference Basketball Tournament will have been
played there four of the last five years. And this year's SEC
event, set to begin with four games Thursday, is the second of
three straight years in which it will be played in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The increased frequency of the tournament's visits here has some
SEC members wondering, will Atlanta become the SEC Tournament's
permanent home?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to me, we'd play it in Atlanta every year,'' said
South Carolina coach Eddie Fogler, when asked about the subject
Monday. ``There are no negatives about it. What Atlanta brings to
the table can't be beat. If you look at all the ingredients you
need for a tournament, they're all there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen, SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer said,
though he added Atlanta could be considered the tournament's
semi-permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will always be a desire to move the tournament
on occasion to the west side of the region and maybe we'll do that
every third or fourth year,'' Kramer said. ``But we'd like to keep
it in Atlanta as much as we can. Atlanta may not be the
(tournament's) permanent home, but it's definitely the anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC Tournament, which was played in Atlanta last year and in
1995, is already under contract to be played at the Georgia Dome
next year and in 2002. It will be played in Nashville, Tenn., in
2001 and, though negotiations are still ongoing, will likely go to
New Orleans' SuperDome in 2003, the same year it hosts the Final
Four, Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, it will probably come back to Georgia. In
fact, there have been preliminary discussions about playing the
tournament in Philips Arena, the Atlanta Hawks' new home scheduled
for completion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC wasn't always so infatuated with Atlanta. The tournament
has been played here just five times in the previous 40 seasons of
its existence, including the first two years at the Atlanta
Athletic Club in 1933 and '34. It was 53 years before it returned
and then it did not come back for another eight years. The four-day
event in 1987 at The Omni attracted just 105,616 spectators, 43,000
fewer than the previous year in Lexington, Ky., and 21,000 less
than the following year in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some concern in 1987 that the city (of Atlanta)
didn't care,'' said Brad Davis, SEC associate commissioner and
executive director of the tournament. ``But since 1995, everybody
realizes that's not the case. Atlanta has embraced this event and
made it bigger and better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament returned to Atlanta and moved into the Georgia
Dome in 1995 where it debuted to record-setting crowds. With
Kentucky and Arkansas meeting in the finals, it drew 250,301
spectators in four days, which remains the all-time attendance
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the tournament could break the record this year. ``If
we get a run on a few more tickets this week, it may be sold out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That should come as no surprise, Fogler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big Southeastern city located in a major transportation
hub that's easily accessible by car or plane,'' he said. ``They
have nice hotels and restaurants, plenty of entertainment, the best
facilities and the fans come out. What's not to like?''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the tournament should remain in Atlanta
indefinitely, Arkansas' Nolan Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care much about it being in one spot,'' he said. ``I
enjoyed the rotation thing we were doing there for a while, playing
in New Orleans and Memphis. There are some advantages to having it
in one spot, certainly. But there are so many teams in our league,
I'm for rotating it around so all the fans get a chance to go see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the Georgia Dome along with the expansion of
the SEC were important factors to its success here. Da

HOCKEY COMES OF OLD AGE IN DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Stars are so old that ``Remember the Alamo''
is not merely a figurative expression. The veterans don't mind that
the National Hockey League will expand to 30 teams in two years
because they remember how hard it was for them to earn a job in the
six-team league. When the Stars signed a free agent named Hull last
summer, one of them said, ``Bobby may have lost a step, but his
slap shot will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher's father was in the locker room the other day.
Derian is the Stars' 26-year-old captain but his dad did not look
all that out of place among a few of Derian's teammates. In need of
an extra defenseman, the Stars last week hired the 38-year-old Doug
Lidster, a former Ranger who had retired last year. Stashing his
gear into his locker after practice last Saturday, Lidster looked
around and said, ``I fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars visit New York to play the Rangers on Tuesday and
the Islanders on Thursday, they will bring the league's oldest
roster, averaging more than 31 years of age. They also bring the
league's best record and its biggest expectations. In 58 games,
they are 38-11-9 and 7-1-1 in their last nine. Their longest losing
streak has been two games. On the road, they are unbeaten in their
last eight. Their goals against average is 2.00, lowest in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not have the fastest team, but we can match fast
teams,'' Guy Carbonneau, who turns 39 this month, said earlier this
season. ``We might not have the strongest team, but we can play a
physical game. We might not be the best at any one thing, but right
now we're the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   When they played Detroit last spring in the Western Conference
finals, the Red Wings beat them in six games, on their way to their
second consecutive Stanley Cup championship. But it seemed to some
as if the craftier team in decline won over the better team
ascending. Apparently en route to their second consecutive
Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season record, the Stars'
biggest challenge might be to stay healthy and focused on the last
quarter of the regular season until the post-season tournament
begins in April.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gainey, the general manager of Dallas and a former captain
of the Canadiens, has built a roster filled with veterans. Two of
them, Mike Keane, who arrived from the Rangers last spring, and
Carbonneau, were also captains in Montreal. Pat Verbeek was a
captain in Hartford. Brian Skrudland was a captain in Florida.
Brett Hull, Bobby's 34-year-old son, was a captain in St. Louis.
Carbonneau said, ``If Bob makes a trade and the chemistry is not
there anymore, he is the one who will have to pay for it. He's
going to try to make the right deal, but he also knows that
sometimes the best trade you make is the one you don't make.''
</P>
<P>
   And, sometimes, the best signings you make are free agents. They
compose a quarter of the roster, including Hull, Verbeek, Shawn
Chambers, Ed Belfour and Dave Reid. Although more than half the
Stars are older than age 30, the nucleus of the team is composed of
stars in their prime, such as Hatcher, the leading scorer and the
alternate captain Mike Modano, Sergei Zubov, Jamie Langenbrunner
and Jere Lehtinen, all between ages 23 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   Common among both older and younger Stars are strong
personalities, a challenge to Ken Hitchcock, a strong-willed coach
who was still coaching junior teams in Kamloops, British Columbia,
when many of his players were established in the NHL. ``These
people are set in their ways,'' Hitchcock said. ``So many strong
opinions. There is no coaching clinic for this.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four seasons with the team, Hitchcock has learned to
listen. Because he is so demanding in games and in practices, his
players demand off days and he allows them, at least five each
month, he said. ``Otherwise, I'm going to burn this group out,'' he
said. The veterans and even the 20-somethings bang on his door,
Hitchcock said, to give him free advice. ``Yinning and yanging,''
is what Hitchcock calls their ongoing negotiations. But even the
Stars have free-speech limits. When Hull joined the team last fall,
he brought the reputation of being hockey's version of Charles
Barkley, a talented man who sometimes says too much. Midway through
the season, when Hull complained to reporters about his ice time,
Hitchcock didn't have to respond.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Lites, the team president, the veterans told
Hull that such things were ``not done here'' and Hull stopped
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Currently sidelined with a hamstring strain, Hull still leads
the team in goals with 26, despite playing a more restrained system
that includes defensive responsibilities. Craig Ludwig, a Stars
defensemen, said ``Hully played a free-wheeling kind of game'' in
St. Louis before joining the Stars and ``He probably didn't expect
to have that many goals with this kind of a system.'' As for Hull's
conversational skills, Ludwig said ``He never shuts up. That's his
character. But at least he plays the way everybody else does.''
Ludwig, who turns 38 this month, is the other alternate captain.
Hitchcock calls him and other veterans his ``glue guys.'' The coach
meets with the captains and team elders about twice a month, to
discuss everybody's gripes. Belfour, the goalie, said ``I have some
input, but, basically, I leave it up to the older guys. I don't
feel like I'm one of the older guys.'' He's a mere pup of 33.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to protect Belfour's goals-against average is to
keep the puck at the other end of the ice, Hitchcock said. To
accomplish this, he encourages his defensemen to join the attack,
not off the rush but rather after the forwards take puck possession
in the other end. He learned this, Hitchcock said, when the Stars
lost to the Wings in the playoffs. ``We decided after playing
Detroit last year to stop playing scared,'' Hitchcock said. So far
this season, they are 3-0 against the Wings. Describing the style
of extended puck possession in the attack zone, Hull recently said:
``It's almost like a football game. Whoever has time of possession
longest is going to win.'' This does not go unappreciated in
football country. ``The whole game seems to fit with the Texas
personality,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars make their share of mistakes, but teammates cover up
for each other, a common trait of good teams. They are able and
willing to block shots and to hustle on the backcheck. Although
they aren't heavily penalized, the Stars know how and when to play
mean. In the opening minutes against Pittsburgh on Friday night,
Verbeek barged through two checks and then exchanged swings with
Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso and Ludwig dropped Stu Barnes with an
elbow to the head. After both served their minor penalties, Verbeek
scored to spark the Stars to a 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got slashed, I got punched,'' Verbeek explained afterward,
ice bags on each elbow, a few stitches in his upper lip. ``I
reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes are enjoyed by a fan base that is growing in hockey
sophistication in the sixth season since the team moved from
Minnesota. In some ways, the Texas culture, with oil and cattle, is
like that of Alberta, in Western Canada, where several stars come
from. Hatcher, one of several Stars from the ``Hockeytown'' suburbs
of Detroit, said ``It seems like every other person I meet is from
up north.'' Many migrated during the Rust Belt recession two
decades ago, from states round the Great Lakes. Hitchcock said the
transplanted Northerners ``are all coaching youth hockey, watching
it on TV and buying season tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's sellout was the 26th. in succession and a new, bigger
arena will open in two years. Lites said some fans used to cheer
when the team pulled its goalie for an extra attacker during a
delayed penalty, thinking it was a novel way of attacking. They
don't any more, but they do shout ``Stars!'' when it is heard in
the lyrics of the national anthem. And they cheer a film clip in
which Pee-Wee Herman sings ``The stars at night are big and
bright'' and a chorus of people in cowboy hats respond with ``Deep
in the Heart of Texas!'' Perhaps, by June, the Stars will give the
audience a great deal more about which to hoot and holler.

THE TIME ARRIVES FOR SEAVER TO MEET THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ It seemed fitting that Jason Isringhausen
was the first person Tom Seaver approached in Seaver's new,
part-time, role as an ad-hoc pitching coach with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   As Seaver had been in the late 1960s, Isringhausen, a few years
ago, was one of the organization's can't-miss kids. But because of
recurring arm troubles after an optimistic rookie season,
Isringhausen has since had little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old right-hander, who had reconstructive elbow
surgery in early 1998, has not even pitched in a game since he
threw in winter ball in 1997. Even when he was healthy,
Isringhausen's work ethic and maturity had been questioned by
people in the organization. And Isringhausen will not begin this
season with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that his talent is still there. And
so Seaver _ in a Mets uniform Monday for the first time since 1987
_ who had never seen Isringhausen before, gravitated to him almost
instantly to offer suggestions. It was as if a magnet had pulled
Seaver to Isringhausen.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, Seaver said later, he had stepped in to encourage him to
slow down. First, however, the Hall of Famer asked permission.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Seaver won 311 games in the major leagues, had 3,640
strikeouts and won three Cy Young awards. But the 54-year-old, who
will also be a team broadcaster, had said at his introductory news
conference, and he reiterated Monday, that he is not the pitching
coach. And he does not want to get in anybody's way.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Bob Apodaca, who  &UR; is &LR;  the pitching coach and who
was a teammate of Seaver's a quarter of a century ago. ``I am
asking him his advice,'' he said. ``I'd be stupid if I let my ego
get in the way. That is why he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver had a little trouble getting to practice, since he was
with the organization before it moved its spring training to Port
St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've ever been here,'' Seaver said a
little sheepishly. ``I did get lost, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, on his first day on the job, Seaver arrived at the
team's playing fields, in a golf cart, late. Once Seaver joined the
workout, Manager Bobby Valentine began to needle him
good-naturedly. ``It took about two minutes,'' Seaver said, when
asked how long it took to get comfortable again in his old No. 41.
``It was like I never left.''
</P>
<P>
   What Seaver will mostly do for the next week and a half is
observe. He admitted that he was not familiar with the Mets' staff,
and he will cram with Apodaca to get up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob knows I can help,'' Seaver said. ``I just hope I can help
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were up to Seaver, he would be merely another pitching
coach in camp. That, of course, is impossible. If Sandy Koufax _
who made a brief visit here last week _ was a distinguished
visiting professor, Seaver is like a professor emeritus, one who
has come back to his alma mater to supplement the teachings of the
department head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just feeling my way through,'' Seaver said. ``What to do,
what to say, when to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, he simply watched. When Isringhausen pitched,
Seaver struck a thinker's pose, leaning back against a fence, two
fingers from his left hand resting on his cheek. After a couple of
minutes, he stepped in to give some tips.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Seaver said that he does not think it is going to be
a problem being in the broadcast booth while serving as a part-time
coach. He sees no conflict between the two roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the interesting things about it,'' Seaver said.
``I'll be able to talk about what this individual is working on,
what he has not been able to comprehend, and why _ if the problems
are recurring _ he keeps making the same mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Seaver simply wants to get to know the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder about things like why a guy like Isringhausen would
have shoulder and elbow problems,'' Seaver said. ``And you don't
know why. His mechanics are pretty good. Very good, for that
matter. And he's got great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, will get a chance to see Seaver pitch.
Valentine had some old films of Seaver's famous delivery digitized.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show how perfect he was,'' Apodaca said.
</P>
<P>
   Apodaca was fortunate enough to witness it firsthand in the
early 1970s. But while, as a rookie reliever, Apodaca had no qualms
about approaching Jerry Koosman or Jon Matlack, things were
different with Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't talk to him unless he talked to me first,'' Apodaca
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unspoken respect for the best pitcher in the game.
And 25 years later, Apodaca is still a little bit in awe of Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing, however, that has definitely changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm 50, I can finally tell Tom Seaver to go shove
off,'' Apodaca said, suppressing a laugh.

STUDIO WINS FILM RIGHTS TO SPIDER-MAN FRANCHISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tangled web of claims over Spider-Man movie
rights ended abruptly after six years, with Sony settling the legal
issues and proclaiming it will turn the comic-book hero into a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this would happen sooner or later but I'm absolutely
delighted,'' said Stan Lee, who created the character in 1962 and
will be an executive producer on all film and television projects.
``I've waited so many years for Spider-Man to hit the big screen.
With luck, this should be one of the biggest movies ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man has long been one of Hollywood's hottest undeveloped
properties, considering the success of other comic-book characters
like Batman, Superman and Men In Black. Additionally, ``Titanic''
writer-director James Cameron wrote a treatment for a Spider-Man
movie in 1991 and agreed to direct for now-defunct Carolco, which
was sued in 1993 by Cannon Films in the first of five suits over
the project's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the 76-year-old chairman emeritus of Marvel Enterprises,
did not predict who will write, direct or star in the first
Spider-Man movie but estimated the film will hit theaters in 2001.
``I'm quite sure it's going to be put on the fast track,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, which owned video rights, resolved disputes with
comic-book publisher Marvel and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and announced a
merchandising joint venture with Marvel. ``This is a great day for
the studio,'' said John Calley, chief of Sony Pictures
Entertainment, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   MGM lost the rights to the project last week when a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge ruled that MGM's claim lapsed in 1996,
prompting the ailing studio to announce it would appeal. MGM had
argued it acquired the rights from three extinct film companies _
Cannon, Carolco and 21st Century _ but Marvel has contended the
movie options have expired.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be resolved is Marvel's dispute with Viacom Inc., which
claims it holds the TV rights to any Spider-Man movie. But Marvel,
which emerged from bankruptcy last year and combined with Toy Biz,
and Sony believe the agreement frees them to make a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spider-Man is the crown jewel of Marvel's vast character
library,'' said Eric Ellenbogen, chief executive officer, in a
statement. ``Our pact with Sony is a giant step forward in
leveraging Marvel content to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man, a high school student who gained super powers of
dexterity after being bitten by a radioactive spider, has remained
a top seller in comic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day doesn't go by that I don't get several dozen fans
asking when there's going be a Spider-Man movie,'' said Lee, from
his Los Angeles headquarters at Stan Lee Media Inc. ``I'd like to
think he's popular because of the personality we built into him, so
he makes mistakes and has his own problems. He's an everyman with a
superpower.''

 &HT;    Visitors come to endorse Bush run
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's a political courtship encouraged, welcomed
and coordinated by a noncandidate who has done nothing to indicate
he does not like the attention.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds Georgetown University political scientist Stephen
Wayne of the draft movement that led Dwight Eisenhower into his
first government job that didn't come with a uniform. To Larry
Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, it brings to
mind William McKinley's successful ``front-porch campaign'' of
1896.
</P>
<P>
   Without declaring his candidacy, without getting out much, Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential pre-campaign has amassed key support.
And today in a move that will allow him to begin raising money for
the effort, Bush is expected to announce formation of a
presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, political leaders from North and South Carolina and
Connecticut became the latest to enjoy a private lunch date with
Bush at the Governor's Mansion and then offer a public proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he best represents the ideals and values of South
Carolinians,'' South Carolina House Speaker David Wilkins said
after lunch. ``We believe he is the best candidate, the best man
for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to play it close to the vest. ``Something will be
happening very soon,'' he teased.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Bush aide Mindy Tucker confirmed that Jack Oliver
of Missouri, a key GOP fund-raiser, has been helping Bush test the
presidential waters. Oliver could wind up as Bush's campaign
finance director.
</P>
<P>
   The almost-daily parade to Austin of political leaders from
around the country indicates Bush is not discouraging anyone from
dropping by for a bite of lunch behind closed doors and a bite of
sound in front of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're not the first guys who've been here,'' Connecticut
GOP Chairman Chris DiPino said facetiously as he left the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar nature of the Bush campaign has drawn attention
nationwide and taken on the feel of a nominating convention as
delegations make their feelings known. ``The home state of
Elizabeth Dole, we are proud to be here to give our commitment . .
. to Governor Bush that if he runs for the Republican nomination
for president we will support him,'' said David Miner, a North
Carolina state representative who brought a letter signed by 38 of
the 54 Republicans in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolinians want Dole, who has not announced her
candidacy, as Bush's running mate. Miner said Bush is a stronger
presidential contender because Dole has never sought elected
office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to picking up support from Dole's native state, Bush
picked up some from his own. Ninety percent of the Republican state
lawmakers in Connecticut, where Bush was born, signed a letter
delivered at Monday's lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my colleagues in the House could have listened to him
today, they would know if he campaigned through the Northeast he
will do as well as he did here in the state of Texas,'' said Robert
Ward, Republican leader of the Connecticut House.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and the other visitors said they were not lured here by
Bush operatives. The Connecticut delegation thought a trip to
Austin would be a good idea after reading about other delegations
that have made the trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't want to visit a lovely city like Austin?'' asked
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, South Carolina's House speaker, who brought a letter
signed by 59 of the 66 Republicans in his chamber, said, ``I wasn't
asked to come. I asked if I could come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, they are spontaneous,'' Bush said of
the lunch meetings, adding that his staff has helped schedule the
meetings and that his political money is paying for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Spontaneous? Maybe. Productive? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato, the Virginia political science professor, said there
hasn't been an effort like this one since Republican McKinley's
front-porch campaign in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to out-talk legendary orator William Jennings
Bryan, McKinley, drafted for the GOP nomination, stayed home in
Canton, Ohio, and chatted with delegations that came to him.
</P>
<P>
   While he stayed home, party operatives advanced his campaign
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be the closest thing to what's going on here,'' said
Sabato, ``assuming the leaders of the Republican Party can get the
rank and file to go along.''
</P>
<P>
   For McKinley, it worked out well, for awhile. He was elected in
1896 and re-elected in 1900. In 1901, McKinley was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne, the Georgetown professor, said the Bush noncampaign
reminds him of the 1952 draft movement that turned Gen. Eisenhower
into a general election winner. Though historians believe he really
wanted the job, Eisenhower remained publicly indifferent as the
draft movement heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne says the evidence indicates the Bush strategy is right on
target, so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason to declare early is to raise money and get
endorsements,'' Wayne said. ``It looks like he has the endorsements
now, and he is not going to have any problem raising the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said the don't-leave-home campaign has gone so well that
Bush might want to take it one step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he should do what Clinton did in '96,'' Sabato said.
``He never formally announced for president.''
</P>

STING OPERATION LED TO ARREST OF CHINESE SEEKING GYROSCOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Massachusetts manufacturer of precision gyroscopes
helped set up a federal sting leading to the arrest of Chinese
operatives accused of trying to smuggle military technology to
China, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Yi, a Chinese citizen who allegedly tried to buy
sophisticated fiber-optic gyroscopes from the company, was arrested
in San Diego last week as he re-entered the country. He is being
brought to Boston by federal marshalls and will be charged under
arms export laws, officials said Monday. Another man, Collin Shu,
was charged in the scheme Feb. 11 in Boston after undercover
federal agents videotaped a meeting in which he allegedly said
China needed the gyroscopes for missile guidance systems and
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, some Washington officials believe that a concerted
effort is under way to smuggle US military technology to China to
improve its weapons systems. Last week the Pentagon issued a
detailed report to Congress on China's buildup of tactical missles.
The report said China still may be decades away from developing
technically superior missle systems. But it also said
less-sophisticated cruise and ballistic missiles ``will give
Beijing the `credible intimidation' it needs to accomplish
political and military goals without having to rely on overwhelming
force on force superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope matter came to light after the Massachusetts
manufacturer became suspicious of efforts by Yao and Shu to
purchase ``tactical grade'' systems that can be used for missle
guidance, according to the criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint did not name the company, but officials familiar
with the case identified the firm as Fibersense Technology Corp. of
Canton, one of a handful of contractors nationwide making the
gyroscopes. Fibersense would neither confirm nor deny that the
company was involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't comment one way or another about anything having to
do with that case,'' said Mike Perlmutter, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, a Massachusetts company began
receiving orders from Yao and Shu in late 1997. One was on behalf
of Northern Jiaotong University in Beijing and claimed the parts
would be used for a ``super speed train navigation system.''
Another order was for Changsha Rail University in Hunan.
</P>
<P>
   An officer of the company told Yao such purchases required
special permission from the State Department because the gyroscopes
are on a government list of munitions technology that cannot be
exported without a license. Exporting items on that list to certain
countries, including China, is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The company, at Yao's request, filed applications with the State
Department in May 1998 seeking clearance to sell the gyroscopes.
Both requests were immediately denied.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 6 the Massachusetts company received written orders
for the same kind of gyroscopes requested by Yao from a man who
identified himself as Winston Wang of Micro Techland, which he said
was a Montreal company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Massachusetts company became suspicious because
none of them ``had ever heard of Micro Techland or Winston Wang,''
according to the complaint. Further, the order contained specific
prices and technical information a new customer would have no way
of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing director at the Massachusetts company told
investigators he also spoke by phone to someone with an Asian
accent claiming to be a Micro Techland official who said he was
placing the order ``for another company.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts company alerted US Customs officials, who then
set up a fake export firm. Undercover agents told Yao the company
would operate as a middleman in order to get around US export laws.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as officials from the export company, customs agents
recorded a series of phone conversations with Yao and Shu about the
illegality of the transaction and the fact the gyroscopes were
ultimately bound for China, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to transcripts contained in the
complaint, Shu asked whether he could also obtain infrared sensors,
which are needed in some navigational devices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts company played a role in the sting,
taking phone calls from Yao and Shu as the pair apparently tried to
haggle over the price of the gyroscopes, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the dummy company dragged on for months. In
December 1998, Yao became impatient. He e-mailed the Massachusetts
company directly to say ``we are in eager need of'' the gyroscopes
and that money could be wired directly to the company's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Shu reached an agreement with the dummy export
company. He wired a portion of the $70,000 order to an account at
BankBoston, the complaint said. Shu was arrested last month after
attempting to pick up the gyroscopes.

BRUINS TRY TO IGNORE SEEDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Selection Sunday looming and a desert road
trip remaining, UCLA stands on the brink of seeding satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Strong finishes are essential to gaining a high seed, and the
Bruins (21-7, 11-5) have won six of their past eight. Their current
power ratings _ 20th in Sagarin, 15th in the Ratings Percentage
Index _ suggest either a No. 4 or No. 5 seed, with the potential to
rise or fall based on their performance at Arizona State and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NCAA Tournament selection committee uses an
undisclosed ratings formula and considers other factors _ some
subjective, some not _ the RPI and Sagarin rankings are usually an
accurate gauge of what to expect on Selection Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a sweep in the desert probably would solidify a No. 4
seed for the Bruins and possibly push them to a No. 3. If they get
swept, however, they'll likely be a No. 5 or 6 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, they're trying not to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put too much energy into what seed and what region, you
can carry with you a feeling of disappointment,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, UCLA won the Pacific-10 title by three games
and expected a spot in the West. Instead it was shipped to
Indianapolis to play Princeton and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That threw us for a loop,'' Lavin said. ``No one expected
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine from the line: UCLA shot 69 percent from the foul line
against Washington _ its best performance since shooting 81 percent
against Cal State Northridge on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep shooting them (in practice), and we're not talking
about it a lot,'' Lavin said. ``When you talk about it, it becomes
an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Baron Davis was the most improved last week, hitting 10 of
13 to raise his season percentage to 61.2.
</P>
<P>
   The Farnham factor: Walk-on junior Sean Farnham started his
fourth consecutive game Saturday and continued his inspired play.
When asked what he'd have thought three months ago if told Farnham
would be a starter down the stretch, Lavin smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have guessed it had more to do with discipline: Six
guys late for the bus, or seven guys missed practice,'' he said.
``I wouldn't have guessed it would have come about by his
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Forward JaRon Rush had 21 rebounds against the
Washington schools, raising his average to 8.0 in Pac-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made 8 of 21 shots from 3-point range against
Washington State and 1 of 13 against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six games, UCLA has held its opponents to 39.3
percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins defeated the Washington schools by 56 points _ their
largest victory margin in a conference weekend in 21 years.

SURVIVING A BLAST FROM PAST

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ David Carey Jr. was asleep when one of his roommates
took the cartridge clip out of a 9mm pistol and began waving it
around. The shrieks of laughter coming from beyond his bedroom door
didn't wake him.
</P>
<P>
   A weary 19-year-old sleeps with all his weight.
</P>
<P>
   That night 10 years ago, Carey descended into his favorite
dream, the one in which he went from playing baseball for
Scottsdale Community College, to a major university, to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   The merrymakers on the other side of the wall were having too
much fun to remember the bullet left in the pistol's chamber, at
least until the gun went off.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The slug ripped through the door of his room and struck him in
the middle of the back, riding the rail of his spine all the way to
his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. on March 7, 1989, the dreamer awoke _ paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on it, now,'' he says. ``Mostly because I know
there's nothing I can do to change what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   I first heard about the shooting from one of Carey's teammates.
It was a few months after the accident by then. Carey was in a
rehabilitation center, unable to move his arms or legs and still
with a metal ``halo'' screwed into his skull, its braces keeping
his back straight.
</P>
<P>
   His father was in town from Florida, his mother and sisters from
Texas. The whole family was devastated. &QL; 
TIME REVEALS ERROR &QL; 
I hung around just long enough to produce a
senseless-act-of-violence- &QL; 
shatters-once-beautiful-dream article, figuring Carey's life as a
quadriplegic would be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fact, I could disguise my arrogance and
journalistic sloppiness by calling today's story a ``follow-up.''
But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   It's a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing fine,'' David Carey says. He works for the state
Department of Administration helping people who need assistance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act. He also works with
Arizona Bridge to Independent Living, visiting those who've
suffered injuries like his own.
</P>
<P>
   After getting out of the hospital, Carey returned to Scottsdale
Community College, then went on to Arizona State University, from
which he graduated with a physical education degree.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, he'll be one of four people honored at the 6th
Annual Gene Autry Courage Awards Banquet, which recognizes athletes
who've overcome disabilities and hardship. &QL; 
`I'VE MOVED ON' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's uncomfortable with those wanting to replace the metal brace
once screwed into his head with an actual halo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people every day who must overcome obstacles,'' he said.
``Poor people. Sick people. Life is making the best of what you
have and moving forward. That's all I'm trying to do.''
</P>

SURVIVING A BLAST FROM PAST

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ David Carey Jr. was asleep when one of his roommates
took the cartridge clip out of a 9mm pistol and began waving it
around. The shrieks of laughter coming from beyond his bedroom door
didn't wake him.
</P>
<P>
   A weary 19-year-old sleeps with all his weight.
</P>
<P>
   That night 10 years ago, Carey descended into his favorite
dream, the one in which he went from playing baseball for
Scottsdale Community College, to a major university, to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   The merrymakers on the other side of the wall were having too
much fun to remember the bullet left in the pistol's chamber, at
least until the gun went off.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The slug ripped through the door of his room and struck him in
the middle of the back, riding the rail of his spine all the way to
his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. on March 7, 1989, the dreamer awoke _ paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on it, now,'' he says. ``Mostly because I know
there's nothing I can do to change what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   I first heard about the shooting from one of Carey's teammates.
It was a few months after the accident by then. Carey was in a
rehabilitation center, unable to move his arms or legs and still
with a metal ``halo'' screwed into his skull, its braces keeping
his back straight.
</P>
<P>
   His father was in town from Florida, his mother and sisters from
Texas. The whole family was devastated. &QL; 
TIME REVEALS ERROR &QL; 
I hung around just long enough to produce a
senseless-act-of-violence- &QL; 
shatters-once-beautiful-dream article, figuring Carey's life as a
quadriplegic would be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fact, I could disguise my arrogance and
journalistic sloppiness by calling today's story a ``follow-up.''
But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   It's a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing fine,'' David Carey says. He works for the state
Department of Administration helping people who need assistance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act. He also works with
Arizona Bridge to Independent Living, visiting those who've
suffered injuries like his own.
</P>
<P>
   After getting out of the hospital, Carey returned to Scottsdale
Community College, then went on to Arizona State University, from
which he graduated with a physical education degree.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, he'll be one of four people honored at the 6th
Annual Gene Autry Courage Awards Banquet, which recognizes athletes
who've overcome disabilities and hardship. &QL; 
`I'VE MOVED ON' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't see what the big deal is,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's uncomfortable with those wanting to replace the metal brace
once screwed into his head with an actual halo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people every day who must overcome obstacles,'' he said.
``Poor people. Sick people. Life is making the best of what you
have and moving forward. That's all I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He still likes sports, at least watching them, but sees his life
going in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved on,'' he says. ``Some things are not meant to be,
which doesn't have to be bad. Not everybody is supposed to be an
athlete or a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in an apartment with his father, who moved here after
the accident. His mother and sisters live just down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky enough to have a lot of support during a tough
time,'' he said. ``I realized there are people who want me around,
no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   How else have you changed in 10 years? he's asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more aware of things now,'' he says. ``I'm a better
person. Once you lose something you took for granted, it gives you
a perspective on life that you didn't have before. You appreciate
the small things around you. I do. And I still feel I have a lot to

STING OPERATION LED TO ARREST OF CHINESE SEEKING GYROSCOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Massachusetts manufacturer of precision gyroscopes
helped set up a federal sting leading to the arrest of Chinese
operatives accused of trying to smuggle military technology to
China, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Yi, a Chinese citizen who allegedly tried to buy
sophisticated fiber-optic gyroscopes from the company, was arrested
in San Diego last week as he re-entered the country. He is being
brought to Boston by federal marshalls and will be charged under
arms export laws, officials said Monday. Another man, Collin Shu,
was charged in the scheme Feb. 11 in Boston after undercover
federal agents videotaped a meeting in which he allegedly said
China needed the gyroscopes for missile guidance systems and
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, some Washington officials believe that a concerted
effort is under way to smuggle US military technology to China to
improve its weapons systems. Last week the Pentagon issued a
detailed report to Congress on China's buildup of tactical missles.
The report said China still may be decades away from developing
technically superior missle systems. But it also said
less-sophisticated cruise and ballistic missiles ``will give
Beijing the `credible intimidation' it needs to accomplish
political and military goals without having to rely on overwhelming
force on force superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope matter came to light after the Massachusetts
manufacturer became suspicious of efforts by Yao and Shu to
purchase ``tactical grade'' systems that can be used for missle
guidance, according to the criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint did not name the company, but officials familiar
with the case identified the firm as Fibersense Technology Corp. of
Canton, one of a handful of contractors nationwide making the
gyroscopes. Fibersense would neither confirm nor deny that the
company was involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't comment one way or another about anything having to
do with that case,'' said Mike Perlmutter, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, a Massachusetts company began
receiving orders from Yao and Shu in late 1997. One was on behalf
of Northern Jiaotong University in Beijing and claimed the parts
would be used for a ``super speed train navigation system.''
Another order was for Changsha Rail University in Hunan.
</P>
<P>
   An officer of the company told Yao such purchases required
special permission from the State Department because the gyroscopes
are on a government list of munitions technology that cannot be
exported without a license. Exporting items on that list to certain
countries, including China, is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The company, at Yao's request, filed applications with the State
Department in May 1998 seeking clearance to sell the gyroscopes.
Both requests were immediately denied.
</P>
<P>
   Last August 6 the Massachusetts company received written orders
for the same kind of gyroscopes requested by Yao from a man who
identified himself as Winston Wang of Micro Techland, which he said
was a Montreal company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Massachusetts company became suspicious because
none of them ``had ever heard of Micro Techland or Winston Wang,''
according to the complaint. Further, the order contained specific
prices and technical information a new customer would have no way
of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing director at the Massachusetts company told
investigators he also spoke by phone to someone with an Asian
accent claiming to be a Micro Techland official who said he was
placing the order ``for another company.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts company alerted US Customs officials, who then
set up a fake export firm. Undercover agents told Yao the company
would operate as a middleman in order to get around US export laws.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as officials from the export company, customs agents
recorded a series of phone conversations with Yao and Shu about the
illegality of the transaction and the fact the gyroscopes were
ultimately bound for China, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, according to transcripts contained in the
complaint, Shu asked whether he could also obtain infrared sensors,
which are needed in some navigational devices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts company played a role in the sting,
taking phone calls from Yao and Shu as the pair apparently tried to
haggle over the price of the gyroscopes, according to the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the dummy company dragged on for months. In
December 1998, Yao became impatient. He e-mailed the Massachusetts
company directly to say ``we are in eager need of'' the gyroscopes
and that money could be wired directly to the company's bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Shu reached an agreement with the dummy export
company. He wired a portion of the $70,000 order to an account at
BankBoston, the complaint said. Shu was arrested last month after
attempting to pick up the gyroscopes.

$9.50 MOVIE TICKETS? VALLONE URGES A POPCORN PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, asked New Yorkers
Monday to stage a one-day boycott of movie theaters on Friday as an
expression of anger over ticket prices that were raised to $9.50
last week at some Manhattan theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``An absolute outrage,'' Vallone said Monday afternoon. ``It's
unfair. It's a mugging of the middle class. Do something else on
Friday. Anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The $9.50 movie ticket, the highest in the nation, was
introduced on Friday at Loews, Cineplex Odeon and Sony Theaters in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said he hoped that prices approaching $10 would stir
Manhattan moviegoers to action. But both he and Ed Koch, the former
mayor, acknowledged that an attempt by Koch to organize a boycott
bombed badly in 1988, when ticket prices rose to $7 from $6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would picket as long as one person was behind me,''
Koch said Monday. ``I looked behind me when I got to the theaters;
nobody was there. So I bought a ticket and saw the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise in ticket prices was defended by Lawrence Ruisi,
president and chief executive of Loew's Cineplex Entertainment
Inc., who said the ticket prices were raised to keep pace with
increasing operating costs. ``Mr. Vallone may be forgetting that we
don't keep all the revenue,'' Ruisi said. ``Half of it goes to the
Hollywood distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices were raised at the chain's 425 theaters in 22
states and Canada. Prices increased to $8.50 from $8 in Chicago,
and to $7.75 from $7 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a movie ticket nationwide was $4.75 in 1997,
the latest year available, said David Lamb, an independent
financial analyst for the movie-theater industry. Movie theaters
have thin profits in general, Lamb said. ``You make it on the
popcorn, and the tickets, but the margins have always been slim,''
he said.

WHEN in doubt, talk about the RPI and act like you know what it
means.
</P>
<P>
   Put your hand on your chin, raise one eyebrow professorially,
nod your head a lot, and talk about the Ratings Percentage Index.
</P>
<P>
   Say things like, ``You know, Factor One in the RPI is weighted
25 percent, and it's based on a team's winning percentage. Factor
Two is strength of schedule, and it's weighted 50 percent. Factor
Three is a team's opponents' strength of schedule against Division
I teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the important if unofficial Factor Four _ quality
losses. Mention the College of Charleston a lot _ predict a No. 4
seed for the COC based on their S.O.S. (strength of schedule).
</P>
<P>
   Mention the Big Ten, Big East and Southeastern Conference as
big-timers. Talk about Stanford, UConn and Auburn as potential
threats. Talk about ``site-neutral wins,'' the ``mid-major
conferences'' _ the Missouri Valley and the Ohio Valley _ and how
they figure to make quite a splash in the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   You'll surely wow the casual college basketball fan and impress
those bracket-happy faithful who rear their heads around the water
coolers, like tax accountants, usually only in March.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to act like you really know everything there is to
know about the soon-to-be-released 1999 NCAA Tournament bracket,
these are the things you should say and do.
</P>
<P>
   But if you really want to know what the madness will be all
about this March, know this: This week's conference tournament
games might offer more intrigue, entertainment and suspense than
the NCAA Tournament once the bracket is set Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This year, filling in the NCAA blanks will be fun. But
ultimately, the answer is Duke.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say Duke's unprecedented Atlantic Coast Conference
sweep is misleading because the conference allegedly is down, we
have only one thing to say. Humbug.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't you been paying attention the past 80 years? The ACC
always has been one of the best basketball conferences in America,
and nothing changed this year except the greatness of the team that
won it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we arrive at conference-tournament week and the brink of
the NCAAs not knowing exactly which teams will offer thrills and
last-second chills for the next month but certain it will be the
Blue Devils left dancing on the floor of Tropicana Field when all
is done.
</P>
<P>
   Hate to burst your bubble teams. Hate to put a damper on Dick
Vitale's diaper dandies. Certainly, we should all diligently fill
out the office pools and tune in for the madness, which never fails
to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the suspense will be in the journey, not the
outcome. And maybe the best part of that journey, certainly the
most unpredictable, begins now.
</P>
<P>
   The case could be made that except for Duke's dominance, this
has been the most balanced, most unpredictable year in college
basketball in recent memory. Which is why, outside the ACC,
conference tournaments might be at their best, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 teams enter conference tournaments with the dream of
making it into the March mayhem. Except for the bottom 100 or so of
those teams, there is legitimate hope of racking up enough upsets
to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than the Big 12 or Western Athletic Conference
for evidence that anything could happen this week. Texas is the
team to beat in the Big 12, but with the league certainly balanced
at the top and the tourney in Kansas City, the likes of Missouri
and Kansas must be feared.
</P>
<P>
   In the WAC, Utah looks like it could cruise in, but New Mexico,
Tulsa, Nevada-Las Vegas and Rice are playing at their best.
</P>
<P>
   At conference tournaments everywhere from Richmond, Va.
(Mid-Eastern), to Shreveport, La. (Southland), to Ogden, Utah (Big
Sky), hope will spring eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous questions will have to be answered. Can New Mexico, a
team in the Top 25 most of the season despite a low RPI ranking, be
invited to the NCAAs if it doesn't win the WAC tournament? Is
Auburn, at the top of the tough SEC, the real deal? Will the
talented Cincinnati Bearcats, whose four losses all came in
Conference USA play, survive the likes of Alabama-Birmingham,
Louisville and DePaul?
</P>
<P>
   Can quality Big Ten teams Minnesota, Purdue and Northwestern
advance far enough in their tournament to give their league a sixth
and maybe even a seventh NCAA Tournament team? Can upstart Miami
hustle to the Big East conference title and maybe earn a No. 1 or
No. 2 seed?
</P>
<P>
   Can bubble teams like Nebraska (Big 12), Wake Forest (ACC),
Rhode Island (Atlantic 10) and Ole Miss (SEC) impress enough to
land a bid? Can Western Kentucky, which carries a losing record
(13-15) into today's Sun Belt final against Arkansas State, pull
out the unlikely bid?
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to it all. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, we know what will happen in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
the Final Four host city that once was known as ``God's waiting
room'' because of its attraction to retirees. This year, in an
interesting twist, it will be the Devils' waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean it won't be fun getting there.

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A disturbing pattern is developing in the Clinton
administration's relationship with China. The more Washington seeks
to broaden its agenda with Beijing, the more harshly China treats
its democrats and dissidents. In the face of a new wave of
political repression in China, President Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright must do more than repeat stale complaints
and then change the subject to trade. Americans will not support a
policy of engagement and improved relations with China if the price
is American inaction on human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Albright traveled to China this week just days after the State
Department published a withering report on repression in China. It
found that in 1998 Chinese leaders broke their promises to respect
international human rights conventions, held thousands of political
critics and religious activists in prison, tortured detainees and
tightened restrictions on the press. Beijing has been using long
prison sentences to crush the formation of independent political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Albright talked bluntly about the dismal record in her meetings
with Chinese officials Monday, as she has done before. That seemed
sufficient when China's conduct was improving, but as President
Jiang Zemin has tightened controls on political expression in
recent months, the American criticism has seemed increasingly
hollow and ineffectual. Albright's words were further muffled by
the primary purpose of her visit, which was to advance the
administration's policy of building diplomatic links with China,
specifically by advancing Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization and preparing for a smooth visit to Washington next
month by China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Washington can act more forcefully on human rights by sponsoring
a new United Nations resolution on Chinese abuses in Geneva later
this month. Last year, for the first time since 1991, the United
States did not support a resolution condemning China before the
U.N. human rights commission in Geneva. The administration hoped
that this gesture would encourage Beijing to ease political
repression. American silence on the issue this year would be
unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and his fellow communist leaders fear social unrest. As
economic growth has diminished because of Asia's financial crisis
and Beijing's own incomplete economic reforms, political protests
have spread and the government has tried to intimidate those who
favor greater freedom and democracy. But as Clinton noted last
week, sooner or later China will have to realize that it ``cannot
purchase stability at the expense of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If the repression grows worse in the weeks ahead, the
administration may have to reconsider its commitment not to link
China's admission to the WTO to its human rights performance. For
now, the membership decision will depend on Beijing's willingness
to lower tariffs to international standards. Concerned that too
rapid an exposure to free trade will increase Chinese unemployment
and unrest, Beijing wants an extended transition period. Some
accommodation is reasonable. But the point of admitting China into
the WTO is to bring it more fully under the rules of the
international trading system. Excessively watering down those rules
to have an agreement ready in time for Zhu's visit to Washington
would be a mistake.

   SUN CITY, Ariz. _ (STORY ALSO MOVING IN ``A'' CATEGORY) Lorraine
DeJongh says it was love, not money, that led her to marry a
wealthy 99-year-old retired naval commander.
</P>
<P>
   And now a judge has paved the way for the 38-year-old caregiver
and her legally blind, wheelchair-using groom to cruise off into
the sunset together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sent here to do a job, which I did well, and the media
criticized me for falling in love,'' DeJongh said Monday after a
judge dismissed a petition for guardianship of her husband, Edward
Gamble, by his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   In the petition, Gary Gamble alleged his grandfather was
incapacitated and that the elderly man's estate of nearly $1
million was in jeopardy of being exploited by DeJongh.
</P>
<P>
   But the grandson agreed to drop the case and walk away with only
$17,779 after a psychological evaluation showed the elder Gamble to
be a ``fond spouse'' and competent to make financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, my client did have to pay his grandson off in order
to get his grandson to leave him alone,'' said Edward Gamble's
attorney, Alisa Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's settlement ends the final challenge to the
made-for-tabloids marriage that provided red-hot fodder for radio
talk shows, with hosts and callers alike questioning DeJongh's
motives for marrying a wealthy, ailing man more than 60 years her
senior less than two weeks after divorcing another Phoenix-area
man.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria Justice of the Peace Lex Anderson refused to marry the
couple Dec. 31 because he didn't believe Edward Gamble to be
mentally competent. The couple turned to Glendale Justice of the
Peace Quentin Tolby, who married the couple less than an hour later
after asking Gamble a series of questions to test his mental
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Attorney's Office then began looking into
the marriage, and concluded last month it is legal.
</P>
<P>
   DeJongh declined to comment further, other than to say she was
surprised by the media frenzy over her marriage. Edward Gamble also
declined comment, saying he is angry with the media coverage of his
marriage, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's completely surprised that his decisions have caused such
an uproar,'' Gray said. ``He feels that he is completely in control
of his faculties, and he just likes to be married. He is in love
with Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone assumes she's a gold digger and everyone assumes he
is out of his mind. That's been very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jan. 29 psychological evaluation said Edward Gamble was
thinking of DeJongh's honor when the couple tied the knot New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gamble stated that he married her because she's fun to be
with, and they wed for companionship and affection, not for sex,''
said the report by a court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Pamela
Wilson of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that if a man wants to `cuddle' with a woman, they
ought to be married, and is aware it's not really something you can
expect of paid caregivers,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the age difference and the fact DeJongh has been
married four times, Edward Gamble said ``he feels he's found the
perfect arrangement _ a woman who will provide the supportive care
he now requires, whom he finds enjoyable, attractive, and a good
cook, and who seemingly reciprocates his affection and interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report called the groom ``feisty with a keen, dry sense of
humor'' and even commented on the couple's ``practical yet playful
style of interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had her give him a few `smooches,' and winking at me after
she left, he said, `That was just for show!' '' Wilson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Gamble also said he decided to revoke his trust _
which gave Gary Gamble power of attorney over his estate _ not
because of pressure by DeJongh but out of ``increasing discomfort
with the way his grandson was handling his finances,'' the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gamble, who lives in Alabama, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Paul Blunt, hired by Gary Gamble to investigate
the matter, said that the younger Gamble ``was just trying to
protect his grandfather, and unfortunately his grandfather doesn't
see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty well resigned to the fact his grandfather has
decided to favor someone else, despite what he's done for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation and psychological evaluation led the grandson
to drop his petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that it was best at this point to reach some
sort of an accommodation,'' Blunt said. ``We could argue the merit
of his (Edward Gamble's) decision, the morality of his decision.
That's not our place.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Gamble has two other grandchildren but hasn't had a
meaningful relationship with them, Blunt said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the settlement signed Monday by Maricopa County
Superior Court Commissioner Gary Donahoe, Gary Gamble was allowed
to retain $17,779 he distributed to himself from his grandfather's
trust, and Blunt was allowed to keep $12,000. The grandson also
agreed to turn over the warranty deed to Edward Gamble's Sun City
home.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a third-party trustee, Colonial Trust, was appointed to
oversee Gamble's estate, which, according to court records, is
worth $934,000.
</P>
<P>
   The couple now apparently plan to continue Edward Gamble's
favorite pastime _ taking cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gamble and DeJongh took a 59-day, $60,000 South
American cruise during which the captain performed a ``mock
marriage,'' complete with a celebration, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's genuinely fond of him. He definitely is fond of her,''
Gray said. &QL;

EDTORIAL: RACIAL ATTITUDES IN NEW JERSEY'S STATE POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, did the right thing in
dismissing Col. Carl Williams as superintendent of the state police
because of comments he made in an interview with The Star-Ledger of
Newark. Williams had asserted that certain crimes were associated
with certain races, and he specifically linked minorities with drug
trafficking. His remarks betrayed pernicious racial stereotyping
that cannot be allowed to guide a police force that must deal
fairly with all members of a diverse society.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the comments provided new insight into the
possibility that racial profiling, or the tendency to stop drivers
of certain races and skin colors as potential lawbreakers, may be
deeply rooted in the police agency. Although Williams insisted in
the Star-Ledger interview that racial profiling would not be
condoned, his comments associating crimes with particular racial
groups sent the opposite message. Coming from a 35-year veteran who
rose through the ranks to lead the 2,700-member force, the remarks
suggested that such attitudes may be endemic. In appointing a
successor to Williams, Whitman needs to find one who will make a
personal commitment to root out all traces of racial stereotyping
in the state police and eliminate all individuals in command
positions who harbor such attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, minority communities have complained that New Jersey
troopers target black and Hispanic drivers for unwarranted stops
and searches in trying to make drug arrests. The charges, though
denied by police officials, are the subject of multiple
investigations. A grand jury is looking into an incident in which
troopers fired on four unarmed minority men who were traveling in a
van to a basketball clinic last April, and both the state attorney
general's office and the federal Department of Justice's civil
rights division are investigating race-based traffic stops in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a Gloucester County judge ruled that state troopers
used illegal profiling along the southern end of the New Jersey
Turnpike. Evidence in that case showed that while 13.5 percent of
the motorists on that stretch of highway were black, 46 percent of
those stopped by the police were black. More recent data collected
by The Star-Ledger found that in the first two months of 1997,
fully 75 percent of the motorists arrested on the turnpike were
minorities. Several former and current troopers have filed lawsuits
charging racial discrimination in the agency and alleging that
racial profiling is encouraged as a way to get arrest numbers up.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the situation has prompted some minority leaders to
criticize Attorney General Peter Verniero, who has recently been
nominated by Whitman to the state supreme court, for failing to act
forcefully on the matter. Whitman can help ease tensions by making
sure her next choice for superintendent takes all steps required to
restore public confidence in a police force whose fair-mindedness
is under challenge.

ON CALL WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 7)  
 (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to avoid becoming a traffic statistic, according to
Charles F. Richmond of the Connecticut Department of
Transportation, is to check your tires before a trip. All five.
</P>
<P>
   If you bought your car used, you may have a spare with a leak or
without air, or a doughnut spare that does not match your wheel. Or
no spare at all. Richmond, who works for a highway-safety program,
spends seven hours a day on the road five days a week, along the
stretch of I-95 between Norwalk and Bridgeport. And tire problems
rank first among the difficulties he sees.
</P>
<P>
   Driving with underinflated tires is a big cause of flats, he
says, because they get damaged and blow out, particularly in summer
when they get hot. Then a defective or nonexistent spare turns what
might be a 20-minute delay into a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond, who looks like a smiling Brian Dennehy, wears a
reflective vest and a Day-Glo orange cap and drives a heavy
custom-designed yellow truck that tows a long device to protect it
in rear-end crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But he still pulls into the breakdown lane warily, rooftop
flashers alight. Despite all, he fears being a pedestrian on a
turnpike. The impact absorber in back has saved him and the truck
once already.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekday afternoon shift I spent with Richmond, on
Feb. 11, we did not encounter a major crash _ only a minor one. But
he uttered an anxious ``Uh-oh, that's dangerous'' when he heard a
report to a colleague: ``Pedestrian on median strip, Exit 41.'' In
that area, the median is lined by concrete walls called Jersey
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   At the garage in Milford at the end of the shift, we met the
colleague, David Rodriguez. ``I thought he was dead, for sure,''
Rodriguez said, referring to the motorist. ``He got a flat on the
left rear, and he did everything OK. He pulled into the center
breakdown lane, as tight as he could, and while he was changing the
tire, some guy who wasn't paying attention hit his rear end and
there were five cars in it before it was over. The car shoved the
guy against the Jersey barrier. But he was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The program Richmond and his colleagues work for is called Champ
_ Connecticut Highway Assistance Motorist Patrol. It began in April
1996 as part of a joint state-federal program to keep traffic
flowing on a 56-mile stretch of I-95 _ between the New York state
line and the exit for Branford, just east of New Haven _ that
carries 115,000 vehicles daily. Richmond sees his first job as
safety, but since that means clearing disabled cars, he also
eliminates lane blockages and rubbernecking, which slow traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy trucks are labeled ``Service Patrol,'' and the people
on patrol can talk to one another or headquarters in Bridgeport. At
headquarters, shared with State Police Troop G, 30 television
monitors display views provided by 91 cameras along the turnpike
and in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond is a devotee of the cell phone. ``It has saved more
lives than the ambulances,'' he says. He urges those who drive a
lot to carry one. There is no charge for dialing 911; this number,
by federal law, can be dialed even when other service has been cut
off for nonpayment. And passing drivers can report accidents and
breakdowns they spot.
</P>
<P>
   If a tire goes flat on limited-access highways like Interstates,
Richmond says, get as far as possible from the traffic flow. ``Your
tire's shot anyway,'' he said. ``One in 30 can be repaired. So you
might as well drive on it to an exit if one is near. If you get
only to the breakdown lane, all it takes is one sleepy driver and
you've lost your whole car.''
</P>
<P>
   If the car has failed mechanically and will not move, Richmond
says, drivers who cannot call for help should hang a ``Get Help''
or ``Call Police'' sign in the window facing traffic. Then they
should stay inside the car with seat belts fastened. Passing cars
with cell phones will report the problem. He wishes that more road
atlases and maps would have a sheet printed with a ``Help''
message.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richmond said that 50 percent of the mechanical problem he sees
are caused by broken timing belts. These belts, which keep the
valves opening in proper synchronization, essential to an engine's
operation, should be replaced after 60,000 to 70,000 miles, he
said, but many drivers have not read their owner's manual closely
enough to know this.
</P>
<P>
   On the shift I monitored, Richmond changed a right front tire
for a young couple in a small car. They had pulled up, but were
still inside when we arrived. Richmond used his heavy jack to raise
the car, lifted the spare on and, naturally, had to pump it up with
an air tank he fetched from the truck.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they were headed to the next exit anyway and
would stop to buy a tire. Richmond was dubious. He called
headquarters: ``Problem 9, Solution 9,'' he reported, meaning
``flat tire'' and ``changed tire.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Bridgeport headquarters, these numerical reports are
collated. According to the January statistics for these 56 miles of
I-95, plus pieces of feeder highway, four trucks working two
daytime shifts took a total of 73 hours 27 minutes to deal with
problems. Of this, almost 21 hours was for 95 flat tires. Although
mechanical trouble led the listing _ 114 out of 545 incidents _
this took only 16 hours 51 minutes. The patrol seldom fixes engine
problems, and usually just gets the vehicle off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Unoccupied vehicles accounted for 100 reports, but these took
only three hours because the patrols simply leave cards saying
``Sorry We Missed You.'' The police later put a red sticker on the
side-view mirror, and the car will be towed if not removed
promptly; the owners pay for the towing and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant problems on the log are ``out of gas,'' 47
reports; accident, 41; disabled vehicle or debris in the road, 37
reports each. The patrol carries enough gas to enable a car to get
off to a filling station. In crashes, it calls the police and tries
to get all the movable cars off the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the way it used to be, that nothing should be
moved,'' he said. ``We need to clear the way and get traffic moving
before other crashes. Drivers can exchange information at the
bottom of the ramp just as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Disabled cars are pushed off. Debris is removed with a crane on
the truck; gas and oil slicks can be blotted up. The truck carries
water for radiators, jumpers for batteries.
</P>
<P>
   A real bane, Richmond said, is stray animals. The patrols have
to lead dogs off, which is sometimes tricky, even with flashers
going.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond does not recommend pulling onto the breakdown lane for
a routine cell-phone call; he considers it too dangerous. For those
regularly doing business while driving, he urges the no-hands cell
phone; otherwise, use a service area or drive down an exit ramp.
For his brief calls while driving, he uses cell phones with
programmed numbers, CBs and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The patrols operate Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Last
summer, a shift was added on Sunday evening to ease westbound
traffic. This year's plan is still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in trouble on our highway in our hours,'' Richmond
said, ``just stay put. We'll be along pretty soon.''

   NEW YORK _ Fernando Leon, a numbers runner with the nickname
Benny tattooed on his arm, was getting madder and madder at Grace
Meullins. The woman kept bothering him for the $700 that she said
he owed her daughter. Then she hit him over the head with a
flashlight.

   ``He stewed over it and he was drinking,'' Ronald Balzan, a
homicide detective, remembered later.
</P>
<P>
   People on the street said Leon had a frightful temper. He got a
gun, which he hid in a plastic bag, and went looking for Grace
Meullins near the old Brooklyn Navy Yard. He ran into the daughter,
Christina, and got into a shouting match. Her brother, Benjamin,
showed up, so Leon pumped two bullets into him. Christina ran
around the corner and tried to hide behind a garbage bin. He shot
her three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot the guy right off the bat, killed him,'' Balzan said.
``She hid behind the Dumpster, cowering, begging for her life. But
he killed her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This was on July 20, 1994. Leon got on a southbound bus at the
Port Authority and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in the normal course of events, would have been that.
</P>
<P>
   But the case folder, No. 96,231, was forwarded to the Cold Case
Squad, a three-year-old detective unit of the New York Police
Department that chases down unsolved cases that the regular
detective squads lack the time or resources to deal with. While
crime is down all over the city, these detectives are dealing with
the residue of a more violent time.
</P>
<P>
   The squad caught Leon, who is doing 45{ years to life for the
double murder. Not only that, but in reinterviewing witnesses to
the crime, Balzan also uncovered evidence that suggested Leon had
killed another man in the Bronx more than 17 years ago, and he is
awaiting trial on that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Through a computer network that traces financial records, Balzan
found that someone who might have been Leon had been paid a few
hundred dollars working at a chicken processing plant in Jackson,
Miss. It was a lucky break, because Leon had kept a low profile,
below most record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed more like the right man when the plant manager
told him the man was ``a scary guy'' who drank and had a temper.
Leon, the detective said, was ``totally surprised'' when he showed
up to arrest him, and the woman he was living with was ``stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife in Brooklyn _ she had given him the gun _ now told
Balzan about another murder in the Bronx, back when their baby boy
was just standing up in his crib. That would have been 1981, so the
detective sorted through old cases in the Bronx until he found the
murder of Dr. Victor Soto, 29, whose attacker chased him down,
stabbed him and cut his throat. Balzan was able to build a case
tying Leon to that killing, in which the tattoo was a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the luxury of time, the luxury of being able to
concentrate on these cases,'' said Capt. Raymond Ferrari, the squad
commander. ``In a regular squad, you always have a new rape, a new
murder coming through the door. Or you can have a high profile case
and have to use everybody. You can make the best plans in the world
and something will come through the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the unit was formed in February 1996, Ferrari said, it has
cleared 280 old homicide cases, 180 by making arrests on cases his
detectives had built, 61 by capturing suspects who had eluded other
detectives and 39 by ``exceptional clearance,'' usually meaning
that the suspect was dead. All told, he said, they had arrested or
caught 595 suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 fiscal year, according to figures in Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's management report issued last September, the Cold Case
Squad selected 273 cases to investigate and cleared 122 by arrests.
Homicides accounted for 244 of the 273 cases, and 93 of those were
cleared. Three-quarters of the homicides had occurred within the
last eight years, but 20 percent were nine to 18 years old and one
was 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Police Department says, there is a 90 percent
clearance rate for homicides. But Andrew Karmen, a professor at
John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that figure was
artificially high because of the way the FBI keeps statistics. When
the homicides are counted for a given year, unsolved crimes from
earlier years are not included in the total, Karmen said, but old
crimes that have been newly solved are. Thus New York's figures are
improved by its success in solving old murders. He estimated that
the department was solving roughly 60 percent of current cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 detectives on the squad all have at least 15 years on the
force. The unit's lieutenants regularly visit other detective
squads to go through the files looking for possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pull out the old ones and read them through,'' Lt. John
Dove said. ``Maybe there's reluctant witnesses 10 or 12 years ago.
You see different things that might indicate there's meat on this
case. Every time I read through a case I might find something new.
Or there might be a certain kind of case that just sticks with you,
say a young girl was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has traditionally been thought that most crimes that
are not solved quickly are rarely solved, the Cold Case detectives
say that this is not necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time goes by,'' Ferrari said, ``and sometimes time can be to
our advantage. It could be an area that was controlled by a drug
gang. But now that gang is gone, and a teen-age witness back then
could be a legitimate adult now, and willing to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Thomas F. Mansfield added: ``Allegiances change.
Today's husband might be tomorrow's enemy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While technological advances like computer networks and better
DNA testing techniques have helped, Ferrari and the others said
that much of their success was old-fashioned police work, mostly
talking to people and getting them to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to nurture them,'' said Detective Pat
Lanigan, recalling a case in Bensonhurst in which he talked to the
girlfriend of a drug addict who, it turned out, had stabbed his
dealer 15 times and cut his throat to steal $500 and eight bags of
heroin. The addict was dissuaded from stabbing the girlfriend in
the shower, to keep her quiet about the killing, only after she
pleaded that she was the mother of their child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She decided to give up the entire thing,'' Lanigan said.
``That poor woman, she just broke down to us. She said, `I always
wanted to to tell the police, but I was afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the case was clinched by DNA evidence. Lanigan found
a down jacket the man had asked the girlfriend to wash. Although
the medical examiner thought the chances of its still having a
bloodstain were ``slim to none,'' the detective insisted it be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   But it was talking to the woman that provided the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where experience comes in,'' Mansfield said. ``It's the
interaction with the witnesses. Sometimes you'll read a case file
and think, `I wouldn't have asked the question that way.' You're
building a data bank. Sometimes people will tell you something
important, and they don't even know they're telling you. But you
walk out of there knowing you just hit the gold mine.''

AMWEST, ATTENDANTS STILL FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ America West Airline and its flight attendants union
can't even agreeon how much they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared to be no closer to a contract agreement
on Monday despite information the company released Saturday
indicating that the wage gap had closed by $10.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over how far apart the two sides remain seems to
show that the Tempe-based carrier and the Association of Flight
Attendants Council 66 have a way to go before they agree on a
contract for about 2,400 flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which is threatening to strike after March 19,
remains $16.5 million apart on a contract with America West,
according to Jeff Zack, AFA communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Garger, America West's vice president of labor relations,
figures the gap at $5.8 million. That's based on America West's
proposal of $68.7 million and the union's proposal of $74.5
million, Garger said.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures include the total new costs over the five years of
the contract. America West's labor costs for flight attendants
totaled $67.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The union has never previously disputed the $68.7 million figure
that the company presented during federally mediated bargaining
sessions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union listed the value of its proposal at $74.5 million in a
letter to flight attendants last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, AFA Council 66 president, said the union does
not accept that the company's offer is worth $68.7 million in new
costs, and contested that figure during negotiations. He said
America West is including $10 million in costs that it would have
incurred even without this contract.
</P>
<P>
   He pegs America West's offer at $58 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West is throwing numbers around to attempt to confuse
the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garger said the company has been consistent in stating the
value of its offer. He accused the union of having a moving target
on what it wants in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   A Feb. 12 letter from America West Chairman William Bill Franke
to flight attendants mentions the company's offer of $68.7 million.
Each flight attendant also received a personalized letter dated
Feb. 22 in which the company spells out the details of how its
proposal would affect that employee.
</P>
<P>
   The union's letter to its members, dated Feb. 24, includes
information to clarify the company's offer but does not dispute the
$68.7 million figure.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the union and America West remain at odds on an
agreement and no negotiating meetings have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are expected in the final week before the strike deadline
on March 19 at 10 p.m. Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   America West is offering an average pay increase of 44.7 percent
over the life of the contract, and the pay rates would be 90
percent of what Southwest Airlines pays its flight attendants,
according to Franke's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is offering a $1.1 million signing bonus that
would be distributed by the AFA to the flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   America West's flight attendants have been seeking a contract
since 1994 when they voted for representation by the AFA. A
tentative contract was rejected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on the contract broke down in late January. The National
Mediation Board declared an impasse last month and set the March 19
strike date after a 30-day cooling-off period. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: GUESS WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DREAMING OF NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer on Tuesday,
March 2: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ People who covet their neighbors' goods
always overestimate how much happier they would be if they got
them. This rule is particularly true when applied to spouses, and
perhaps giant TV satellite dishes. But it also works for
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   California has long been dissatisfied with its June primary, and
envious of the states that vote earlier. California regards itself
as the Land of the Future, but picking presidential nominees after
most of the candidates have already crashed and burned made people
feel non-cutting-edge, a retro electorate. So the state
legislature, after some struggle, moved the date to March 7. You
would not believe how happy the California politicians think this
is going to make them. The place where a state senate campaign can
very easily cost $1 million believes it is going to turn into a
political New Hampshire. ``The voters will get a chance to meet the
candidates on a retail basis,'' the state Republican chairman told
his party convention here last weekend, calling up visions of
George W. Bush shaking hands at Orange County malls while Elizabeth
Dole hits a string of house parties in Chico.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, the secretary of state, has been telling people that
on the day California pushed up its election all the Republican
presidential candidates ripped up their position papers and tossed
them in the wastebasket. And why? ``Because they were all written
for New York!'' Jones says triumphantly. ``Now they're going to
have to talk about our issues!'' New York has an early primary, and
Californians seem to believe that in 1996 Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan
were running around arguing how to get the PCBs out of the Hudson
River while Steve Forbes promised to personally finance the
construction of the Second Avenue subway tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the Republican presidential candidates showed up for
the state convention, and that was regarded as the first sign of
the glories to come. ``California's early primary is already having
results!'' announced a Sacramento anchorwoman triumphantly. Neither
Ms. Dole nor Bush made an appearance, and to be frank, some of the
contenders who did show up were not exactly tough to capture. But
they all competed to see who could make more frequent references to
the fact that California represents the future, or come up with the
most flattering way to describe the new primary. (Sen. John McCain
won with ``of transcendent importance.'')
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans needed all the bolstering they could get,
having lost the governor's race by more than 20 percent last
November. ``This crowd seems a little quiet and serious,''
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush told the convention
dinner. This was perhaps because Quackenbush is, after Jones, now
the most important Republican elected official in the state. The
surviving Republican leaders continually vowed to regroup _ the
word ``unity'' was perhaps mentioned even more often than
``future.'' But when the presidential candidate Lamar Alexander
expressed his intense desire to ``see the California agenda as part
of the presidential campaign,'' he may have been the only one in
the room with any idea of what that agenda might comprise.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the new primary is going to pack a wallop,
although not necessarily the one the parties have in mind. In
California, even candidates for governor barely bother to shake
hands or even hold campaign rallies _ the place is just too big for
the personal touch. What California has done, however, is to create
a stampede to the front of the election-year calendar. So many
states have moved or are moving their primaries to March 7 that
it's very likely the nominees will be chosen on that day, in an
incredibly expensive bicoastal war of TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign that's going to be as time-compressed as this one,
the candidates will stick to issues so general they will make
``compassionate conservatism'' look like a computer printout, and
attacks on the opposition so specific that someone's vote for a
2,000-page budget will be transformed into ``supported spending
$400,000 for midnight basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the contenders are trading meaningless sound bites,
California is thrilled with the idea that they'll be trading more
meaningless sound bites here than anyplace else. ``We have finally
moved up to the front,'' rhapsodized Jones, who asserted, in a
burst of enthusiasm, that 25 percent of all Americans live in his
state. The primary that decides the presidential nominees might
come too early, cost too much money and be too driven by TV ads.
But on the plus side, as Smith pointed out, California is
``representative of the future.''

PALESTINIAN GETS LIFE TERM FOR PLOTTING SUBWAY BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Palestinian immigrant convicted of plotting to bomb
the New York City subway was sentenced Monday to life in prison,
after bitterly denouncing Israeli treatment of the Palestinian
people and U.S. support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing the defendant, Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, for his
plan to plant a powerful, nail-studded pipe bomb, Judge Reena Raggi
of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn said that ``whatever has
occurred in Mezer's life'' did not justify his desire to make
average New Yorkers ``bear the consequences of his hatred and
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before Ms. Raggi, who could have chosen a lesser
sentence, imposed the life term, Abu Mezer recited a list of
grievances against the Jewish people, from Biblical days to the
present. He also maintained that it was ``a lie'' that the Nazis
killed 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a statement in heavily accented English, Abu Mezer, 25,
a slight, bearded man wearing a Muslim skullcap, said, ``I lived
under the Israeli army occupation for 20 years, facing all kind of
suffering from the aggression of the Israeli army.'' He was
convicted in July of possession of the bomb, and of threatening and
conspiring to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Mezer, who was born and raised in the West Bank, arrived in
the United States illegally from Canada several months before he
was arrested with the pipe bomb in his Brooklyn apartment in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In his court statement, he said Palestinian land, houses and
businesses had been confiscated by the Israelis, including his
family's house. He said he and his relatives had been beaten and
arrested during the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and that
as a teen-ager during the Palestinian resistance known as the
intifada, he had been twice arrested and tortured by Israeli
authorities, who wanted him to identify friends who had thrown
stones at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A defense lawyer, Lawrence F. Ruggiero, said Abu Mezer's past
experience, while ``not an excuse'' for the crimes for which he was
convicted, justified imposing a sentence less severe than life in
prison. Under federal law, there is no possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raggi rejected this appeal. She noted the complex
circumstances that brought Abu Mezer to this point, and said, ``It
is always sad to see a human being _ a young man _ so consumed with
hatred.'' Nevertheless, she said, her task was to deal with the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not to address public debate about either the domestic
policy of Israel or the foreign policy of the United States,'' she
said, adding that evidence at Abu Mezer's trial showed that the
police raid on his apartment, in which he was shot and wounded,
came ``literally hours before'' he planned to place the bomb in the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that generated nightmarish visions of another
terrorist attack in a city where the World Trade Center had been
bombed in 1993, the police and federal agents said Abu Mezer's bomb
could have killed scores of people.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn have said
they found no evidence linking Abu Mezer to any known terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
   His courtroom account of having been tortured by the Israelis
could not be confirmed, and his older brother, Nour, said after his
arrest that ``he exaggerated a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the trial, when Abu Mezer testified against the advice of
his lawyers, he said he had intended the bomb as a suicide attack
in which he hoped to kill as many Jews as possible, although he
maintained that the bomb was not to have been placed in the subway.
</P>
<P>
   But an FBI agent testified that Abu Mezer said after his arrest
that he had wanted to bomb a rush-hour train on the B line
``because there are a lot of Jews that ride that train.'' The line
passes through Brooklyn's Borough Park section, home to many
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Abu Mezer made no admissions, saying he planned to
appeal because his rights had been violated by ``government
misconduct.'' He also charged that his trial lawyers had not
diligently represented him and that one had even been ``working
with the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raggi responded that she had been ``highly impressed by the
quality of lawyering'' he had received, in a case with
``overwhelming evidence'' of his guilt.

GUARD IN NASSAU JAIL BEAT A MENTALLY RETARDED INMATE, JURY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury found Monday that a Nassau County Jail
guard had beaten a mentally retarded inmate in 1993, leaving him
with broken ribs and spinal fractures. The decision clears the way
for a broader civil-rights trial against Nassau County and other
jail guards.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, the former inmate, Thomas Donovan Jr., 39, had
accused the guard, Salvatore Gemelli, a leader of the corrections
officers' union, of attacking him as he arrived at the East Meadow
jail. The beating, which Donovan said Gemelli administered with a
metal frying pan or pot, left him afraid that his life inside the
jail was in jeopardy, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict bolsters claims by critics and other former Nassau
County inmates that beatings were commonly administered by guards
at the jail. An inquiry began after the Jan. 13 death of Thomas
Pizzuto, 38, an inmate whose family says he was beaten by guards
and then left untreated for days. His death, which has been ruled a
homicide, is at the center of a wide federal investigation into
possible civil rights violations at the jail.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous ruling Monday, the jury awarded Donovan $65,000
in compensatory damages after spending an unexpectedly long time _
13 hours over two days _ in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the 10-member jury will return to consider whether to
award Donovan punitive damages. After that, they will begin hearing
arguments in the second phase of the civil suit, in which Donovan
has accused Nassau County of failing to protect his constitutional
rights during his time in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision, which by law must be unanimous, was by no
means swift. On four occasions throughout the day, the forewoman
passed notes asking lawyers from either side to provide copies of
Gemelli's testimony and other documents from the case.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:15 p.m., after the jury sent Judge Allyne R. Ross a note
that asked, ``What if we can't reach a unanimous decision?''
lawyers weighed the notion of a hung jury. But the jurors finally
reached an agreement at 5:45 p.m. as Judge Ross was preparing to
send them home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand in awe of my son because of the bravery he showed
through this whole ordeal,'' said Donovan's father, Thomas Donovan
Sr., after the jury rendered its verdict. ``I could care less about
the money. I hope the good, decent guards now step forward. I want
that prison cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gemelli, 45, appearing crestfallen as he left the Brooklyn
federal courtroom Monday, and his lawyer, Chris P. Termini,
declined to comment after the ruling. Telephone calls seeking
comment from several Nassau County officials were not returned late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Gemelli testified he had no recollection of
Donovan or the night of beating. In a case where there were no
other witnesses to Donovan's beating, the jury had to decide on
Gemelli's liability by plodding through reams of documents and even
a secretly taped conversation between Donovan, who has an IQ of 58,
and police officers who asked about his injuries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The junior Donovan did not appear in court Monday, staying
instead at the home of a family relative in Brightwater, on Long
Island, his father said. He had been taken to the county jail on a
child sexual abuse charge and later pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployed for the last several months, Donovan will soon begin
working as a chef's aide at a country club restaurant on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Federal civil-rights statutes require Donovan's suit to be split
into two phases. The second part of the trial set to begin Tuesday
will focus on whether Nassau County is partly responsible for
allowing Donovan's rights to have been violated. That process is to
include allegations against other jail guards, including James
Tyrrell, who accompanied Gemelli to court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul F. Millus, the lawyer representing the county, will attempt
to show that the county is not liable for Donovan's or other
inmates' beatings while inside the county jail. ``I think the law
will bear out that the jail doesn't guarantee safety 100 percent,''
Millus said before the jury's ruling Monday. ``No jail does. That's
not the nature of jail. Jails house violent people.''

   New Ferries Speed Bahamas Travel &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fast ferries are presenting new options to Bahamas-bound
travelers this year, as a company has begun service between Miami
and Nassau and another is planning inter-island trips starting in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Nassau service, operated by Bay Ferries of Prince
Edward Island, Canada, uses a 300-foot catamaran called the Cat,
which makes a five-hour run from Miami to Nassau every day except
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry, which sails in summer between Maine and Nova Scotia
and will be replaced by a sister ship, carries 750 passengers and
travels up to 50 miles an hour. It leaves the Port of Miami at 9
a.m., arriving at Nassau at 2 p.m.; the return trip leaves Nassau
at 4:30 and arrives at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There is a casino on board with slot machines, blackjack and
roulette. Other diversions include bingo, movies and a duty-free
shop. There is also a snack bar.
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip fares are $119, $59 for ages 3 to 12; one-way tickets
are $69 and $39. A total of $20 United States and Bahamas departure
taxes is extra. For reservations: (888) 635-9228.
</P>
<P>
   The inter-island service, by a new Nassau-based company called
Bahamas Fast Ferries, will connect Nassau with Eleuthera, a
90-minute trip, and with Harbour Island, which takes about 20
minutes longer. The 115-foot catamaran, being built in Connecticut,
will accommodate 170 passengers and will have a bar serving light
snacks. The fares will be $90 round trip for either island, and the
company expects to start taking reservations at the end of April,
at (242) 323-2166. &QL;

   Early Bloom Won't Stop Wildflower Festival &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bluebonnets, the traditional harbingers of spring in central
Texas, are in bloom again. The redbuds are budding, the daisies are
dancing in the warm breezes and the sweet scent of mountain laurel
fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not necessarily happy news for travelers who visit
Austin and the Texas Hill Country to admire the spring wildflowers.
Because of unusual warmth so far this year, the peak for spring
wildflowers _ typically the last two weeks of March and the first
two weeks of April _ is about three weeks early.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the second week in March, I suspect we will have peaked
out,'' said Flo Oxley, botanist at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower
Center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas is also unusually dry, which could reduce both the
number and the duration of blooms unless it rains soon. ``I still
think it's going to be a beautiful spring,'' Ms. Oxley said, but
added, ``Don't be disappointed if you don't see oceans and oceans
of bluebonnets.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be abundant pink evening primroses, coreopsis, and
Engelmann's daisies, she said, as well as gaillardia, prairie
verbena, wine cups, columbines and salvia.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the early arrival of the guests of honor, the Lady
Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, 4801 LaCrosse Avenue, Austin, Texas
78739, is planning its annual Wildflower Days Festival on four
weekends: March 20 and 21, featuring children's activities; March
27 and 28, focusing on native plants; April 24, a photo festival,
and a crafts show on May 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to each is $4, $2.50 for students and ages 60 and up.
The center is open Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Information: (512) 292-4200, www.wildflowers.org.

   London Restaurants Show Off With Bargains &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having recognized that London, for some time now, has become a
worthwhile destination for dining, the London Tourist Board has
organized a yearlong restaurant promotion. It starts Friday with
the city's first Restaurant Week, to run through March 21.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 200 restaurants involved in the program will serve
special prix-fixe menus and wine offers. There is no single set
price _ unlike New York Restaurant Week, in which lunch prices are
determined by the year ($19.98 in 1998, for example) _ but some
places will have meals priced at about $8 and $16, and all the
menus are expected to represent good value.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A listing of participating restaurants is available in a
supplement in the March 11 issue of the London Evening Standard
magazine, in the March issue of Where London, a magazine available
free in many hotels, and at www.londontown.com. Information:
(44-171) 872-5678 from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among special events, a number of art exhibits involving food or
restaurants or both open on Friday, including an expanded display
of ``The Art of Cooking'' at the National Portrait Gallery on
Trafalgar Square.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, Duncan Hamilton, a former chef who is London's most
famous ice sculptor, will give carving demonstrations at Trafalgar
Square. On March 21 in Soho, Greek, Dean, Frith and Bateman Streets
and part of Old Compton Street will become pedestrian malls from
noon to midnight, with cooking demonstrations, restaurants selling
their specialties, and entertainment. Florence Fabricant &QL;

   Poland's Grand Era Sweeps Into the U.S. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From 1572 through 1764, Poland was Europe's largest nation,
sweeping east to include what is today Lithuania and most of
Belarus and the Ukraine. It was the crossroads of trade between
eastern and western Europe, the Christian bulwark against the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land of the Winged Horsemen: Art in Poland, 1572-1764,'' which
began a five-city tour of the United States at the Walters Art
Gallery in Baltimore on Tuesday, puts that Baroque era on view.
Nearly 150 works _ from Old Masters paintings, to armor and
weaponry to Oriental rugs and liturgical objects _ depict Poland's
Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from the National Museum, the Royal Castle in Warsaw, the
Wavel Royal Castle in Cracow and more than 30 other museums and
churches, most have never been outside Poland. Many are national
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit begins with a section on Poland's elected monarchy,
including a jeweled crown, scepter and orb, a throne and a portrait
of Ladislas IV by Rubens and his studio. Next come galleries
devoted to fancy military regalia, armor, sabers and cavalry
trappings. There is also a Turkish tent captured when the Poles,
led by John Sobieski, defeated the Turks in 1683 in the Battle of
Vienna, which is illustrated in the show by a 17th-century
painting.
</P>
<P>
   The third section examines the lavish life of the Polish
nobility with examples of dress, tapestries, porcelain and
furniture. Finally, paintings, carvings, chalices and other
religious objects focus on religion, including a 17th-century
painting of Our Lady of Czestochowa, Poland's famous Madonna, in a
silver robe.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the opening, admission is free Sunday; there will
be shows of Polish folk dancers, rapiers engaging in a duel, and
puppet-making, paper-cutting and other festivities for children.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will remain at the Walters until May 9. It then
travels to the Art Institute of Chicago (June 5 to Sept. 6), the
Huntsville Museum of Art in Alabama (Sept. 25 to Nov. 28), the San
Diego Museum of Art (Dec. 18 to Feb. 27, 2000) and the Philbrook
Museum of Art in Tulsa, Okla. (March 25 to June 18, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   The final showing of the exhibition will be at the restored
Royal Castle in Warsaw, which was destroyed by the Nazis in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Walters Art Gallery, at 600 North Charles Street, in the
Mount Vernon Cultural District of Baltimore, is open Tuesday to
Sunday. Dated and timed tickets to ``Art in Poland'' are $10 for
adults, including an audio tour, with discounts for seniors,
children and groups. They are available at (800) 551-7328, on the
Web at www.ticketmasterwb.com or at the museum.

COMMENTARY: ON CHANGING MAYORS IN MIDSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you recall how Bill Bradley, the former senator,
kept insisting during the Senate impeachment trial that a special
election for president be held if Bill Clinton were convicted?
Remember the way he complained that Vice President Al Gore's
automatic ascension to the White House would give him an unfair leg
up in next year's national election?
</P>
<P>
   What's that, you say? None of this sounds familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was well aware that the Constitution calls for the vice
president to step in when the presidency is vacant, and that's
that. And the old athlete in him knew that you don't try changing
the rules deep in the game, no matter what the consequences may be
for your own presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   What does this obviously absurd hypothetical situation have to
do with New York? Only this:
</P>
<P>
   A movement is afoot to change the City Charter, in effect New
York's constitution. It says that the public advocate, Mark Green,
automatically becomes mayor should Rudolph Giuliani move on after
the 2000 election to the U.S. Senate or other fertile fields.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to shock you, but the most prominent politician
banging the drum for a rules change happens to have his eye on City
Hall himself. That would be Alan Hevesi, the city comptroller. (It
may also shock you to learn that Green thinks the present charter
is just dandy when it comes to mayoral succession.)
</P>
<P>
   Here comes another jolt: Hevesi would rather not run against an
incumbent Mayor Green, even if incumbency has not always proven
gold for unelected chief executives. Just ask the golfer Gerald
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Hevesi says he has taken no stand on charter change.
Unofficially _ read: in reality _ he has told fellow Democrats that
democracy is not well served by letting Green waltz into City Hall.
Better a special election to decide who fills out Giuliani's term
in 2001 while he is off teaching fellow senators the art of
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you may be stifling a yawn and looking to flip the page.
Fair enough. No one is sure yet that Giuliani will run for the
Senate, let alone win. Nor is it clear that Hevesi's idea of a
special election will get off the ground. Leading Democrats like
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer, another would-be mayor, give it two thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is more than an exercise in political inside
baseball. How this issue is resolved may well determine who governs
New York come 2002. So it warrants discussion now, including these
points from Hevesi:
</P>
<P>
   It is silly to compare the public advocate to the vice
president. The City Charter is not the U.S. Constitution, and Gore
is Clinton's political soul mate, while Green is Giuliani's polar
opposite. Also, holding a special election is not such a radical
thought. The charter already contains provisions for one _ just
not, to Hevesi's misfortune, one that could come in time to help
him if next year brought us Senator Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hevesi point is that precious few voters understand that
the public advocate stands first in line to move suits, ties and
toothbrush into Gracie Mansion. They should decide directly who
gets to be mayor, whether for one year or four.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in doubt,'' the comptroller said, ``let the voters
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Now to Green, who will get the last word. To him, this move to
change the rules in mid-game ``does not pass the smell test,''
however cloaked in democratic imperatives it may be.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the public advocate and his political antecedents,
including the city council president, have stood next in line to
the mayor since 1830, with the transition carried out three times
in this century. Why change now? Just because fate decrees that it
may work to the advantage of Mark Green (assuming he is not so
unlucky as to have the pendulum swing and the crime rate start
soaring on his watch)?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Green says, to change the charter in time you probably
need to put it on the ballot this November, in an election year
that has no major races. The turnout would most likely require a
microscope to be detected. Is that, he asks, how a city's
constitution should be revised?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an appealing but glib phrase: `Let the people decide,'''
Green said. ``But isn't it really a fig leaf to cover up someone's
political motivation?''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ David Robinson dressed quietly, knowing full well
what was about to come. The San Antonio Spurs, from whom so much
had been expected in the preseason, had played another lousy game
Sunday, losing by 14 points to the Utah Jazz, their bitter Midwest
Division rival.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The game, their second straight loss by a double-digit margin,
had dropped the Spurs to 6-8 on the season heading into tonight's
game against the Rockets at Compaq Center, and the media
surrounding Robinson's locker were demanding to know what was wrong
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Christian, Robinson knew he was about to go through his
own version of the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knew he was going to be a target for the media.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew why.
</P>
<P>
   It's because Robinson, a man who avoids swearing, had ironically
been branded with perhaps the worst four-letter word in
professional sports: soft.
</P>
<P>
   It has been whispered throughout his career, no doubt because of
the good-guy image Robinson projects through his faith and his
adherence to the principles he learned during his days at the Naval
Academy. But the worst part is that those whispers are now being
spoken aloud in his own locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``What frustrates me is that I hear it from other teams that our
team is soft,'' said former Rocket Mario Elie, who signed with the
Spurs as a free agent. ``How am I supposed to feel? Guys I play
against all the time saying, `Mario, you know your team is soft.'
It frustrates me, but I hear this. Guys are telling me this.
There's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Robinson is the antithesis of the emotional Elie.
Where Elie is outwardly fiery and combative, Robinson rarely strays
from the stoic front he projects, which is why he is perceived to
be soft.
</P>
<P>
   The knock against Robinson is even more ironic since everything
else about him is about as hard as can be.
</P>
<P>
   You start with the hardbody physique, which looks more like an
anatomist's chart _ broad shoulders, bulging biceps and a waist
that seems impossibly small on a man who stands over seven feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   But people look at that body and expect Robinson to be breathing
fire every second he's on the court.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness was supposedly illustrated last season when, after
being knocked unconscious by an elbow from Utah's Karl Malone and
falling face-first to the Delta Center floor, Robinson refused to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson just shrugs off the criticism, even though it stings
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep my perspective,'' he said. ``They (the media)
are on the outside looking in. I believe in doing things the right
way. I believe in working hard with this thing. I believe in the
commitment. They keep talking about passion, but to me, passion is
about commitment. It's about faithfulness; it's about being there
every day. It's about working your tail off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like in a marriage. You see, our society doesn't
understand about passion. They think passion is running around
growling at somebody or whatever, or cheating on your wife. But
that's not passion. That has nothing to do with it. What I'm
talking about is the faithfulness and the commitment to being
there, and fighting through times when it's not so good. And right
now is a time when it's not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not for Robinson or the Spurs. But he's not about to
rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not something Robinson learned during his days at the
Academy. It is more a byproduct of his faith, which is rock-solid,
and a value system that demands respect for authority.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, however, that Robinson's faith in the Spurs' system,
the brainchild of San Antonio coach/general manager Gregg Popovich,
is evaporating. Popovich's system is designed to emphasize Tim
Duncan in the low post, meaning Robinson, not too far removed from
leading the league in scoring (1994) and taking home a Most
Valuable Player trophy (1995), has to spend much of his time off
the blocks or at the high post, where he is clearly uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if Mark McGwire reported to camp, only to be told
his new job would be to lay down bunts. Robinson's job now is to
move the ball around, play defense and rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he does it, even though it means getting criticized for his
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way the world is,'' Robinson said. ``People
like those flamboyant guys. They like the guys who don't like to
pass and do all the crazy stuff. That stuff, I guess, is more
interesting. I don't know. I could it doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson bit his lip, in much the way he has been asked to bite
the bullet since Duncan came on board the Admiral's ship last
season. Still, Robinson is averaging 15 points, 10 rebounds and
three blocks per game this season, solid by anybody's definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a time right now to point fingers,'' said Robinson of
changes he would like to have made. ``I think it's a time for us to
just dig down and figure out what we can do better. Personally, I'm
going to have to get some more post-ups and hopefully some more
transition buckets working. We have to talk about that stuff. We
just have to solve our problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really point fingers at anybody. I just have to look
at myself and say, `How can I make this team better? What more can
I do? How can I get more shots or make this team more effective
offensively?'''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Spurs, however, asking what they can do to make Robinson
better?
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed fine when San Antonio hosted Seattle on Feb.
24 and won a 99-81 blowout behind Robinson's 29 points and 17
rebounds. But the Sonics got their revenge two nights later with a
92-82 victory, and Sunday's loss to the Jazz represented the low
point of this young season for Robinson and the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off two blowouts, it's real frustrating,'' Robinson
said. ``I thought after that first Seattle game that we had made
some progress and we were beginning to get a little confidence in
one another. It seems like we've kind of taken a step backward
after that game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson intends to keep pressing forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of what is so great about winning and doing the
things (to win) and doing it right is the challenge of fighting the
uphill battle,'' he said. ``That's part of what's so awesome about
it. I think that right now we have a lot of questions to answer. No
question. But if we are able to overcome this, then it's going to
be that much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be that much stronger having gone through some
of this garbage, questioning ourselves and really digging down deep
and saying, `Where is our team? We're 6-8. What are we going to do
right now?' I think that's really what this is all about. That's
the part about this game that I really love _ the challenge. Every
night you have a great challenge, stepping out there on the floor,
where you challenge yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge hill to overcome for me, and I want to overcome
it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A day after firing the head of the New Jersey
State Police for what she called racially insensitive remarks, Gov.
Christie Whitman on Monday defended her administration's response
to charges that state troopers use ``racial profiling'' to single
out black and Latino drivers in looking for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that the comments by State Police Superintendent
Col. Carl A. Williams, in which he suggested that certain minority
groups were disproportionately responsible for some kinds of drug
trafficking, were wrong. But she reiterated her contention that
there was no widespread practice of ``racial profiling'' by state
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always made it very clear that I won't tolerate racial
profiling, and I believe he's telling the truth when he says that
it isn't tolerated or condoned,'' she said, referring to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she had resisted earlier calls for Williams' ouster
because he had cooperated with several measures intended to improve
race relations on the force and deter profiling by troopers.
Williams had expanded the State Police recruiting unit in an effort
to bring more women and minorities into the force, the governor
said, and after troopers shot three unarmed minority men last April
during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike, Williams agreed
to install video cameras in patrol cars to tape all traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also rejected suggestions from some civil-rights
advocates and Democratic lawmakers that the furor over racial
profiling and Williams's remarks could complicate the nomination of
Attorney General Peter Verniero to the state Supreme Court.
Verniero, who was nominated by Whitman to the court last week, has
been criticized, as the official who oversees the State Police
department, for not acting quickly or forcefully enough?? after the
turnpike shooting last April.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero has also been criticized for representing the troopers
in an appeal of a 1996 court case in which a state judge found
evidence of widespread profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman's swift move to oust Williams was praised by
most civil rights leaders as an important first step, they
emphasized that more was needed to be done to address bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes clear to us that the problems facing the State
Police are deep and pervasive,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson,
executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey.
``Colonel Williams is not just a superintendent but a veteran of 35
years, and it is difficult for us to believe that the thoughts
expressed in that interview have not trickled down to the rank and
file of the state police.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic lawmakers Monday joined the Black Ministers
Council in calling for the state Legislature to delay its vote on
Verniero's court appointment until the U.S. Justice Department's
civil rights division completes an investigation, begun in 1996,
into profiling complaints against the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Williams and Verniero are equally at fault for
procrastination on the growing litany of profiling complaints, yet
one is out of a job and the other is poised for one of the most
coveted positions in the state,'' said Assemblyman LeRoy J. Jones
Jr.. a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, the minority leader, said that all 16
Senate Democrats agreed that the confirmation should wait. But
Republicans hold control of the Senate, with 24 seats, and all that
would be required for confirmation is a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero issued a public statement Monday condemning Williams'
remarks as ``insensitive and inappropriate.'' But he declined to
discuss how the firing of Williams might affect his nomination to
the state Supreme Court, saying that he did not want to politicize
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The governor dismissed suggestions that Verniero should be
faulted for Williams' statements or that the lingering allegations
of profiling should stall his nomination to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything said by Col. Williams is indicative of
the attorney general's response to these complaints,'' she said.
``He's done an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she believed Williams was correct when he stated
that there is no clear evidence that troopers engage in profiling,
but she said his public comments, published in The Star-Ledger of
Newark on Sunday _ that most drug traffickers are black or Latino _
were so insensitive that he had seriously damaged the credibility
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a racist,'' Whitman said. ``But I don't
believe he saw how insensitive his comments were. That's part of
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' political demise came after 10 months of escalating
complaints that the state police use discriminatory and illegal
tactics to single out minority drivers in search of narcotics
traffickers. Williams, who was appointed by Whitman shortly after
she took office in 1994 after a decorated career as a trooper, has
steadfastly denied that the practice exists, and publicly bristled
last month when Verniero announced that the attorney general's
office would undertake its own review of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Sunday in the Star-Ledger, Williams
ridiculed the notion that police should not take race into
consideration when trying to search for possible drug couriers.
During the interview, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago the president of the United States went to
Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go
to Ireland. He didn't go to England. Today, with this drug problem,
the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most a member of a
minority group that's involved with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams declined a request for interviews on Monday, and Lt.
Col. Michael Fedorko, the acting superintendent, spent the day
meeting with top commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said John Hagerty, a State Police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is not the only state to face allegations of racial
profiling. Delaware, Connecticut and Maryland's state police
departments have been named in lawsuits charging that minority
drivers are pulled over more often than white ones are.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the public fiasco caused by Williams' comments are an
embarrassment to Whitman, it also offers her a new opportunity to
seize the initiative in an issue that has dogged her administration
for nearly a year. After the shooting in April, the Whitman
administration ordered that patrol cars be equipped with video
cameras to record all traffic stops, and has expanded a recruitment
effort to bring more minorities and women onto the force.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of new allegations of profiling have continued to
emerge, including several from current and former troopers who have
filed discrimination lawsuits against the state police and say they
were trained to pull over drivers based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing public complaints in recent years, the State
Police have refused to release public details of the disciplinary
actions against troopers and have resisted suggestions that
troopers note the race of motorists they stop, making it difficult
to document patterns of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Newark, Kevin Keenan, acting executive
director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, urged Whitman to create a database of the race of all
motorists stopped by troopers, and an ``early warning system'' to
ferret out troopers, as well as local police officers, who might be
racist, psychologically unfit, or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   With the dismissal of Williams, who had become the most fiery
defender of the State Police, Whitman must find a more temperate,
politically sensitive leader for the 2,700-member force. The
governor said the list of potential candidates should include
civilians, as well as uniformed law enforcement officers, and
minorities, although she said she would not limit the search to
minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights leaders and representatives of black law
enforcement officers say it will take far more than a new commander
to remedy those a State Police culture that they say has
contributed to racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   William Buckman, a lawyer whose lawsuit led to a judge's finding
in 1996 that black drivers are 4.85 times more likely to be stopped
than whites on the southern half of the New Jersey Turnpike, said
that only the governor and the Justice Department can force the
insular police force to adopt the kind of changes that are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is a major component of New Jersey State Police
thinking,'' Buckman said. ``The governor opted for spin control.
Something much more must be done than firing one state scapegoat.
It is about time for this historic and decades-old problem to come
to an end.''

GIVING CHEEVER COUNTRY ITS GUILTY PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, Diane Straus Tucker had never met
her stepsister-to-be, a woman she had heard of only as Monica. But
it did seem odd to Ms. Tucker when she heard that Monica, who
seemed to have a good job at the Pentagon, was looking for a public
relations job at Revlon in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having all the facts, right?'' Ms. Tucker recalled last
week. ``To put it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Jan. 21, 1998, the day the world first heard of Monica S.
Lewinsky, rolled around soon enough. That morning Ms. Tucker's real
sister was on the phone with a question: ``Do you know who Monica
Lewinsky is?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, the daughter of Marcia Lewis _ who married
Ms. Straus' father, R. Peter Straus, later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker has since picked herself off her original 1780 floor
in Bedford, N.Y., and in an unrelated but utterly fitting career
development is now the editor in chief of the gossipy,
six-month-old Westchester Wag. The Wag is a free monthly, heavy on
local celebrities congratulating each other at benefit events, that
covers Westchester County's rich without shame. John Cheever would
have railed against it, but probably would have studied the party
pictures first.
</P>
<P>
   The Wag's cover is a hard-to-ignore bright red, white and purple
_ Ms. Tucker said she and her publisher wanted to avoid a classy
Town &AMP; Country look, and they have. It is available at bagel shops
and good restaurants, but only in Katonah, Mount Kisco, Rye and the
like. Ms. Straus says a letter to the editor in an upcoming issue
asks, in essence, ``Do you guys even know where Peekskill is?''
</P>
<P>
   She says yes. ``Take 684 to Exit 6, take a left on 35,'' Ms.
Tucker said, then confessed she needed to follow written
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for everybody,'' Ms. Straus admitted, ``but everybody
is reading it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least writing for it. Seema Boesky, Ivan's ex, has a Wag
column called ``Seema Says . . . .'' (``I feel I understand your
pain,'' she wrote in an open letter to Ms. Lewinsky in February.)
Lucie Arnaz, Lucille Ball's daughter and a recent Wag cover girl,
writes a column, too. (``Whatever Happened to Jean Harris?'' was
Ms. Arnaz's November offering. She answered her headline this way:
``Funny you should ask. She just called me the other day to thank
me for a contribution my husband and I had made to her Children of
Bedford Fund.'')
</P>
<P>
   Clearly The Wag will not be at the top of the list of pit-bull
publications supposedly making Hillary Rodham Clinton think twice
about running for the Senate from New York. ``We will never be
cruel, but we may occasionally be wicked,'' said Ms. Tucker's boss,
Mary Ann Liebert, who publishes 60 medical journals from The Wag's
Larchmont offices.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Monica. ``I think she'll do something
with us,'' said Ms. Tucker, meaning that The Wag, too, will likely
get its Monica interview. In December, Ms. Tucker fought off
worries that she was capitalizing on her new stepsister and wrote
an exceptionally discreet column about her. ``Monica is a bright,
engaging and attractive young woman,'' she said. ``Who hasn't made
mistakes in their twenties?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker didn't go much further in an interview in her office
last week, but did say that she spent a week with Ms. Lewinsky at a
family get-together in the Adirondacks this past summer. ``She's
full of life, she's funny, she's smart,'' Ms. Tucker said. ``I
think the House managers overlooked the fact that a woman like
Monica can have her own motivation, and make up her own mind. Just
because she was doing this doesn't mean she was somebody's
puppet.'' Also: Ms. Lewinsky has a ``hauntingly beautiful'' singing
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker, 47, was dressed in a pink jacket with a short black
skirt and looked like the very fit former national paddle tennis
champion she is. She is having a good time with The Wag. ``You
can't not read it,'' she said. ``It's like going to a dinner party
without having to polish the silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker grew up ``everywhere'' _ New York, Washington and
Geneva, where her father, who owns newspapers and radio stations in
New York and New Jersey, was an executive with the International
Labor Organization. Ms. Tucker went to the Brearley School on
Manhattan's Upper East Side and Sidwell-Friends in Washington, and
graduated in 1973 from Yale. Her first job was at New York
magazine, where she became an assistant to the managing editor. She
then moved to The Village Voice as an associate editor.
</P>
<P>
   She married a Yale classmate, Carll Tucker, in 1976, moved to
Bedford from Manhatan's Upper West Side in 1982, then raised three
children in a house once owned by her
great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, David Hays. Ms. Tucker's
mother, Ellen Sulzberger Straus, was the first cousin of Arthur
Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company.
While at home with her children, Ms. Tucker started a catering
company, ``Oh, Cuisine,'' and also worked in her husband's
business, Trader Publications, which owns newspapers and magazines
in Fairfield and Westchester Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Wag cover subjects have included Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
and Gov. George E. Pataki _ who grew up in, yes, Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Wag, which prints 50,000 copies a month, making money?
Ms. Tucker's answer was Clintonian: ``It depends on how you count
it.''

DOMINGUEZ HIGH SOPHOMORE STANDS TALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ He was the principal subject of a widely
watched segment on the nation's most popular news television show -
60 Minutes - before ever stepping onto a high school campus.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, he will become the first high school athlete to ever
be featured in Vanity Fair magazine, and there are whispers that he
may actually grace the cover.
</P>
<P>
   He is 7-feet tall with model looks and is arguably the most
well-known boys basketball player in the country. And he's only a
16-year-old 10th grader.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside looking in, it may appear that Dominguez High
basketball star Tyson Chandler has the world in the palm of his
hands. But being such a highly touted prospect does have its
drawbacks, such as the pressure to fulfill expectations, which
always seems to coincide with fame and adulation for those who are
above the norm in their sport of choice.
</P>
<P>
   While most agree that his potential is unlimited, carrying the
burden of being one of the game's so-called `Next Great Big Men'
doesn't seem to faze Chandler, who feels his shoulders are broad
enough to handle the weight of expectations placed upon him by the
basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The expectations) might be unfair to a person that couldn't
take it, but I can handle it,'' Chandler said. ``I realize that
basketball is just a game, even though some people take it too
serious. Don't get me wrong, I love this sport. But to some people,
basketball is their whole life and if they don't make it, they have
nothing to fall back on. That's not me, and it won't be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dons coach Russell Otis says that Chandler isn't your typical
star jock, and that he has remained a down-to-earth teenager
despite all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson comes from a real good family, and he really cares about
his teammates and people in general,'' Otis said. ``He just wants
to be as normal as possible. Sometimes, I think if he could do it
all over again, he'd make himself six feet, because he gets a lot
of attention due to his height and I don't think he enjoys it all
the time. But I wish I had a son like him, not because of his
basketball ability, but because of his attitude and demeanor about
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a 7-footer in high school will surely get you noticed, and
Chandler has been the center of attention wherever he plays. Otis
said that at times, its like traveling with a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   ``His persona is unreal ... I marvel at how people react to him
all the time,'' Otis said. ``But he always takes time to talk to
people, especially the smaller kids, and he treats everyone the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   (sub) It's in the genes
</P>
<P>
   To say genetics played a small role in Chandler's stature is an
understatement. His biological father, Frank Chandler, is
6-foot-10, and his mother, Vernie Threadgil, may only be 5-11, but
all of her brothers stand 6-4 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chandler played basketball at San Jose State in the early
70s, but Tyson doesn't credit his father's affection for hoops as
having an influence on his desire to play the sport. As a matter of
fact, Tyson admits to having a closer relationship with his
stepfather, William Brown, and didn't show much interest in
basketball until he reached the seventh grade, by which time he
stood 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Once he became dedicated to basketball, Chandler began to play
on Nike-sponsored traveling teams for well-known youth coach Pat
Barrett, and between the eighth and ninth grades, he sprouted four
inches and stood 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler grew up in San Bernardino, and his decision to attend
Dominguez drew plenty of criticism from those in that area who had
hoped he would attend one of the local high schools. But Chandler
said he made up his mind as an eighth-grader to become a Don, and
he took advantage of a CIF rule that allows incoming freshman the
opportunity to attend any high school they wish, provided the
school district involved accepts the student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to better myself, and I thought (Dominguez) would be
the best choice for me and it has,'' said Chandler, whose family
has since moved to Montclair, from which he commutes to Compton
daily. ``I don't think I could have gained anything by playing out
there. I think every day, playing against these guys in practice,
represents a bigger challenge to me than what I might have faced
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also developed a very close relationship with Otis, whom
he calls a second father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has been great on and off the court, and I know he won't
steer me wrong,'' Chandler said. ``I can ask some people a
question, and they'll tell me what I want to hear. But coach will
tell me what I need to hear, even if it might hurt my feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you see him screaming at players like Kenny Brunner,
Jason Thomas and Tayshaun Prince ... those guys were as good as
you'll find, and I knew I wasn't going to be an exception. I didn't
want to be treated any differently than anyone else coming into
high school.''
</P>
<P>
   (sub) The critics
</P>
<P>
   Chandler averaged 10 points, five rebounds and three blocks per
game as a freshman for a Dons team that won a fourth consecutive
CIF Southern Section title and would probably have captured a third
straight Division II state championship if not for an injury to
Prince.
</P>
<P>
   He's increased those numbers across the board this season,
averaging 14 points, eight rebounds and five blocks while leading
Dominguez to a 26-3 record and a No.9 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who expect more on the offensive end of the
court from a player of his caliber, but according to Chandler,
anything he does offensively is simply a plus for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a role on this team like everyone else, and my job is
to rebound, block shots, run the floor and intimidate people,'' he
said. ``It's not like there aren't guys on this team who can't put
the ball in the basket. As long as I get another team out of their
offense, then I'm doing my job. Maybe next year I'll take a more
assertive role on (offense), but what I'm doing this year is what's
needed for us to be successful now. I never look at the stats
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who has been called a young David Robinson by scouts
who love the fluid way in which he moves on the court, said he
wants to pattern his game after NBA stars Kevin Garnett and
Shaquille O'Neal, both of whom he has met and had frequent talks
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the way Garnett played in high school, because he
could completely dominate a game without scoring a single point,''
Chandler said. ``And I like Shaq because he's so strong down low.
He just moves people without even trying sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis said there have been times when the 7-footer has tried to
do too much on the court, but noted Chandler has learned that he
has no one to impress but his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only a sophomore, and the more he matures, the other
stuff (offensively) will come,'' Otis said. ``We've got some pretty
good high school players surrounding him, so there's no pressure
offensively. But he can dominate a game right now on the defensive
end, and he's going to learn how to dominate offensively as well.
Tyson has every post move in the book, he just doesn't know how to
transfer it from the practice floor to the game floor all the time.
When he puts it all together on a consistent basis, look out,
because it's going to be something to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have dogged Chandler from the day he started classes at
Dominguez. There was the widespread reports that he was headed to
Mater Dei after his freshman season they were still going around
after he refuted them in the Press-Telegram last February and the
one he hates the most, which has the star ticketed to the NBA right
out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never said I was going to go pro out of high school ...
that has never come out of my mouth,'' Chandler said. ``Some of the
people around me might have said it, but I never did. When people
say that, they're just questioning their own thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who's a B-minus student, said he definitely plans on
going to college, and while he still has more than two years of
prep competition left and realizes that his mind could change, he
has put together a list of schools, with his current favorites
being Kansas, Arizona and UCLA, in no particular order.
</P>
<P>
   Winning over his critics would be nice, but it's not exactly at
the top of his agenda for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those guys have way too much time on their hands,''
Chandler said. ``I mean, if they can sit back and look at my game
and pick all the flaws out, that probably means they're not very
busy doing anything else. There's no way I can hide myself on the
court, because everywhere I go, I'm a marked man, and people are
going to try and shut me down. I never had a chance to build a
reputation, because everyone knew who I was before I even got to
high school. I had no chance to gain anything, all I could do was
lose the reputation I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Most scouts have Chandler ranked among the top five sophomores
in the country. But being the No. 1 player in his class isn't what
drives the Dominguez star, who is looking to achieve that goal and
and a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the No.1 player in the country, regardless of
class, next year,'' Chandler said. ``I always tell myself that I
can do anything I want to do, and how much I better myself as a
basketball player and as a person is all up to me.''

JUDGE DELAYS TRIAL OF 2 IN SCHEME TO SELL HUMAN ORGANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge has delayed the trial of two men who
were charged in a scheme to arrange the transplant of organs taken
from executed Chinese prisoners, questioning whether the defendants
were entrapped in the case, and expressing concern over the absence
of a crucial witness.
</P>
<P>
   When the arrests were announced last year, federal officials
said the case could provide the first evidence of what dissidents
have long described as a thriving trade in human organs in China,
and its reach to the United States, where it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged the two defendants after the FBI mounted
a sting operation using information from the human rights advocate
Harry Wu about a conspiracy to sell the human organs. The two
defendants are Cheng Yong Wang, who has described himself as a
former prosecutor on Hainan Island, China, and Xingqi Fu, a Chinese
citizen who runs a laundry in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's role in the case had already drawn fire from the defense,
which contended that he held a grudge against the Chinese
leadership and had set up the defendants to advance his agenda. Wu,
who has denied those allegations, was expected to testify at the
trial for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of entrapment arose again after the defense
lawyers told the judge, Deborah Batts of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, that they had discovered that a second government
informer had played a much greater role in the case than was
previously known, including orchestrating much of the illegal
activity charged against the defendants and pushing them to join
the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The government has disputed the defense's contention, and said
there was no entrapment in the case. But Batts said in court last
week that she was troubled that the second informer, a man named
Paul Risenhoover, described as an American long active in the
Chinese dissident movement, had left the United States and is now
refusing to return to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers, who wanted to question Risenhoover, are now
asking that the charges against Wang and Fu be dismissed. Batts has
delayed the trial in order to decide whether it will be fair to
proceed without Risenhoover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants have raised, I think, troubling and serious
issues regarding their rights, in terms of the unavailability of a
primary player in this series of events,'' Batts said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the informer's ``not being available, compounded by
entrapment, compounded by active role in these things,'' she said,
``I think fairness requires the defendants to be able to confront
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``He is essentially such a seminal and significant
and integral part of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said
Monday that officials there would have no comment. The government
has filed secret court papers with the judge pertaining to
Risenhoover's role, the court docket shows.
</P>
<P>
   But last week in court, federal prosecutors told Batts that they
disagreed with the defense's contention that Risenhoover's presence
was critical, or that his testimony would even be admissible at
trial. The government made clear that it does not believe that the
defendants were entrapped in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Risenhoover, who is about 30 and said to
be a native of Oklahoma. He was studying in China in 1989 at the
time of the student protests and deaths at Tiananmen Square, said
one person who knows him. He was described in court by a defense
lawyer as a fervent anti-Communist who is fluent in Chinese and
fears for his safety because of his strong opposition to the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers had said they wanted to question Risenhoover
because records obtained from the government show he instigated the
scheme. They say he aggressively recruited their clients into the
conspiracy, then handed the case off to Wu, who informed the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Smith, the lawyer for Wang, the former Chinese
prosecutor, said in court that Wang had been in the United States,
seeking advice about how to get a visa, when he was referred to
Risenhoover, who said he was an immigration counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that Risenhoover told Wang that he could get him a
visa, but in return Wang would have to use his former contacts as a
prosecutor in China to help arrange the transplants of organs from
executed prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme, as laid out by Smith, involved patients from Aruba
and did not involve the United States, meaning it was not illegal,
Smith said, according to a transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told the judge that Wang never agreed to any activity that
was illegal in the United States, and that Risenhoover persisted in
drawing the defendants aggressively into the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is entrapment, judge,'' Smith said. ``It is not a situation
where my client came to Risenhoover. It is a situation where
Risenhoover came to my client.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Monday night, ``I stand by the arguments I made in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Fu's lawyer, Stephen Cohen, concurred. ``As I argued in court,
the unavailability of the informant denies my client his Sixth
Amendment right to confrontation. He's absolutely the crucial
player,'' Cohen added, referring to Risenhoover.

JOHN GOLDWATER, CREATOR OF ARCHIE AND PALS, DIES AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kansas)  (kd)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is survived by Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica
in Riverdale, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Their creator, John L. Goldwater, an orphan from East Harlem who
hitchhiked his way west in the Depression and invented prototypical
teen-age America in the comics, died of a heart attack on Friday at
his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Andrews and his pals remain forever 16 going on 17.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Goldwater, a struggling writer distantly related to the
late Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, dreamed up the carrot-topped,
freckle-faced character perpetually torn between two loves, one
blond, one dark-haired. He was a hapless teen-age Everyman
counterpoised to the hyperpotent Superman, who had made his debut
just a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Naming his creation Archie, after a school chum, Goldwater
surrounded him with other characters patterned after teen-agers he
had met in the Midwest, gave them jalopies and typical teen-age
problems, placed them in the mythical and idyllic town of
Riverdale, and found a young artist, Bob Montana, who provided what
became indelible faces.
</P>
<P>
   Millions worldwide came to chuckle over Archie's misadventures
at school with his spinster teacher, Miss Grundy, and the fussy
principal, Mr. Wetherbee; his intractable romantic triangle with
the sweet Betty and spoiled, rich Veronica; the hamburger obsession
of the nerdy Jughead; the rivalry with the handsome, conceited
Reggie. In time, the supporting cast members grew to star in their
own comic books.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the settings have been updated _ Archie and his
friends now exchange e-mail and go in-line skating _ but the
problems have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding idea, Goldwater always said, was simple. It came
down to Archie. ``He's basically a square, but in my opinion the
squares are the backbone of America,'' he told The New York Times
in 1973. ``If we didn't have squares we wouldn't have strong
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula clearly hit a responsive nerve. The comic strip once
ran in 750 newspapers. Comic book sales sometimes reached 50
million a year, though they have leveled off at about 15 million a
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldwater's touch catapulted him to the pinnacle of the comics
world, with a multimillion-dollar fortune and publishing empire,
Archie Comic Publications Inc. of Mamaroneck, N.Y., one of the
industry's big three, along with Marvel and D.C. Comics. Archie was
on the radio, on television and in the movies. There was even a
short-lived chain of Archie restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater was also instrumental in creating the Comics Code
Authority, which was formed in 1954 to self-police the industry's
depictions of sex and violence. He was also a national commissioner
of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and his wife, Gloria,
was the first national chairwoman of its women's division.
</P>
<P>
   His childhood world of East Harlem was no Riverdale, U.S.A. His
mother died giving birth to him in 1916 and his father succumbed to
grief, abandoning his baby and dying soon afterward. Young John was
raised by a foster mother and grew up to complete high school,
where he knew a red-haired boy who became the prototype for Archie.
Goldwater was six feet tall and husky with dark hair, more the
Reggie type.
</P>
<P>
   With the Depression worsening, he left New York, hopping freight
trains and bumming rides to the Midwest, where he worked for a time
in Kansas as a news reporter. Assigned to school sports, he hung
around with football teams, meeting the players and the girls they
attracted, who would later supply him with ample comic material.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years he continued west to the Grand Canyon, where
he worked at a lodge, but was dismissed for socializing with the
female help, affording him more future material. The lodge paid his
way to San Francisco, where he found work again as a reporter and
saved enough to book passage on a ship back to New York. On board,
he met two young women bound for the novitiate. Both fell for him,
which later gave him the idea of the Betty-Veronica rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, he got a job on the docks and his experience
with shipping gave him an idea. He went to a magazine publisher and
offered to buy his outdated issues at a penny each. Then he shipped
them abroad to an avid market. The business prospered and Goldwater
soon joined with a pulp magazine publisher, Louis Silberkleit, to
found a magazine publishing business in 1941, just as the war was
restricting paper supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Their Archie venture, with illustrations by Montana, himself
then a teen-ager, began as a four-page insert in another comic. It
proved an immediate hit and Archie and his pals quickly got their
own comic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, with national critics decrying brutality, vulgarity and
sex in the comics, Goldwater helped found the Comics Magazine
Association of America, whose Comics Code Authority persuaded
magazines to voluntarily weed out offensive copy as well as ads for
guns, knives and war weapons. He was president for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he went further, licensing Archie for evangelical
Christian messages. Although Jewish, Goldwater said the sentiments
were in line with his wholesome family message.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Archie comics company, then public, was acquired by
a son, Richard, from Goldwater's first marriage, and by
Silberkleit's son, Michael, and returned to private ownership. It
now employs 32 writers and artists and publishes more than 30
comics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his son Richard, of White Plains,
N.Y., he is survived by two other sons, Jonathan, of Scarsdale, and
Jared, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Goldwater's first obituary. When he was 48, in June
1964, The New York World-Telegram and Sun reported that he had died
at age 89, confusing him with someone else with a similar name. In
a letter to the editor, Goldwater responded, ``This is a unique
experience, and I guess that I am one of the very few men in the
world who is able to laugh at his own obituary.''

CHANGE OF SCENERY JUST UP THE COAST 
SHADES OF SINATRA 
KITCHEN TROUBLE

<P>
   Democrats were buzzing Monday about what President Clinton said
about one coast during a dinner party on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, on Friday, was given by Eli Broad, the billionaire
chairman of Sun America, the Los Angeles insurer. Some Democrats
quoted the president as saying he expects to live in New York after
he leaves the White House, whether or not Hillary Rodham Clinton
runs for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some chitchat that went, `For 22 years she's lived
where I wanted to live, and now I owe it to her, so if she wanted
to live in New York or run for the Senate, I'd do it,''' said
another Democrat who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It was
all very vague. He clearly indicated that he doesn't know what she
wants to do and that she hasn't made up her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Shades of Sinatra &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hugh L. Carey, who was the governor of New York from 1975 to
1982, provided musical assistance at the Palm Beach Tavern in Palm
Beach, Fla., on Saturday. From his front-row seat, he sang along
with cabaret singer Eric Comstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing he was chummy with Sinatra, I sang `How Little We
Know,' `Nice 'n' Easy' and `Witchcraft,''' Comstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Comstock struck up what he considers a quintessential New
York song, ``On the Sunny Side of the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I gambled that he'd react to the line, `I'll be as rich as
Rockefeller,''' Comstock said, ``and he did react _ `Don't mention
that name.''' First Comstock substituted Malcolm Wilson, the
Republican whom Carey defeated for governor in 1974. ``Finally I
got it right: `If I never have a cent, I'll be as rich as Hugh L.
Carey,''' Comstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Carey asked for ``New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to want a Sinatra strut,'' Comstock said. ``He sang
so well that I let him modulate and finish alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen Trouble &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were supposed to be 14 chefs from Charlie Trotter's
restaurant in Chicago in the kitchen of Roger Yaseen's apartment on
the Upper East Side on Sunday afternoon, putting together a dinner
for 16 guests.
</P>
<P>
   But by 6 p.m., only three members of the team, including
Trotter, had arrived. A chef de cuisine, Matthias Merges, and a
sommelier, Robert Houde, were delayed by bad weather. So was the
all-important cargo they were bringing: 20 boxes containing the
dinner (which had been painstakingly prepared, bagged and sealed on
Saturday), plus 20 copper sauce pans to warm it in and nearly 200
pieces of china to serve it on.
</P>
<P>
   Yaseen, an investment banker, had paid $12,000 for the dinner at
a benefit and memorial for the chef Patrick Clark last year. He had
invited his guests for 6:30 p.m., but when it became clear that
things would be running late, he called everyone and said to come
at 7:15 instead.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30, the chefs and the food had landed at La Guardia
Airport, but the vans that were supposed to meet them were nowhere
to be found. They had to stand in a taxi line for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Yaseen's, the party _ including the restaurateurs Drew
Nieporent, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Jean-Jacques Rachou, Sirio
Maccioni and Maguy Le Coze _ sipped Champagne and waited. Nieporent
thumbed through a directory of menus from a takeout delivery
service. Yaseen also had a seven-foot hero sandwich from
Manganaro's in reserve, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter kept his cool. ``Roger Yaseen has been made to wait in
every one of these people's restaurants, and now he's getting his
revenge,'' he said. ``There is no food.''
</P>
<P>
   But finally, starting around 9:15, with quail egg salad served
in quail eggs, there was food. Nine courses, five wines and three
pounds of fresh black truffles.

   A week after a report accused the Metropolitan Police Service in
London of ``pernicious and institutionalized racism,'' a new report
has found that police forces across Britain are failing to give
enough attention to racial matters. The report said police forces
were marginalizing the issue of race by not, for example, working
to combat racism among officers.

DOCTORS' GROUP MERGES WITH A LARGER UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Doctors Council, a union representing 2,500
salaried doctors at New York City hospitals, announced Monday it
was merging with the larger Service Employees International Union
as part of a plan to accelerate efforts to unionize doctors
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger agreement, the Doctors Council _ most of whose
members are post-residency attending physicians at the city's
municipal hospitals _ will begin a campaign to unionize physicians
in other states, helped by the larger union's pledge to spend $1
million a year on the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, said one
priority would be to press for legislation in New York state and
elsewhere that would make managed-care organizations liable if they
overrule doctors' decisions and patients are hurt as a result.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing the merger, Liebowitz and other
union leaders said repeatedly that doctors' unions would fight as
much to improve patient care as to increase doctors' wages and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine has been infected by a big-business mentality,'' said
Liebowitz, a pediatrician. ``Hospitals are merging and downsizing.
Profit-driven managed-care companies and corporate administrators
are dictating medical treatments to protect the bottom line. For
the sake of our profession and for the sake of patients everywhere,
this must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   With the merger, the Doctors Council becomes the third medical
union in the Service Employees International Union, which now
includes 15,000 doctors, making it the the nation's largest
representative of doctors. The service employees union has created
a new umbrella group, the National Doctors Alliance, comprising the
Doctors Council, the Committee of Interns and Residents, and United
Salaried Physicians and Dentists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Committee of Interns and Residents, which is based
in New York and represents 9,000 doctors, joined the service
employees union, which has 1.3 million members, 600,000 of whom are
in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Stern, president of the service employees union, said it
would make a big push to unionize not just interns and residents,
but also salaried physicians. Doctors in private practice are
usually considered independent contractors and prohibited by law
from bargaining collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Liebowitz said the union would not rule out calling strikes. He
said it would be hard to justify doctors' striking over economic
issues, but he said a strike might be appropriate to prevent
reduced quality of care _ closing a cardiology and neurology
department to cut costs, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it is better to strike than to allow patients to go
into a substandard facility,'' he said.

DAVID H. SMITH, 67, DEVELOPER OF VACCINE AGAINST MENINGITIS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Ohio) (ms) 
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David H. Smith, a researcher and entrepreneur who
helped figure out a way to coax even the immature immune system of
an infant into mounting a defense against a bacterium that causes
meningitis, died Feb. 24 at his home on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan. He was 67 and also lived on Martha's Vineyard and in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was malignant melanoma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research
in 1996 for his work in developing a vaccine against the bacterium
Haemophilus influenzae type B, or Hib. The prize was shared with a
former colleague, Porter W. Anderson Jr., and two researchers from
the National Institutes of Health, John B. Robbins and Rachel
Schneerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hib vaccine work is a wonderful success story,'' said
Richard A. Insel, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Rochester and a former colleague of Smith's at the university. ``I
don't think people thought it would be this successful, almost
eradicating the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, about 20,000 cases of Hib invasive disease
in preschool children were reported to the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. In about 12,000 of those cases, the
children had meningitis, an inflammation of the brain and spinal
cord membranes that can be fatal or cause permanent brain damage.
In 1997, a few years after the vaccine became available for
infants, 258 cases were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Smith became convinced that a Hib vaccine was feasible but could
not interest a drug company in the work, so he founded Praxis
Biologics in Rochester in 1983, said his wife, Joan. ``He was so
determined to do this,'' she said, ``that he quit his job and
mortgaged the house and founded the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Praxis' first vaccine was developed in 1985, but it was
effective only in older children. In 1989, the company was bought
by American Cyanamid and became Lederle-Praxis. Smith was chairman
and chief scientific officer of the new company in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A successor company, Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines, won approval in
1990 for a vaccine that is now used in infants starting at 2 months
of age.
</P>
<P>
   That vaccine stimulates an infant's immune system by joining a
protein from another bacterium, like tetanus or diphtheria toxin,
to sugars from Hib bacteria. The protein stimulates immature immune
cells, prompting the production of antibodies to the Hib sugars and
protecting the child from infection.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy of using what is known as a ``conjugate'' vaccine
is now being studied to see if it is effective against other
childhood diseases.
</P>
<P>
   David Hamilton Smith was born in Canton, Ohio, and graduated
from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953. He earned his medical degree
at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted research at Harvard Medical School, and served as
chief of infectious diseases at Boston Children's Hospital from the
late 60s to 1976. He was chairman of the pediatrics department at
the University of Rochester from 1978 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active in conservation efforts. He led the effort to
establish the Polly Hill Arboretum, a 60-acre tract with more than
2,000 species of plants, on Martha's Vineyard; it opened to the
public last year.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave more than $9 million to the Nature Conservancy to
finance 48 postdoctoral researchers to study freshwater
conservation. He was on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund
at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Smith is survived by a brother,
Richard, of Delaware, Ohio; three daughters, Andrea Smith and
Rachel Smith, both of New York City, and Jennifer Smith of Takoma
Park, Md.; two stepdaughters, Jody Leader of Brookline, Mass., and
Kristin Leader of Rome, and five granddaughters.

GOV. BUSH SET TO NAME EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE FOR PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c. 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush will announce Tuesday that
he will form an exploratory committee, clearing the way for him to
raise and spend money while evaluating a possible bid for
president, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, Bush officials said Monday
the governor will hold an afternoon news conference at the
Governor's Mansion to make the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had said Thursday that he would announce a decision within
two weeks concerning the presidential race, and there were
indications then that his first move would be to form an
exploratory committee. The governor isn't expected to announce a
final decision regarding his candidacy until after the Texas
Legislature adjourns May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican legislators from North Carolina, the home
state of possible presidential contender Elizabeth Dole, delivered
a message to Bush Monday: ``Bush-Dole 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In that order.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a chorus of state legislators urging Bush to run for the
White House, the lawmakers told reporters at an Austin news
conference that they liked favorite daughter Dole but wanted the
Texas governor to lead the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the home state of Elizabeth Dole, we're proud to be here to
give our commitment ... to Governor Bush, if he runs for the
Republican nomination,'' North Carolina state Rep. David Miner
said. ``We believe and we hope Elizabeth Dole will be Governor
Bush's running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   The commitments come on top of petitions from several other
states and add to a list of fast-moving developments that suggest
that Bush is already far down the road in putting together a
presidential campaign. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush will tap fund-raiser Jack Oliver to help lead efforts to
raise money for a presidential bid, according to The Associated
Press. Oliver used strong ties to grassroots conservatives to raise
almost $3 million for Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, who has decided
not to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twelve Republican governors signed a petition pledging their
support to Bush, and organizers say seven more will endorse him
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a pattern that has become increasingly familiar, GOP
delegations from legislatures in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Connecticut urged Bush to get into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he or his staff had coordinated the visits, Bush
described them as ``spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it requires, when people express a desire to come
down, a certain sense of coordination, so both of our calendars can
be coordinated,'' Bush said. ``I don't want people coming to Texas,
and I'm not available for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he paid for the lunch out of political funds raised
for his gubernatorial campaign. He has not begun to collect money
for his expected national committee, which, unlike the state
operation, must abide by limits of $1,000 on contributions from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Miner, the North Carolina state representative, was asked why
most of the Republican legislators from his state are supporting
Bush over Dole. He said it is partly because Bush has been elected
twice as governor while Dole, a former secretary of transportation
and of labor, had ``only served in appointed positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Dole's Washington office were not returned.

MORE REFS, MERRIER TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back in September, an NHL coach was asked his
opinion of the two-referee system the league was planning to
experiment with this season.
</P>
<P>
   The coach winced, then replied, ``It means twice as many
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But through the course of the season, opinions changed as the
two main concerns with having two referees failed to materialize.
The extra body on the ice didn't crowd the terrain. And two
referees didn't mean twice as many penalties would be called,
killing the flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much previously unpenalized clutching and grabbing
behind the play was eliminated in games with two referees, and it
is for this reason that games this season have had a better flow to
them than did games the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a system in which the game is a little shorter and a
little more under control, and those are things that the league has
been seeking,'' said Dallas Stars general manager Bob Gainey, who
was skeptical about the experiment before the season.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of the benefits of having two referees (a
system the league plans to implement in the playoffs) came in the
Los Angeles Kings' recent 2-2 tie at Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defenseman Doug Bodger was sitting on the bench watching
as Flames defenseman Derek Morris cleared the puck from the other
end of the ice. Suddenly, the play was directly in front of
teammate Mattias Norstrom and Theoren Fleury (still a Flame)
battling for the puck with everyone else at the other end of the
ice, including the lone referee that night, Stephen Walkom.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury grabbed Norstrom's stick, causing Norstrom to fall to the
ice. Fleury then picked up the loose puck and scored the tying goal
on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (referee Walkom), `He was holding the stick,''' Bodger
said. ``(Walkom) said, `I didn't see that.' I said, `That's because
you were too far back.' Maybe with two referees, that's a different
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Avs and Av-nots: Speaking of Fleury, the Sunday trade that sent
him to Colorado didn't enhance the Kings' chances of signing him
this summer. Denver is reasonably close to Calgary, where Fleury's
12-year-old son lives. And unlike the Kings, the Avalanche is a
Stanley Cup contender.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Fleury now, the Avalanche gets him for its Stanley
Cup run this season, and has his exclusive bargaining rights for
the next four months. Fleury has insisted he won't sign until
testing the open market, but who knows?
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for the Kings, Fleury is not the only key
player Colorado must worry about signing this summer. Heading
Colorado's list is star center Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury recently said he rejected a four-year, $25-million offer
from the Kings that would have triggered a trade early last month.
It remains to be seen whether a similar offer from the Kings will
be enough to entice Fleury this summer, if he's even still
available.
</P>
<P>
   End of an era? Wayne Gretzky hasn't said anything to spur the
speculation, but there is some thought that hockey's all-time
leading scorer may be considering retiring following this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who turned 38 in January, will miss up to a month with
a back injury, the New York Rangers announced last week. He remains
among the league leaders in assists this season, but has scored
just eight goals and has an abysmal minus-21 defensive rating.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, when the Rangers visited Edmonton recently,
Gretzky gave his former boss, Oilers general manager Glen Sather,
an autographed stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thanked me for all the things I'd done for him,'' Sather
said. ``Pretty nostalgic stuff. I was thinking later, `Is this
Wayne's way of saying he's quitting?' I told Wayne he should just
quit the Rangers, move his family to Edmonton, put his kids in our
great school system, put them in our hockey programs. I told him
he'd have to play for free, for old time's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying Lemieux: The Pittsburgh Penguins expect to lose more than
$20 million this season. Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy said he will
not build a new arena for current team owners, but hasn't ruled out
building one if retired Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux ends up
buying the team with his group of investors, which appears more
likely than not.
</P>
<P>
   Women's clinic: The Kings and Iceoplex will host a women's
hockey clinic Wednesday, with sessions scheduled for 6:30-7:45 p.m.
and 8-9:15 p.m. The clinic will be conducted by Annie Camins, a
1998 finalist for the U.S. Women's Olympic team. Cost of the clinic
is $25, which includes a ticket to the Kings-Panthers game on Mar.

KNICKS FIND THE PERFECT ELIXIR FOR THEIR 2-GAME LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks played a team in a bigger rut than
themselves Monday night at Madison Square Garden. And though they
went through their routine misadventures against the Cleveland
Cavaliers, Patrick Ewing and his desperate teammates finally seemed
to understand how to win a basketball game again.
</P>
<P>
   It began with pretty offense, ended with ornery defense and
produced an 85-78 victory before a crowd that alternated between
frustrated and euphoric _ depending on the possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won their seventh straight at the Garden, but more
important extricated themselves from a two-game slump that had
featured two embarrassing losses on the road. The Cavaliers came
within 6 points in the final minutes, but the Knicks would have
none of a last-minute comeback on their home floor.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs pumped in a huge 3-pointer with 4 minutes 2 seconds
left, pushing the Knicks ahead by 76-66. And Larry Johnson
administered the final blow, pirouetting in the lane before softly
hitting a short jump shot with two minutes remaining that gave New
York an 80-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the Atlantic Division lead at stake, the Knicks headed for
Miami and their third game in three days with renewed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing scored 16 points, hauled down 12 rebounds and blocked 4
shots. Johnson added 16 points and Allan Houston contributed 15
points and 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland shot 43 free throws and was led by Shawn Kemp's 19
points and 10 rebounds. Derek Anderson added 15 points as the
Cavaliers, who were held to 29.6 percent shooting from the floor,
lost their fourth straight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just as the Knicks looked as if they were about to collapse in
the third quarter, the veterans _ Ewing, Houston and Johnson _
righted them from an extended slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland had closed to within 4 points, 54-50, in the final
minutes of the quarter when Ewing scored from inside. Houston then
dropped in a 3-pointer with less than four minutes left and Johnson
executed a nifty up-and-under move, splitting the Cavs defense for
a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, battling all night with the 6-foot-10-inch, 285-pound
Vitaly Potapenko, got behind the Ukrainian center for an easy
layup, which put the Knicks ahead by 65-52 heading into the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a team playing its second of three games on
consecutive days _ the first time the Knicks have played three in a
row since the 1984-85 season _ was looking polished and poised,
less than 24 hours before playing the Heat in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed this game, having come off atrocious,
double-digit losses to Boston and Detroit over the previous three
days. The loss to the Pistons on Sunday was an 89-68 blowout in
which no one seemed to care and Johnson wondered aloud who would
provide the spark that Charles Oakley once provided.
</P>
<P>
   It could be reasoned that the Cavaliers needed it more, since
they had lost three straight. But a four-game skid in Cleveland is
exactly that, a skid. A three-game slide in New York is cause for
major introspection, a team crisis in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy has been through enough of those to know
how distracting they can be. He lamented the effort the team gave
on Sunday, and wondered where the adrenaline would come from before
Monday night's game. He got some good news earlier in the day when
team doctors cleared Latrell Sprewell to practice, a development
that could lead to the team's shooting guard returning as the sixth
man as early as Friday in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy also received some good news on the floor from an
unlikely source, Dennis Scott, who had made 5 of 24 3-pointers
entering the game and played only five minutes in the loss to
Detroit. He finally found his range from the 3-point line, making
three from the same spot on the left wing in the second quarter,
the third one giving the Knicks a 39-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks appeared to be on their way to a rare blowout,
building a 16-point lead. But Cleveland went on a 12-4 run at the
end of the quarter to close to within 48-40 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The usual culprits _ ragged offense, lethargic defense and no
rebounding to speak of _ sprouted in the second quarter and
remained through most of the third until the Knicks finally started
to play inspired ball.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp had controlled the middle early. He scored 9 points in the
first quarter, maneuvering his hefty frame inside for easy baskets.
Coming into training camp at about 300 pounds, Kemp was ridiculed
for gaining about 40 pounds in the off season. But his bulk has
enabled him to bang more inside. l

RANGERS DUO MAKES HISTORY IN OWN WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Last week it was Pudge Rodriguez, hurting
nothing except his image, but why say something that stupid? ``I'm
not a team leader,'' was his answer for an unexcused, tardy arrival
at the Rangers' spring training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday it was Juan Gonzalez, also late for spring training,
but unlike Pudge, he had cleared it with team management. Another
difference was Juan being a charming diplomat as the media horde
peppered him with first-day questions.
</P>
<P>
   Score one for Juan. And made it an E-2 for Pudge.
</P>
<P>
   But after taking in both Juan-Pudge arrival scenes from a nearby
clubhouse locker, first baseman Rafael Palmeiro offered a new and
old slant to the latest adventures of the Rangers' golden boys.
New, because Rafael was in Baltimore the last five years. Old,
because Rafael was with the Rangers when Gonzalez and Rodriguez
launched their major-league careers in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is growing in his understanding of what the game is all
about beyond the field,'' said Palmeiro. ``But Pudge comes in here
the other day, talking out of frustration, and he says something he
doesn't mean, and he knows he doesn't mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Rodriguez did attempt to put a different spin on his
``I'm not a leader,'' gaffe. ``I meant I'm not the kind of guy to
be outspoken in \Rthe clubhouse\S,'' he said. ``If I'm gonna be a
leader, it's got to be on the field, or if someone comes to me for
advice, I certainly will help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not comfortable with that thing about putting a team
on my shoulders. I don't like having to tell people what they
should be doing. It's not for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation is acceptable, as opposed to the one last week,
which sounded foolish coming from a still young, but veteran star
player who makes $8 million a season. Rodriguez has been around
long enough to know better. Maybe he should be taking a read from
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Pudge debuted in Arlington at age 19, Juan at age 20. Both
arrived hailed as ``the future of the franchise.'' Both have lived
up to the baseball billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the incredible part,'' said Palmeiro. ``They've had
this huge spotlight on them from Day One, and with that comes a lot
of responsibility. At times, maybe they've disappointed, but I'm
not sure that any of us _ fans, media or other players _ fully
realize what we're seeing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro mentioned the duo of Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez
in Seattle. ``That's the only other organization in baseball,'' he
said, ``that has two homegrown players who, based on their careers
at the moment, are headed for the Hall of Fame. We are watching
history being made, but when you are this close to it, you don't
necessarily see it. And maybe they don't realize it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Start adding up the combined MVP awards, all-star game
appearances, home-run titles, Gold Gloves, etc., and the Juan-Pudge
``homegrown'' duo is unmatched, save for the Seattle pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unheard of in today's game is an organization keeping
two players together of Juan and Pudge's caliber,'' said manager
Johnny Oates. ``With Griffey and \RAlex\S Rodriguez there is now a
question of how long they stay together in Seattle. But look at
Pudge and Juan in Arlington.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, at age 29, has played eight major-league seasons and
been in the Rangers' system for 13 years. Pudge, at age 27, has
played seven seasons and been in the organization 11 years. And
this in the U-Haul era of players moving constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has spent 10 seasons with the Mariners, and Rodriguez
has been in Seattle three years, but both have talked recently of
taking free-agency walks in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has grown up around Pudge and Juan, and
vice-versa,'' said Rangers hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo, a
rookie-league coach for both players when they were 16 years old.
``Pudge and Juan have felt comfortable here throughout their
careers. The questions on both have always been there about
attitude and commitment. But both are still young, and because of
the talent they have, and the success they've achieved, the
spotlight gets bigger all the time. More is always expected from
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, coming off his second MVP season in three years, is
now praised for an ever-improving ``attitude.'' Pudge, however,
suffered a setback last week, meaning new doubts in that area were
raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge will be fine,'' said Palmeiro. ``No matter how long
you've been in this game, or how good you are, it's still a
learning process every day. And that includes even when you've
established Hall of Fame credentials, like Pudge.''
</P>
<P>
   A late arrival in Florida means zilch. But how Juan handled it,
compared to Pudge, said a little something about both.

VAN HORN'S SHOT AT BUZZER STOPS NETS' LONG SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before Monday night's game, Nets Coach John Calipari
talked of going to church on Sunday and realizing that life is
bigger than a basketball game. He spoke of teaching his players to
believe in positive psychology and ignoring the pains in their
bodies, of just about anything of a spiritual and mental nature
that might help the Nets overcome. And finally, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn rebounded Eric Murdock's missed shot and hit a
10-foot baseline jumper as the buzzer sounded to give the Nets a
99-97 victory over the Boston Celtics and end the club's grueling
six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, the Nets' star forward, had struggled in the final
minutes. Isolated in the post, he missed four baseline jumpers,
including one that was blocked by Paul Pierce, down the stretch,
and two free throws with 58 seconds left that could have put the
Nets ahead by 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting open looks and the ball was just short,'' he
said. ``That last shot was short too, but fortunately we got a high
bounce and it fell.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those missed foul shots, Van Horn, a 79 percent
free-throw shooter, said: ``I never miss those down the stretch.
But all that matters is that I made that last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He also committed the foul that allowed Andrew DeClercq to make
a free throw and tie the game at 97-97 with 7 seconds remaining
after Chris Gatling's follow of a Van Horn miss had given New
Jersey a 97-96 lead. Following a timeout, the Nets went to Kerry
Kittles, who drove the lane, and found a wide-open Murdock on the
baseline. But Murdock, who had made a 3-pointer and two foul shots
in the last three minutes, missed, setting up Van Horn's rebound
and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn released the ball with two-tenths of a second
remaining. He was wide open. The ball hit the side of the rim and
bounced about a foot in the air, before falling through.
</P>
<P>
   After Murdock had missed, a horde of players went for the
rebound and Gatling got a hand on it, directing it to Van Horn. ``I
was just trying to keep the ball alive,'' Gatling said. ``I just
got a little piece of it. And Keith was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did any team in this league deserve that ball to bounce and go
in more than us?'' asked Calipari. ``Come on now. It's amazing how
when you're losing games, the players are questioned and the coach
is questioned in a big way. And you should be when you're losing as
much as we're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led by 89-83 with 4 minutes 55 seconds remaining but
Boston rallied to tie it at 95-95 and took the lead 96-95 on a
driving layup and free throw by Kenny Anderson with 49 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and Kittles had 20 points apiece for the Nets,
following Kendall Gill's 23. Jason Williams had 16 rebounds and 10
points for New Jersey before fouling out late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker led Boston with 21 points and Pierce added 20.
The Nets improved to 3-10 while Boston fell to 6-6 as its
three-game winning streak ended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Nets led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter and
by 7 at halftime. But Boston, with its unceasing pressure on both
ends of the floor, closed the gap quickly, outscoring the Nets by
16-9 in the first half of the third period to force the game's
first tie at 57-57. Moments later, Dana Barros drove around Damon
Jones to give the Celtics their first lead (68-67) on a 13-foot
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been a rare sight this season, the Nets responded
nicely, going ahead by 74-71 at the end of the third on a 3-pointer
by Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   As they have done numerous times during their losing streak, the
Nets started off hot. Welcoming Boston's challenge to play at a
feverish pace, they scored the game's first 8 points, 6 of them on
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, who missed their first seven shots, got untracked
midway through the quarter and pulled within 3 at 20-17 on a jumper
by Andrew DeClercq, but the Nets pushed the advantage back to 6
points heading into the second.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey built its lead by attacking Boston's pressure and
turning the Celtics' aggressiveness against them. The strategy
resulted in the Nets getting layups or dunks on 9 of their 12
first-quarter baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn was the recipient of most of the gimmes, making two
dunks and two layups in scoring 10 early points.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying the up-and-down tempo, the Nets increased the
lead to double digits (37-26) on a five-foot running jumper by Van
Horn at the 5:40 mark. Though his team was in command, Calipari had
to be nervous about the final minutes of the half. The Nets had
dropped 14-point second-quarter leads in their last two losses and
in both games, the shift in momentum occurred near the close of the
half.
</P>
<P>
   A similar collapse appeared imminent when the Celtics put
together a barrage of slashing dunks and layups and then pulled
within 5 at 39-34 on jumper by Ron Mercer. But in displaying a
resiliency that has been absent for most of the season, the Nets
rallied to go ahead by 12 points before taking a 48-41 lead into
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Van Horn, who had 14 points, Kittles played a
strong first half. The lanky shooting guard had been in a
season-long slump, shooting 32 percent from the field, but he made
5 of 7 field goals to score 10 points before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Pierce, the catalysts of Boston's victory at
Continental Arena on Saturday, scored 10 first-half points apiece.

COURT OVERSIGHT OF TEXAS PRISONS MUST CONTINUE, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge ruled Monday that Texas' huge prison
system has improved since a landmark ruling more than a decade ago
that put the system under court control, but not enough to warrant
ending that oversight and returning full control of the prisons to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Wayne Justice ruled in Austin that ``systemic
conditions of confinement in administrative segregation, failure to
provide reasonable safety for assaulted and abused inmates and
excessive use of force by correctional officers in Texas prisons
violate the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same judge who ruled in 1983 _ after a lawsuit on
behalf of several Texas inmates _ that the state's prison system
was unconstitutional and needed to be placed under court control.
Among the judge's chief complaints was severe overcrowding, but he
also found fault with the medical treatment and the safeguards for
prisoners inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prisons officials reacted to the ruling with a decade-long
campaign of prison-building and early releases that eased the
overcrowding and led to a 1992 ruling by Justice that the
day-to-day running of the prisons could be given back to state
officials _ but the judge retained final oversight for the system
and demanded further improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Monday was in response to a request filed by the
state in 1996 that all federal court oversight be ended. Justice
heard three weeks of testimony last month in Austin, much of it
from prisoners who complained of being mistreated and abused by
guards and other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   John Cornyn, a Republican who was elected Texas' attorney
general in November and inherited the case from his predecessor,
Dan Morales, a Democrat, said that Monday's ruling was regrettable
but not unexpected. At least, he said, it gives state lawyers
something that they can take to a higher appeals court in an
attempt to go over Justice's head and get the ruling overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all along felt this was a first step in a process,'' Cornyn
said. ``We are certainly disappointed and respectfully disagree
with Justice's decision, but all along we felt the final decision
would be made by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
and that's where we head next.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has 30 days to appeal Monday's decision, but the
attorney general left no doubt that it was what he intended to do.
The appeals court will then have two years to issues its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won the battle, but hopefully we will win the war,''
Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 167-page decision Monday, Justice gave lawyers from the
state and lawyers representing the state's prisoners three months
to come up with a reform plan that would satisfy him. If not,
Justice said, he will issue his own plan and force it on state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas prison inmates continue to live in fear, a fear that is
incomprehensible to most of the state's free-world citizens,''
Justice wrote. ``More vulnerable inmates are raped, beaten, owned
and sold by more powerful ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates locked away in what is known as administrative
segregation, a kind of solitary confinement, are subject to
particular abuse, he said, especially those suffering from mental
illnesses. Too often, guards rely on excessive use of force to
maintain control and prisoners are often forced to pay for
protection from other inmates with money, services or sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such practices and conditions cannot stand in our society
under our constitution,'' the judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prison officials have long contended that they have
transformed their state's prison system since the dark days that
led to the initial ruling, making their system at least as good,
and in many cases better than, other prison systems around the
country. While there were still bound to be some abuses in a prison
system so large, they said, the abuses are not frequent or systemic
enough to warrant continued federal court oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is accredited as being among the best in the nation
in safety for inmates, staff and the people of Texas alike,'' Allan
Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, told The
Associated Press. ``It's time to quit wasting time and money on
this needless lawsuit.''

EARLY INTERVENTION CUTS VIOLENCE, SAYS STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A University of Washington study that tracked 600
Seattle schoolchildren for a dozen years found that teaching social
skills and cooperation early to elementary students reduced violent
behavior, alcohol abuse and sexual activity, while boosting
academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Monday by the UW's Social Development
Research Group, found that students who participated between first
and sixth grades ended up with better marks and fewer problems than
their peers through age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that what parents and teachers do in early grades
has long-term effects,'' said David Hawkins, the lead author of the
study and a social work professor at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a panacea, but it is something that we can do at a
reasonable cost to reduce violence and dangerous sexual activity
while helping children improve their academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The program combined special training for students in basic
social skills and conflict resolution with giving teachers better
classroom management tools and offering parents classes in positive
discipline and other strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Children who hit other students were taught how to solve
problems peacefully, while teachers learned how to control their
classes without yelling. Parents developed new strategies for
setting limits at home and worked on helping their children develop
good study habits.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that by age 18, students who took part in the
full program were nearly 20 percent less likely to commit violent
acts and 38 percent less likely to drink heavily than students who
did not receive that training. Full participants also were 35
percent less likely to have caused a pregnancy or become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the full program averaged a 2.42 grade point
average, while children who did not receive any training averaged
2.18.
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 percent of low-income students in the full program
failed a grade, while 30 percent of poor children who did not get
that help were held back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found they were just more committed to getting an education
and more bonded to their school experience,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of investment in the front end isn't just about
being touchy-feely _ it really can work.''
</P>
<P>
   The total cost for children in the full six-year program was
about $3,000 per student.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by several public and private
organizations, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the
federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Burlington Northern
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers began in 1981 when they assigned 600 elementary
students from 18 inner-city Seattle public schools to three
different groups.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the children were in the full intervention
group and received special training in social skills and
cooperative learning in first grade, and then again in sixth grade.
Their teachers received training throughout those years, while
their parents were also offered several classes.
</P>
<P>
   The students' training included everything from learning how to
take turns to empathizing with others' feelings and talking out
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't assume that all children have learned about how to
control aggressive impulses by the time they get to kindergarten,''
Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   In sixth grade, the students were taught ``refusal skills,'' or
how to say no without losing face with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers of students in the full program received five days of
professional development each year until the children finished
sixth grade. That training stressed classroom management skills,
including positive discipline, fostering teamwork and monitoring
all students' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some teachers who weren't too excited about this at
first,'' Hawkins said. ``But by the end of the year, they were
saying it was their best class ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents also were offered two sessions of parenting classes
while their children were in elementary school. Just over 40
percent of those parents participated.
</P>
<P>
   Another one-third of students enrolled in the study did not
receive any special training until they were sixth-graders. Their
parents were offered classes during fifth and sixth grade, while
their teachers also received training.
</P>
<P>
   The final one-third of students, as well as their teachers and
parents, did not receive any extra training and acted as a control
group.
</P>
<P>
   Students were not told which of the three groups they had been
assigned to, and most did not know their status when they were
interviewed at age 18. Forty-five students could not be located for
the final interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that students in the late intervention group,
who didn't get help until sixth grade, had more behavior problems
and less academic success than those who received help earlier,
Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a country investing huge amounts in locking people up
after they have been violent,'' Hawkins said. ``But we don't
seriously invest in them when we should.''
</P>
<P>
   A cost-benefit analysis of the study by an independent
researcher has found that the reduction in violent behavior alone
paid for the cost of providing the program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hawkins also cautioned that while the program reduced
violence, alcohol abuse and sexual activity, those behaviors were
not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, almost half the students in the full program did
commit a violent act during their school years.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that taking part in the program did not
significantly reduce drug abuse and cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins suggested that designing a program that would extend
into middle schools might produce even better results.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and other researchers are continuing to follow these
students as part of another 800-student long-term study.

   RUSSIA-FASCISM (Moscow) _ How dangerous a threat is posed by
neo-fascism is one of the main questions under debate in Russia. It
is not difficult to make a comparison between Russia today and
pre-Hitler Germany _ a collapsed economy, an electorate that feels
bitter and betrayed, a weak central government. But for all the
scare talk, Russia's neo-fascist groups are still small and
marginal. Some experts maintain that they are creatures of the old
KGB, while others argue conspiratorially that they are used by the
authorities to whip up pre-election anxieties that will drive

together an approach of avoiding care whenever possible, and when
it is is not, using hospital emergency rooms or pay-as-you-can
clinics. And many young, single and healthy people, even those with
reasonable incomes, simply take a calculated risk that they will
never need to see a doctor at all. The problem is particularly
acute in New York, where 19.1 percent of the state's residents

the girls were exemplary citizens, bright students and popular. But
neither residents of the area nor school officials nor, least of
all, the parents of the girls, were prepared for what followed last
week: a report from the Delaware County medical examiner's office
that the driver of the car, Loren Wells, 16, of Media, had inhaled
a chemical solvent that could have impaired her judgment. Further

ALBRIGHT DEBATES RIGHTS AND TRADE IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Albright, fresh material
from Tuesday morning in Beijing; No pickup.) 
 (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Trying to infuse the troubled relationship between the
United States and China with a new sense of direction, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright spoke sternly on Tuesday to the
authorities here about human rights but also encouraged them to
move forward on joining the organization that governs world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials
that the United States was disturbed by Beijing's crackdown on
opposition groups and called on them to release a number of
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said at a news conference Tuesday morning that ``in the
last two days we've seen what a candid dialogue looks like'' on
human rights. One administration officials said rights issues were
``prominent but not dominant'' during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit came on the heels of the annual report by the
U.S. government that identifies countries with human rights
problems, which was far more critical of China than last year's
report.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright made clear that the administration
was sticking to an approach that separates human rights from trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined some time ago that it was not a good idea to
link human rights and trade,'' she said on the first day of her
visit on Monday, ``and that we actually make better progress in
both when they are not linked.'' She emphasized the possibility of
membership for China in the World Trade Organization, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Washington and Beijing strained by the roundup
of dissidents, charges that China is trying to hone the accuracy of
its missiles with American technology and a burgeoning trade
deficit. Tuesday, Albright described relations as ``neither the
best of times nor the worst of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the administration has been eager to sound positive about
China's chances of entering the WTO. Albright's comments about
separating trade organization membership from China's human rights
record were the latest in a series of signals Washington is sending
in an effort to prompt the Chinese to make serious market-opening
offers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge obstacles to an agreement. The administration
would have to win the backing of a good part of the American
business community, which is fractured on the issue of exactly what
markets China must open, and how fast.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, China wants assurances that Congress will drop the
annual review of its ``most favored nation'' trade status _ which
despite its name means the rights afforded to most American trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The review has brought an annual congressional debate over the
nature of the economic relationship between the two countries.
Dropping it would require congressional action. And even if the
administration separates China's entry into the trade group from
human rights issues, it is highly unlikely that Congress will keep
them separate.
</P>
<P>
   China views membership in the World Trade Organization as a
matter of national prestige, and the United States has a virtual
veto over who can join the Geneva-based organization, the
rule-maker and arbiter in world trade matters.
</P>
<P>
   In return for membership, Washington has insisted that China
provide a detailed schedule for opening its markets to foreign
goods. But Chinese officials, facing a severe economic slowdown,
are loath to allow international competitors to vie with outmoded
state-owned enterprises that are laying off millions of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit is not likely to stop China's Communist
government from taking further action against dissidents. Late last
week it detained one dissident and handed down an 18-month sentence
in a labor camp to another without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group based in Hong Kong said on Monday that
another dissident planned to form an independent political party. A
recent effort to form such a party brought several arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit also came as other vexing problems with China
surfaced, including the arrest last week of a Chinese citizen in
California whom federal agents charged with trying to obtain a
component vital to missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, Chinese officials did not emphasize that or
other security matters. Instead, they limited their public
criticisms of the United States to its human rights stand.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, with whom Albright spent most of
her time, obliquely warned the United States not to submit a
resolution criticizing China's human rights record at the annual
meeting in Geneva this month of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
He said such ``confrontation'' would not solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is in the midst of a heated internal debate
about whether to go ahead with such a resolution, which is bound to
antagonize the Chinese government.

   The State Department has characterized Albright's trip as a
``business visit,'' intended to develop a system of regular
meetings between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest-level of a constellation of visits to Beijing
in recent and coming days by American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was here last
week, discussing China's beleaguered economy and its possible route
to membership in the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking Chinese membership because it would
force Beijing to agree to a schedule of reductions in tariffs and
trade barriers and would subject China to the rulings of the
organization's court, which enforces trade rules. While reluctant
to lower those barriers, the Chinese want to insure that other
countries _ including the United States _ cannot discriminate
against Chinese-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sees China's desire for membership as
an opportunity for a tangible accomplishment that could move the
relationship between the two countries forward. The United States
is eager to close a deal in time for a scheduled visit by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in early April.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official familiar with Washington's efforts to
get China into the organization said it appeared that Zhu was
serious about the talks and understood the benefits of membership.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been contemplating some ``imaginative
transition'' periods for China's entry so that the uncertain
economy here, particularly some sectors including agriculture,
would not be overwhelmed by the immediate lowering of tariffs, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to human rights, the main complaint from China
during Albright's talks was an American proposal for a missile
defense system in Asia, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have said that if such a system embraces Taiwan, its
deployment will set off a new arms race and deeply harm
Chinese-American relations. A Pentagon study released last week
portrayed a growing threat to Taiwan from a buildup of missiles
along the Chinese coast facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright countered, according to her spokesman, James P. Rubin,
that the system, which is in the design stage, was intended to
protect American troops in the region from threats posed by
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   She told the Chinese that if they improved relations with Taiwan
and stopped their missile buildup near the island, the enthusiasm
in Washington for the theater missile defense system would probably
wane.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also brought up the Clinton administration's
cancellation last week of a satellite sale to China on the ground
that the purchasing company had ties to the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   An Administration official said the Chinese had expressed
puzzlement, arguing that if the United States was interested in
reversing its huge trade deficit with China, it should allow the
Chinese to buy high-technology goods. The deficit, which reached an
all-time high of $57 billion last year, is second only to the
American trade deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On a subject that increasingly concerns the administration,
Albright urged the Chinese to be more helpful in preventing North
Korea, with whom China has diplomatic and military relations, from
becoming a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official called the talks on that subject
constructive, but another official said the Chinese were fairly coy
about how much influence they could or would use with the North
Koreans.
