Wednesday to explore the possibility of expanding trade and
economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for India's External Affairs Ministry told
reporters here that Russia showed interest in importing high
technology from India and setting up joint ventures in civil
aviation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bayi Rockets kept their winning
momentum as they slammed Zhejiang Cyclone 124-100 at a 16th-round
match of the Chinese Basketball League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions slipped into the habitual sluggish form
in the opening stage and had to settle the first quarter for a 29-
all tie after failing to find effective ways to pull away from the
defence-minded home side.
</P>
<P>
Rockets managed to come back on track by sparking a 7-0 run at
the start of the next quarter, only to be replied by Cyclone with
a solid defense which left the visitors scoreless for three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
With six minutes left in the second quarter Li Nan came off the
bench to replace national center Wang Zhizhi, a move proved to be
wise as Bayi regained the control with three pointers.
</P>
<P>
Leading 60-57 into the third quarter Bayi finally found their
rhythm as they showed their quality on both courts and went ahead
into the final quarter with a 15-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
The home side showed signs of fatigue before the fast-attacking
Bayi who easily settled the match in their favor.
</P>
<P>
The win kept Bayi atop the rankings on 31 points, followed by
Guangdong Hongyuan which regained their second placing by a 109-92
win over Liaoning Hunters at home court.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to be Cooperative to Review Tanzanian Union Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar will be
cooperative in the exercise to review articles of the union
between itself and Tanganyika in order to iron out problems within
the 36-year-old structure.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Isles' President Salmin Amour during
his addressing the nation to mark the 36th anniversary of the
Zanzibar Revolution at the Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar and the mainland of Tanzania want the articles of the
union to be updated in line with political and economic changes
taking place in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his 90-minute address, Amour said that a clear-cut
definition of union and non-union matters is necessary to remove
contradictions resulting to unnecessary conflicts between the two
sides of the union.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the union is there to stay and will be
defended at any cost because the structure is vital for the
country's development.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on constitutional reforms, Amour observed the need
to respect the views expressed by the majority of citizens through
a survey organized by a presidential committee last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee's report, a total of 58,750 people
or 88.87 percent of the population favored the current
two-government system (the Union government and the Zanzibar
government) rather than a proposed three- government structure
(the Union, the Zanzibar and the Tanganyika government) .
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar joined Tanganyika in 1964
to form the United Republic of Tanzania, but it has remained a
semiautonomous state with its own government and parliament.

MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, leader of

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges Israel to Release More Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) called on Israel to release more Palestinian political
prisoners, especially the sick and old who have spent long periods
in jails, on charges of attacking Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Qaddorah Faris, member of the Joint Palestinian-Israeli
committee and in charge of prisoners affairs, was quoted Thursday
by Voice of Palestine as urging Israel to release all the sick and
elderly political prisoners as well as seven detainees who served
20 years in jail and three female prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Faris made the call during a committee meeting held in west
Jerusalem on Wednesday, co-chaired by Palestinian Minister of State
for Prisoners Affairs Hisham Abdul-Raziq and Director General of
Israeli Internal Security Erie Schevman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the next release of Palestinian prisoners
that will include Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, Faris
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli opposition have been slamming the government for
including East Jerusalem prisoners in the list of release, which
they said undermined the Israeli claim to the whole of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and
declared the city, also holy to Muslims, as its "eternal and
undivided" capital. The Palestinians, however, want the east part
as capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues to be resolved at the
final-status negotiations, which are expected to produce a
permanent peace accord between the two sides by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two sides also confirmed that there have been
riots inside the Israeli jails and the Palestinian asked Israel to
stop practises that enrage Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 383 Palestinian political detainees in three
batches under the Sharm el Sheikh peace accord signed last
September. There are still some 1,500 such detainees inside Israeli
jails, according to Palestinian sources.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Campaign Against Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their assaults on rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
Thursday and fiercer fighting there have prompted the increase of
refugee exodus to neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have completed the blocking of the rebel
formations in the area of the villages Belgatoi, Tsentoroi and
Benoi-Vedeno in the Vedeno and Shali districts, the Interfax news
agency reported, citing sources with the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Up to 40 rebels were killed and three weapon emplacements and
nine trucks destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, the Chechen capital, federal Russian troops continue
to be engaged in trench fighting, with artillery fire against
rebel position in the city as well as in neighboring areas Roshni-
Chu, Yaryshmardy, Chishki, Ulus-Kert, Khimoi, and Chernorechye.
</P>
<P>
One federal serviceman was killed and three wounded over the
last 24 hours, Interfax said, citing official information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, interior troops continued the special operation of"
cleaning up" Chechen areas under federal control.
</P>
<P>
General Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of Russia's general staff, said
the Russian flag had been hoisted and a police station set up in
the Chechen village of Nozhai-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
He told the NTV television station that federal forces had
occupied the village of Sharoi and nearly all of the Sharoi
district in Chechnya's mountainous part.
</P>
<P>
Following intensified fighting in Chechnya, the number of
refugees fleeing the republic is rising again, exceeding the
number of people coming back.
</P>
<P>
The return of refugees to Chechnya has been suspended following
militant attacks on the towns of Argun, Shali and Gudermes,
director of the Russian Federal Migration Service Vladimir
Kalamanov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have strengthened the screening of Chechen
refugees crossing the borders with neighboring regions, but the
tougher measures came under fire from Ruslan Aushev, president of
the neighboring Ingushetia republic.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Have New Aircraft Carriers in 2012 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it will
have two new aircraft carriers by the year 2012 that will rank
among the world's biggest warships.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Minister John Spellar pledged that the British-
built ships, nearly double the size of the current Invincible
class of aircraft carriers, would boast the latest state-of-the-
art technical wizardry.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the carriers would total about 2.0 billion pounds(
about 3.29 billion U.S. dollars) and an additional 7.0 billion
pounds would be spent on its aircraft, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to build the new warships was first made by former
Defense Secretary George Robertson in his Strategic Defense Review,
a major shake-up of Britain's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The aim is for Britain to be able to act fast and effectively
in future, with mobile and well armed rapid reaction forces as
trouble spots flared around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out Britain's ambitious plans for its navy in the new
millennium, Spellar said the new warships would be crucial in
dealing with international crises as and when they erupted.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces will have to travel to the crisis, operate and be
sustained at considerable distance from their home bases," the
report quoted Spellar as saying.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed how to make progress in the
negotiations, State Department spokesman James Rubin said. But he
declined to comment on whether Clinton asked Assad to make a
symbolic gesture toward Israel to make it easier for the Israelis
to sell peace at home.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel wound up their peace talks on Monday in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia, without any results. A new round of
talks were scheduled on January 19, but the site has yet to be
decided. It is expected to be around the Washington area again.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli newspaper published a secret U.
S. working document that listed the points of accord and discord
between Syria and Israel. The document was presented by Clinton
last Friday to the leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the publication of the document was "damaging. It
harms the cause of peace; it makes it harder for the kind of
confidentiality that's necessary to make decisions to be
understood or expected by those who have to make decisions."

<HEADLINE> United States Seeks Intelligence Base in Panama: Legislator. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States
government seeks desperately to establish in the shortest term
possible an information gathering center in Panamanian territory,
Panamanian legislator Miguel Bush said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the Pentagon intentions to install the
intelligence center seriously damages the Panamanian state
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"They are desperate to control through this information center,
the transportation of the cargo that traverses the Panama Canal
toward third countries," said the legislator to the Panamanian
radio station RPC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. authorities meddling in the control of
the cargo in the canal is very dangerous for Panama.
</P>
<P>
"We are drafting a proposal to establish a security and
intelligence center owned by Panama, far removed from the United
States influence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's intentions to establish an information center in
Panama have unleashed a controversy in all the Panamanian
political sectors, which question the U.S. intervention in
national security .
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that she
will make a seven-hour visit to Panama Saturday in which she will
meet with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe will leave here for Mozambique on Friday to attend a summit
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Mozambique, Mugabe will also witness the
inaugural ceremony of President Joaquim Chissano, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders will hold a one-day special summit on Sunday
which is likely to come up with a common position for the
forthcoming United Nations Security Council session on the peace
process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on January
24 to 28 in New York.
</P>
<P>
President of the DRC Laurent Kabila has demanded that the
United States, which holds the Security Council presidency this
month, order the pull-out of Ugandan and Rwandan troops from his
country before he agrees to attend the U.N. session.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of all five countries involved in the DRC civil war
and Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba have been invited to the
U.N. session.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to help Kabila's army
fight rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda after the rebellion
broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Agreement was signed by all the belligerents
in July and August last year but the war has been raging on with
both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The lack of urgency in the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping
force and failure by the world body to provide adequate resources
have been blamed for the fragile peace process.

HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Prega Ramsamy, acting executive
secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Thursday called for foreign investment in the region to boost its
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We need investment in our region to stimulate economic
growth," He was quoted as saying in a statement by Zimbabwe News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramsamy, a regional consultative conference will
be held in Swaziland next month to provide dialogue between SADC
and its international cooperating partners in an effort to attract
investment.
</P>
<P>
The conference would lead to greater investment opportunities,
the identification of areas of financial and technical assistance
and improved strategies for effective aid coordination, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said political, economic and social issues would also be
discussed at the conference in search for a better understanding
of matters such as good governance, democracy, finance and
investment, economic growth and international politics.
</P>
<P>
"This crucial meeting to us provides regular dialogue between
SADC and its international cooperating partners," the acting
executive secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We need a regional growth rate of above 6.5 percent
to make a dent on poverty and create gainful jobs."
</P>
<P>
"It is through economic growth that jobs would be created,
contributing to the prosperity of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged SADC members to work tirelessly to find ways to
resolve the remaining conflicts in the region and to pave the way
for enhanced cooperation and integration.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Disappointed at Violation of Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Thursday
expressed its disappointment at the continuous violations of the
ceasefire agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Erick Silwamba told the
fourth plenary session of the Joint Military Commission (JMC) here
that many violators of the Lusaka peace agreement have managed to
get away with the action without anything being done.
</P>
<P>
He urged the JMC to come up with suggestions on how to deal
with the similar violations in future.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Salim Ahamed Salim and members of the JMC should quickly
finalize all the issues discussed in the past as the outcome would
form part of the agenda for the meeting of the Political Committee
scheduled for Harare, Zimbabwe, early next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba expressed confidence that through their experience and
 commitment to peace in the DRC, they will overcome all the
difficulties and differences which might arise in the course of
the session.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier, JMC interim Chairman Timothy Kazembe said the
 commission will consider the violations of the ceasefire
agreement and make sure that it is well implemented.
</P>
<P>
In July and August last year, all the belligerents involved in
the DRC conflict signed the ceasefire agreement in Lusaka but the
implementation of the agreement is not satisfactory, with
violations often reported.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African Foreign Minister Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo died of illness on Thursday at the age
of 75. In honor of him, the national flag will be flown at half
mast throughout the country from Monday until Nzo's funeral,
President Thabo Mbeki announced in a statement read at a press
conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was deeply saddened by the departure of "this
great African patriot".
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government and the people of South Africa,
Mbeki expressed condolences to Nzo's wife, Regina, and his family.
</P>
<P>
"Alfred Nzo dedicated all his life to the struggle of the
oppressed for freedom. To his last day, he was an unwavering
champion of non-racialism and non-sexism. He stood for a united
country and people," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo died at Olivedale Clinic in Randburg, Johannesburg. He
suffered a stroke last month and had been in hospital ever since.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, South Africa's first post-apartheid foreign minister,
dedicated almost his entire life to the country's liberation
struggle. He was born in 1925 and received a missionary education
in the Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
In 1945, he joined the African National Congress (ANC) Youth
League and became active in student politics.
</P>
<P>
After South Africa's first democratic general elections in
1994, Nzo was elected Minister of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said Nzo's death came at a time when his leadership
skills and political perception were "desperately" needed as the
country is preparing itself for the second local government
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC regrets the sudden and untimely death of one of the
most experienced veterans and stalwarts of the South African
liberation movement, " ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Thursday that Moscow is ready to receive a
delegation of senior officials of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the statement during a meeting with Hassan Rouhani,
secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed situation in the North Caucasus region, where
Russian federal troops are carrying out a campaign to root out
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov thanked the Iranian leadership for humanitarian aid to
the population of the North Caucasus, Tass said, quoting the
Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also "expressed their opposition to attempts to
upset the long- established balance of forces and interests" in
the Caspian, Trans-Caucasian and Central Asian regions, a Foreign
Ministry communique said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides shared the view that "the problems of security and
the future economic development of these regions must be tackled
with the priority participation of and attention to the interests
of the states located in those regions, and without external
interference," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also "expressed identical or similar views on
many present-day problems, including the rejection of the one-
polar world setup, the preservation of the ABM Treaty, the
struggle against international terrorism and human rights," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
Rouhani arrived here Tuesday on an official visit. He is
scheduled to meet with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Turkey's Decision on Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday welcomed
Turkey's decision to suspend the death sentence imposed on Kurdish
leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this decision as the manifestation of the readiness
of the Turkish leadership to take the opinion of the international,
primarily the European public into account, although with certain
reservations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevgeny Voronin said.
</P>
<P>
"For its own part, Russia has urged Ankara many times to follow
the high principles of humanness in the Ocalan case," the Interfax
news agency quoted Voronin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made the decision to delay the execution of Ocalan,
leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Wednesday
at the tripartite summit of the country's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling partners reached an agreement to hold the file, sent
by the Justice Ministry earlier this month, and to wait for the
ruling by the European Court of Human Rights on the case. The
process could take some 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Ankara said the decision was made following tough
talks, indicating the opinion that the execution could lead to an
escalation of separatist terrorism, hurt the process of Turkish
full membership in the European Union and worsen the country's
economy prevailed.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish commandos last February in Kenya
and condemned to hanging in June by a Turkish court for treason
and separatism.
</P>
<P>
The PKK had been leading a war against government troops for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey that claimed some 37,
000 lives. It announced a cease- fire in August, a move
interpreted by the government as an attempt to save Ocalan's life.
</P>
<P>
The European Court has asked Turkey not to carry out the
sentence against Ocalan until it reviews the case. Turkey has not
executed anybody since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Work on Refugees in Africa Is No Easy Job, Ogata Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She made the statement at an open Security Council debate on
refugees in Africa, whose plight has been long neglected by donor
nations compared to war victims in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the internally displaced is often more arduous
than with refugees who cross borders," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty of having access to large number of people in
insecure and isolated areas is compounded by the complexity of
assisting civilians in their own country -- where their own state
authorities, or rebel forces in control, are frequently the very
cause of their predicament," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of people at risk in war areas such as
South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Angola and
Sierra Leone -- a majority of them internally displaced -- are
presently not accessible to humanitarian agencies," she said.
</P>
<P>
"And where such access is possible, it is often very dangerous,
" she said. "The killing of two United Nations staff members in
Burundi last November is just the last of many such fatal
incidents affecting humanitarian personnel."
</P>
<P>
Current refugee crises also have other complex aspects, she
said. "The security, socio-economic and natural environment of
countries of asylum are severely affected by large forced
population movements."
</P>
<P>
War-induced, mass population movements have also contributed to
the spreading of conflicts, as has been the case in Central and
West Africa, she said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no solution to refugee crises -- and especially
no voluntary repatriation -- if wars that force people to flee are
not stopped," she said. "Conflicts, in turn, will not be resolved
unless some basic power sharing problems are addressed."

ATHENS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece's electricity supply to
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo will be included within the
framework of humanitarian aid to the region, a Greek government
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a request from Kosovo's U.N.-appointed civil
governor, Bernard Kouchner, Greece agreed last week to send much-
needed power to Kosovo, which has been hit by power shortages
after its electricity grid was badly damaged by NATO air strikes
last year.
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled Greek Public Power Corporation (DEH) has
informed U.N. authorities in Kosovo that it can supply electricity
up to 500 megawatts through Albania and the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), but so far no electricity had been
transferred through the countries due to network faults.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Barred From Holding Political Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean civil servants will
with effect from this month be barred from holding positions in
any political party, but will still be free to join political
parties of their choice, Zimbabwe News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the national news agency, Acting Public Service,
Labor and Social Welfare Minister John Nkomo said a new public
service regulation barring civil servants from holding political
party positions would be gazetted sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cabinet had already approved the new regulation and
the Public Service Commission would determine the exact date when
it should come into effect.
</P>
<P>
Asked why such a regulation was made just before the 2000
parliamentary elections scheduled for March this year, Nkomo said
there is nothing sinister about the timing but only that the
government wants a civil service that is professional and
efficient.
</P>
<P>
The regulation would ensure that the public service would
concentrate on its core-business and thereby improve efficiency to
meet public demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Zimbabwean civil servants, except all uniformed
forces, were free to take top positions in political parties as
long as their participation did not interfere with the laid-down
government regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, the new regulation contradicts the views expressed in
the past by senior ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) officials, who felt that
government workers should not only be free to join political
parties but also should be able to take top posts, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a group of senior civil servants have
recently been nominated to the ZANU-PF Central Committee and to
the provincial leadership.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Committee Blocks Another 30 Contracts: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's trade ministry announced
on Thursday that the United Nations Sanctions Committee had
suspended another 30 contracts Iraq signed under the oil-for-food
program, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said the U.S. and and British
delegates at the Sanctions Committee put on hold those contracts
during the committee's sessions on January 4-6.
</P>
<P>
Those contracts were concluded with companies from Saudi Arabia,
Oman, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Japan, Russia, Turkey and France for
the purchases of drilling equipment, oil spare parts, generators,
lab equipment, sprinkling irrigation systems, tankers and safety
equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in Iraq in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Revive Hope in Drought-hit Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains that continued over the
last week in the Palestinian self-rule areas revived hope among the
Palestinians who have suffered from water shortages over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Meteorological Department (PMD) said the rainfall
had reached a satisfactory level in most of the Palestinian
territories since January 4.
</P>
<P>
On January 4 and 5, the rainfall in West Bank city of Bethlehem
hit 93 millimeters, or half the rainfall in the province last year.
</P>
<P>
In other West Bank towns and cities, Ramallah and Hebron
witnessed short snowfalls for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus and Tulkarm, the rainfall reached 66 millimeters and
77 millimeters respectively, according to the PMD.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip town of Khan-Yunis, the rainfall was 33
millimeters, the PMD said.
</P>
<P>
Rains saved the current agricultural season as they increased
the subterranean water level and purified the soil, according to
Palestinian agriculturalists.
</P>
<P>
The rains will also benefit the summer cultivation of wheat and
rye as will as olive and orange trees.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts pointed out that the land was still in
need of more rains after two years of drought.
</P>
<P>
The water situation in the Gaza is still serious. The area has
no river or lake and depends on 2,000 wells to meet its needs of
potable and irrigation water. The subterranean water reserve does
not exceed 1 billion cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian official sources said Israel controls 80 percent of
the water resources in the West Bank. The level of Palestinian
household water consumption is lower than the minimum level set by
the World Health Organization.

<HEADLINE> 25 Lebanese Released by Israeli-Allied Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Lebanese guerrillas
and others accused of aiding them, were released by Israeli-allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) on Thursday from prisons in Israeli-
occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were freed as a goodwill gesture marking the new
year and Id Al-Fitr, the holidays marking the end of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan, the SLA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Another five guerrillas of the Hezbollah had been released by
the SLA last December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla targets
in mountainous regions in south Lebanon on Thursday, for the third
consecutive day, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claim to protect its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. The zone covers about one 10th of the Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrilla groups, spearheaded by the Iranian and
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been fighting to
drive Israeli occupation troops and their allied SLA out of the
area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Rise 3 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the Department said that the price pressures were largely
confined to the energy sector. If excluding energy and food,
wholesale prices pick up just 0.9 percent last year, better than a
2.5 percent increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 3 percent gain in last year's wholesale prices was the
largest annual increase since a 5.7 percent rise in 1990 and it
stemmed from a huge 18.4 percent rebound in energy costs, which
had fallen sharply in 1998 as the Asian currency crisis depressed
global demand.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed to the well-behaved performance all year of
the core PPI rate, which excludes energy and food, as evidence
that inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
In December, the Producer Price Index was just up 0.3 percent.
The December advance came from a big rise in gasoline and other
energy prices. Outside food and energy, wholesale prices rose only
0.1 percent and suggesting that price increases in other areas
were tame.
</P>
<P>
Last month, energy prices increased 1.2 percent, following a 1.
4 percent rise the month before. An 8.5 percent jump in gasoline
prices led the way, the biggest advance since August. For the year,
gasoline prices rose a whopping 76.4 percent, the largest annual
gain since a 78 percent rise in May 1980.
</P>
<P>
Heating oil rose 3.8 percent in December, but prices for
residential electric power and natural gas declined. Residential
natural gas prices dropped by 2.9 percent, the lowest level since
April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food costs rose 0.4 percent in December, pushing the
total increase for 1999 to 0.9 percent, compared with a 0.1
percent gain for all of 1998. Sharp increases in the prices of
beef, pork, and vegetables in December offset decreases in the
prices of eggs,turkeys and fish.
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the rise in December's overall
wholesale prices was a 0.7 percent increase in the car prices.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Department said the number of new
claims for unemployment benefits was unchanged at 309,000 for the
week ending on January 8. The four-week moving average, which
smooths out week-to-week volatility, grew to 294,000.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Calls for Immediate Arms Scrapping of IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First
Minister David Trimble said on Thursday the Irish Republican Army
must begin to hand over its arms this month or risk destroying the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the republicans...to produce the necessary progress
in January," he told reporters after more than an hour of talks
with Prime Minister Tony Blair at his Downing Street residence.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's pro-British Ulster Unionist Party is due to review
the peace process in February and Trimble himself has threatened
to resign as head of the province's new government if the IRA has
not started to hand in its guns.
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla disarmament remains to be the most thorny issue of
the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the province's independent disarmament commission,

Trimble said his party had fulfilled all its obligations under
the landmark Good Friday Agreement and the review into the process
under former U.S. Senator George Mitchell.

<P>
The IRA and other main guerrilla groups agreed late last year

peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Will Continue to Focus on Development, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
continue to focus on the issue of development in the years ahead
after its efforts over past years to make the issue a central work
of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement at ceremonial meeting to mark the
formal turnover of the chairmanship of the Group of 77 (G-77) from
Guyana to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Development -- and especially international cooperation for
development -- continues to occupy a central place in our work,"
he said. "In the year to come, as in the year or two that have
just passed, much of that work will no doubt focus on the impact
and implications of globalization."
</P>
<P>
First, the 10th session of the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X), to be held just four weeks from now,
offers a major opportunity to strengthen and advance the position
of developing countries in the area of trade, Annan said. "After
the imbroglio in Seattle, it is vital that we pick up the pieces
and explore ways of making trade work better for the poor."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the General Assembly will be discussing the
organizational and substantive details of the international event
on financing for development, which it has agreed to hold in 2001,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and the Bretton Woods Institutions attach great
importance to this process, but only with the help of a united G-
77 can we hope for a successful outcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, this year's high-level segment of the U.N. Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) will address the issue of information
technology and its role as the backbone of today's knowledged-
based economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond these three areas, the year will also feature vital
follow-up meetings to the Beijing and Copehhagen conferences," he
said. "And all of this activity will culminate, in the Autumn,
with the Millennium Assembly and Millennium Summit," which will be
convened in September this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican and Swazi
governments agreed here on Thursday to enhance cooperation in
dealing with the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the end of an extraordinary
two-day meeting of the Mozambique/Swaziland Sub-Committee on
Defence,Security and Immigration. The meeting was called following
mass deportation last December of Mozambicans living in Swaziland,
without any prior notice to the Mozambican authorities.
</P>
<P>
The two sides concluded that joint monitoring of repatriation
operations and strengthened communications are necessary. The
consular officials of the two countries must be notified in
advance whenever any repatriation is pending.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations also agreed to set up a working group that
should meet regularly to discuss the situation of the immigrants
of both countries.
</P>
<P>
A final statement from the meeting stressed the importance of
"dialog and tolerance" in dealing with any dispute, taking into
consideration the existing friendly relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Provincial Capital Runs Short of Electric Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Angolan city of Uige has been
deprived of electricity supply for about two weeks, primitively
due to the lack of fuel oil for the generator group, official
source said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Uige, the capital city of the northern Uige
Province, has experienced several days without transportation by
motor-driven cars and a dozen of darkling nights in dead silence,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
Oil and lubricant supply for the provincial capital was
transported by air from the Negage Airport which is currently
under repair due to the bad state, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Due to the scarcity of electric power, local radio station has
been totally paralyzed since Monday, leaving the city in dead
silence and without any entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Many motor-driven vehicles have been parked in the depots due
to the galloping rise of the prices of gasoline and lubricant in
the informal markets in the city of Uige, with gasoline priced at
nine kwanza (1.5 U.S. dollars) per liter and diesel oil at 10
kwanza (1.67 U.S. dollars) per liter, said the official news
agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil-producing country in Africa,
with its daily output of 750,000 barrels of petroleum.

<HEADLINE> 160 Israelis Die of Flu-related Complications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Flu-related pneumonia has
claimed the lives of at least 160 Israelis during the first week of
this year, Health Ministry sources confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this year's flu conditions are extreme and
unprecedented. The flu laboratory at the Central Laboratory for
Viruses has found that the current flu viruses are being spread at
a rate five times higher than the norm.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate in the first week of 2000 is 166 percent
higher than the average such deaths during the first week of each
year over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether these conditions in Israel have any
relations with the flu epidemic erupted through the whole world,
which had harshly hit Sweden, Canada, France and so on.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Israel have been crammed with victims of the flu
outbreak since a few days ago, with the internal medicine
departments and the pediatrics departments the most crowded.
</P>
<P>
The pediatrics department of Nahariya hospital registered a 220
percent occupancy on Monday, while the internal medicine department
at the Laniado hospital in Netanya was filled at 215 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli virologists said that the current situation
does not involve any new strains of the flu virus, but only a
combination of several viruses that were already found in the flu
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Professor Avraham Morag, director of the clinical virology
department at Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, recommended high-risk
people to be vaccinated with the flu vaccine.
</P>
<P>
While the vaccine does not guarantee that a person will not get
the flu, it does make it less likely and reduce the severity of the
attack if it happen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Willing to Fund Israeli-Syrian Deal: Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is willing
to provide "substantial" sums of money to Israel for a future peace
agreement between Israel and Syria, a visiting U.S. Senate
delegation said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While finding the money will be tough, the U.S. would continue
its trend of generously funding Middle East peace initiatives, said
Ted Stevens, who was heading a five-member delegation of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, giving money to Syria for its role in a peace treaty
would be more difficult, because Syria is still on a U.S. list of
countries supporting terrorism, said Stevens, chairman of the
powerful committee which would set the tone for any financing.
</P>
<P>
Removing Syria from the list would require Damascus to prove
that it had renounced support for terrorism, he added.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Arlen Specter, from Pennsylvanian, noted that
U.S. foreign aid has consistently dropped in recent years,
suggesting the European Union, Japan and Gulf states help fund the
Israeli-Syrian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The senators said they did not discuss the price tag with
Israeli leaders during their two-day visit to Israel, which began
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But they dismissed as premature Israeli reports that withdrawal
from the Golan Heights would cost anywhere from 10 billion to 30
billion U.S. dollars. Such figures would only scare off U.S.
taxpayers, they said.
</P>
<P>
The group toured the Golan Heights and then met with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The senators visited the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on
Thursday, and heard more security briefings from Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh, Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz and top
officers of the military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian negotiators will resume their talks in the
United States on January 19, after the second round ended in West
Virginia on Monday with no tangible progress.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, revived last December in the U.S.
after a freeze of nearly four year, focus on the strategic Golan
Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war,
water rights, security arrangements and normalization of relations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Easing Ban on Return of Puppet PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Thursday denied
local reports that it has eased the ban on the return of Al Aa
Hussein, prime minister of the puppet Kuwaiti government during the
Iraqi occupation almost a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
"What has been published by one of the local newspapers in this
regard is baseless," said Mohammad Deifallah Sharar, deputy prime
minister and minister of state for cabinet and national assembly
(parliament) affairs, in a statement to the official Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
A story carried by local Arabic daily Al-Watan said Al Aa, who
chaired the so-called temporary government during Iraq's seven-
month occupation 1990-1991, expressed desire to return to Kuwait to
resume his appeal to the death sentence issued against him.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Kuwaiti authority raised "no objection to
his return to the country because there were no orders to ban him
from entering," the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa and other senior members in his short-lived puppet regime
fled the country when Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by the
multi-national forces in 1991. He is said to be in exile in a
Scandinavian country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Businesses Urged to Adapt to Fast Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore businesses have
been urged to adapt themselves to the fast changing world and
always to be responsible to changes so as to survive and succeed
in meeting challenges brought out by globalization and rapid
technical advance.
</P>
<P>
The urging echoed at the International Day seminar held
Thursday by the Trade Development Board of Singapore, which was
designed to bring business community together for a discussion and
exchange of ideas and views to address some of the major concerns
facing business today.
</P>
<P>
In his key-note address to some 800 participants, Singapore
Minister for Communications and Information Technology Yeo Cheow
Tong said that "the globalization of trade and commerce, the rapid
technological advances in the telecommunications and IT industry,
and the pervasiveness of the Internet will very quickly lead to
the emergence of the new 'Digital or Net Economy'."
</P>
<P>
"Given today's one-click technology, the global marketplace has
become smaller and the competition has grown more intense," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To survive and succeed in the Net Economy, businesses must
learn to compete on a global basis and against others who can
consistently offer better and more innovative products at more
competitive prices," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "This is why we have been urging local
companies to venture beyond Singapore's shores and seek out new
markets both for ideas and market share."
</P>
<P>
"Our companies must realize that the most valuable commodity
traded these days is creativity, especially web-related creativity,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
TDB Chairman Stephen Lee told the seminar that "Increasingly,
as the world converges and age-old boundaries begin to lose ground,
our companies must be savvy enough to know how to interpret global
developments and to appreciate the impact of new trade policies on
business."
</P>
<P>
"They will need to spot trends affecting international
businesses and to translate them to their advantage," he
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Chris Meyer, Director of the Ernst &AMP; Young Center for Business
Innovation and co-author of the book BLUR: The Speed of Change in
the Connected Economy, said in his address via videoconference
that the economic world is experiencing a major change, from the
industrial age to the information age, and the new economy is
being transformed by speed, connectivity and intangibles as the
primary drivers of value.
</P>
<P>
"Products versus service; buyer versus seller; employee versus
employer; work versus life -- all these distinctions are being
blurred," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged businesses "to start with throwing away all the
traditional definition used by managers" in order to succeed in a
fast changing world.
</P>
<P>
Some other speakers stressed that the success in the new
millennium depends on how well businesses exploit the most
valuable assets: knowledge, skill and people.
</P>
<P>
"These are the keys to producing high-value capital and
advanced business practices," they said, noting " these are what
drive the heart of a modern knowledge-based economy."
</P>
<P>
TDB first launched the International Day in 1996 and the event
has since been held once every year and grown in size and stature
to become one of the major events in the local business calendar.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM "Encouraged" by Thai Economic Recovery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi was "encouraged" by the Thai economic
recovery but stressed that more should be done to achieve a
sustainable one, Sadaaki Numata, Japanese Foreign Ministry's press
secretary, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi told his Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai during their one-
hour talks earlier Thursday that Japan will help Thailand in its
economic recovery, particularly in aspects of foreign direct
investment and human resources development, Numata said at a news
briefing after the talks.
</P>
<P>
About the upcoming Group-of-Eight (G-8) summit to be held in
the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in July, Chuan wished
Japan, as the only Asian country in the group, to convey Asia's
view at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the industrialized countries, represented by G-8,
still have barriers for trade.
</P>
<P>
He called on the industrialized countries to give equal
opportunities for competition to developing nations and cooperate
with the latter in forums like the International Monetary Fund and
the World Trade Organization so that climate can be fostered for
developing countries to compete and survive in globalization.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi thanked Chuan for his suggestions, the press secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
As for bilateral cooperation, Obuchi said that Japan is
planning to send experts to help Thailand's small and medium-sized
enterprises and a separate mission to study the investment
opportunities in Thailand's big businesses in March.
</P>
<P>
Japan also wanted Thailand to continue to improve the quality
of its agricultural products, such as rice, tapioca, natural
rubber and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that Japan and Thailand are all undergoing bold
structural reforms and Japan will continue its support to Thailand
in this respect.
</P>
<P>
As for regional issues, both side discussed ways to narrow the
economic disparity among Mekong sub-regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan also pledged to extend loans of 4 billion yen (38 million
U.S. dollars) each for Thailand and Laos to construct the second
international bridge over the Mekong river.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also exchange views on the East Timor
issue and the upcoming the 10th United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development scheduled to be held here in February.

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
held a milestone meeting Thursday with the leaders of France's 4.5
million strong Muslim community, officially endorsing Islam as a
major religion of France along with Catholicism, Protestantism and
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a French president to receive Muslim
leaders at the Elysee presidential palace at the New Year's season,
a gesture hailed by all Muslim leaders as historic.
</P>
<P>
"Islam, from now on, is part of the landscape of the republic

<P>

purpose of the meeting is "to officially present them and all
Muslims in France with the good wishes of the president."
</P>
<P>
Until now, the French president has given New Year good wishes
only to Catholic, Protestant and Judaist worshippers.
</P>
<P>
With 4.5 million worshippers, most of whom are immigrants from
Muslim countries, Islam has become France's second largest
religion after the Roman Catholic Church, according to the French
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Islam was allowed to install in France after the country
separated Catholic Church with the power of the state in 1905.
</P>
<P>
However, no French law exists yet to fix the conditions of its
practice and there is no national representative body for the
religion.
</P>
<P>
Islam saw its roots greatly strengthened in France with the
arrival of the great immigrant labor force from Maghreb countries
of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as black Africa and
Turkey, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Most Muslims in France practice their religion in their homes
and do not go to mosques frequently. In the Parisian region with
at least two million Muslims, only 40,000 people go to the 417
local mosques regularly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a young generation of Muslim immigrants, claiming
both Islamic and European cultures at the same time, has become an
import part of the French society.
</P>
<P>
France's most popular football star, Zinedine Zidane, is from
Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gathering to Deny Nanjing Massacre Arouses Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and Japanese
people have protested against the Japanese right-wing's planned
gathering in Osaka on January 23 to deny the reality of the
Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Hall to Victims of the Nanjing Massacre and the
Research Institute of the Nanjing Massacre have presented letters
of protests to the Osaka City government and the Osaka
International Peace Center.
</P>
<P>
Historians, jurists, media professionals and students in
Nanjing have also held meetings to protest against the coming
Osaka gathering.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengshan, curator of the memorial in east China's Jiangsu
Province, said that the organizer of the gathering, Noshudo
Higashinaka, has always denied the Nanjing Massacre, saying in his
several articles that the Nanjing incident was actually
perpetrated by the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
The truth of the Nanjing Massacre is known worldwide, and no
one can deny the facts, said Kan Matsuoka, a Japanese friend who
visited Nanjing recently.
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese anti-war and peace associations have also
protested the coming gathering when they first got to know it from
a report in Japan's Asahi Shimbun on December 20 last year. A
website named "Peaceful Osaka" has also been opened to try to stop
the gathering, said Zhu.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Sets Record in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's imports and exports
reached 165.8 billion US dollars and 194.9 billion US dollars,
respectively, in 1999, both all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the country's import and
export volumes increased 18.2 percent and 6.1 percent,
respectively, on a yearly basis, despite the influence of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's total foreign trade volume hit 360.7 billion US dollars
in 1999, an 11.3 percent growth over 1998.
</P>
<P>
China had a favorable balance of trade of 29.1 billion US
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the General Administration of
Customs, the country's foreign trade declined in the first half of
last year, but picked up momentum in the second half thanks of the
implementation of a series of preferential policies and the
general recovery of the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
From July to December 1999, China's exports increased by 15.8
percent to 112.1 billion US dollars.

Yeltsin thanked Jiang for expressing friendship in a telegraph
sent by the Chinese president when Yeltsin resigned the Russian
presidency on New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Jiang that through their active cooperation in the
past few years Russia-China relations have embarked on a track of
steady development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the substantial development of China-Russia
relations in recent years owes much to Yeltsin's concern and
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that further expanding and deepening the strategic
and cooperative China-Russia partnership conforms to the
fundamental interests of both sides, and is helpful for promoting
multipolarization.

 FM Spokesman: U.S. Should Correct
</P>
<P>
 Decision on Human Rights Proposal
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao today urged the
United States to immediately stop interfering in China's internal
affairs on the pretext of human rights, and correct the erroneous
decision to propose a resolution concerning China at the 56th
meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Slamming the "double standard" on the human rights issue and
the "politicization" of human rights, Zhu stressed that "fact has
proven and will continue to prove that the United States will
encounter another failure if it insists on doing so."
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Missile Development Programs Harmful for Global
</P>
<P>
Strategic Balance and Stability, FM Spokesman
</P>
<P>
China has today expressed "serious concern" over a massive
missile development program of the United States, describing it as
"going against the tide of times and being harmful to the global
arms control efforts."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
in response to a report at a regular press conference today that
the Clinton administration required U.S. congress to allocate
additional 2.2 billion U.S. dollars for the development of
National Missile Defense system (NMD).
</P>
<P>
"Such move goes against the tide of our times and is
detrimental to the global efforts of arms control and disarmament,
" he said, adding it will have an extensive and deep adverse
impact on the international and regional strategic balance and
stability in the 21st century.

Chinese law-enforcing authorities are investigating into the
case of a man by the name Song Yongyi who is accused of illegally
purchasing and collecting intelligence for overseas, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at today's press conference.

"We are willing to maintain and develop the friendly
cooperation with Pakistan in various fields," he stressed.

<P>
"Political Asylum" May Encourage Illegal Immigration, Spokesman
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration could be encouraged given that relevant
countries blindly believed stories made up by illegal immigrants
and accommodated their pleas for "political asylum", said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a regular press conference in response
to reports about illegal Chinese immigrants being detained by the
U.S. in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
China has noticed such reports but has not yet received
verified details, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently opposed illegal immigration and have
taken a series of effective measures to curb it," he said.

 Allegation of China's Infiltration in Panama Canal Fabrication
</P>
<P>
The allegation of China's infiltrating in and exerting
influence on the Panama Canal is "sheer fabrication with ulterior
motives," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in response to the allegation in a United
States Pentagon report that China attempts to take a dominant
share of the Panama Canal through a Hong Kong-based company so as
to transport military equipment.

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Targets 7.5 Pct GDP Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Other major socio-economic targets of the Vietnamese capital
city for 2000 include a total investment of nearly 11.9 trillion
Vietnamese dong (850 million U.S. dollars), a drop in birth rate
by 0.03 percent, employment generation for additional 55,000
people, and reduction of poor households to one percent.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of those targets is expected to lay down a firm
foundation for the implementation of Hanoi's 2001-2005 development
plan, a move toward the construction of a new Vietnamese capital
as approved recently.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hanoi registered the highest local GDP growth rate
of 6.5 percent as against the country' average of 4.8 percent and
the 6.2 percent GDP growth rate recorded by Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
However, Hanoi failed to achieve some economic development
targets last year. The local industrial production sector obtained
a low growth rate with several key industries such as electricity
and electronics production, engineering, and metallurgy remaining
in stagnant production and business activities.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production of foreign invested enterprises in the
city grew slowly too.
</P>
<P>
The city failed to spur up the domestic demand for locally-
produced products. As a result, Hanoi's market seemed to be less
exciting than other key economic centers of the country.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Puts Forward Govt Strategy for Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Thursday vowed to develop Cambodia into a country with a
sustainable economic growth and social progress and prosperity in
the first decade of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a seminar of "Cambodia in the Millennium," Hun
Sen elaborated on seven key factors that constitute the core of
the government strategy for poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
They include: to consolidate peace, stability and social order;
to promote investment; to mobilize domestic resource; to place
investment priority on priority sectors and improve the
productivity of agriculture; to build institutional capacity and
strengthen good governance; to integrate the Cambodian economy
into the region and the world; and to develop human resource.
</P>
<P>
About 200 government officials and diplomats attended the three-
day conference sponsored by local think tank Cambodian Institute
for Cooperation and Peace (CICP) and a German NGO organization FES
which aimed at managing the past and building the future.
</P>
<P>
"In 20 to 30 years, I want to see Cambodia developed to the
level of neighboring advanced economies in the region and the
Cambodian people attaining a proper and decent living standard,
and enjoying progress, prosperity and happiness," Hun Sen said,
adding "Cambodia has the ability and opportunity to achieve these
ambitious goals."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he has confidence that Cambodia can
have this vision materialized through the achievement of high
annual economic growth of 6 to 7 percent over the next two to
three decades.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Attend Sino-African Cooperation Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Namibia firmly supports
China's initiative of establishing a Sino-African Cooperation
Forum, and it will actively take part in the minister-level
meeting due to be held in Beijing this October, Namibian President
 Sam Nujoma said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan at the state house. The president said his
country has always been strongly opposed to any act of hegemonism
and power politics. He hoped all the developing countries will
strengthen their unity and cooperation to safeguard their proper
rights.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that the establishment of the forum will not
only benefit the friendly relations between China and African
countries, but also the world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the circumstances that the world is
experiencing great changes and globalization continue to develop,
it becomes more necessary that the developing countries should
push forward their cooperation against hegemonism and power
politics.
</P>
<P>
Based on the similar historic backgrounds and the principle of
mutual benefit, China is willing to promote political consultation
and economic cooperation with all African countries in the new
century in a bid to step up the establishment of the new world
political and economic orders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange and cooperation between China and Namibia in
political and economic fields had been significantly improved in
the past decade, Tang added, noting that the two developing
countries shared common views on many issues and supported each
other in international arena.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here from Nigeria on Wednesday for a two-day
official visit to the southwest African country, which is the
second stop of his African trip.
</P>
<P>
He left for Harare, Zimbabwe, on Thursday afternoon to continue
his five-nation tour.

<HEADLINE> Putin Agrees to Run for Presidency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin gave his consent Thursday to running for
presidential elections in March, officially kicking off his race
for the Kremlin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin made this announcement at St. Petersburg University
following a ceremony in which he received the gown of honorary
member of the learned council of the university school of law, it
said.
</P>
<P>
An activist group of some 15 governors met in Moscow Wednesday,
declaring their support for Putin's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Putin, the prime minister who became acting president following
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on
December 31, expressed the hope that the presidential campaign
will be "worthy" and be free from mud-slinging and personal
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The very nature of the campaign should promote the
consolidation of the public, not its division," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, whose approval rating at opinion polls was just around 2
percent when he took office as prime minister last August, has
witnessed his popularity skyrocketing, especially following the
commencement of a military campaign against rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched last September following two waves of
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series
of apartment bombings that left more than 300 people dead in
Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Putin's popularity rate stands at 62 percent at present and his
policy is approved by 76 percent of the Russians, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Since Yeltsin's resignation, Putin's presidential rating has
shot up from 45 percent to 55 percent, Interfax said, citing
results of a poll taken by the Public Opinion Foundation among
urban and rural Russians on December 25 and January 8 receptively.
Each poll involved 2,000 respondents.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Turkey's Decision to Delay Ocalan's Hanging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday welcomed the
decision by Turkey to postpone the hanging of the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described the
Turkish move as a "correct decision," saying that Greece had
opposed the PKK leader's execution from the time of his trial.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was blamed by Turkey for leading a 15-year Kurdish
rebellion, was arrested last February and sentenced to death last
June.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government Wednesday decided to postpone the
execution of a death sentence against Ocalan and to wait for a
European Court of Human Rights to review Ocalan's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that hanging Ocalan
without waiting for the European court's decision would seriously
harm the prospects of Turkey's joining the European Union (EU),
which has warned that hanging Ocalan would be a grave mistake.

WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq has told members of the U.N. Security Council that it
will not accept Rolf Ekeus, the former head of U.N. disarmament
efforts in Iraq and now Swedish ambassador to Washington, as the
chairman of a new arms inspection agency, diplomats said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian officials strove Wednesday to counter a growing
impression that the military campaign against separatist rebels in
Chechnya has hit the skids, reporting that troops have established
new footholds in the southeastern part of the region and regained
control of two towns outside the capital that the rebels overran
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish leaders postponed the execution of the country's
most prominent Kurdish rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, in response to
European pressure and in hope of ending a conflict that has shaken
the country for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain announced a military code of conduct that ends a ban
on gay men and women serving openly in the armed forces. The
action follows a European court ruling that Britain could no
longer keep the exclusion.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Mahathir opponents were arrested for sedition as the
Malaysian premier cracked down on foes after his recent re-

face six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft faces a hard opening line in its anti-trust
settlement talks with the government, which is seeking a breakup
of the software concern. The most likely outcome is a return to
federal court, people on both sides say.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The organisers said Thursday that
all necessary measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the
Libyan stage of the Dakar Rally.
</P>
<P>
According to the official JANA news agency, the Libyan Olympic
Committee said it had "made all the necessary arrangements" to
ensure the safety of the rally teams after the Niger leg was
cancelled due to a terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
Organisers have began a massive airlift of vehicles and their
crews from Niger's capital of Niamey to Libya, saying that the
participants would find all the facilities they required on the
stage of the event.
</P>
<P>
The air bridge, using giant Antonov 124 cargo planes, was set
up between Niamey and Sabha, Libya.
</P>
<P>
The transport aircraft are expected to make several ferry trips
to Libya at a cost estimated at some 1.57 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Due to delays in getting the necessary aircraft to Niamey
airport, the rally will not now resume until next Tuesday, 24
hours later than planned.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Entry Will Benefit Both U.S. and China, Says U.S. Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- "We are satisfied with what we
have seen in Shanghai, and we decide to support China's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), for it will benefit both
countries," Matt Salmon, head of a seven-member U.S. congressional
delegation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
They U.S. congressmen came to Shanghai after visiting Beijing
to see the operations of U.S. solely funded companies in the city.
</P>
<P>
China will put more efforts into agricultural modernization
after it gains WTO entry, and tariffs will then be lower, which
will be good news for U.S. companies, said Rich Christman, vice-
president of Case-New Holland, a U.S.- Italian combine and the
world's third-largest producer of agricultural machinery.
</P>
<P>
The company set up a branch under the name Case Machinery (
Shanghai) Company Ltd. in Shanghai at the beginning of last year,
and another in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are not the largest U.S. company here, but nonetheless we
have a responsibility to let our congress know the true conditions
of our business in China, so as to help them make the right
decision on the issue of China's entry into the WTO," said
Christman.
</P>
<P>
"We have a general idea of the actual conditions of U.S.
companies in the city and their future plans, which will be useful
for us in judging what impact China's accession to the WTO will
have on our country," said Salmon.

<HEADLINE> Young Assistants Sent for Aiding New Legco Election in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 young voter
registration assistants will be dispatched to aid in the 2000
Voter Registration Campaign for the Second Legislative Council
Election of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in
September.
</P>
<P>
All the assistants have been well trained before they were sent
to Hong Kong's 18 districts to help register all eligible voters
and update the electoral roll, a home affairs official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the end of the training session
for the last batch of the assistants Thursday, Acting Secretary
for Home Affairs Leo Kwan said that the exercise will no doubt
provide them with some valuable employment opportunities and
working experience.
</P>
<P>
But of equal importance is the fact that they will, in the
process, get to know their community better and have a better
appreciation and understanding of their civic rights and duties,
Kwan said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the whole experience would effect a positive
influence on their lives, and our previous experience has shown
that young assistants are particularly effective in registering
new young voters as they can relate to each other better," Kwan
said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall arrange for them to visit youth centers and various
tertiary institutions during the campaign period from January 17
to March 16. We also believe that the campaign will afford them
with a valuable lesson in civic education and allow them to
contribute to community building," Kwan added.

<HEADLINE> mee011311 hke -- Roundup: Turkish Ruling Coalition Suspends Hanging of Ocalan By Xing Guoxin, Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Meeting behind closed doors for
over seven and a half hours, the troika of Turkey's coalition
government agreed on Wednesday to "conditionally" abide by a
European court request to put the hanging of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan on hold.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), could breathe a relief about his fate as it
will take 18 months for the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
to hand down a verdict on the case.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that the ECHR
has no right to change the ruling of Turkey's courts.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit warned that if this appeals process was exploited in a
manner that could hurt Turkey's interests, the three leaders of the
coalition government would meet again and review their decision.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was condemned to hanging last June on terrorism and
separatism charges by the Ankara State Security Court for leading a
15-year war for autonomy in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern
Turkey. Some 37,000 people have been killed during clashes between
the PKK and Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
The European court has asked Turkey not to execute Ocalan until
it reviews the case.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, leader of the ruling Democratic Left Party (DSP) and an
opponent of death penalty, has been making efforts to keep the
issue from reaching the parliament, which is widely believed to
approve the execution.
</P>
<P>
He argued that hanging Ocalan regardless of the European court
demand would seriously harm Turkey's prospects to become a member
of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
However, grassroot supporters of Deputy Premier Devlet Bahceli,
the leader of the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), marched on
Wednesday towards the Prime Ministry, calling on the government to
resign and demanding an imminent hanging of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Ecevit's DSP and Bahceli's MHP had been pushing
the seven-month-old coalition regime to the brink of collapse for
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's troika meeting, attended by Ecevit, Bahceli and
liberal Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, started only
hours after the holding of a funeral ceremony a few hundred meters
away from the Prime Ministry for the soldiers killed in clashes
with the PKK on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the opposition Islamist Virtue Party tried
to make the best use of the chill between Ecevit and Bahceli over
Ocalan, offering to form a coalition with the MHP and the central-
right True Path Party of Tansu Ciller and bringing the case to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Turkey cannot afford a political crisis now as the government
has launched an ambitious economic package to curb chronic
inflation and has promised widespread reforms to comply with EU
standards that have excluded death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that it was this outlook that finally
prompted the tripartite leaders to iron out their differences over
the Ocalan case and avoid a possible government crisis.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Action Rather than Popularity  Ratings: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that he wants to see the public translate
his popularity ratings into concrete action for improvement of the
people's living condition.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
that while the president feels happy over the people's high level
of trust in him shown in a fresh survey, he would rather have
their support for his programs.
</P>
<P>
"The president needs the people's support. He wants them to
rally behind him in the implementation of his programs," Zamora
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a fresh Social Weather Station survey showed that
as many as 72 percent of Filipinos believe the president can get
things done, while 71 percent think he is honest and trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
This result of survey came out better than the previous one
made by the same pollster before the cabinet revamp last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The result in the previous survey showed tat Estrada's net
satisfaction rating, representing the difference between approval
and disapproval ratings, dropped to positive five percent, an all-
time low record for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Estrada administration's main programs focus on
food security, mass housing, peace and order and the fight against
graft and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He added these programs are at the center of the president's
efforts to fulfill his election promise to uplift the people's
lives.

<HEADLINE> Pak Expects Basic Fairness from U.S.: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said it
viewed its relations with the United States in a positive
framework and expected basic fairness from Washington in its
approach towards Islamabad and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that Pak-U.S. ties should be cast at the
expense of any third country. Negative exclusivism is not our
desire," Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said in a
press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, a basic fairness is expected from the U.S. in its
approach to both Pakistan and India."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, in Pakistan's view, had the capacity
to play "a moderating and constructive role particularly in the
promotion of peace and security in the region" which is predicated
on a just and fair settlement of the core dispute of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He said two separate U.S. congressional delegations are
visiting Islamabad this week. Their visits, he said, would be
followed by a visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karl
Inderfurth.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan welcomes these visits and the intensification of the
Pak-U.S. dialogue on issues of mutual concern."
</P>
<P>
During these visits, the spokesman said, the two sides would
exchange views on their global and regional perspectives.
</P>
<P>
He said South Asia had recently been in the focus on account of
hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and that India had tried to
exploit this "condemnable" episode to advance its own political
agenda of "maligning the just Kashmiri cause and to convince
Washington that the U.S. should declare Pakistan as a terrorist
state.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, for India this attempt has miserably failed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Altaf said, had been cooperating with the U.S. and
the international community to combat terrorism in all its forms.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan, as we have recently declared, will not permit the
use of its territory for any act of terrorism. We will also not
allow propagation of hatred or incitement to violence against
anybody, least of all foreign nationals."
</P>
<P>
He added that Islamabad will continue to cooperate with
Washington in the field of combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the spokesman said Pakistan expects U.S.
President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to South Asia will
include the tour of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, President Clinton will visit this region and this
region is expected to include Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and
other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were reports about Pakistan' apprehension that Clinton
will not visit Pakistan due to the military coup which led to the
collapse of former Nawaz Sharif government in October, 1999.

ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
have changed the capital of Nimroz province from Zaranj to
Ghurghuri, which is located in central part of the province, news
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports quoting a Taliban spokesman in charge of
information and culture, Mulla Abdul Hai Mutamain, the change of
the capital of Nimroz had been made under the thinking that the
capital of every province should be at equal distance from all the
districts.
</P>
<P>
Mutamain said Ghurghuri had become a border market, which had
the danger of political and military problems. Besides it was
quite far off from other parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Nimroz is located at the southwestern most part of Afghanistan
and Zaranj borders Iran across a river.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Extends Peace Talks Deadline to This June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Thursday extended up to June this year the deadline for
the conduct of peace talks between the government and all armed
groups in a bid to attain just and lasting peace for the country.
</P>
<P>
In an open forum with the Foreign Correspondents Association of
the Philippines, the president said the original deadline he set
at the end of last year was extended to another six months upon
the advice of the government peace panel.
</P>
<P>
"The peace panel in our deliberations and discussions has
agreed to extend it for another six months. That's the agreement,
so it will be up to June this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that after this period, the government will make
it clear and will assert its stand before all armed groups that "
there is only one Armed Forces" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the peace process initiated by the
government with the New People's Army (NPA) and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) has been going on since the
administrations of former president Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Estrada gave the go-signal for government
authorities to pursue peace talks with the NPA at the local level,
after the Netherlands-based leadership of the National Democratic
Front withdrew from the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a National Peace Forum and local peace fora
nationwide will pave the way for the government to directly
address peace issues on the ground and allow rebels to participate
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the part of the MILF, the government is optimistic that
peace talks which formally opened last October, will resume on
January 17 in Maguindanao despite a recent raid done by the
secessionist guerrillas on a town hall in the province.

<HEADLINE> France's Economic Growth Accelerates, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of France's gross
domestic product (GDP) has been accelerating since the first half
of 1999, with a 1 percent growth registered in the third quarter
of 1999 over the previous quarter, said the State Economics and
Statistics Research Institute (INSEE) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth rate in the second quarter of 1999 was
0.8 percent, and that in the first quarter 0.7 percent, according
to the INSEE.
</P>
<P>
The INSEE also said that the GDP growth in the fourth quarter
of 1999 is estimated at 1.1 percent, and the annual GDP growth in
1999 is about 2.8 percent, lower than the 3.4 percent scored in
the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy Christian Sautter said recently that
the GDP growth in 2000 is expected to be at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The INSEE attributed the GDP growth to a growth of consumption
by households, increasing exports, and growing investment.
</P>
<P>
It also noted an increase of industrial production in the third
quarter of 1999, especially in food, agricultural, energy products
and a growing dynamism in car exports.

<HEADLINE> UK Interest Rates Rise 0.25 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) - The Bank of England Thursday
decided to raise interest rates by a quarter point to 5.75 percent
in response to an increasing sign of inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
Britain's inflation stands at just 2.2 percent - below the
target rate of 2.5 percent, but a raft of recent economic data
have increased fears that inflation may soon take hold again.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase the cost of borrowing had been widely
expected, given the current strong growth of Britain's economy.
</P>
<P>
It means higher borrowing costs for home buyers and businesses,
but it also means higher income for savers and investment.
</P>
<P>
Britain's largest mortgage lender, Halifax, said that annual
house price inflation hit 13.6 percent in December, the highest
level since the housing boom of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the decision, Ian Peters, deputy director general
of the British Chambers of Commerce said, "This is a disappointing
blow for British business."

<HEADLINE> Klinsmann: Germany Can Defend the Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The outstanding german
footballer Juergen Klinsmann said Thursday that the German team
could retain the European champion during the European
Championship held in the Netherlands and Belgium this summer.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the head-coach Erich Ribbeck forms a team
which quite well at the tournament. Then everything is possible,"
said the 35-year-old forward in an interview with a german sport
magazine "The Kicker".
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann has a brilliant career as football player. He took
part in the World Cup in Italy in 1990 and Germany won the
champion. As captain he led his team to take the champion of the
Europran Championship in England in 1996. Klinsmann has once
played for many clubs, for instance, VfB Stuttgart, Lazio, Tottnam
Hotspur, Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
After the 1998 World Cup he made an end of his longtime player
career and now he lives in California with his wife Debbie and
three-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann hoped that the head-coach Ribbeck will allow 33-year-
old midfielder Thomas Haessler, 1.66 meters in height, to return
into the national team because there is a serious shortage of
midfielders with clerverness among the german footballers for long
time. Small Haessler has left the national team after the World
Cup in 1998 and at present he is playing for 1860 Munich.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann also predicted that the famous sweeper Lothar
Matthaeus can return into the national team without any trouble,
the latter will leave Bayern Munich for New York/New Jersey
MetroStar in March. At the beginning of the week Matthaeus hinted
that he will end his glorious career at the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Barak Seeks to Keep Settlers on Golan in Peace Treaty: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is seeking an agreement with Syria that will let Israeli
settlers remain on the occupied Golan Heights after a possible
Israeli withdrawal from the strategic plateau, a local daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian position is, however, that Israel should withdraw all
civilians, together with all its armed forces, to the Israeli side
of the future border to be agreed upon in negotiations, Haaretz
said.
</P>
<P>
These different positions are reflected in a draft framework
agreement that the United States submitted to the two sides last
week, according to Haaretz. The influential newspaper published the
full text of what it said is a copy of the draft framework
agreement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted "an authoritative political source" as
confirming that Barak believes Israelis are entitled to live in the
Golan, just as Arabs live in Israel. But it also said the official
Israeli assessment is that most of the 17,000 settlers will reject
remaining in the plateau after Israel hands it over to Syria under
a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Golan, which Israel seized from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war, is the focus of the ongoing Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, which resumed last month after nearly four years of
freeze.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks, which were held at Shepherdstown,
West Virginia, ended inconclusively Monday. But both Israeli and U.
S.officials said progress have been made in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak echoed President Bill Clinton Wednesday by saying that a
peace treaty can be reached in two months.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to make territorial concessions over the
Golan but has been at odds with Syria on where the final border
line should be located.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded that Israel go back to the borders of June 4,
1967, the eve of the war. This will grant it control over the
seashore of the Sea of Galilee of Israel, the main fresh water
resource in the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that it will only withdraw to the international
border drawn in 1923 by British and French colonial powers
respectively in areas which are currently Israel and Syria. This
line is scores of meters away from the seashore of the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
According to the reported framework agreement, the future border
might be a new line based on the June 4, 1967 border but also
considers Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
On another key issue of security arrangements, both sides agree
to refrain from entering a military alliance hostile to the other
side and will ensure that areas under its control are not used by
third parties to adversely affect the security of the other.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, this means that Syria will agree to restrict the
activities of Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, where they
are fighting to oust Israeli forces from an occupied zone, and
agree not to allow militant Palestinian groups to use Damascus as
their bases.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are still disputing over how an early-warning
station in the Mount Hermon on the Golan should be operated in the
future. Israel demands that it be allowed to continue its operation
there, but Syria wants the station to be operated by the U.S. and
France without any Israeli presence.
</P>
<P>
This issue, together with the size of the demilitarized zone and
the areas with limited military forces on and near the Golan, is to
be discussed in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also at odds over the issue of water, a
fundamental element in a future peace treaty. Israel wants to
ensure the continuation of its current use in quantity and quality
of all water resources from the Golan, but Syria wants a mutually
agreeable arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The framework stipulated that the two counties will establish
and develop "friendly and good neighborly relations" after a peace
treaty was signed. These will include the exchange of resident
ambassadors, the free flow of people, goods, and service, and
cooperation in most economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Syrian negotiating teams will return to the U.S.
on January 19 to continue their talks aimed at resolving the
remaining difference and developing the framework agreement into a
full peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Set to Regain Net Creditor Status:  Rating Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has been accorded
a favorable sovereign rating by International rating agency Fitch
IBCA LTD which said the country would regain a net external
creditor status by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's gross external debt service could reach 174.8
billion ringgit (about 46 billion U.S. dollars) this year and this
was still below its 1997 peak of 178.6 billion ringgit (about 47
billion dollars), it said in its sovereign rating of Malaysia
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that thanks to Malaysia's export performance,
its gross external ratio is the lowest of all countries in the BBB
range and its external liquidity position ranks as the strongest
in rated Asia besides China.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the other Asian crisis-hit economies, Malaysia's
debt burden is modest. It enjoys a more favorable maturity
structure than Thailand or south Korea and a strong debt servicing
ability," it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the country's gross external debt is likely to rise as
economic recovery gathers pace, it is being backed by the
prospective size of Malaysia's current account surplus and
international reserves position, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia posted a consistently strong external liquidity
position with foreign exchange reserves recovering from a low 76
billion ringgit (about 20 billion dollars) at the height of the
crisis to current 114 billion ringgit (about 30 billion dollars),
and could still top 171 billion ringgit (about 45 billion dollars)
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The agency forecast that Malaysia would continue its current
account surpluses of 30.4 billion ringgit (about 8 billion dollars)
to 45.6 billion ringgit (about 12 billion dollars) or 9 to 15
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), together with a further
build-up in international reserves to 174 billion ringgit (about
45.789 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA believed that one of the main risks for Malaysia is
its exchange rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the country's real exchange rate would begin to
lose its competitiveness as wage pressures in the export sector
intensify and the output gap narrows the country's real exchange.

<HEADLINE> German Team's Training Camp on Majorca  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The German national football
team has chosen the popular holiday island of Majorca on the
Atlantic as its training camp for the last phase's preparation of
the European Championship this summer according to the news from
the German Football Association (DFB) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The head-coach of national team Erich Ribbeck, 62, said with
satisfaction: "The conditions are perfect. We have at our
disposition the entire training facilities and at the stadium of
Real Majorca and we have found a wonderful hotel." The head-coach
has made an inspection to the training camp.
</P>
<P>
It is said by the DFB that the training camp will open from May
27 till June 2. And then the German national team will return to
Nuremberg and have a friendship match with the Czech Republic on
June 3 there, the latter once got the second place at the 1996
European Championships with 1-2 to Germany.
</P>
<P>
After the match with the Czech Republic, the German players
will have a rest for several days. The last warm-up match will be
held on June 7 and the opponent is Lichtenstein, a small country
between Switzerland and Austria. Usually the German football team
prefers to choose a very weak opponent as its last one for warm-up
before the important games. For example, two years ago, before the
World Cup in France in 1998 Germany chose Luxembourg as its last
warm-up target.
</P>
<P>
The European Championship will be held June 10-July 2 in the
Netherlands and Belgium. Germany is divided into a relative strong
group which consists of Germany, Romania, Portugal and England.

<HEADLINE> Climate Change in Qinghai Plateau a Bellweather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- According to Chinese
meteorologists, climate changes in the Qinghai Plateau in west
China are similar to those in the rest of the country, and
climate changes in the plateau are usually a sign of changes
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qingchuan, head of a research group on climatic
variations in the Qinghai Plateau, said today that climate records
for the past four decades show that changes in the plateau usually
take place about five to six years earlier than they do in other
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
These records of climate changes were obtained by
meteorologists at 26 observatories in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said the average temperature in Qinghai Province increased
by 0.15 degrees Celsius each decade during the four-decade period,
nearly the same as that for the rest of the country, though the
changes in Qinghai occurred five to six years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Wang said this discovery is of significance for forecasting
climate changes nationwide, and for policy decisions based on
these predictions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Greece Remains Committed to Federal Solution to Cyprus Issue  by Liu Xingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government is
committed to seeking a solution to the Cyprus issue on a federal
formula, said visiting Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou
here on Wednesday afternoon at the end of his two-day visit to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Papandreou held talks with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou and his
Cyprus counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides to coordinate the policy of
the two governments on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the current situation in Cyprus
following the first round of proximity talks on Cyprus which was
held last month in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities on the island was conducted to pave the way for
a final solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to hold a second round of talks in
Geneva at the end of January. And the visit was considered as a
final touch on the preparation for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Cyprus leaders, Papandreou pledged to
raise the Cyprus issue during his forthcoming visit to Ankara
despite that his talks there will focus on Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou told reporters after meeting with President Clerides
that the European Union (EU) members will not recognize the
breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in response to claims by Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash that he will initiate contacts of his own with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou reaffirmed Greece's staunch backing for a solution to
the Cyprus issue within the framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation as provided by United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with local political party leaders, Papandreou
reassured them that there is no danger that the Turkish Cypriot
regime will be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, they had expressed unhappiness to an article by a
senior Greek official, which they claimed had implied that Greece
is backing setting up a confederation on the island, the long-
standing demand of the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Giorgos Pandayias, press adviser to Greek Premier Constantinos
Simitis, said in an article that any solution to the Cyprus issue
can only take place by setting aside nationalism, and should be
based on equality and on a series of rapprochement measures.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou repeated that the the Cyprus issue is the top
priority of the Greek foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
This is Papandreou's second visit to Cyprus in less than three
months.

MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The floods in Mozambique's
Maputo Province have caused four deaths in the past few days, the
Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The largest river in southern Mozambique, the Incomati, has
burst its banks in the coastal plain, inundating farmland in
Manhica district, some 80 kilometers north of the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of hectares of crops are under water in Manhica
lowlands, the area which is extremely vulnerable to flooding and
is of concern to the authorities every rainy season.
</P>
<P>
All the main rivers in Maputo Province are at levels above
normal, and the authorities are reiterating their calls on all
those living in danger areas to seek higher ground.
</P>
<P>
The floods in Manhica are the result of a flood wave from South
Africa, which has been travelling slowly down the Incomati for
several days.
</P>
<P>
This week there has not been much rain in the province, and so
the overall levels of the rivers are gradually dropping.
</P>
<P>
However, General Director of the Southern Regional Water Board,
Issufo Cutumia, said that "we shall be attentive to what happens
in the coming days, since the state of alert lasts until March."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Toys Fair Exhibitors Optimistic Of Business Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A majority of exhibitors
participating in Hong Kong Toys &AMP; Games Fair 2000 are optimistic
of the business prospects for the year 2000, a survey released by
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,562 exhibitors from 29 countries and regions have
participated in the four-day toys fair, the first international
event of the millennium for the toy industry.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the survey, the
TDC, organizer of Hong Kong Toys &AMP; Games Fair 2000, commissioned
German-based company Hermann Fuchslocher Unternehmensberatung to
conduct an independent survey at the fair.
</P>
<P>
With encouraging Christmas sales and a growing number of orders
from major toy markets in 1999, a majority of exhibitors said they
are optimistic about the business prospects.
</P>
<P>
Of the 751 exhibitors interviewed, 66.1 percent predicted the
sales in 2000 to be better than last year and forecast an average
increase of 17.6 percent in business.
</P>
<P>
Given that China's imminent access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) would create a level ground for international
competition, 72 percent of the respondents ranked China to be the
biggest retail market for toys after the United States and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that 73.5 percent of Hong Kong
exhibitors had been making use of the Internet for marketing and
promotion purposes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 66.3 percent of U.S. exhibitors said Internet was an
existing distribution channel while 53.3 percent of Western Europe
exhibitors and 46.5 percent of Japan exhibitors said so.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) today issued a decree on regulating insurance
firms, which will take effect from March 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
There are ten chapters in the decree. These include provisions
on the establishment of insurance firms, the operation of insurers,
insurance policies and premium, the use of premium income and
reinsurance.
</P>
<P>
According to the decree, the establishment of insurance firms
and branch offices by insurance firms must be approved by the CIRC.
Insurance firms must have a customer service department and lines
that will look after potential complaints.
</P>
<P>
The terms and premium of major insurance policies must be fixed
by the CIRC. Other policies must also be approved by the CIRC.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-fund insurance firms shall also be subject to
regulations stipulated in the decree.

insurance brokers and insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
CIRC sources said the new decree marks the latest progress made
by China in improving its insurance law system.

<HEADLINE> China To Push Forward Reform in Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's political and
economic reforms will make new breakthroughs in the new decade,
said a senior official here today.
</P>
<P>
Lu Baifu, deputy director of the Development Research Center of
the State Council, said reform will continue to be the main
driving force in China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Lu, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua, foresees changes in
the ownership system in the next five years. Wholly stated owned
enterprises will decline amidst rapid growth of private firms and
companies with mixed ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
In five to ten years, the Chinese government will shift from
political instructions to economic policies in regulating the
country's economic activities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China will further open up to the outside
world and work out more policies and regulations according to the
global market as China seeks entry into the WTO, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
"China's strong economic growth will continue in the next ten
years with an annual growth rate at seven to eight percent," Lu
said, adding that that average income of Chinese citizens in 2010
will double the current figure.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the next ten years will see the application of
advanced technologies and more emphasis on efficiency and quality.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Are Taller: National Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A national research has found
that Chinese children today are taller than those of the same age
ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the vast rural area of China, the average body height of
three year old children rose from 90.1 centimeters in 1990 to 93.8
meters in 1998. Four year olds rose from 97.4 cm to 100.4 cm,
according to a research conducted by the National Surveillance
Network of Food and Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Among urban children with normal body weight, the ratio of
those whose heights are below the standards dropped from 7.5
percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 1998. In rural areas, the rate
fell down to 15 percent from 31.3 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Comparing a similar research conducted in the early 1990s,
researchers found the rate of growth retardation among children
under 5 dropped from 9.4 percent in 1990 to 4.1 percent in 1998 in
cities, while the rate decreased from 41.4 percent to 22 percent
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The drop in growth retardation may be associated with more
clean drinking water and breast feeding throughout the country,
said Chen Chunming, head of the National Surveillance Network of
Food and Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Overweight is emerging as a major health problem for Chinese
youngsters, especially well-off urbanites who eat more high-
calorie food.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh has said he would resign if the house of deputies (lower
house of parliament) proved that his son had asked for bribes from
potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a closed-door session of the lower house on

house to set up a special committee to investigate into the
allegations, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister vowed to resign if the house could prove that
his son Issam Rawabdeh had asked for 15 million Jordanian dinars
(21 million U.S.dollars) from two unnamed nationals from a Gulf
state to help them win a contract to build a tourist village near
the Queen Alia international airport 35 kilometers south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
"If the charges are proven, then I will resign, and if they are
not, then the accuser should resign," he said, adding that the
government has not floated any tender for such a tourist village.
</P>
<P>
The case was first raised by Deputy Mahmoud Kharabsheh, head of
the House Legal Affairs Committee during a house session last week,
but Rawabdeh did not respond to the question.
</P>
<P>
The charges were brought up again by Deputy Abdullah Akayleh
during the house session on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The alleged scandal emerged at a delicate time when the kingdom
is heading for an imminent major cabinet reshuffle. Rawabdeh
claimed the accusations were aimed at tarnishing the reputation of
himself and his family ahead of the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The major cabinet shakeup, the first since Rawabdeh took office
10 months ago, is expected to touch upon five portfolios, including
the health, justice, industry and trade, posts and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is aimed at garnering support for the Rawabdeh
government, which had launched a series of controversial social,
economic and administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is under attacks from the public and
opposition parties for his efforts to privatize key public
enterprises, crackdown upon Muslim dissidents, and his decision to
levy a 10 percent tax on consumption, which triggered a price hike
in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, the kingdom is expected to achieve a 1.5 to 2 percent
economic growth in 1999 after suffering a decade-long economic
stagnation since the 1990 Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Mekong Subregion Countries to Further Open Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The 9th Ministerial Meeting of
the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program was held
Thursday at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila with
further opening of borders and poverty reduction topping the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the six countries bordering the Mekong River --
China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam -- agreed to
further opening their borders following the precedent-setting
accord signed in Vientiane in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Vientiane agreement, inked by the governments of Laos,
Thailand and Vietnam, eases the cross-border movement of goods and
people on the East-West Corridor linking the three countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks at the meeting, ADB President Tadao
Chino said the Asian financial and economic crisis has underscored
the importance of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said regional cooperation can promote closer economic ties,
strengthen the investment climate and other factors critical to
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting that most people in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)
continue to live on less than 1 U.S. dollar a day, Chino hoped
that regional economic cooperation can be tailored to contribute
to poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Entering into the GMS Program since 1992, the six countries
have moved from establishing physical linkages among them to
opening their borders in the subregion.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's meeting, delegates from the six countries
stressed that cutting red tape and other barriers will spur trade
and investment in the GMS.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to promote the cooperation in the GMS in the areas
of transport and communication, energy, health and education,
environment and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Participants also discussed concrete actions to stop
environmental degradation in the subregion, especially
deforestation, illegal logging and trafficking in wildlife, drugs
and prostitution.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Food Agency Urged to Pursue Debtors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Agriculture Minister
Suresh Desai has urged the government-funded Food Reserve Agency
to pursue all the debtors by taking any appropriate measures
including legal action.
</P>
<P>
A list of maize and fertilizer debtors compiled by the agency
shows that Zambian government ministers, parliament members,
opposition leaders and businessmen owed a government-funded agency
a total of 15.58 billion kwacha (about 5.8 million U.S. dollars at
current exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
According to the Post newspaper reports Thursday, 38 ministers
and deputy ministers owed the agency a total of 3.83 billion
kwacha by November 30, 1999 and 84 parliamentarians owed 5.03
billion kwacha while 37 opposition leaders and businessmen owed
6.72 billion kwacha by the end of November of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The huge debt has affected the agency's liquidity, said the
agriculture minister noted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debt was accrued from 1997 to 1999, while some of
the debt dates back to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Food Reserve Agency, Chance Kabaghe,
said Wednesday that some repayments have started coming after the
intervention by President Frederick Chiluba, who last year gave
the debtors one to three months to repay the debt.
</P>
<P>
But Kabaghe said the pace of payment is slower than anticipated
and the huge debt has threatened the very existence of the agency.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Fell in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
fell to 809.7 billion yen (about 7.7 billion U.S. dollars) in
November last year, down 31 percent from a year earlier for the 10
th consecutive month of decline, the Finance Ministry said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the downswing to a sharp expansion in
imports which overwhelmed an increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade dropped 35.3 percent to
399.1 billion yen (about 3.8 billion dollars), the ministry said
in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The pace of the shrinkage is the steepest since August last
year, when the goods and services trade surplus dropped 61.5
percent from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise trade surplus totaled 819.4 billion yen (about 7.8
billion dollars), down 22.7 percent for the eighth straight month
of retreat, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 4.7 percent to 3,730.9 billion yen (about 35.5
billion dollars), while imports jumped 16.2 percent to 2,911.5
billion yen (about 27.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said the growth in exports and imports
stemmed from increased shipments to and from Japan's Asian trading
partners. Shipments to the region leaped 20.1 percent in the month,
while imports from there grew 23.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The services deficit decreased to 420.3 billion yen (about 4
billion dollars) due to scaled-back deficits in services other
than those related to transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The income account, which covers income from Japanese
investment in foreign securities and payments by foreign employers
to workers in Japan, left a surplus of 475.4 billion yen (about 4.
5 billion dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the difference between a
country's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 104.96 to the dollar in November, up some 13
percent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein Wednesday denied a report that Weizman's lawyers has
worked out a deal with the State Attorney's Office whereby he will
resign and the case against him will be closed without a police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Weizman accepted nearly half a million U.S. dollars as a
personal gift from Monte Carlo-based businessman Edouard Saroussi
between 1988 and 1993 without reporting it to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants Syria to permit
Israeli residents on the Golan Heights to remain in their homes
even after the signing of a peace treaty and the transfer of the
territory to Syrian sovereignty, a copy of the draft peace treaty
obtained by the Ha'aretz newspaper revealed.
</P>
<P>
The United States submitted the draft treaty last week to the
two sides during the Shepherdstown talks.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak predicted in an interview with CNN
that Israel and Syria could strike a peace deal within two to three
months and a deal with Syria would win landslide support in a
referendum he has pledged to hold, despite a groundswell of
opposition to a withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy flew to Rabat, Morocco
Wednesday to brief King Mohammed VI on the Middle East peace talks.
It is the first time since the Oslo agreement that Morocco has
initiated a visit by an Israeli official at such a high level.
</P>
<P>
Levy's four-day trip aims at confidence building in the
relations between the two countries and an upgrading of their low-
level diplomatic ties. It will also serve to pave the way for a
future visit by Barak, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Levy left his hometown of Rabat for Israel at the age of 20 and
has since visited the country only once to attend the funeral of
King Hassan II in July 1999.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Starts Visit to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi arrived here Thursday for a three-day official visit, which
aims to strengthen ties between Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and other high-ranking
government officials met Obuchi, the first Japanese prime minister
to visit Thailand in seven years, at the Airforce Airport.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Obuchi is expected to hold talks with his
Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai on issues concerning the World
Trade Organization, the Group-of-Eight (G8) summit and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Obuchi will especially seek Thailand's view on the G8 summit
which will be held on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in
July this year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest investor in Thailand, accounting for one
third of the total foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Being a crucial trading partner of Thailand, Japan is the
fourth largest export market of Thailand, receiving 14 percent of
Thailand's total exports, while some 23 percent of Thailand's
imports are from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also one of the recipients of many Japanese
financial aid projects, including the 30-billion-U.S. dollar
Miyazawa Initiative, which aimed to help the countries hit by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the last leg of Obuchi's six-day, three-nation tour
in Southeast Asia, which has brought him to Cambodia and Laos.
</P>
<P>
Hailed as "historical," his visit is widely seen by analysts as
a demonstration of Japan's growing determination to take a
leadership role in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Education Reform Progresses Slowly, Study Finds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Education for All Year 2000 Assessment," published in
November, holds that Cambodia's education reform progress is slow,
the Cambodia Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that despite efforts by the Education Ministry,
many indicators are lower than expected, and the few number of
girls going to school and high number of dropouts remain serious.
</P>
<P>
One of the primary goals of the ministry during the last 10
years was to provide at least primary education for all the nation
's children by the end of 2000. But the goal has not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate in 1999 was nearly 15 percent, 5 percent
higher than the ministry's target established in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Though the ministry is slated to receive 47 percent more money
in 2000 than last year, the figure remains a small portion of the
national budget, standing at about 8 percent, the same as 1999,
according to Education Minister Tol Lah.
</P>
<P>
However, there are positive signs. The secondary school system
has greatly improved, and other indicators are gradually rising,
including the number of qualified teachers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tol Lah pointed out that the educational system has been
troubled by a lack of funds, a devastated infrastructure, and the
lack of qualified teachers.

<HEADLINE> China Moves Grotto In Whole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cultural relics departments
in central China's Henan Province have moved a grotto in whole to
a spot 500 meters away to help protect it.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaonanhai Grotto, located on the southern side of the
Guigai Mountain in north Henan, absorbed frequent shocks caused by
a nearby rock-blasting company which used explosives in its
operation.
</P>
<P>
With no security fence around it, the grotto also runs the
risk of being damaged by vandals.
</P>
<P>
The grotto has a number of exquisite and lifelike Buddha
figures and Buddhist scriptures carved on the walls inside, which
are valuable for studying stone carvings of the Northern Qi
Dynasty (550-577).
</P>
<P>
The grotto was one of three grottoes made by monks in the
Lingshan Temple during the Qi Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Recently, local cultural relics departments decided to move
the grotto all in one piece.
</P>
<P>
Workers used steel wires to bind the rock exterior of the
grotto, which weighed 69 tons, then hoisted it with a 120-ton
crane and placed it on a vehicle covered with planks.
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the grotto was transported undamaged to a place 500
meters away, to stand beside another grotto. Both grottoes are
protected by a wall.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Development Programs Harmful for Global Strategic Balance and Stability, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China has today expressed "
serious concern" over a massive missile development program of the
United States, describing it as "going against the tide of times
and being harmful to the global arms control efforts."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
in response to a report at a regular press conference today that
the Clinton administration required U.S. congress to allocate
additional 2.2 billion U.S. dollars for the development of
National Missile Defense system (NMD).
</P>
<P>
United States, already a country with the world's largest
nuclear and conventional weaponry, should have again put great
efforts to develop NMD and Theater Missile Defense system (TMD) in
the beginning of the new century, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Such move goes against the tide of our times and is
detrimental to the global efforts of arms control and disarmament,
' he said, adding it will have an extensive and deep adverse
impact on the international and regional strategic balance and
stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China believed that the development,
deployment and transfer of any anti-missile systems with strategic
defense potentials will not enhance security or curb missile
technology proliferation but will eventually undermine security
and instigate missile technology proliferation. "It should be the
noted that U.S.'s move has violated the Treaty on the Limitation
of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM)," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that ABM, a document significant for
maintaining global strategic balance and stability and the nuclear
disarmament process, should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called for efforts of the international community to
safeguard ABM. On December 1, 1999, he said, the 54th United
Nations General Assembly passed a resolution jointly submitted by
Russia, China and Belarus on the maintenance and adherence of ABM.
The resolution, passed with votes of overwhelming majority,
demonstrated the any move by any country to revise ABM or develop
anti-missile systems will surely be opposed.
</P>
<P>
"We urged relevant countries to seriously consider the strong
call from the international community and abandon the above-
mentioned anti-missile development programs," he said.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman: U.S. Should Correct Decision on Human Rights Proposal (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today urged the United States to immediately
stop interferring in China's internal affairs on the pretext of
human rights, and correct the erroneous decision to propose a
resolution concerning China at the 56th meeting of the UN
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Slamming the "double standard" on the human rights issue and
the "politicization" of human rights, Zhu stressed that "fact has
proven and will continue to prove that the United States will
encounter another failure if it insists on doing so."
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in a regular news conference this
afternoon when asked to comment on the saying that "it is crucial
for the Clinton administration to propose the resolution to get
the Congress grant China the Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status."
</P>
<P>
"These are absolutely two different things," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States have reached an agreement on China
's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), a win-win
result achieved on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and
mutual concession and understanding," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"It will accelerate China's pace in entering the WTO, promote
overall development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
and help improve and develop bilateral relations, " said Zhu. (

"We have noticed that the Clinton administration has vowed to
go all out to get the Congress to grant China NTR status, and some
congressmen and people from the industrial and commercial circle
have also shown their support," said Zhu, expressing the hope that
the United States will take substantial moves to carry out its
promise.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing China's attitude toward the human rights issue, Zhu
said that the Chinese government always respects the general
principles of the international community on human rights, and
insists that each country is entitled to adopt effective measures
to promote and protect human rights conditions according to its
own practical situation.
</P>
<P>
It is normal that different countries have different views
toward human rights, and take different approaches to protect
human rights, considering the difference in their historical
backgrounds, cultural conventions, and level of social and
economic development, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that China has consistently held that the
differences between states on the issue of human rights should be
addressed and settled through dialog on the basis of equality and
mutual respect.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Yu Yongbo, member of the
Central Military Commission and director of the General Political
Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has called for
more efforts to carry out family planning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a military meeting on family planning here, Yu
stressed that family planning constitutes one of the basic
national policies of China and the military should take the lead
in its implementation.

<P>
Officials at all levels should pay enough attention to the
family planning work, and do more to ensure that the policy is
vigorously implemented at all levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more efforts should be done to strengthen the
management of family planning and family planning services, the
military leader noted.

<P>
Since it was introduced here in the early 1970s, family
planning has proved to be a big success.
</P>

Over the past 30 years, China has reduced the number of births
by 338 million due to its family planning program, government
statistics show.

governmental decision to postpone hanging of him and wait the
ruling
by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ocalan was happy like a child when he heard
the decision. One of his attorneys said that prior to the decision,
Ocalan was very excited and he followed all the developments.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Farmers Dump Bananas to Keep Prices Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus banana growers Wednesday
dumped 250,000 kilos of fruit in a waste area near Paphos, western
Cyprus, in an effort to curb overproduction and lift up prices,
local reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yerasimos Ioannou, a banana grower, said more than one million
kilos of bananas will be dumped in all and the European Union (EU)
will compensate banana growers for their losses.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of doing nothing to prevent the waste
of labour, fertilizers, water and general costs, which exceed one
million Cyprus pounds (2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another 250,000 kilos of bananas were destroyed on Tuesday and
the entire process is expected to take less than a week.
</P>
<P>
The action comes after agricultural unions recently ordered the
destruction of grape crops because of similar overproduction.
</P>
<P>
Grape growers were told to throw away most of their crop to keep
the balance between demand and supply so as to maintain stable
prices, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Try Alleged Planners of Millennium Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's State Security Court will
try within 10 days 14 suspects accused of plotting terrorist
attacks in the kingdom during the new millennium celebrations,
court sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Court Prosecutor Mahmoud Obeidat has finished the interrogation
of the 14 suspects who are believed to be affiliated with a group
headed by Afghanistan-based Saudi Arabian billionaire Osama Ben
Laden.
</P>
<P>
Ben Laden has been blamed by Washington for masterminding two
deadly attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998
that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
The 14 suspectes, including 12 Jordanians, one Iraqi and one
Algerian, were rounded up by Jordanian police on December 5 last
year after they entered the kingdom on forged passports.
</P>
<P>
They had received military training in Afghanistan, and all of
them had fighting records alongside the Afghani Mujahedeen (holy
war fighters), Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are facing charges of affiliation with an illegal
foreign organization, plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on
American targets during the new millennium celebrations and illegal
possession of arms and explosives for unlawful purposes.
</P>
<P>
The suspects may be hanged if they are convicted of the second
and third charges though no terrorist attacks were reported in the
kingdom during the new year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials refused to disclose the names of the 14
suspects, but said three other suspects wanted by the kingdom are
still at large, possibly hiding out in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> TNI Chief Optimistic Over Security Condition in Ambon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Unrest as well ethnic bloodshed
in Indonesia would be quelled and the situation in the conflict
area such as Ambon, capital of Maluku province and Aceh,would
recover, a top military official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Prospect of security (situation) in Ambon is positive. With
the consistency for the law enforcement, security situation (in
the riot areas) can be controlled," Commander of the Indonesian
Military (TNI)Adm. Widodo A.S. said.
</P>
<P>
He was also confident that ethnic bloodshed in Ambon could be
tackled, saying TNI is ready to restore law and order in the
conflict area.
</P>
<P>
However, Commander of the Army Forces Gen. Tyasno Sudarto asked
for public support to TNI in quelling unrest in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
"If (the Indonesian people want) conflict in Maluku province to
be settled soon, (please) give security forces support. We must
cooperate with each other," Sudarto was quoted by Antara news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 15 battalions of troops were deployed in the strife-
torn Maluku in a bid to end communal clashes and restore law and
order in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commander of the Army Special Forces (Kopassus) Maj.
Gen. Syahrir M.S. also said that the Army's elite forces are ready
to be deployed into conflict area in a bid to calm down the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Kopassus is always ready. We are just waiting for a command (
from TNI Chief), and (we) will always be ready to carry out an
order,"Syahrir said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Abdurrahman Wahid also said that the
government expected violence in Aceh and Ambon would die down
within two months.
</P>
<P>
"I talk to the right people. I know them one by one. Because of
this I am confident that we can tackle the problem," Wahid said in
an interview with Singapore's Straits Times published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid urged foreign investors not to be worried about security
situation in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many areas without trouble.. or we can wait for
one or two months for the troubles to phase out," Wahid was quoted
by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now I would like investors to think about planting their money
here in areas which are not afflicted (by conflict)," Wahid added.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed intermittent
Muslim-Christian violence since January 19 last year, which has
left more than 1,100 dead, over 2,300 injured and 8,500 buildings,
including 122 places of worship, damaged or burned.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Denies Corruption Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has dismissed claims that the country is one of the
world's most corrupt nations.
</P>
<P>
The president denounced allegations of widespread corruption in
high levels within his government as a "most unfair assessment",
the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the openness with which we have tackled the
scourge of corruption has created the impression that Tanzania is
among the most corrupt countries in the world,"  Mkapa told the
heads of diplomatic missions accredited to Tanzania at a New Year
party on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Such accusations are discouraging to those who prosecuted the
war against the vice, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also took the occasion to ask the donor community to
support the reform and strengthening of the government's
corruption watch-dog, the Prevention of Corruption Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative impression, Tanzanian government would

<HEADLINE> IMF Keen on Reaching Compromise With Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is keen on reaching a compromise with the Zimbabwean
government to ensure the release of the remainder of the balance
of payments support package, the Herald newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard to put together with the (Zimbabwean)
government a satisfactory program... a compromise between the
optimal solution of good economic environment and what the
government can do," IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told
reporters via satellite from Washington on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government also needs to play its part in
arriving at an amicable solution, said Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
"The difficult thing is to make sure that there is enough being
done in the program to make sure there is a reversal of the
adverse economic trend because your country has high inflation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, a key backer of Zimbabwe's reforms has asked the
government to devalue the Zimbabwean dollar and the budget deficit
be brought down to be about three percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also asked Zimbabwe to pull its army out of the Congo
as part of measures to cut down state spending and balance its
books if further crucial aid from the fund is to be released under
a 193-million-U.S. dollar 14-month program the government agreed
with the IMF last August.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he would take the opportunity to hold further
discussions with Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa at next
week's IMF meeting with African heads of state in Libreville,
Gabon.
</P>
<P>
On Zimbabwe's military expenditure in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, he said the IMF is not interested in the military
secrets, but wants to ensure that expenditure was not tilted in
favor of wars instead of social development.
</P>
<P>
He said peace is important because it brings development and
reducing military expenditure would also help bring about
development.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Plans to Sell 40 Percent PCs Directly by Year-end </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's biggest personal computer maker, claimed Wednesday that it
plans to sell up to 40 percent of its PCs directly to customers by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Michael Capellas, president and chief executive of Compaq, said
he expected the share of Compaq computers sold directly to
customers to rise by 15 percentage points from a current share of
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Capellas also said he saw rapid benefits emerging from the
recently announced 370-million-dollar purchase of assets from
computer distributor Inacom Corp., a move seen as boosting
Compaq's ability to sell personal computers directly to customers
like its archrival Dell Computer Corp. does.
</P>
<P>
The Houston-based Compaq remains the world's number one maker
of personal computers, although it was edged out of the top slot
in the United States last year by fast- growing rival Dell, which
is seen as a master of direct sales.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales refer to those made by Internet or phone to
customers, as opposed to sales made through retail stores or other
distributors.

<HEADLINE> 30-Plus Injured in Northeast China Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- No one was killed but at least
30 people were injured in an earthquake which jolted northeast
China's Liaoning Province Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Government of Liaoning has sent more than 500
tents, medical supplies and heaters to the disaster-hit area.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter Scale hit the area
between Xiuyan Manchu Autonomous County and Haicheng City in
Liaoning Province at 7:43 (Beijing Time) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that about 3,
600 apartments had collapsed, and another 8,800 households
experienced varying degrees of damage.
</P>
<P>
The heavy snows in the region have worsened the situation and
created difficulties for people involved in relief work.
</P>
<P>
According to the Liaoning Seismological Bureau, the quake's
epicenter, located at 40.5 degrees north latitude and 123.1
degrees east longitude, was an aftershock of the quake measuring 5.

Wednesday tremor caused more damage than the November quake, the
Bureau said.

<HEADLINE> China Breeder Chickens Going to International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua)-- China's chicken scientists will
introduce four new types of breeder chickens to the United States
at an annual international poultry show next week, hoping that
their high-tech fowl can get a clawhold in the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
According to the poultry show regulations, no live chickens
will be brought to the fair, where negotiations and sales are
struck. The Beijing Huadu Group, which has 24 years of experience
on breeding chickens, will take life-size photos and other
technical materials to the show.
</P>
<P>
The Huadu Beijing White A98 and three other breeds of chickens
boast a feed-egg ratio of about two to one and an annual egg
output of over 20 kilos, which means that the chickens "have
reached the internationally advanced level," said Zhang Lichang,
deputy general manager of the state-owned company, formerly part
of the Beijing Animal Husbandry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that the new breeds of chickens, which first
left the lab in 1998, have attracted the attention of some foreign
businessmen, who have shown an interest to buy the birds.
</P>
<P>
Jiafa, manager of the breeding farm of the group, said that
China has a 6,000-plus year history in raising chickens, but that
local chickens have failed to make a name for themselves abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that before 1975, when the Huadu Group started breeding
chickens, nearly all of China's breeder chickens were imported
from the Netherlands, the United States and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's chicken population stands at more than 1.2 billion,
with an annual egg output of 15.6 billion kilos, which is 42
percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> "Political Asylum" May Encourage Illegal Immigration, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigration could be
encouraged given that relevant countries blindly believed stories
made up by illegal immigrants and accommodated their pleas for "
political asylum", said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a regular press conference in response
to reports about illegal Chinese immigrants being detained by the
U.S. in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
China has noticed such reports but has not yet received
verified details, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently opposed illegal immigration and have
taken a series of effective measures to curb it," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has enacted laws banning illegal immigration and
tightened controls on its borders, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"We have also kept up healthy consultation devices with
relevant countries to deal properly with the problems of illegal
immigration," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, some illegal immigrants tell lies and make up excuses
in asking for "political asylum" or "refugee status", so as to
ensure their stay abroad, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
If relevant countries are easily taken in by their tales and
approve their application, it would be an encouragement to waves
of more illegal immigrants, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Government Procurement System Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The trial system of government
procurement in provincial and municipal governments has proved
very effective, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The system, under which government departments are directly
responsible for purchasing market goods, has been a great help in
curbing corruption, said officials from the Central Committee for
Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party and the
Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
So far, 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
have set up an experimental system of government procurement, and
the buying has expanded from goods to services.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the practice of bidding for goods,
which has been incorporated into the trial system, has improved
the transparency and fairness in government purchasing, and helped
to close loopholes that led to corruption.
</P>
<P>
It also saved the government large amounts of money, the
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the provincial and municipal governments indicated
that the new system saved them an average of 10 percent in
spending a year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1998, the provincial and municipal
governments bought a total of 3.1 billion yuan (370 million U.S.
dollars) in goods and services under the government procurement
system, saving at least 400 million yuan.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries are set to witness a high incidence of non-
communicable diseases, including diabetes, cancer, hyptertension
and cardiovascular diseases over the next two decades, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Drastic changes in socioeconomic status, sedentary lifestyle and
food habits are the major factors for the ever-rising number of GCC
nationals and residents becoming victims of such diseases, the
experts quoted authoritative studies as saying.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2025, Saudi Arabia is expected to witness a 213
percent rise in the number of people affected by non-communicable
diseases, while it will be 138 percent in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), 120 percent in Qatar, 267 percent in Oman, 288 percent in
Kuwait and 180 percent in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Cardiovascular diseases are the cause of 30 percent of the
deaths every year, while cancer and diabetes mellitus are also
major health problems in the region, according to Dr. Abdul Rahman
Musaiger, associate professor of nutrition at the Bahrain Center
for Studies and Research and Coordinator of Arab Nutrition Society,
who was quoted by the Gulf News daily on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Bahrain, heart diseases now account for over 34 percent of
the deaths every year, while it was just 29 percent in 1991. Cancer
is the second biggest cause of deaths in the country, with more
than 900 new cases being detected every year.
</P>
<P>
In Oman, the number of people suffering from heart and
cardiovascular problems has now jumped to 180 per 10,000 people,
and over 35 percent of all hospital deaths in the country are due
to diseases of the heart.
</P>
<P>
In the UAE, cardiovasuclar diseases and cancer have been the
leading cause of death in the past decade. Ministry of Health
statistics indicate that nearly half (46.6 percent) of all reported
deaths are due to cardiovascular disorders, malignant neoplasm and
accidents since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In Qatar, the total number of cancer cases last year was 369,
among which breast cancer is the most common followed by thyroid
and lymphoma cancer.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait's Health Ministry, there were 2,477 cancer
cases in 1997, representing 1.4 cases per thousand of the
population.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of dysentery have
killed nine people in the past three days in a village in Kenya's
Northeastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 people from the same village Takaba were admitted in
critical condition at a local health center in Garissa District,
the Kenya Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the dead were children under five, District Medical
Officer Peter Mbugua confirmed.
</P>
<P>
There are enough drugs to help contain the situation so far,
but additional drugs are needed because similar cases were also
reported in neighboring villages, Mbugua noted.
</P>
<P>
Contaminated water is believed to be the cause of the outbreak
as all those patients drank water from polluted water holes,
according to the health official.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has drafted a bill on
economic crimes which will be debated when Parliament reconvenes
in March, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The document, when made into law, will address corruption more
effectively than the existing laws, according to Musikari Kombo,
chairman of the Anti-Corruption Parliamentary Select Committee.

to collect views from the public on the causes and perpetrators of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
He added that his committee is now finalizing a report which
will also be tabled in Parliament when the House resumes session
in March.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Hosts Over 20,000 Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of Angola refugees
crossing into Zambia has risen to more than 20,000 since January
1, this year, according to the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"We have recorded a total number of 20,926 refugees," said
Musengo Kayombo, UNHCR assistant program official.
</P>
<P>
Among the refugees crossing into the country are the disabled,
women and children, Kayombo was quoted as saying by Thursday's
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are running away from the fighting which has
escalated in the southern part of Angola.
</P>
<P>
A total number of 7,547 refugees have crossed into Sinjembela
and Imusho area in Western Province, Kayombo said, adding that the
situation is getting worse because the number of refugees crossing
into the province was increasing at a very fast rate.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR has continued providing food stuffs and blankets
in camps in Sinjembela.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNHCR official noted that access to the area where
a high number of refugees have been reported is not easy and that
four-wheel drive trucks are needed to get there.
</P>
<P>
Kayombo said UNHCR is providing assistance at a minimum level
in Sinjembela area and efforts to acquire more trucks are being
made.

<HEADLINE> African Experts Determined to Fight Gun Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts from 17 member states
of the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders have resolved to fight
illegal firearms trafficking on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the resolution after a three-day meeting in
Ugandan capital Kampala Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to carry out the initiatives in the region to
address the issue of possession, trafficking and misuse of
firearms, the Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The problem in the Great Lakes region is very serious and as
long as firearms are easy to get, insurgencies would go on, said
Eric Kibuka, Deputy Director of the U.N. African institute.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting also decided to set up an African
Firearms Center in a certain country for dissemination and
collection of information regarding firearms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, all delegates realized that check and control
of firearms trafficking on the continent could effectively stop
and prevent ethnic wars and insurgencies as well as organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Half of firearms trafficking in Africa is said to be illegal,
one of the greatest potential threats to stability and peace, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that a workshop for government
representatives would be held here soon to find out what steps the
governments can take to tackle the problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. E-commerce Between Businesses to Grow Rapidly: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- One-fourth of all U.S.
business-to-business purchasing will be done online by 2003,
according to a new study made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
estimates that between 1998 and 2003, U.S. business-to-business e-
commerce will grow by 33 percent per year and reach 2.8 trillion U.
S. dollars in transaction value.
</P>
<P>
BCG said that the Internet will soon replace private electronic
data interchange (EDI) networks as the medium of choice to
transport electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
EDI is the electronic communication of business transactions,
such as orders, confirmations and invoices, between organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to BCG, U.S. e-commerce between businesses was 671
billion dollars in 1998, comprising 92 billion dollars in Internet-
based transactions and 579 billion dollars in transactions using
EDI over private networks.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, the transaction value of e-commerce between businesses
over the Internet will be 2 trillion dollars, and an additional
780 billion dollar purchase will be made over private networks
using EDI.
</P>
<P>
BCG's research shows that the size of the business-to-business
e-commerce market is far greater than is commonly reported, in
part because it recognizes the established base of EDI over
private networks and its extensions to the Internet. While EDI
over private networks represented the lion's share of the 1998
volume at 86 percent, BCG expects this condition to reverse
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, BCG said, over 65 percent of all U.S. business e-
commerce purchases will be made by the sectors of retail, motor
vehicles, shipping, industrial equipment, high tech and government.
Cost savings, rather than strategic opportunities, will drive most
of the initial adoption. Companies which have moved aggressively
into business-to-business e-commerce report cost savings on
materials up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reported transaction cost savings alone, in the purchase and
ownership of indirect materials, could reach almost 65 percent as
buyers' internal purchasing and record- keeping processes are
simplified.

<HEADLINE> Ford Unveils Rollover Protection System In SUVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Company plans to
add what it calls a rollover protection system in the fall of 2001
to its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks in an effort
to reduce fatalities, according to reports from the world's second
biggest auto maker.
</P>
<P>
The new system, unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday,
includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is
a response to the federal government's revelation that almost half
the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover
accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Its principal purpose is to help keep occupants inside the
vehicle and protected," said Helen Petrauskas, vice president of
environmental and safety engineering for Ford.
</P>
<P>
"We've looked at the most threatening current driving
conditions and developed new technologies to improve the
protection for our SUV drivers and their families," she said.
</P>
<P>
While some auto makers, including Mercedes, Volvo and BMW have
air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could
potentially help during a rollover, experts believe Ford's is the
first that is designed specifically for rollover protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 9,400 people died in rollover crashes in 1997,
according to the latest year statistics available. Forty-seven
percent of all fatalities in light trucks and SUVs result from
rollovers, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, while 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
</P>
<P>
Most often rollover deaths involve passengers being ejected
from the vehicle. Government officials and auto makers have
repeatedly said that wearing seat belts is the most important
single way to prevent passengers from being ejected in a rollover
crash.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Reaches Record High: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A weekly poll released
Wednesday shows that soaring consumer confidence became even more
positive this week in the United States, leaping to a record high
in 14 years of weekly polls.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by The ABCNEWS/Money magazine Consumer
Comfort Index, found that 77 percent of Americans rate the economy
positively.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts said that the new peak caps a two-year run of
extraordinarily robust public ratings of the national economy,
personal finances and the buying climate.
</P>
<P>
They believe the consumer confidence and the remarkable
economic growth cycle have been fueling each other: confidence has
been buoyed by low inflation, low interest rates, a strong job
market and rising incomes, and the economy in turn has been
bolstered by consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Despite its high level in 1999, confidence seemed to hit a
ceiling early last year, posting only one record high all year
after setting nine records in 1998. This week's record is the
first since last January.
</P>
<P>
The ABCNEWS/Money Index represents a rolling average based on
telephone interviews with about 1,000 adults nationwide each month.
This week's results are based on 1,044 interviews in the month
ending January 9 and have an error margin of plus or minus three
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Anthology of Pu Opera Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 13 (Xinhua) --Pu Opera, a traditional Chinese
opera that is loosing an already shrinking audience, has now begun
its second life.
</P>
<P>
A huge 20-volume Pu Opera Anthology, based on a set of hand
written scripts, has recently been compiled and published by
several elderly experts after six years of hard work. It contains
197 plays or episodes in 7.5 million Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Pu Opera has been popular in southern Shanxi for centuries.
Over 500 plays do not have texts because these plays have been
passed down through a process of oral transmission.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, a group of experts, organized by the South Shanxi
Pu Opera Theater went to the countryside to collect Pu opera texts.
These texts were then hand written but were never printed.
</P>
<P>
 After five decades of neglect, most of the texts are covered
with dust and many are damaged. To save these rare copies, the
Sanjin Culture Research Society in Shanxi entrusted several
experts to collate them into an anthology.
</P>
<P>
 During the compiling, the experts interviewed a number of
elderly actors, corrected scribal errors in the texts and added
new contents to the original scripts.
</P>
<P>
 Pu opera aficionados are overjoyed at the publication of the
Anthology, saying the merits of the experts can never be
overestimated.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An article in today's "
Shanghai Securities News" reports that almost 80 percent of the
100 economists interviewed by the China Business Climate
Monitoring Center say they are expecting a stronger stock market
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economists are also predicting that the stock market will be
subject to stricter regulations and that investors will be more
rational and less vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six percent of the economists predict a 7.4 percent
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth this year because of more
exports, China's accession to the WTO, rise in incomes, increased
consumption of automobiles, housing and education.
</P>
<P>
About 65.5 percent of the economists noted China should have an
expanding monetary policy to curb deflation and encourage
investment. And 28 of the economists said there is no need to
change the current monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 68 of the 100 economists said the interest rate of
RMB will remain unchanged this year and 25 percent of the
economists acknowledged that there is a trend in the country for a
further possible cut in interest rates owing to a relatively big
pressure on inflation.

<HEADLINE> First Private Museum of Natural History Opens in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The first private museum of
natural history opened in the city of Jinzhou in the northeast
China's Liaoning Province on the weekend. The museum was set up
based on the proposal of Professor Hou Lianhai, a noted
paleoornithologist.
</P>
<P>
Among the 300 rare fossils on display at the Jinzhou Wenya
Museum, there are a host of rare ancient plants and animals,
including the well-known Sinosauropteryx and Confuciusornis. These
fossils were all discovered in the western part of Liaoning
Province. The finds have drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
All of the 300 rare fossils belong to the museum owner, Du
Wenya.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibited objects, this specific Confuciusornis was
named after Du Wenya himself, who first discovered the fossil in
1998. Afterward, he contacted Professor Hou Lianhai of the
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, which
is attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Hou studied the
fossil for one year and noted that it was a clue to and could be
very helpful in discovering the skull structure of archaeopteryx.

Du Wenya, owner of the museum, used to be a staffer working in
Jinzhou City's Guta district Procurator's office. He has developed
a keen interest in the fossil collection. "Collecting fossils is
not only for personal interest, but for the sake of scientific
research," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fossils of Jeho (named after the formerly Jiho Province)
animals which had inhabited the planet during the Mesozoic Period,
a period between 225 million and 65 million years ago, were
discovered in 1996, attracting international interest. However,
some rare fossils have been taken out of China illegally.
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying my utmost to protect these rare fossil specimens,
and to do something useful for popular science education and
scientific research in the country."
</P>
<P>
Du has mortgaged his home worth 2 million yuan (241,000 U.S.
dollars) to set up his museum.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Du said, a five-yuan (60 U.S. cents) entrance fee
will not be enough to keep the Museum's operation going, and he
expressed the hope that fund can be raised from exhibitions and
selling some of the fossils if possible.

<HEADLINE> Australia Funds Sri Lankan Corrections Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia has provided a grant
of 10 million rupees (140,000 U.S. dollars) to Colombo's Community-
Based Corrections Project, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Justice said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to establish a community-based corrections
system acceptable by courts, the community, lawyers and agencies
of work placements and offenders, the ministry said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be provided through technical support, short-
term training and study visits to Australia, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Community-based corrections is a sentencing option that allows
a judge to punish an offender found guilty of a less serious
offense by ordering him or her to perform a certain number of
hours of unpaid community work instead of serving a jail sentence
or paying a fine.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted Australian High Commissioner Peter Rowe as

<HEADLINE> Japan's Plan to Ship Reactor Fuel Condemned in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace New Zealand
Thursday condemned Japan for planning to return a cargo of
Plutonium-uranium mixed oxide (MOX) reactor fuel back to Britain
and urged the government to make official representations to Japan
opposing the plan.
</P>
<P>
"The shipment of the plutonium-MOX fuel, which passed through
the Tasman Sea in September 1999 on its way to Japan, was totally
unjustified and threatened the health and well-being of millions
of people in en-route countries, including New Zealand and the
Pacific," Sue Connor of Greenpeace NZ said.
</P>
<P>
"Now the Japanese government and industry are sending the
plutonium-MOX fuel back because it is unsafe to use it in Japan,
regardless of the risks to en-route countries," Connor added.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the Japanese nuclear utility Kansai
Electric Power Company (KEPCO) announced on January 11 (Japanese
time) that it would return the cargo of plutonium-MOX fuel that
was sent by the British state-controlled plutonium company British
Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) in 1999. The Japanese utility authorities
acknowledged that the weapons usable plutonium would be returned
because BNFL had covered-up and lied about its failures to assure
the quality of the dangerous nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Thursday quoted
Environment Minister Marian Hobbs as saying that New Zealand is
powerless to stop a ship loaded with nuclear fuel travelling
through the South Pacific and Tasman Sea.
</P>
<P>
Ms Hobbs said the government doesn't know the route the
plutonium ship will take, but on previous occasions New Zealand
has been given an assurance such shipments wouldn't come within
this country's 200-mile economic zone.
</P>
<P>
However, both she and Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff would
raise the issue internationally, questioning the need for such
shipments and highlighting environmental and safety concerns,
according to NZPA.

<HEADLINE> China To Return More David's Deer To the Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING,January 13 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife protection
organization in China has worked to return to the wild more David'
s Deer in the world's largest David's Deer nature reserve in east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,000 extant David's Deer in the world.
Wild species of the rare animal have been extinct for over a
century. Experts hope that the deer will breed once it is returned
to its wild habitat. China today boasts 408 David's Deer in the
Jiangsu reserve. In November 1998, the Nature Reserve returned
eight David's Deer to the wild and one of the females successfully
delivered a fawn in March 23, last year.
</P>
<P>
David's Deer have been described as having the antlers of a
deer, the head of a horse and the body of a cow. The species was
named after Pere David, a French Catholic priest and naturalist
who first recorded the existence of the deer in China back in 1865.
Last year, the Nature reserve attracted approximately one million
visitors both from China and overseas and thus become one of the
country's 15 best-selected and most popular tourist destinations
in China because of their ecological achievements.

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- You Lantian, director of the
Beijing Bureau of Labor and Social Security, becomes the first
official in the Chinese capital to report work to the Standing
Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress (BMPC) since
October of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the Standing Committee of the BMPC decided that
the executive leaders of governmental departments should report
their work to the Standing Committee of the BMPC.
</P>
<P>
Around 50 standing committee members of the BMPC questioned the
48-year director on almost all aspects of her work. And most of
the 50 members expressed satisfaction with You's answers, but You
does have her critics.
</P>
<P>
Many Beijing residents listen attentively to You's detailed
work report. Feng Xingyuan, a retired engineer of the Beijing
Xuehua (Snow Flake) Appliances Co., said, "ordinary people have
now the opportunity to see what the officials have done and what
they have not."
</P>
<P>
Meng Xuenong, Beijing vice-mayor, who was present at the
meeting, said that You's work report allows both government
officials and ordinary residents to work together to make
governmental services still more efficient.
</P>
<P>
You is expected to further improve her work based on comments
and suggestions of Standing Committee members of the BMPC. And she
will deliver a detailed report in two months' time.

TAIYUAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai head office of the
Guinness Book of World Records has recently announced that a 36.65-
meter-long and 26-centimeter-wide scroll is China's longest

The scroll is the reduced format of a painting some 100 meters
long which depicts the scenery of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
It took Chinese artists Zhang Yinlin, Li Heng and Guo Xiaochen
more than three years to complete the painting, which shows more
than 120 scenic spots, including some 150 majestic ancient temples.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the original painting, the scroll is easier for
people to view, carry or preserve. Its weighs only two kilograms.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian President Accepts Resignation of Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad
said on Wednesday that he has accepted the resignation of Defense
Minister Jose Gallardo and appointed a commander of the armed
forces to take over his responsibility temporarily.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision came days after retired general
Gallardo stated last Saturday amid intensifying calls for Mahuad's
resignation that Mahuad, as elected president, enjoyed the
continued backing of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Mahuad turned down the resignation
request of the cabinet as a whole, which chose to step down as it
usually did in a gesture to show regret over its poor performance
and in hope of re-appointment by the president.
</P>
<P>
Gallardo's resignation was widely believed to be linked with
his order in July last year to arrest Fernando Aspiazu, a former
bank board director, on grounds that he stole the country's
financial revenue.
</P>
<P>
Aspiazu has accused Gallardo of going beyond his authority and
challenged him to make clear the whereabouts of the 3.1 million U.
S. dollars of campaign funds he raised in 1998 for Mahuad, which
Mahuad's campaign team did not report duly to the supreme election
court of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gallardo had become Mahuad's close aide after he played a major
role in the peace talks and the demarcation of borders and other
affairs between Ecuador and Peru.

Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and China are the others in the

</P>
<P>
Worawi Makudi, secretary-general of the Football Association of

</P>
<P>
Of the five bidders, the three Middle East countries have

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Receives Record Number of Tourists in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists who
visited Sri Lanka last year reached an all-time high of 436,440,
an increase of 14.5 percent over the previous year, the Ministry
of Tourism said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said Britain and Germany topped the
arrivals list in 1999. Tourist arrivals from Eastern Europe, India
and East Asia also recorded significant improvements.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the success to an aggressive promotion
by the private sector, the Tourist Board and Sri Lanka Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Except for December, the arrivals in all months were higher
than those of the previous year by 7 percent to 24 percent,
according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The fall in December was attributed to the fallout created by a
combination of elections and fears that normal life could be
disrupted by the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the highest tourist arrivals figure
recorded previously was 407,522 in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Adams over N.Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday met with visiting Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams over the peace process in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the implementation of the Good Friday accord, Adams
told reporters after the White House meeting: "I think it's true
to say that we had a very good meeting. There was considerable
progress made toward the end of last year."
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute meeting was also attended by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Clinton's National Security Advisor
Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of difficulties to overcome. The president has
played a crucial role since way back when the presidential
elections took place, when he was first elected to create
conditions to make peace happen in (Northern) Ireland," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said they focused on all aspects of implementing the Good Friday
accord, the historical peace agreement signed by the parties in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Hammer said the meeting was requested by Adams. "The president
is going to continue to play an active role and try and help move
the process along," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our progress today ... was on the whole issue of
demilitarization." Adams told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the purpose of the meeting was to have a "
strategic view of what needs to be done to bring about the full
implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday agreement."
</P>
<P>
Adams also urged David Trimble, leader of the pro-British
Ulster Unionists, to lead his party and help move forward instead
of setting ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear before I left (Northern) Ireland that Mr.
Trimble has to lead his party and to be true to the Good Friday
agreement, and doing it in the same way I have had to lead our
party," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Deadlines, ultimatums have not worked anywhere in the world in
terms of trying to get peace processes to come to democratic
conclusions. So let's go forward empowered by the progress that
has made life so much better for people on the Island of Ireland,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Nab Suspected Suicide Bomber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have arrested
a suspected suicide bomber who is alleged to have come to Colombo
to target senior government politicians, press reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The arrested suspect Jothiswaran, 28, had left the country
about two months ago when the police launched a dragnet for him,
said the state-run Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The police took him into custody on Tuesday night following his
deportation from Singapore, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports did not say why Jothiswaran was deported
from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Several bullet marks were found on Jothiswaran's body when the
police checked him, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The police suspected those bullet marks indicate that
Jothiswaran was an active member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) which has been fighting for a homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
On January 5, a woman suicide bomber blew herself up opposite
the Prime Minister's Office while earlier on December 18, another
woman suicide bomber attempted to assassinate President Chandrika
Kumaratunga as she was leaving the venue of an election rally in
central Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the two suicide bombings on LTTE
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The police believed that Jothiswaran had connections with the
two female suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile seven experts from the United States arrived in Sri
Lanka last week to help with investigations into the assassination
attempt on President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four persons including five security personnel were
killed in the assassination attempt and more than 100 others
including Kumaratunga and three cabinet ministers were injured.
</P>
<P>
Criminal Investigations Department investigators have
questioned hundreds of persons in this connection. They are trying
to ascertain how the woman suicide bomber entered the venue and
approached President Kumaratunga.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslim Scholars Reject Holy War in Ambon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Some top Indonesian Muslim
scholars said calls for a holy war against Christians in Ambon,
capital of Maluku Province, were wrong and insisted that they did
not want to launch such a war which would only worsen the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
"I reject Jihad (holy war) if it means collecting thousands of
people together who will then vent hatred and revenge," Deputy
Chairman of the Indonesian Ulemas Council (MUI), the country's top
official Muslim body, Umar Shihab said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic bloodshed has been going on in Ambon for more than a
year, involving Christians and Muslims, killing more than 1,000
civilians from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to conduct a war to take revenge because it is
a sin, but if Jihad is intended to fight the provocateurs, then it
is allowed," Shihab added.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year when the clashes intensified, some
Muslim organizations have called for a holy war against Christians
in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday President Abdurrahman Wahid rejected such calls.
</P>
<P>
"This republic will be broken if all Muslims nationwide go to
Ambon to carry out a holy war," said Amidhan Shaberah, another MUI
co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the House of Representatives (DPR) warned
the country's politicians not to get involved in the ethnic
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of elite politics in the conflict will only
deteriorate the situation," a house member from the National
Awakening Party (PKB), Effendy Choirie, was quoted by the Suara
Pembaruan daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another house member, Manasse Malo from the Nation Love and
Democratic Party (PDKB), also urged national leaders to be careful
in issuing statements related to the Ambon conflict.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that an independent investigation team be
formed to clarify information concerning the number of victims
from the two warring camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Five foreigners and members of
an international drug syndicate were shot dead during a police
raid in South Jakarta on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Head of Jakarta Police detectives Col. Alex Bambang Riatmodjo,
who led the raid, said the five foreigners are believed to be from
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The raid on the house rented by the five was carried out after
police seized some seven kilograms of cocaine from an Indonesian
couple at Soekarno-Hatta Airport. The couple were about to take
the drug to Canada and London via Hong Kong on a flight early in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We've been observing these members of a big international
drugs ring for at least three years. We have several times
attempted to bust this gang, but there had been a lack of evidence,
" Alex was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the five had been on the police list
for the past three years as the biggest suppliers of cocaine and
heroin to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of cocaine has a street price of some 600 million
rupiah (about 86,000 U.S. dollars) in Jakarta, Alex added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Tax Bodies Urged to Submit Collection Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Finance Wednesday ordered the two revenue generating agencies to
submit revenue targets for the year in a bid to ensure this year's
tax collections, the leading newspaper Today reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue) and Bureau
of Customs to submit estimates of revenue inflows for the year,"
newly-appointed Finance Secretary Jose Pado was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan, the government expects to collect some
661 billion pesos (16.5 billion U.S. dollars) in revenues this
year. This includes collections of the BIR, Bureau of Customs and
Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
An improved revenue collection will help contain this year's 62.
5-billion-peso (1.56-billion-dollar) budget gap, Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
Shortfalls in revenue collection last year have caused the
government's budget gap to balloon to 110 billion pesos (2.75
billion dollars) as of end-November last year. This already
exceeded the yearend revised target of 101 billion pesos (2.5
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the budget gap for this year has also been raised
to 62.5 billion pesos from 40 billion pesos (1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BIR, for its part, is setting an ambitious target of 397
billion pesos (9.9 billion dollars) in tax collections for this
year.
</P>
<P>
The BIR's original target for 1999 was 380 billion pesos (9.5
billion dollars), but this was eventually reduced to 353 billion
pesos(8.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Actually, the BIR collected 340 billion pesos (8.5 billion
dollars)for 1999, 13 billion pesos (325 million dollars) below the
target.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua to Sue Colombia at The Hague for Territorial Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 12 (Xinhua) --Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman said on Wednesday that Nicaragua will sue Colombia in the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague for a
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The president told journalists that his country is waiting for
the right time to present the case to The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua has accused Colombia of cutting off over 130,000
square kilometers of its territorial waters including the resort
island of San Andres in the Caribbean since late last November
when the Honduran parliament ratified a 1986 treaty with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, Honduras recognized Colombian sovereignty
over the waters also claimed by Nicaragua, which boasts fishing
resources and potential oil and natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute sparked tensions between Nicaragua and
Honduras, with both sending troops to their common border.
Meanwhile, Nicaragua levied punitive 35 percent tariffs against
imports from Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, Nicaragua filed a lawsuit against Honduras at
the ICJ at The Hague, the Netherlands, asking it to demarcate the
frontier in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan-Honduran standoff only eased after the
Organization of American States (OAS) brokered an agreement
between them on December 30. They agreed after talks to halt
immediately any military moves at the border and define a military
exclusion zone in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
They committed themselves to a peaceful solution of the border
dispute at the ICJ, and will continue talks over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ICJ will call Nicaragua and Honduras on February 4,
starting a legal process expected to last four to five years, and
cost Managua at least 5 million U.S. dollars.

kilograms, were sold at the store. The bars were worth more than
62.4 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the robust sale of the gold bars was partly due
to curiosity, but was more attributed to bars' exquisite design
and value for collection of the bars. For customers, they prefer
gold bars over the jewelry to maintain and increase their wealth.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that China sold gold bars to the public
since 1949. The decision by the People's Bank of China to share
its 1.5 tons of coveted metal with the public is termed by
analysts as a bold step forward to open its gold market.
</P>
<P>
China Gold Coin Incorporation was designated by the bank to be
the chief dealer of the gold bars selling.
</P>
<P>
The bars were also sold in 10 other cities in China, including
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan, bank sources said.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Expands Phone Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom signed an inter-
connetion agreement Wednesday with China Telecom, kicking off its
international and domestic long-distance phone services, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom currently provides paging, mobile phone, Internet
access, Internaet Protocol phone and limited locally fixed-phone
services.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great deal, which will provide another option for
Chinese customers to choose a long-distance phone service," said
Wang Jianzhou, executive vice-president with China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
The company has finished the construction of two optical-cable
backbones totaling more than 10,000 kilometers. And 23 long-
distance phone switchboards and one international line switch
board have also been installed.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is now only authorized to conduct locally fixed-
phone business in two cities and one province -- Tianjin,
Chongqing and Sichuan. It will continue to expand its own fixed-
line network, but will rely mainly on the phone network of China
Telecom to provide long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the inter-connection agreement will become effective
after approval from the Ministry of Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
The company enjoys the privileges granted by the government to
have a 10 per cent margin of phone price discounts, compared with
China Telecom.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, INTERFET Sign Timor Border Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the United
Nations-sanctioned International Forces for East Timor (INTERFET)
signed an agreement on joint border security acts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The security accord was signed by Chief of Udayana Regional
Military Command Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri and INTERFET Commander
Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove following a two-hour meeting, held at the
Mota Ain border post in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara Province (
West Timor), according to the Antara News Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was also witnessed by officials of the
districts of Belu and Timor Tengah Utara -- two areas which are
located on the border between East Timor and East Nusa Tenggara
Province.
</P>
<P>
One of the agreement's main points was that both the Indonesian
Military (TNI)/ National Police and INTERFET members can conduct
joint patrols but consistently respect the sovereignty of the
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Both parties also agreed to oversee border stakes and visit
each other to strengthen the joint security acts.
</P>
<P>
Besides discussing points of the agreement, Antara said, both
military officers also talked about various issues with regard to
East Timor, including East Timorese refugees, who are still in
camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Lack of food and security guarantee for the refugees who want
to return to their homeland was on the meeting agenda. Both TNI
and INTERFET officers vowed to pay attention to the existing
problems.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Indonesian side demanded a video
showing of the current situation in East Timor to help the
refugees make immediate decision on whether they want to return
home.
</P>
<P>
The border area has been at the center of negotiations and
controversy since October 11, when it was the scene of the biggest
border clash after multinational troops arrived in East Timor on
September 20 to restore security.
</P>
<P>
Two Indonesians were killed after they fired on an
international patrol. A joint investigation into the incident
later found that the two sides were using different maps of the
vaguely-defined frontier.
</P>
<P>
"From the first draft to this point there has been a lot of
effort from both sides to iron out differences, and at this point
the agreement is acceptable to both sides," Kiki said after the
signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove said the agreement would be respected by a new U.N.
peacekeeping force due shortly to replace INTERFET.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the final international border will be
drawn up by the United Nations and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony for more than 400 years. On
August 30 last year, more than 400,000 East Timorese took part in
a U.N.-sponsored ballot and overwhelmingly voted for independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
said Wednesday that it is his country's justice tribunals that
will try former leader Augusto Pinochet for his alleged crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
"It is the courts of justice of our country that must rule," he
said in a statement he read at the La Moneda presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Medical examinations made on life-long Senator Pinochet have
shown he is in no condition to face the extradition trial
requested by Spanish justice while British Home Secretary Jack
Straw has affirmed his decision not to extradite Senator Pinochet
to Spain, Frei noted.
</P>
<P>
Frei said his government has acted under a consistent state
policy. "We're behaving transparently, facing the country."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained on October 16, 1998, in London at the
request of a Spanish judge who intended to bring him to trial for
alleged crimes against humanity in Chile during his military
regime from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last October, a British judge authorized Pinochet's extradition
to Spain.

<HEADLINE> NBA Charlotte Hornets Player Killed in Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- NBA Charlotte Hornets
reserve Bobby Phills was killed instantly in a three-car accident
right after he left the Charlotte Coliseum where he did a morning
practice on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And the fatal late-morning accident about 1.6 kilometers from
the coliseum caused two others injured. Hornets' game Wednesday
night against the Chicago Bulls was also postponed.
</P>
<P>
Police started investigation to find out whether Phills in his
black Porsche was at the time racing with a car driven by teammate
and starting guard David Wesley. Witnesses said both cars were
travelling at high speed and Phills' car skidded several hundred
feet before the collision.
</P>
<P>
Wesley's car was reportedly going at high speed, although his
car did not collide and was not involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
Phills, a 6-foot, 5-inch guard and forward, was a nine-year
National Basketball Association veteran, breaking into the league
with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Hornets in 1997 after six years with Cleveland,
and was in the third year of a seven-year, 33 million U.S. dollars
contract.
</P>
<P>
A native of Baton Rouge, La., who played college basketball at
Southern University, Phills averaged 13.6 points, 2.5 rebounds and
2.8 assists per game in 28 games this season. Over his NBA career,
he averaged 11 points a game in 467 games with the Hornets and
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
Phills' accident was the second serious car wreck this season
involving Hornets players. Guard Eldridge Recasner remains on
injured reserve after suffering a broken shoulder and collapsed
lung when a Range Rover driven by forward Derrick Coleman collided
with a tractor-trailer. Coleman was charged with drunken driving
in the October accident.
</P>
<P>
Phills was survived by his wife Kendall, two children and his
father.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Must Stay off Drugs and Drink, Doctor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Argentine doctors said
cocaine and alcohol caused a massive damage to soccer star Diego
Maradona's heart. But the 36-year-old could play soccer again one
day if he stays off the drugs and drink.
</P>
<P>
"This is an example for young people of what happens to them
when they take cocaine and think it's so fantastic," said the
footballer's cardiologist, Carlos Alvarez. "This is the result."
</P>
<P>
The specialist said that when Maradona fell ill in Uruguay last
week, drugs and drink had left only 38 percent of his heart tissue
in working order. But medication has now helped it recover more
than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to forbid him alcohol and cocaine. If he stays
off that sort of drugs, his heart will recover," said Alvarez. "
This is not an illness to be taken lightly because it damaged an
organ which is the most important in the human body."
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the Uruguayan hospital of Punta del Easte said that
Maradona, one of the all-time soccer greats, was suffering from
hypertension and an irregular heartbeat. He was brought back to
Buenos Aires last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan police found traces of cocaine in the blood and urine
samples of the overweight athlete, a confessed cocaine addict,
after he was hopitalized. His manager Guillermo Coppola and a
publicist at a party they attended, are being investigated for
supplying Maradona drugs.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said Maradona's heart could recover 98 percent-- if he
cleans up his act.
</P>
<P>
"Within the severity of the condition, our prognosis could be
encouraging if he gives up the habit totally," said the doctor. "
If the heart muscle recovers completely, Maradona will able to
take part in sports again."
</P>
<P>
Maradona's personal physician Alfredo Cahe has talked of
sending him abroad for long-term drug addiction treatment,
possibly at a Canadian clinic.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, visiting Buenos Aires,
said he had not received any such request but "would have no
trouble" welcoming him.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, whose leader Fidel Castro is a friend and fan, also said
it was ready to offer Maradona treatment.
</P>
<P>
Maradona has already collapsed twice with hypertension, a
condition characteristic of drug abusers, in recent years
including once during an appearance on a Chilean chat show.
</P>
<P>
The hero of Argentina's 1986 World Cup victory against Germany
said in a recent interview that he first took drugs in 1983 while
playing for Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 it earned him a 15-month suspension from world soccer
while he was playing at Napoli and his attempted comeback three
years later was cut short when he was booted out of the U.S. World
Cup for drug use, and banned for another 15 months.
</P>
<P>
He is currently serving a three-year suspended sentence for
shooting at journalists with an airgun.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry to Be Beefed up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China is to fatten up its
animal husbandry industry as consumers begin to demand more meat
and milk and less grain, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the sector is vital to agriculture and the rural
economy, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As China has succeeded in striking a balance between the
supply and demand of major farm produce, it must find ways to
increase the added value of grain and other crops in order to
further speed up agricultural development," said Jia Youling, head
of the ministry's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Developing animal husbandry will not only help consume
stockpiles of grain, but will also lead to a better crop mix, Jia
said, adding that farmers also stand to make more money.
</P>
<P>
Jia said beefing up the animal husbandry sector will help
promote crop production and the agricultural processing industry,
and will spur the development of other related trades such as the
animal feed and leather industries.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the output value of trades related
to animal husbandry is expected to top 400 billion yuan (48.2
billion U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
Jia said the expansion of animal husbandry will also provide
jobs to the growing number of unemployed rural laborers and will
accelerate agricultural and rural modernization, in addition to
contributing to the cycle of ecological agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the country's goal to develop its
western regions will restore large tracts of farmland to woods and
pastures, which will further help the growth of animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Winter Blast Knocks Thousands Out of Power in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A strange winter blast has been
hitting Canada's west coast city Vancouver since Tuesday, knocking
25,000 people out of power, the country's CTV television reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hail greeted commuters in part of the city early Wednesday
morning. Once it touched down, it became sheet of ice, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The city was also reported to witness a lightening storm
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The local traffic authority had to shut down parts of upper
level highways, while emergency services kept busy responding to
numerous minor accidents, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In some of the areas, highways have been turned into perfect
places for games of hockey among drivers trapped by the icy
traffic, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The local weather forecast said there would be another heavy
snowstorm within days.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuban Universities Finalize First Exchange Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- San Diego State University
(SDSU) in California, the United States, said Wednesday that it
has created a historic university exchange program with the
University of Havana, Cuba's largest institution of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
While other American universities send students to Cuba for
short study tours, the SDSU exchange will be the first to allow
students to stay for a semester or a full year to study Cuban
culture, language and business practices by attending regular
classes at the University of Havana, said SDSU in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of SDSU officials led by its President Stephen L.
Webb will travel to Cuba later this month for a signing ceremony,
the university said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that education, which is really about sharing ideas,
can be a bridge to enhance understanding and cooperation between
our two countries," the statement quoted Webb as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen U.S. universities have sent students to Cuba
since a 1995 agreement between the two countries allowed exchange
programs. But those programs were short, lasting only a few weeks.
The SDSU students will be fully integrated into Cuban university
life, living with their peers in dormitories or in private homes.
</P>
<P>
SDSU is expecting to send three students to Cuba this spring
and 30 by fall this year.

<HEADLINE> Borg to Meet Edberg, Wilander in Farewell Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's tennis great Bjorn
Borg, 43, will play in what likely will be one of his last
competitive matches in Stockholm against Stefan Edberg, 33, and
Mats Wilander, 35.
</P>
<P>
Edberg grew up in Vastervik, a small town in southern Sweden.
Wilander hails from Vaxjo, another southern city.
</P>
<P>
Borg will quit competitive tennis after this year. "I'll play
seven or eight tournaments on the Senior Tour and a few
exhibitions this year, then it's finito,'' he said. "This will be
a lot of fun, although I'm not in the best shape after my knee
surgery in November."
</P>
<P>
Winners of a combined 24 Grand Slam tournament singles titles
and all formerly ranked No. 1 in the world, Borg, Edberg and
Wilander have never played in the same tournament before.
</P>
<P>
But Borg has played both Edberg and Wilander in separate
tournaments or exhibitions. They've also played on the Senior
Tour.
</P>
<P>
While Borg and Wilander still play regularly on the Senior Tour,
Edberg retired for good in 1996 after an early exit in the
Stockholm Open ATP Tour event and has no plans to join the Senior
Tour when he becomes eligible.
</P>
<P>
Edberg won six Grand Slam tournament singles titles, including
two at Wimbledon. Borg won 11 Slams, including an unprecedented
five straight at Wimbledon. Wilander won seven majors, including
three legs of the Grand Slam in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Each match in Thursday's round-robin tournament will be best-of-
3 sets. To speed up play, a maximum of eight games will be played
in each set, with a tiebreak if the score is 4-4.
</P>
<P>
All the 3,500 tickets had been sold out despite a live national
television coverage and above-average ticket prices. The most
expensive tickets cost 1,000 kronor (125 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Borg, Edberg and Wilander will bring their former coaches,
Lennart Bergelin, Tony Pickard and John-Anders Sjorgen,
respectively, for the matches.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Reports Big Tax Revenue Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province raked in almost 148 billion yuan in tax revenue last year,
up 25.1 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
This makes eight years running that the province has led in
China in total tax revenue volume.
</P>
<P>
China has been practicing a tax-sharing policy since 1994. Last
year, local tax revenue went up by 8.74 billion yuan and state tax
revenue by 21.77 billion yuan, up 20.6 percent and 27.9 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth in tax revenue is attributed to the country's
pro-positive fiscal policy China has been implementing, and a
sustained, stable local economic development, as well as greater
efforts to crack down on smuggling.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of 1999, the province chalked up 758.2
billion yuan in gross domestic product (GDP), up 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, various tax departments in Guangdong have
intensified tax-levying efforts by publishing a host of detailed
measures regarding levy of individual income taxes and of other
income taxes. The province scored 6.52 billion yuan in individual
income tax revenues last year, up 40.7 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The province also netted 11.13 billion yuan in stamp tax
revenue from transactions of securities, up 13.2 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenue hit an all-time high of 1.03 trillion yuan
last year, 122 billion yuan more than that of 1998, up 13.4
percent.

<HEADLINE> Tyson May Only Know his Fate at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Controversial American boxer
Mike Tyson will only learn if he will be allowed into Britain to
box British fighter Julius Francis when he arrives at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
And he appears set to challenge officials to force him to turn
back from Heathrow Airport on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bout is due to take place in Manchester on 29 January, but
it has been thrown into doubt following the British authorities'
decision to take issue with Tyson's criminal record.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has told the Commons that the matter
would be dealt with by the Immigration Service in the "proper way".
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokesman confirmed the situation in a fax to
promoter Frank Warren on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision must be made by an immigration officer upon his (
Tyson's) arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Tyson can ascertain in advance if he is qualified by
applying to a British Embassy."
</P>
<P>
Under British rules, anyone convicted of an offense which would
carry a 12 month jail term in the UK is not allowed into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The American was jailed for rape in 1992, serving half of a six-
year sentence.
</P>
<P>
There has been talk of Tyson taking on another fighter in
Germany if he cannot box in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
But Warren said there is no chance of moving the clash with
former British champion Julius to a venue outside the UK.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would consider taking the fight to the U.S., Warren
told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's too late to arrange, it's two weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
"We've laid out a lot of money - non-refundable deposits, air
fares and so on - and I'm not accepting it because the way this
has been handled has been very, very bad."
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I do believe that common sense will prevail and
this will be sorted out to everyone's satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokesman said: "The rules state that entry is
normally refused, except where there are strong compassionate
reasons."
</P>
<P>
The matter is already the subject of political debate, with a
number of candidates for the London mayoral election opposing
Tyson's entry.
</P>
<P>
In the Commons on Wednesday, the chairman of the parliamentary
all-party boxing group, Labor MP James Wray, asked Blair to ensure
that there would a "fair and just decision" in the matter.
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled by the way the four candidates for the London
Mayor have used Mike Tyson as a political whipping boy," said Wray.
</P>
<P>
"I am also concerned regarding the economic effect it will have
on the hoteliers and the service industry in Manchester."
</P>
<P>
Blair replied: "I think anyone would be ill advised to use him
as a whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
"This is being dealt with by the Immigration Service. That is
the proper thing to do, to play it by the book," he told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman had told reporters: "As I understand it, the
room for discretion is very, very limited."
</P>
<P>
As a U.S. citizen, Tyson does not need a visa to come into the
UK or a work permit to take part in a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
But for the fact that he is extremely well-known, he would
probably have been able to enter the country unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Concerns over Owen Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- England football team manager
Kevin Keegan has admitted he was concerned about striker Michael
Owen's fitness ahead of the friendly with Argentina next month.
</P>
<P>
Persistent hamstring injuries since the end of last season have
hampered the Liverpool striker - but this latest worry is
understood to be unconnected to his previous problems.
</P>
<P>
Owen may well be recalled to the Liverpool side after he missed
Monday night's FA Cup defeat at home to Blackburn, but his
presence in England's squad for the game on February 23 is still
not assured.
</P>
<P>
Keegan needs to see his first-choice players in action, as he
looks to build a team that can launch a serious challenge for the
Euro 2000 finals this summer.
</P>
<P>
The England boss said: "I am concerned about it as Michael's a
great player.
</P>
<P>
"If he's fit, he'll be in an England squad but that will have
to be decided by Liverpool and I can only pick up where they leave
off," he added.
</P>
<P>
Keegan also revealed that he planned some limited
experimentation for the match against Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Fringe players like Rio Ferdinand, Jonathan Woodgate, Emile
Heskey - who could replace Owen - and Steve Froggatt may get a
chance to shine.
</P>
<P>
Keegan will take his time to assess form before naming his
squad but admitted: "There will be a little bit of experiment but
I haven't got six or seven games to try this or that out for two
games.
</P>
<P>
"So it'll be pretty much an experienced side."
</P>
<P>
Keegan also insisted that David Beckham would be in the squad
despite his red card in Brazil and supportively described the
underfire Manchester United midfielder as a "model professional".

<HEADLINE> Bagheri to Leave German Side Arminia Bielefeld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian soccer star Karim
Bagheri, who has played for Arminia Bielefeld of the German
Bundesliga since 1997, was reported here on Wednesday to leave the
club and return to the prestigious home team Pirozzi Teheran.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that he has already referred his application
to the club and Arminia Bielefeld agreed to release him.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri, 26, who was regarded as the top player of the Iranian
national team, had played an important role in Iran's qualifying
for the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
He was transferred from Teheran to Arminia Bielefeld in the
fall of 1997, only to see Bielefeld relegated to the second
division last season.
</P>
<P>
But Bagheri led the German side to the champion of the second
division league and brought the club back to the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri played 11 matches for Bielefeld in 11 matches this
season but failed to score a goal.

<HEADLINE> Kiefer Still Refuses to Play Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- German tennis number one Nicolas
Kiefer announced on Wednesday that he would not play Germany's
Davis Cup World Group first match with the Netherlands on February
4 despite Boris Becker's resignation as captain.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old world number six, whose running feud with
Becker led to the latter's resignation late last month, claimed
that his decision was because of a very tight schedule owing to
the Olympics later this year.
</P>
<P>
Georg Freiherr von Waldenfels, new president of the German
Tennis Federation (DTB), confirmed that Kiefer had turned down all
the overtures made by the federation.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer's refusal to play places Germany in a critical position
as their number two Tommy Haas has a hip injury, David Prinosil is
recovering from an Achilles tendon operation, Marc-Kevin Goellner
has wrist problems and Rainer Schuttler is still plagued by the
stomach injury that he incurred during last Sunday's ATP final in
Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Yacht Quits Cape to Rio Race after Taking on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A South African yacht has
quit the Cape to Rio regatta Wednesday after it started taking on
water in rough seas. It switched to head for Port Nolloth, about
500 kilometers north of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The 12.5-meter La Bamba issued a distress call about 12:30 p.m.
when it was some 426 nautical miles (788 kilometers) west of the
South African coast in the South Atlantic, according to race
officials.
</P>
<P>
The decision of withdrawal was thought to be made mostly due to
the fact that co-skippers brothers Andrew and Ian Tozer had their
daughters on board.
</P>
<P>
Rob Butler, the skipper of the African Satellite Second Wind,
was the competitor nearest to La Bamba. He said in an interview
via satellite telephone that conditions were very rough and he had
heard La Bamba was taking on water. Having been unable to contact
race's guard ship, he said unless he had been authorized to
deviate from his course to help, he would carry on to Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The American boats Sagamore and Zephyrus were leading on
Wednesday the 5,500 kilometers (3,000 nautical miles) race which
began in Cape Town Saturday. They were believed to be on track to
break the race record of 14 days and 15 hours.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique-Swaziland Sub-Committee Meeting on Migrants Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambique/Swaziland
Sub-Committee on Defense, Security and Immigration began an
extraordinary session here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by Mozambique's protests against recent Swazi
mass deportations of supposedly illegal Mozambican migrants.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican side is hoping that the meeting will produce an
understanding between the two governments to end what the
Mozambicans regard as arbitrary repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting has been called because of violations of the
understandings reached at previous meetings," Inacio Junior,
director for Africa and the Middle East in the Mozambican Foreign
Ministry, told reporters before the start of the talks.
</P>
<P>
A series of meetings in 1998 and 1999 led to an understanding
under which Swaziland was supposed to inform the Mozambican
authorities prior to any repatriation.
</P>
<P>
But Swaziland has repeatedly violated these agreements and
continued to deport Mozambicans, accusing them of violating Swazi
laws, Junior said.
</P>
<P>
According to Junior, In the last mass deportation in December,
over 200 Mozambicans were repatriated without prior notice.
</P>
<P>
He said that he expected the meeting, which was requested by
the Swazi side, to review all pertinent aspects linked to
questions of repatriation, and the need to respect undertakings
given by the two sides.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members to Implement Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will implement its free trade pact in
April this year, SADC interim Executive Secretary Preg Ramsamy
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pact has been signed and ratified by 10 countries --
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, the South African
Press Association quoted Ramsamy as saying in Botswana's capital
Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that before being implemented, the pact has to be
signed and ratified by a two-thirds majority of SADC countries. So
far Angola and Zambia have not ratified the pact yet, while the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Seychelles are expected to
automatically accede to it when it is implemented.
</P>
<P>
Since the two-thirds majority requirement has been met, the
agreement will be binding on all 14 member states, no matter
Angola and Zambia ratify it or not, Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the trade protocol is the linchpin of
regional integration," he said, noting that "what remains now is
for the secretariat to notify the member states that the protocol
has been ratified by the required number of countries."
</P>
<P>
The aim of the agreement is to produce a free-trade bloc in
southern Africa by 2004 and to accelerate its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that within eight years, the region would have
reached a zero tariff level in all non-sensitive products and by
2012, it would have fully liberalized its trade.
</P>
<P>
"This level of liberalization would give international
credibility to the SADC trade protocol in the context of World
Trade Organization rules, which require that all trade be
substantially liberalized in a free-trade area," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC would set up a special technical committee to
oversee the implementation of the accord and to consider the
possibility of establishing a regional legal tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"This is imperative because we are expecting a lot of trade
disputes once the protocol is in force," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kagera Basin Organization Wants to Merge With EAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a council of
ministers of the Kagera Basin Organization (KBO) have proposed
that the regional organization be merged with the revived East
African Community (EAC).
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made at a two-day council meeting which
began on Wednesday in the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
"The KBO was created in 1977, the year of the demise of the
East African Community, for the purpose of replacing it," Rwanda
News Agency quoted Ugandan Minister for Foreign Affairs and
Regional Co-operation Eria Kategaya as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the EAC is revived with Rwanda and Burundi as willing
members, the two secretariats should be integrated to avoid
overlapping and duplication of services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan foreign minister decried the failure of member
nations to meet their financial obligations to the organization.
</P>
<P>
However, he hailed the Kagera Basin communication project that
was completed in 1991and has created a direct communication links
between Uganda and Tanzania to Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Kagera Basin Organization was meeting for the first time
since February 1996.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Revive Hope in Drought-hit Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains flooded several refugee
camps in Gaza while strong winds uprooted some trees in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, but these did not dampen the joy of the
residents in the water-stranded Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians there have suffered severe water shortage over
the past two years and the propitious rains that continued over the
last week rekindled hope among them. The joyful residents of Gaza
celebrated the Eid El-Fitr, or the Islamic fast-breaking service,
last Saturday in the rains.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Meteorological Department (PMD) said the rainfall
had reached a satisfactory level in most of the Palestinian
territories since January 4.
</P>
<P>
On January 4 and 5, the rainfall in West Bank city of Bethlehem
hit 93 millimeters, or half the rainfall in the province last year.
Ramallah and Hebron witnessed short snowfalls for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus and Tulkarm, the rainfall reached 66 millimeters and
77 millimeters respectively, according to the PMD.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip town of Khan-Yunis, the rainfall was 33
millimeters, the PMD said.
</P>
<P>
Rains saved the current agricultural season as they increased
the subterranean water level and purified the soil, according to
Palestinian agriculturalists.
</P>
<P>
The rains will also benefit the summer cultivation of wheat and
rye as will as olive and orange trees.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-year-old farmer of Khan-Yunis Mohammed Abu-Dharifa said
the rains would bring about a successful agricultural season. He
had grown wheat, lentil and pea in half of his 20 donums (1.878
hectares) land and plans to plant some summer economic crops like
watermelon, cantaloup, okra and cucumber.
</P>
<P>
Fayz Kadieh, 40, said delightedly that "the rains will enable me
to use the tractor that has been locked for two years in the
garage." Kadieh bought the tractor two years ago to plough land for
farmers for money, but the drought weather has left it idle ever
since.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts pointed out that the land was still in
need of more rains after two years of drought.
</P>
<P>
The water situation in the Gaza is still serious. The area has
no river or lake and depends on 2,000 wells to meet its needs of
potable and irrigation water. The subterranean water reserve does
not exceed 1 billion cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian official sources said Israel controls 80 percent of
the water resources in the West Bank. The Palestinian household
water consumption is lower than the minimum level set by the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
It is natural for the Palestinians to cheer up in the wake of
the week-long rains, but their sustainable economic development
will depend on equitable share of the water resources with the
Israelis, local observers believe.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are undertaking the final status
talks to discuss some thorniest issues including water sharing. The
two sides are expected to conclude a framework deal by February and
a permanent peace agreement by September.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Militants Face Crackdown as Amnesty Deadline Draws Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hardcore insurgents who refuse
to lay down arms will face all-out attacks from the Algerian
security forces as the amnesty offered by President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika to Islamic militants expires with the end of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Algerian media reported Thursday that a leader of one
of the two major Islamic radical groups was negotiating with the
authorities for his surrender.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Hattab, head of the Da'wa wal Djihad (Appeal and
Struggle), was seeking a blanket amnesty similar to the one
Bouteflika granted to the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), the
military wing of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The AIS, which had 8,000 members, announced a cease-fire in
October 1997 and was formally dissolved this week.
</P>
<P>
The January 13 deadline was stipulated in the Civil
Reconciliation Law issued by Bouteflika on July 13, 1999 after
being endorsed by the two chambers of the parliament in July and a
referendum in September.
</P>
<P>
The law pardons Islamic militants who have not committed
bombing, rape or murder.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has vowed a "fight without mercy" and "eradication"
against insurgents who are still committed to militant acts after
the six-month amnesty expires.
</P>
<P>
No official figures were available as to how many insurgents
have accepted the offer for partial amnesty but recent newspaper
reports put the figures at some 1,700.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline draws close, security forces were being deployed
in regions where radical rebels are active.
</P>
<P>
However, some sources suggested that the army appeared willing
to extend the ultimatum for a few days to make use of information
collected from surrendering militants for a decisive attack.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been torn by a civil war, murders
and massacres that started in early 1992 after the military-backed
government canceled elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win. So far 100,000 people have died in the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Security conditions have improved after Bouteflika, the first
civilian leader of the country in 24 years, launched his initiative
aimed at national reconciliation since taking office.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: U.S.-Palestinian Summit to Focus on New Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-Palestinian summit to be
held on January 20 in Washington will discuss news proposals on the
peace process, according to a senior Palestinian official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat's visit to Washington will be a continuation of his meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Oslo early last November,
Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu-Rudeina told Palestinian News Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Oslo the two leaders agreed on reviewing the Middle East
peace process regularly.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to discuss with Arafat the Palestinian
suggestions to push forward the peace process, Abu-Rudeina said,
pointing out that U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright worked
out some proposals that gave momentum to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he decline to elaborate on the Palestinian and U.S.
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The current visit by assistant U.S. peace process coordinator to
the Middle East is designed to reconfirm the U.S. vital role in the
peace process and to work out the agenda of Arafat's visit to
Washington, the Palestinian official added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and U.S. sides hope that the visit would be a
real and serious work visit at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli
final status talks are going on. The talks are very difficult and
require arduous effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met the U.S. official and his party this midday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah. During the meeting the U.S. official
said his country dealt with the Palestine question as the core of
the Middle East peace process, adding that Clinton would continue
his active and efforts to push forward the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will urge the United States to play a more effective role
to pressure Israel to be more serious in the final status talks,
Abu-Rudeina said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memo, the Palestinian and Israel
negotiators have to reach a framework agreement on the thorny
issues of Jerusalem, borders, water, Palestinian refugees and
Israeli settlements by mid-February, and work out a final accord on
permanent peace by September.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been little progress in the final status
talks since they were kicked off in September. Clinton promised to
exert effective efforts to help both sides settle their
differences.

<HEADLINE> EC President Hails Turkey's Decision to Delay Ocalan's Hanging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 13 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi Thursday hailed the decision by Turkey to put on hold
the death sentence against the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi, who Thursday evening ended a two-day visit in
Romania, described the Turkish move as a "correct decision" but
declined to make further comment at a press conference before his
leaving.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Ocalan
was arrested last February in Kenya and condemned to hanging in
June for treason and separatism. The PKK rebels he led have been
fighting a guerrilla war since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that executing Ocalan without waiting for the
European court's decision would seriously harm the prospects of
Turkey's joining the European Union, which has warned that hanging
Ocalan would be a grave mistake.

UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday wrote to the president of the Security Council
to convey his approval of the distribution plan for Phase VII of

</P>
<P>
The secretary-general's letter, along with the letter of the

petroleum production and export capacity, and on the options for
involving foreign oil companies in Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also assess the impact of holds placed by the

<HEADLINE> Security Council Vows to Address Refugee Problems in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidential statement, issued after an open debate on
refugees in Africa, said, "The Council stresses the need to
address the root causes of armed conflict in a comprehensive
manner in order to prevent those circumstances which lead to
internal displacement and the outflow of refugees."
</P>
<P>
"The Council notes with concern that the majority of refugees,
returnees and internally displaced persons and others affected by
conflict are women and children and stresses the need to intensify
efforts to meet their special protection needs, including their
vulnerability to violence, explosion and diseases, including HIV/
AIDS," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Council underlines the obligation of all Member States to
seek to settle their international disputes by peaceful means,"
the statement said, "The Council condemns the deliberate targeting
of civilians and practices of forced displacement."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, meanwhile, also "reaffirms its commitment
to the principles of political independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of all States," the statement said. "The
Council emphasizes that national authorities have the primary duty
and responsibility to provide protection and humanitarian
assistance to internally displaced persons within their
jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed the obligation of States to
prevent arbitrary displacement in situations of armed conflict,
and reaffirms as well their responsibility to meet the protection
and assistance needs of internally displaced persons within their
jurisdiction, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its grave concern that
alarmingly high numbers of refugees and internally displaced
persons in Africa do not receive sufficient protection and
assistance," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the Security Council urges all parties concerned to
comply strictly with their obligations under international
humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, and emphasizes the
need for better implementation of relevant norms with regard to
internally displaced persons," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council underlines the importance of safe and
unhindered access, in accordance with international law, of
humanitarian personnel to civilians in armed conflict, including

humanitarian assistance to them, and recalls the responsibility of
all parties to conflict to ensure the safety and security of such
personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council condemns recent acts of deliberate violence in
Africa against humanitarian personnel," the statement said. Two U.
N. staff members were killed in Burundi last November came just as
the last of many such fatal incidents affecting humanitarian
personnel working in Africa.
</P>
<P>
There are 6 million refugees in Africa, but their plight has
been long neglected by donor countries compared with war victims
in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Meeting Security Council on Iraq Commission Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
is meeting Thursday afternoon with the five permanent members of
the Security Council on the selection of a chairman of a new arms
inspection regime for Iraq
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council are China,
Russia, France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last month narrowly adopted a resolution
which created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to replace the United Nations
Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Under this resolution, the U.N. secretary-general is requested
to appoint a chairman for the UNMOVIC within 30 days after
adoption of the resolution, with the approval of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the United Nations has found
it more difficult than expected to nominate the chairman and the
secretary-general still hopes to announce a nominee, acceptable to
all members of the Security Council, by Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Intends to Restore Relations With Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has expressed
intention to revive its relation with the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), especially on economic and commercial matters.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Tanzanian Deputy Foreign Minister
Emmanuel Mwambulukutu when he met with a visiting DRC government
delegation led by Minister of Economic and Commerce Jean Bemba
Saolona on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was high time for Tanzania to improve the services at its
diplomatic mission in the DRC so as to further strengthen the
relationship between the two countries, Mwambulukutu said.
</P>
<P>
He told the DRC minister that Tanzania wishes to restore the
relations as soon as possible and that Air Tanzania Corporation
will reintroduce the Congo route services when the security in the
DRC government controlled areas is improved.
</P>
<P>
Air Tanzania introduced flights to the DRC in 1998, but it had
to stop a few months later when a rebellion war erupted in the
eastern part of the country late that year.
</P>
<P>
Mwambulukutu also expressed his concern over the fighting in
the DRC, calling upon the warring factions to respect and
implement the Lusaka peace accord in order to bring peace to the
region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, France Call for Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and France
Thursday called for an immediate cease-fire by all the warring
parties in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) so as to
restore peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement must be honored, said Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa while meeting with visiting French
Minister for International Cooperation Charles Josselin.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged the warring parties to cooperate closely with the
new facilitator Ketumire Masire in mediating the conflicts and to
give the Congolese people a chance to debate and decide their own
future.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Josselin assured Mkapa that the French
government is ready to support the Lusaka peace agreement which
was signed last July by Zambia, Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe on
the DRC side and by Uganda and Rwanda on the rebels' side.
</P>
<P>
The French minister also promised to support the Burundi peace
talks, hoping the new facilitator, ex-president of South Africa
Nelson Mandela, to start from where the late facilitator Julius
Nyerere, Tanzania's founding president, left.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held later in the French Embassy, Josselin
said that France is very concerned with the worsening situation in
the Great Lakes region, commending Tanzania's important role in
maintaining peace and managing conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is no need for the Burundians to start
from the very beginning because what Nyerere had done is good
enough to push forward the talks.
</P>
<P>
Josselin will leave Friday on a visit to Uganda and Rwanda
following a bryef visit to the United Nations International
Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda and the Secretariat of the East
African Community in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha.

<HEADLINE> France Funds Tanzanian Agricultural Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- France and Tanzania
signed an agreement here on Thursday to provide the latter with
5.7 million euros (about 5.9 million U.S. dollars) to upgrade the
permanent infrastructure of four major agricultural produce
markets in central Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Tanzanian Finance Ministry and the
French Development Agency (AFD), will be implemented over a period
of three years.
</P>
<P>
This is the third AFD grant to Tanzania, bringing its total
commitments to the African country to 9.8 millions euros (10
million U.S. dollars) since 1999 when Tanzania was taken into the
French "Priority Area of Solidarity", popularly known as Zone de
Solidarite Prioritaire (ZSP).
</P>
<P>
The two previous grants were related to the rehabilitation of
the Morogoro electric power sub-station (3.4 million euros, or 3.5
million U.S. dollars) and the feasibility study for a water
distribution project at Bariadi town in north-western Shinyanga
region (0.8 million euros, or 0.83 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After being included in ZSP, Tanzania would enjoy closer
co-operation from France as the latter tries to extend its
co-operation efforts to the rest of Africa from restricted areas
of Francophone regimes, said visiting French Minister for
International Cooperation Charles Josselin at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said AFD would also inject funds in other sectors such as
health and education in the country.

<HEADLINE> GM Leaders Urge Congress to Give China Permanent NTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DETROIT, January 13, (Xinhua) - Leaders from General Motors,
the largest automobile enterprise in the United States, have
voiced strong support for China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and urged the U.S. Congress to approve the
country a permanent normalized trading status.
</P>
<P>
"The business community strongly supports the agreement between
the United States and China on trade and China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. We hope to see the mission accomplished,
" said John F. Smith, Jr., Chairman and CEO of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview here on Tuesday with Xinhua and some
other Chinese journalists, Smith said that his company backs up
China's entry into the WTO because it is "healthy and good" for
both countries and "in the interest of the world."
</P>
<P>
After China enters the WTO, tariffs for automobile imports will
be cut down four times that of the current level. At that time, "
We'll produce cars many Chinese people cannot afford to buy today,
" Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"Also I believe we'll see automobile financing come to china in
a major way, and that is an area we would participate in as we
have done all over the world. That will really create a huge
automobile market over time, producing a major expansion of the
automobile businesses both in China and the United States," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, pointed out that some Congressmen and specific
interest groups, including the Automobile Union, are opposed to
giving China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR).
</P>
<P>
"So it's not a easy task, but everyone of us is working very
hard to have that done," the GM chairman vowed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richard Wagoner, Jr President and Chief Operating
Officer of GM, told Xinhua that his company has been "in a
leadership position" for championing improved trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
"We feel strongly that china should have a seat at the WTO and
be given permanent normalized trading relationships," Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a right thing for the global economy, it could help China
achieve its objective of development, and it's also the right
thing for the United States too," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wagoner said GM will provide continued support for the
enhancement of U.S.-China trade relations. "We are hopeful that
China's permanent NTR will be approved by the U.S. Congress so
that we can proceed on the important business of working closely
with the Chinese to develop their economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence B.Zahner, Jr GM China Group President, also said that
accession to the WTO will help China build an automobile industry
that would "create wealth for both China and the United States" in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
"As we begin to build cars and trucks in China, we'll buy
supplies in the United States and ultimately create jobs here in
the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
GM has invested over two billion U.S. dollars (or RMB 16.5
billion) in three joint ventures in Shanghai and Shenyang, two
major industrial cities in China, involving more than 2,000
employees. The company has also set up two automotive technology
institutes in Beijing and Shanghai to promote technology exchange
and train employees. In Addition, GM now has six parts
distributors and authorized service centers across China to offer
services to its local customers.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua to Abide C.American Justice Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman said Thursday that his country will abide by the
resolution of the Central American Justice Court (CCJ) to lift
retaliatory trade sanctions against Honduras.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do what the Central American Justice Court
will determine, but I expect that (Honduran President) Carlos
Flores Facusse will do the same," said Aleman before leaving for
Guatemala, to attend Friday the ceremony of assumption of the new
Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
The CCJ ordered Thursday Nicaragua to take "cautionary steps"
to suspend the commercial retaliatory measures against Honduras
imposed after a dispute for limits in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were strained after
Tegucigalpa ratified in November of 1999 the Ramirez-Lopez treaty
signed with Colombia, that according to Managua, takes off 130,000
square kilometers of its continental platform in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Parliament approved in December a law that
imposes an additional 35 percent customs duty to Honduran and
Colombian exports.
</P>
<P>
Honduras accused Nicaragua on January 7 before the CCJ of
violating an agreement of regional integration with the economic
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The CCJ asked Honduras November 30 to suspend the ratification
of the controversial treaty, but the Honduran Congress passed it
the same day.
</P>
<P>
Aleman reaffirmed that "definitively we are to sue Colombia"
before the International Court of Justice of The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua rejects in a special way the intervention of a
country extraneous to the region in a Central American affairs,"
said the Guatemalan president to the press.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Errs in Y2K Fix of Intelligence Computer System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the night of December 31, 1999, the U.S. Pentagon computer
system broke down, interrupting the flow of spy satellite data for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department would have had to shut down temporarily
the intelligence computer system in order to make an "end-to-end"
test of its Y2K fix, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the decision was to test the fix piecemeal, allowing
the system to keep running, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"They tested it in sections, and it turned out that it was a
mistake because the sections didn't fit together -- the sections
of the fix," Bacon said, adding that this was the only significant
Y2K breakdown among the several thousand Pentagon computer systems
that were fixed at a cost of 3.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Bacon said the several-hour outage on New Year's Eve
was not more troublesome than interruptions that sometimes occur
due to weather or other problems.
</P>
<P>
"This was well within the type of temporary interruption that
we experience on a fairly regular basis," he added.

<P>
The bourse plans to offer companies a forum for exchanging
recyclable wastes and rejects in materials of all kinds, but above
all aluminium, plastic, glass and paper.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEO at ecosquare.com, Silvano Coletti, a Roman-
born 30-year-old, given the start-up costs to move outside Italy
into Europe, Asia and the US, the company could hope to pick up 1
percent of a world market in recyclable products estimated at 1,
250 billion U.S. dollars "within 3-5 years".
</P>
<P>
At Ecosquare.com, customers will also be able to click into
services such as the certification of waste dealers and satellite
monitoring of waste transport.
</P>
<P>
The company, created by the Pavia-based environmental
certification concern, CGSS, also owned by Coletti and his family,
expects to spin off the portal and get a stock market listing as
early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
While taking the start-up forecasts with all due salt,
financial analysts said the company represents a new kind of
Italian entrepreneurial reality linked to eco-industry and new
technologies now emerging into the light of day on the Milan
bourse's New Market.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Aftershocks Rocks Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel hailed Thursday the coalition government's decision to
delay the hanging of Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan "a
relief" to the country, but three Turks set themselves on fire in
protest.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, two young men and a
woman, outraged that the government has stayed the execution of the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader, set themselves
ablaze on Thursday at a cemetery where Turkish soldiers killed in
the 15-year PKK insurgency were buried.
</P>
<P>
The three people were among about 100 relatives of the dead
soldiers holding an angry demonstration at the cemetery. They were
rescued and sent to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came as Demirel, the legal pro-Kurdish
People's Democratic Party (HADEP) and human rights groups all
praised the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The troika of Turkish coalition government agreed on Wednesday
through tough talks to postpone Ocalan's execution and accept an
appeal from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to put on
hold the process until it completes review of the case.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said the leaders of the tripartite coalition "relieved"
the country by making such a "correct, difficult and delicate
decision" that could not have been easily agreed upon by even a
single-party government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition cabinet groups the Democratic Left Party, the
Motherland Party and the Nationalist Action Party.
</P>
<P>
HADEP leader Turan Demir said the delay "would be helpful to the
trend towards peace and democracy in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Islamic Virtue Party and center-right
True Path Party condemned the decision as impairing the
independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The Virtue Party Deputy Chairman Ali Goren accused the decision
a "plot" trying to save the head of the separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
The True Path Party Chairwomen Tansu Ciller slammed the
coalition leaders of sidestepping the parliament, saying the
government should turn the case over to the parliament earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ultra-conservative Grand Unity Party leader Muhsin Yazicioglu,
meanwhile, urged the parliamentary oppositions to file a censure
motion and topple the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish special agents in Kenya last
February and was sentenced to death in June for leading a 15-year
war for autonomy in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey.
Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Appoints New Royal Court Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein issued a royal decree Thursday to appoint Fayez Tarawneh as
the new powerful royal court chief to replace Abdul Kabarati who
resigned earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Tarawaneh had served both as royal court chief and prime
minister under late King Hussein Ibn Talal, Abdullah's father.
</P>
<P>
He had kept a close relationship with King Abdullah who assumed
the throne last February after King Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The royal court chief, one the most important posts of the
kingdom, is responsible for handling daily affairs of the royal
family and serves as a de facto liaison officer between the king
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah did not explain the reason for Kabarati's resignation,
but appointed him member of the 40-strong Senate, or the upper
house of parliament which is formed by veteran politicians.
</P>
<P>
The monarch also praised Kabarati in a letter for his ability
and efficiency during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of new royal court chief appeared to be the
start of a series of measures by King Abdullah to reform the
administrative structure of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A major reshuffle to the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh is expected for the weekend, most probably on
Saturday, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government shakeup will touch upon at least five portfolios
pertaining to the ministries of health, justice, industry and
trade, posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh is expected to keep his job as the kingdom is emerging
from a decade-long economic stagnation since the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
Jordan achieved a 1.5 to 2 percent economic growth in 1999 though
official figures have not be released.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah has the constitutional rights of appointing or
dissolving governments.

<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The board of the
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) held its first meeting here
Thursday to discuss the issues of the agency's structure and
future work.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference following the one-day meeting at the

list of prohibited substances, and a research group will be
created to do research and development work in order to find hi-
tech ways to fight against drugs in sports.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting attended by a dozen of WADA board members and
observers from governments, sports organizations and governmental
organizations, the participants also discussed the WADA's
permanent site. Up to now, Lausanne of Switzerland, Lisbon of
Portugal, Madrid of Spain, Vienna of Austria, Bonn of Germany,
Lille of France, Athens of Greece, and Luxembourg have been
bidding to host the WADA, which is now situated at the IOC
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The WADA, established last November after several doping
scandals in sports, will meet again in Montreal of Canada on
February 16-18.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Says Mafia Not to Win Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi said Thursday in the southern Italian city of Palermo that
"the mafia will not win out."
</P>
<P>
An "all-out struggle" against organized crime must be waged "to
give life to a new model of civil and economic life on the island
of Sicily" but "we know that the strength of civil society will
prevail," Ciampi told a special session of the Sicilian Regional
Assembly held in its capital of Palermo.
</P>
<P>
He added that "a virtuous circle must be created that fosters
the security and confidence needed for economic growth and social
rejuvenation and which withers the roots of crime."
</P>
<P>
Ciampi also spoke of the pressing need for institutional
reforms and "a new electoral law capable of giving life to
stronger and more stable governments" which, in full respect for
the opposition and the concept of alternation, nevertheless last
long enough to develop and carry out their stated programs.
</P>
<P>
Scilian Regional President Nicola Cristaldi opened the day's
assembly meeting urging approval of a constitutional reform of
Sicily's special status.
</P>
<P>
At the president's meeting with Palermo's major Leoluca Orlando
and members of the city government, Ciampi recalled that the
citizens have made it clear they want Palermo and Sicily to be at
the center "of an new Renaissance of Mediterranean civilization."
