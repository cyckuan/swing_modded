<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday described U.S.
allegation of terrorism against Pakistan as "unfounded," saying it
is irrevocably opposed to terrorism in all its forms.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement
said, "The U.S. State Department's annual report on global
terrorism includes allegations against Pakistan which are
unfounded."
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the conclusions drawn in the report, Pakistan
believes that state terrorism is far more pervasive and pernicious
in today's world," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always cooperated with the international community,
including the United States, to combat terrorism,it said.
</P>
<P>
A number of suspected terrorists have been handed over to the U.
S. government and to other countries, the statement noted. The
government of Pakistan has recently announced a de-weaponization
drive to cleanse the society of illegal arms in the hands of
militants and extremists, it added.
</P>
<P>
As regards Afghanistan, the statement said, Pakistan has always
conveyed international concerns to the Taliban and emphasized the
need for cooperation with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, however, cannot be expected to interfere in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan, it declared.

ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez
Musharraf Monday described his country as peace-loving and said it
does not have any belligerent designs.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf made the remarks while visiting troops deployed at

according to a press release from the Inter-Services Public

</P>
<P>
Musharraf added that peaceful overtures and restraint in face
unprovoked shelling of the civilian population from across the LOC
should not be misinterpreted as a sign of weakness.

saying, "We have repeatedly called for dialogue and negotiations
with India to discuss the core issue of Kashmir and all other
issues in the region."

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Appeal to UN to Facilitate Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Human rights activists for
Bhutanese refugees Monday appealed to U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadako Ogata to create the environment for the return of
the Bhutanese refugees residing in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, the Organization of the Bhutanese
Human Rights Activists expressed the conviction that Ogata could
play a significant role in materializing the rights of the
refugees to return home with dignity.
</P>
<P>
"The role to be played by High Commissioner Ogata for the
return of the Bhutanese at the earliest would be of utmost
importance," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who completed her visit to Bhutan Sunday, arrived here
Monday for an official visit to Nepal at the invitation of the
Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
Ogata's visit to Nepal is aimed at facilitating the resolution
of the decade-old Bhutanese refugees problems at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in seven
refugees camps run by the United Nations in eastern Nepal since
they were evicted from Bhutan around the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said on her arrival here that she was embarking on a
visit to Nepal and Bhutan to mediate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are eager to mediate between Nepal and Bhutan and do
something substantive on the resolution of the refugee crisis,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after she arrived here, Ogata left for Jhapa district
to inspect the refugee camps located there.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan have
so far failed to reach any agreement on the repatriation of the
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Dismantling Army Outposts in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel has begun dismantling its
military installations in south Lebanon Tuesday morning in
preparation for the planned Israeli troop withdrawal from the area
by July, Voice of Lebanon radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Several Beirut-based radio stations trumpeted agency dispatches
from the Israeli-Lebanese border that the Israeli army has torn
down two outposts in the occupied strip Tuesday morning and planned
to dismantle two others later to begin the countdown for the
withdrawal that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to
complete by July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers took down a communications antenna in Tziporen
and removed boxes of ammunition from Olesh in a race to meet the
July 7 withdrawal deadline, security source said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two outposts are almost completely dismantled. Tziporen is
in Lebanon, while Olesh is about 100 meters beyond the current
border. A bulldozer was seen leveling sand dunes surrounding the
two neighboring outposts, Future Television station reported.
</P>
<P>
Amid Israel's process of ending its 22-year occupation of south
Lebanon, there were warnings from Beirut against cheating and open
threats from Damascus of uninterrupted guerrilla warfare, the local
radio stations reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government officials as well as Hezbollah guerrillas
remained jittery about possible disputes over the borderline to
which Israel will withdraw and over reports that the South Lebanon
Army (SLA), Israel's proxy militia, would be left behind to operate
as "National Guards" in the vacated zone.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barak has instructed the Israeli army's
sovereign command to "strictly respect Lebanon's land, air and sea
sovereignty after the withdrawal," local radio stations quoted Tel
Aviv daily Maariv newspaper as reporting.
</P>
<P>
"No excuse should be left for any group or government to claim
that the withdrawal was incomplete to justify continued guerrilla
warfare" against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Barak also had stressed that his country would harshly retaliate
if the Hezbollah guerrillas continue firing Katyusha rockets to
northern Israel or causes any casualties after Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed
aim of protecting its northern settlements from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust the Israeli forces from the
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mideast Envoy Arrives in Eilat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EILAT ,Israel, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross arrived in Israel's southern Red Sea resort city of
Eilat Tuesday evening to mandate the Israeli-Palestinian final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Ross refused to meet with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Before Ross' arrival, both Israeli and Palestinian negotiating
teams expressed their welcome to U.S. involvement in the final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Besides putting pressure on the Israeli side, the U.S. should
also help to forge a mechanism to implement the United Nations
Resolution 425 which asks Israel to return to the 1967 border
lines, said Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
The current round of the final-status talks started here on
Sunday and will last till May 12.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) Middle East special peace envoy Miguel
Moratinos arrived here Tuesday afternoon to help the two sides to
move the negotiations forward.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos held talks after his arrival with the Palestinian
delegation, saying the EU supports the Palestinians in their
efforts to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran said earlier that the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks have so far made "some
progress."
</P>
<P>
During the past two and a half days, the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams discussed every issue in the final-status talks
and Israel's third and final troop redeployment in the West Bank,
and "we have made some progress" on all these issues, particularly
on the issue of Israel's next troop redeployment, Eran said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel has to hand over
all remaining West Bank territories, except some military zones and
Jewish settlements, to the Palestinians in the last troop
redeployment, due to be implemented by June.
</P>
<P>
So far, under the signed agreements, Israel has already
transferred about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to carry out the last troop redeployment
under Oslo in June this year and the two negotiating teams are
discussing the scope of the redeployment in the current round of
final-status talks which began here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eran said the two sides held informal discussions, instead of
formal talks on Tuesday because Tuesday is Israel's Holocaust and
Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator in the final-status talks Yasser
Abed Rabbo headed the Palestinian team to the talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Israeli team, who asked not to be
identified, said the two sides are preparing for a summit meeting
between Israeli Prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Everything has to be decided by the two leaders and it is better
for the two to meet as soon as possible, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to strike a framework agreement on final-
status issues in May to pave the way for reaching a final peace
treaty in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks cover the fate of Jerusalem, the
Palestinian refugees, the Jewish settlements, borders and water.

<HEADLINE> Reform Process Irreversible: Iranian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
reiterated here on Tuesday that the reform process in the country
is irreversible, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian people have launched a revolutionary dynamism for
reformation and renaissance of their social life, and nothing can
prevent their determination to do so, Khatami said while visiting
Saeed Hajjarian, the prominent reformer who was shot and severely
wounded in March.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council and a
close adviser to Khatami, will be discharged from hospital
Wednesday after a long time treatment, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The reformer, who is also publisher of the now closed Sobh-e
Emrouz (This Morning) daily, was shot in the face by a young gunman
in front of the municipal council building on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The attacker and other suspects have been arrested and are now
facing charges of assassination.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami condemned the assassins, saying that homicide
is condemnable for whatever reason and in whatever form, and
especially if done in confrontation with "ideas."
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy that Hajjarian was eventually up and
determined to continue a life of "service to people, revolution,
intellect and national progress."
</P>
<P>
According to doctors treating Hajjarian, after the reformer
leaves hospital, he will continue receiving medical care until a
complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, still with a bullet in his neck, is now able to
undertake a nearly normal physical life with perfect mental and
intellectual capacity, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
They added that Hajjarian can now speak and articulate words
without problem. However, he would have to undergo physical therapy
for another three months.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian was considered as a vanguard of Iran's reformist
campaign, which has been growing since Khatami took office in 1997.
The reformer played an important role in the reformist victory in
February's parliamentary elections over the conservatives.

during the Holocaust period from 1938 to 1945 will open next
Monday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will attend the opening
ceremony of the exhibition, according to a statement of Berlin's
Centrum Judaicum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Today, May 2, 2000, is the 55th anniversary of the Soviet Red
Army capturing Berlin and next Monday, May 8, is the 55th

Holocaust survivors. And the exhibition will continue until August
20.
</P>
<P>

Berlin, but during the Night of Broken Glass on November 9, 1938
Nazis burned and destroyed most of them.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 of Berlin's Jews wanted to flee Germany before
the Second World War in September 1939, and more than 55,000
Berlin Jews were killed by the Nazis during the wartime.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Arrives in Lebanon for Talks on Implementing U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. secretary-general's
special envoy for the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, has arrived
in Lebanon and will meet with Lebanon's president and prime
minister Thursday to discuss the implementation of U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426 concerning the withdrawal of Israeli
forces from the country, the U.N. said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in the country, Larsen and his
delegation will also meet with Nabih Berri, speaker of the
Parliament, and spend two days visiting the United Nations Interim
Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Following Larsen's visit in the region and consultations with
other interested Member States, including those contributing
troops to the UNIFIL, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will
submit recommendations to the Security Council regarding how the
United Nations proposes to undertake its responsibilities as set
out under Resolution 425, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
Larsen's consultations with the president and prime minister
will provide the basis of the report that he will make to the
secretary-general following his return to the U.N. headquarters on
May 10, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 of March 1978 calls for "strict respect for the
territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries" and
calls upon "Israel immediately to cease its military action
against Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 also sets out the U.N.'s role, "in light of the
request of the Government of Lebanon," by establishing an "interim
force for Southern Lebanon for the purpose of confirming the
withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and
security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the
return of its effective authority in the area."
</P>
<P>
In Resolution 426, the Security Council approved the secretary-
general's report on the implementation of Resolution 425 and
agreed to the establishment of the UNIFIL in accordance with the
report.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 426 gave the UNIFIL a six-month mandate, which has
been regularly renewed at the request of Lebanon since it was
first approved in March 1978.
</P>
<P>
Prior to coming to Beirut, Larsen met Israeli government
officials. He will also hold consultations in Damascus, Amman and
Cairo before returning to the U.N. Headquarters on May 10.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Earns $322 Million From Coffee Export Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia earns an average of 322
million U.S. dollars annually since 1995 from coffee export, which
is the country's major foreign exchange earner, the Coffee and Tea
Authority has said.
</P>
<P>
Local Walter Information Center Tuesday quoted General Manager
of the authority Tsefaye Berhane as saying that Ethiopia's export
of coffee has risen from less than 62,000 tons five years ago to
the average of 113,000 tons annually in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye attributed the increase in export of coffee to the
launching of the extension package in the coffee sector, the
improvement of the information exchange system and the enhancement
of promotional and training activities.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said that farmers are now able to harvest as much as
nine to 11 quintals (one quintal is equal to 100 kilograms) of
coffee per hectare compared with four to seven quintals per
hectare previously.

their families and all Israelis with conscience, Israeli Radio
quoted some local people as saying.
</P>
<P>
The gamblers went to the Oasis Casino in the Palestinian self-
rule city of Jericho because all entertainment businesses in Israel
are closed from Monday night to Tuesday night in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
A young man, interviewed by Israel Radio on condition of
anonymity, said that he was "tired" of hearing the same stories
year after year about the tragedy of six million Jewish victims,
who were killed in Nazi regimes during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The casino, which is under Palestinian civilian control, offered
an alternative for those seeking to enjoy the day, he added.
</P>
<P>
The attitude of these gamblers toward the Holocaust Martyrs and
Heroes Remembrance Day sharply contrasted with that of most of
their compatriots, who observed two minutes of silence to pay
homage to their ancestors' sufferings on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
There is also a series of ceremonies in the week to mark the
Day, which officially began Monday night with an hour-long
commemoration in Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in the presence of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The gambling incident, according to observers, is a warning
signal showing that Holocaust historians' worries about the collect
memory of the "ethnic cleansing" are deserved.
</P>
<P>
These historians have warned that as the survivor population
dies out, there will be more and more young persons forgetting the
lessons, or even challenging the authenticity of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate comments from Yad Vashem Memorial
Council, which supervises the memorial activities throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Make Some Progress: Eran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EILAT, Israel, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian final-
status talks have so far made "some progress," said Israeli chief
negotiator Oded Eran here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the past two and a half days, the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams discussed every issue in the final-status talks
and Israel's third and final troop redeployment in the West Bank,
and "we have made some progress" on all these issues, particularly
on the issue of Israel's next troop redeployment, Eran said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel has to hand over
all remaining West Bank territories, except some military zones and
Jewish settlements, to the Palestinians in the last troop
redeployment, due to be implemented by June.
</P>
<P>
So far, under the signed agreements, Israel has already
transferred about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has decided to carry out the last troop redeployment
under Oslo in June this year and the two negotiating teams are
discussing the scope of the redeployment in the current round of
final-status talks which began here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eran said the two sides held informal discussions, instead of
formal talks on Tuesday because Tuesday is Israel's Holocaust and
Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo headed the
Palestinian team to the talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Israeli team, who asked not to be
identified, said the two sides are preparing for a summit meeting
between Israeli Prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Everything has to be decided by the two leaders and it is better
for the two to meet as soon as possible, the official added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross is to arrive here Tuesday
night to join the talks. The Palestinian side said that the U.S.
involvement is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to strike a framework agreement on final-
status issues in May to pave the way for reaching a lasting peace
deal in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks cover the fate of Jerusalem, the
Palestinian refugees, the Jewish settlements, borders and water.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Visit Monastery in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Almost 2,000 Greek Cypriots Tuesday
crossed into the northern Turkish Cypriots-controlled area of
Cyprus for a pilgrimage in Saint Andreas monastery on the occasion
of the Greek Orthodox Easter.
</P>
<P>
They crossed early in the morning at the Ledra Palace checkpoint
in Nicosia and arrived at the monastery, at the eastern most tip of
the island, by 52 buses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pilgrims were elderly or people in poor health.
There were also many children among them, as well as Cypriots
living abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cyprus News Agency report, each pilgrim paid
about 10 U.S. dollars for the bus trip, during which they were
accompanied by U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greek Cypriots paid several visits to the
northern Turkish Cypriot area on special religious days, such as
Easter or Assumption Day. The latest visit took place in March by
some 1,500 Greek Cypriot pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Similar trips were also arranged for Turkish Cypriots over the
past few years to visit places of worship in the southern area,
which is controlled by the Cyprus government.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Egyptian, Saudi FMs to Meet in Damascus Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Syria,
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are due to meet in the Syrian city of Tadmor
on Wednesday in an effort to revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli
peace talks, a Syrian official source said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's talks, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
and his Egyptian and Saudi counterparts Amr Moussa and Saud Al-
Faisal will explore ways to jump-start Syria's peace talks with
Israel, said the source on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has recently stated that he
would initiate more efforts to push forward the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks. Mubarak phoned his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-
Assad Monday evening and discussed with him the developments of the
situation on the Arab arena with emphasis on the Middle East peace
process, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, which resumed last December after a
nearly-four-year suspension, have been stalled since January after
two rounds of talks due to Israel's refusal to make a written
commitment to withdrawal from the whole Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war, to the borderlines of
June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Israeli cabinet approved Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's plans to pull Israeli troops out of south Lebanon by
July, with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon and its major
power broker Syria. And the Israeli government has formally
notified the United Nations of this decision in April.
</P>
<P>
The major dispute between Syria and Israel lies in the
sovereignty over the Tiberias Lake. While Syria seeks to restore
its sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the northeastern coast
of the lake, Israel wants to maintain its full control of the lake
as a major water source.

CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid expressed welcome on Tuesday to a border agreement
signed between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the headquarters of the Cairo-based

as "a historic achievement" made by the two Gulf Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the negotiations and the signing of the

said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Ask for 26 Million Dollars to Repair Public Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will ask donors at
the International Reconstruction Conference in Rome, Italy, this
week for 26.6 million U.S. dollars to repair public administration
buildings and replace equipment that has been destroyed, the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The request is part of the 450 million U.S. dollar
reconstruction package for the southern African country, the UNDP
said in a press release issued here. The Rome conference is
scheduled for May 3-4.
</P>
<P>
The public services component envisions training for local
government officials in data collection, processing, analysis,
computer use and reporting, as well as rebuilding and replacement
of office infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Officials would also receive guidance in how to assess damage
and develop plans to relocate displaced populations, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
The president of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, has appealed
for donor support to "rebuild the social and economic fabric
devastated by the forces of nature in a country where 60 percent
of the population already lives below the poverty line," the UNDP
said.
</P>
<P>
Flood ravaged homes and farmlands and destroyed the livelihood
of hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans in February and March this
year, which turned out to be the worst in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Damage to public administration buildings and office equipment
has paralyzed public services ranging from water and electricity
supply to the judicial system, including the operation of prisons
and police stations.
</P>
<P>
In the central province of Inhambane and Sofala, 24 public
buildings were damaged, and in the southern Gaza province, 43
buildings suffered damage. In the capital of Maputo, the central
prison was affected by flood damage.
</P>
<P>
"Public administration offices are crucial cogs in the
machinery that will ultimately carry out the reconstruction and
rehabilitation work at local levels in Mozambique," said Emmanuel
Dierckx de Casterle, the UNDP resident representative in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"If those offices are not functioning, it will slow down the
entire recovery process for everybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the UNDP has been helping provincial and district
authorities in Mozambique to enhance their decision-making process
by training officials, providing equipment and by helping to
establish better communication links between the different layers
of government.

<HEADLINE> London Keeps EU Financial Center Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- London remains its status as a
financial center in Europe, but its supremacy is threatened by a
failing transport system, according to an academic comparison
study from the University of Reading.
</P>
<P>
"By almost all economic and financial criteria, London now
dominates Frankfurt as the European international center,"
concludes the report by professors Andrew Baum and Colin Lizieri.
</P>
<P>
London is the most important fund management center in the
world, with 2,200 billion U.S. dollars of institutional equity
holdings under management. By comparison, Frankfurt ranks in 12th
place.
</P>
<P>
The City of London office market alone is larger than the whole
of the Frankfurt market, and proves more attractive to
international firms, says the report.
</P>
<P>
But the public transit system "is London's Achilles' heel," the
two professors conclude. "Underinvestment in the train and subway
network has left a system close to (or even beyond) capacity."
</P>
<P>
So the City cannot afford to be complacent. Frankfurt has the
advantages of a Central European location and the headquarters of
the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report warns there is also a threat to London from the
proposed merger of the London Stock Exchange and Frankfurt's
Deutsche Bourse, which could make the raising of capital in
Germany more convenient for many pan-European organizations.

<HEADLINE> Traditional High Streets Stage Comeback In UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The traditional high street is
staging a recovery after years of decline with London's Oxford
Street being the best place in Britain to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
Retail consultancy Verdict has ranked the UK's top 100 places
to set up shops, from the point of view of shopkeepers and
investors. "Gradual growth in sales and space is predicted over
the next five years," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Verdict believes that the high street's position has stabilized,
with the slowing down of out-of-town development and reinvestment
in traditional high streets and covered malls leading off them.
</P>
<P>
Oxford Street is followed by Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow
and Nottingham before the highest ranked out-of-town center,
Bluewater, in sixth position, ahead of Kingston-Upon-Thames and
Leeds.
</P>
<P>
Marks &AMP; Spencer remains the UK's pre-eminent high street
retailers, said Verdict, with almost 12 percent of total high
street sales.
</P>
<P>
The report found that just 16 percent of shoppers would like to
see more out-of-town development, but Verdict says further action
needs to be taken to prevent town centers slipping down the
rankings of its top 100 shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Currently about a third of shoppers are prepared to travel for
more than 30 minutes to a shopping destinations, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Families Arrive for Start of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, the Netherlands, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Families of the
victims of the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing began arriving here
for the start of the long-awaited trial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some expressed upon arrival little expectation that the trial,
to be held at a former United States air force base in the central
Netherlands under the Scots Law, would answer all their questions
concerning the disaster almost 12 years back.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least one year and is
estimated to cost some 3 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The panel of three Scottish judges must choose between three
verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven.
</P>
<P>
If they chose the first verdict, the two Libyans suspected in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988, would be
sentenced to life and serve their term in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If the judges chose either of the two other verdicts, the two
Libyan accused would go free.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers revealed last week that they would employ a
special defense by blaming two organizations and 10 individuals
for the bombing instead of the two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
Details of the defense strategy will emerge Wednesday when the
trial gets underway and when the special defense is read out in
court.
</P>
<P>
The arriving families of the Lockerbie victims were driven from
the Amsterdam Schiphol airport to their hotel in a blue-colored
Dutch coach.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that between 60 and 80 family members of the
Lockerbie victims will arrive for the start of the trial while the
others would stay to watch live transmission of court proceedings
in Dumfries, Scotland, London, New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The transmission will only be available for the families of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
The bombing over the Scottish village of Lockerbie killed 259
people on board the airliner and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation led to the issuance in 1991 of an
arrest warrant for Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fahima.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Raids on Rebel Positions in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian air force continued air
strikes on rebel positions in the southern and southeastern
mountains of the breakaway republic of Chechnya Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The raids, which involved Su-25 attack planes, Su-24 bombers,
An-30 and An-26 reconnaissance planes and Mi-24 helicopter
gunships, targeted rebel formations on the Chechen stretch of the
Russian-Georgian border, in the Argun gorge and in Vedeno and
Nozhai-Yurt districts.
</P>
<P>
The areas outside the villages of Tangi, Makhkety, Zony, Alkhan-
Khutor and Khalkinoi was shelled and bombed, Interfax said,
quoting the headquarters of the combined federal grouping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more refugees are flowing into and out of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, 1,927 Chechen refugees have arrived in
neighboring Ingushetia and 1,524 refugees returned to Chechnya,
the Ingush Migration Service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There are 214,800 Chechen refugees in Ingushetia at the moment,
Interfax quoted the service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign against rebels last
September following two waves of armed Chechen incursions into
neighboring Dagestan and a series of terrorist bombings that
killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other cities.
Authorities blamed Chechen militants for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Much of Chechnya has now been put under federal control and
only pockets of rebel remnants remain. The federal military said
they are conducting special operations now to capture the main
rebel ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Kravchenko, the acting Chechen Prosecutor, said about
30 former rebels would be amnestied Wednesday in the village of
Znamenskoye in Naursky district, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that several more groups of rebels will have been
amnestied by the May 15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
"Those who surrender arms before May 15 may count on an amnesty,
" he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament on Tuesday
approved the government's Economic and Social Plan for this year
after week-long debate.
</P>
<P>
As the deputies of the opposition Renamo party boycotted the
debate and the vote, the plan was therefore passed by 130 votes
from the majority Frelimo party to none.
</P>
<P>
The resolution approving the plan, drafted by the Assembly's
Plan and Budget Commission, instructed the government to submit a
revised version of the plan later in the year, after a more
detailed assessment of the impact of the February/March flooding,
and after donors have made their pledges for post-flood
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In response to demands raised in the debate, the resolution
instructs the government "to strengthen its capacity to supervise
public works", and to ensure that, in the rehabilitation of
infrastructures destroyed by flooding, priority is given to
Mozambican building companies rather than foreign ones.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea of Lacking Committment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Tuesday accused Eritrea
of lacking committment to the peaceful settlement of border
disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Because of Eritrea's attitude "to kill all peace processes for
ending the Ethio-Eritrean conflict", the prospect for finding a
peaceful settlement of the crisis appears now to be even dimmer,
the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia made the accusation when representatives of the two
Horn of Africa countries began holding "proximity talks" in
Algiers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to a story on an Eritrean web site which says the
proximity talks in Algiers are on a shaky ground, the Ethiopian
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks sponsored by the Organization of African
Unity was originally scheduled for early March.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry claimed that "the reason why the
Algiers proximity talks currently underway are in trouble is
because of a series of preconditions put forth by Eritrea for
starting talks on substantive matters."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers Still Being Threatened by War Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Cereal Producers
Association Tuesday said its members are still being threatened by
war veterans making it impossible to carry on with production.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the association Peter Wells told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that contrary to statements issued by the
government encouraging production, they are still receiving
reports of threats to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Wheat growers are not boycotting the crop, there is a genuine
desire to grow but many growers in a number of areas have been
threatened not to grow any crops," he said.
</P>
<P>
War veterans and white commercial farmers last week agreed that
the ex- combatants could stay on the farms they occupied without
disrupting farming activities while a peaceful resolution to the
land crisis is being sought.
</P>
<P>
Wells said production for this year was expected to be reduced
by as much as 40 percent of last year's output figure.
</P>
<P>
He said although there was adequate rainfall, production this
year would be reduced because of the land invasion issue and the
potential impact of electricity and diesel shortages.
</P>
<P>
Farm invasions by war veterans are threatening to cripple
agriculture which is the country's economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 farms have been occupied since February to back
 government's plans to seize land from white commercial farmers
without paying compensation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Asked to Brief Peacekeeping Details in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
Democratic Party on Tuesday called on the Department of Defence to
give the National Assembly a detailed briefing on proposals to
deploy South African peacekeeping troops in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Following a six-nation summit in Algiers, Algeria, attended by
South African President Thabo Mbeki last weekend, it seemed that
South Africa will soon dispatch a peacekeeping force to the DRC,
the party's defence spokesman Philip Schalkwyk said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Although this does not come as a surprise, serious questions
remain about whether the South Africa is capable of sending 3,000
soldiers to the DRC, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Schalkwyk said some of the more obvious problems will also
include medical and logistic support, sufficient reserves to
rotate troops, how to deliver the troops to that country, how long
the term of duty will be and how language difficulties will be
overcome.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council in February authorized to deploy 500
military observers and 5,000 supporting troops in the DRC to
monitor the ceasefire agreement signed by all warring parties in
Lusaka, Zambia, last year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Committed to Eradicating Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
pledged to eradicate polio from the country by December 2000 and
for this purpose a comprehensive strategy has been devised to
execute a countrywide plan of action for immunization.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by
Federal Health Minister Abdul Malik Kasi here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed the need to expedite efforts for the
eradication of polio, create awareness against HIV\AIDS, take
steps to check malaria, TB and cardiovascular diseases and work
out programs for mother-child health care.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kasi said the government provided syringes,
vaccines to different hospitals, health centers and dispensaries.
So far, he added, the government has provided 40 million syringes
and a sufficient stock of different vaccines against polio,
measles and other dangerous diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has also set up task forces to execute
the immunization program in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to ensure blood screening before
transfusion in all parts of the country in a bid to prevent
hepatitis, AIDS and other communicable diseases.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Armenian President Explains Sacking of PM, Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Robert Kocharyan
said Tuesday that the absence of a unified team, the worsened
economic situation and a threat of the armed forces'
disintegration prompted the sacking of Prime Minister Aram
Sarkisyan.
</P>
<P>
Kocharyan announced the decision to fire Sarkisyan and Defense
Minister Vagharshak Arutyunyan in a televised address to the
nation earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said it had been hard for him to take the decision bearing
in mind that Sarkisyan's brother, then Prime Minister Vazgen
Sarkisyan, was killed in a terrorist attack on October 27 last
year when a group of gunmen opened fire inside the parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
Aram Sarkisyan took over as prime minister last November.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere dictated the decision because the developments
shattered fundamentals of our statehood," Kocharyan said.
</P>
<P>
"Our constitution stipulates the close interaction between the
cabinet and the president," he said. "There must be a unified team
targeted at one and the same goal."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, no such team was formed. What is more,
political games of some ministers in the executive authorities
became a mode of life while economic problems mounted like a
snowball."
</P>
<P>
"Further developments of the sort threaten with disintegration
of the army and its political split, a halt of investments and a
drop in the country's authority on the international scene," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"Against the background of the deteriorating social position of
the people and the outflow of residents from the republic, I think
it is impermissible to tolerate such phenomena," Kocharyan said.
</P>
<P>
"My actions were based on the constitution of Armenia and
dictated by the duty to take responsible decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kocharyan said he would start consultations with various
political forces, primarily the parliament majority, on formation
of a new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Indicators Rise In March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. leading economic
indicators rose slightly in March after a drop in February, the
Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a survey
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Board said the Composite Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 106.1 in March. The index fell 0.3
percent to 106 in February.
</P>
<P>
"The significant increase in the leading indicators during the
last six months, tempered only by the financially related pause in
February, points to forward momentum in this expansion,"
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is in the 110th consecutive month of expansion,
surpassing the record of 106 month expansion in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The composite index is the key element in an analytic system
designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle in the
next three to six months.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said the index was driven up in March by
rising orders for consumer goods, rising stock prices and
declining unemployment.

<P>
ATHENS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Forty-five people were killed and
450 others seriously injured in traffic accidents throughout
Greece between Thursday and Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 road accidents have been reported in Greece since
Thursday when Greeks celebrated this year's Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
Greece's traffic accident rate is among the highest in the 15-
member European Union (EU) countries, with more than 2,000 people
killed and 30,000 others injured annually in accidents.
</P>
<P>
In February, a total of 1,594 traffic accidents were recorded
around Greece, leaving 145 people dead and 284 seriously injured.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Madcow Disease Surveillance Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) on
Tuesday formally adopted a decision to reinforce the epidemic
surveillance of the madcow disease in the cattle population.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, a monitoring program through rapid post-
mortem tests will be introduced from January 1 of 2001. Three
post-mortem tests had been validated last year by the EC.
</P>
<P>
The commission, executive body of the 15-nation European Union,
said that the annual monitoring program would be carried on a
targeted sample of cattle, with a particular focus placed on those
that died on the farms.
</P>
<P>
Focus will also be placed on sick cattle slaughtered as
emergencies and cattle that display behavioral or neurological
signs.
</P>
<P>
Around 65,000 tests will be carried out among the cattle
population most at risk to the disease. The disease was first
spotted in 1985 in Britain where 170,000 heads of cattle have been
confirmed to have been infected with the disease and have thus
been slaughtered and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The test results should provide more accurate information about
the incidence of madcow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in the European Union and about the pattern
of infectivity in the cattle population.
</P>
<P>
The testing program will be evaluated after six months to see
if any further adjustments are needed, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
David Byrne, EU commissioner in charge of consumer protection,
said that the next step would be for the member states to adopt
the decision to remove specific risk materials from slaughtered
cattle.
</P>
<P>
Belgium confirmed on October 31, 1997 its first case of madcow
disease. So far a total of 13 cases have been reported from within
the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Sector Enjoys Marked Growth in Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Having weathered the financial
storms of the preceding two years, Hong Kong's banks saw improved
results in 1999 and some enjoyed a remarkable growth in profits, a
senior financial official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The recession that had afflicted Hong Kong for 15 months
lifted and the economy began to grow again, and against a
background of market stability and renewed confidence, the
recovery gathered momentum toward the end of the year," said
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
During this year of stability and recovery, the authority
focused its energies on reviewing and strengthening its policies,
particularly in the light of the lessons learned during the
financial crisis, and on preparing the ground for major reforms in
the years ahead," Yam said in his statement in the authority's
annual report.
</P>
<P>
Yam said the assets of the Exchange Fund rose by 10 percent
during the past year. He noted that the year saw a number of
further reforms to the Currency Board system aimed at increasing
transparency and further entrenching rule-based, non-discretionary
principles.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the authority initiated a program of supervisory
reforms in 1999 aimed at supporting the development of Hong Kong's
banking sector into the 21st century and the process of reform
would continue in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his statement on the 1999 Annual Report, Yam looked
forward to new opportunities on a number of fronts for Hong Kong's
further development as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
But, he cautioned, "We should be mindful of the risks and
uncertainties that accompany these opportunities. The main risk is
that, in our enthusiasm for innovation or in our complacency with
things as they are, we cease to see clearly the weaknesses in our
global financial system and fail to take the measures to remedy
them."

<HEADLINE> 28 Killed as Passenger Launches Sink in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 28 passengers died and more
than 100 went missing as two passenger launches sank in the Meghna
River in Brahmanbaria district, about 100 kilometers east of Dhaka,
during a northwesterly that swept the area Monday evening, the
official Bangladesh News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commissioner of the district Lutfat Rahman was quoted as
saying the double-decker MV Dolphin capsized with some 150
passengers while it was going to Bhairab from Nabinagar of the
district.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said 28 bodies have so far been recovered from the
capsized launch, which sank as the passengers started leaving the
vessel in panic when storm suddenly blew away its roof, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the other accident, another small launch carrying some 50
passengers sank on its way to Nabinagar from Bhairab almost at the
same time but there is no immediate information about the
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said local divers abandoned the rescue search
in another storm Tuesday and they are waiting for the arrival of a
rescue vessel which left Naryanganj, 17 kilometers southeast of
Dhaka,Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sends Minister to Philippines to Monitor Hostage Rescue Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday sent a
minister to the Philippines to monitor the efforts to secure the
release of the 21 people kidnapped from Pulau Sipadan off Sabah,
East Malaysia, nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Pandikar Amin Mulia
left here Tuesday for Manila together with Deputy Defense Minister
Shafie Apdal, officers from the National Security Division and
representatives from the local media, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Malaysian police
headquarters here Tuesday night said Inspector-General of Police
Norian Mai, who is already in Manila, is expected to join the
Malaysian delegation in the meetings to be held with Philippine
officials.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to meet President Joseph Estrada,
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon and Home Secretary Alfredo Lim in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the delegation carries a message from Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad to the Philippine authorities stressing
that "the safety of the captives is most important."
</P>
<P>
"The mission is made because we want to know the true status of
the welfare of the Malaysians and foreigners kidnapped in Sipadan
from the parties responsible in the Philippines," Pandikar Amin
was quoted as telling reporters before departing for Manila.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also took with it medicines and food badly
needed by the victims, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Six gunmen kidnapped 10 Malaysians and 11 foreign tourists in
Pulau Sipadan on April 23 and the hostages are reportedly being
held in a hideout of the Abu Sayyaf separatist group in Jolo
Island, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreigners are three Germans, two South Africans, two
Finns, two French, a Filipino and a Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Pandikar Amin said Malaysia wanted to end the situation as soon
as possible through negotiations and did not want to put the
captives in danger.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of the Malaysian delegation
meeting with the parties directly involved in the negotiations and
the country representatives of the other captives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Jump in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- New-home sales around the United
States in March shot up 4.5 percent to their highest level in more
than a year, suggesting that an upswing in mortgage rates isn't
sidelining buyers, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Total sales of new single-family homes reached a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 966,000 in March, the highest level since
995,000 homes were sold in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts were expecting new-home sales to fall by roughly
2 percent to a level around 900,000. The 4.5 percent gain posted
in March was the biggest leap since a 6.8 percent increase in
October.
</P>
<P>
In February, new-home sales fell 0.6 percent, a little weaker
than the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under control.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.24 percent
in March, up from 7.02 percent for the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Even with an upswing in interest rates, robust construction and
housing activity helped fuel the economy's strong growth last year.
Economists expect home sales to slow this year but still remain at
healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West posted the biggest gain with sales rising
12.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 272,000.
Sales in the Northeast rose 11.5 percent to a rate of 87,000. In
the Midwest, sales grew by 5.1 percent to a rate of 185,000.
However, sales fell in the South by 1.9 percent to a rate of 421,
000.
</P>
<P>
March was the fourth consecutive month in which sales were at
or greater than 900,000, an unprecedented performance, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in sales helped push up the price of many homes.
The median price of a new home, meaning half sold for more and
half sold for less, rose 3.1 percent to 165,000 U.S. dollars, up
from February's price of 160,000 dollars. March's 165,000-dollar
median price was the highest since December when the median price
also was 165,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The stock of new homes was unchanged in March at 4.1 months,
meaning it would take 4.1 months to exhaust supply at March's
sales pace.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Summit to Focus on Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Free Trade Area (FTA) will be one of
the major topics of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) summit to be held in Mauritius on May 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic will be on maintaining peace and security
in the sub-region, COMESA Public Relations Officer Mweusi Karake
told Xinhua here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Karake stressed that without peace and security, COMESA's
objective of integration can not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, investment shortage, debt burden,
conflicts and HIV/AIDs are the main challenges facing the regional
group.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is expected to usher in FTA on October 31 after years of
 unremitting and arduous efforts.
</P>
<P>
FTA is expected to further promote trade among the 21 member
countries of the regional grouping and take it closer to the
ultimate objective of creating a regional economic community as
part of the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Once FTA is established, tariffs and non-tariff barriers will
be eliminated between the member states.
</P>
<P>
As from July 1 last year, four member countries have reduced
their tariffs by 90 percent, six by 80 percent, one by 70 percent
and three by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland and Namibia are members of the Southern African
Customs Union and as such, they have a derogation not to reduce
the intra-COMESA tariffs until the year 2000. The remaining five
countries have yet to make any reduction in the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Although most countries failed to meet the targets of tariff
reduction by agreed dates, all of them reiterated last year at the
summit held in Nairobi, Kenya their commitment to achieve the
target of 100 percent reduction by this October.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was established in 1994 to replace the Preferential
Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA), which was set up
in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Investigates Assassination of Lumumba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Belgium started on Tuesday a formal
investigation of the assassination in early 1961 of Patrice
Lumumba, the first premier of the independent Congo.
</P>
<P>
Geert Versnick, a liberal from the Flemish region of the
country, was elected president of the commission which had three
rapporteurs to report the findings.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Baculaine, one of the advocates of inquiry into the
assassination of Lumumba, was appointed one of the rapporteurs.
</P>
<P>
The commission is scheduled to try to find out who actually
assassinated the Congolese independent leader and whether Belgium
is responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary investigation was prompted by Flemish
sociologist Ludo De Witte, who had written a book entitled The
Assassination of Lumumba. De Witte believed that Belgium was
largely responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Congo, a Belgian colony since 1885, declared independence

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Posts Trade Surplus in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone has posted a slight
trade surplus in February this year, Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical office of the European
community said that the 11-nation single currency bloc registered
300 million euros (280 million U.S. dollars) in trade surplus with
non-European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Yet 12 months ago in February 1999, the euro zone trade surplus
with the rest of the world was 4.3 billion euros (4 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eurostat also said that external trade surplus dropped for the
euro zone in 1999 compared with that in the previous year, from 85.
3 billion euros (79.3 billion dollars) to 56.6 billion euros (52.6
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
European Union-wide, however, the external trade ran into
deficit again, with 7.1 billion euros (6.6 billion dollars) in
February, compared with 1 billion euro (930 million dollars) in
deficit in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
There was a total deficit of 13.7 billion euros (12.8 billion
dollars) in 1999 as against a surplus of 22.7 billion euros (21.3
billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU statistical office attributed the increase of trade
deficit to the price hike of petroleum products. The value of
energy imports to the EU grew 132 percent compared with January
1999, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The energy deficit increased by 5.2 billion euros (4.8 billion
dollars) and the increase accounted for most of the deterioration
in the total trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Among the EU member states, Germany enjoyed the biggest trade
surplus with 2.7 billion euros (2.5 billion dollars) whereas
Britain suffered the largest trade deficit with 5.2 billion euros
(4.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Trade growth was strong in all member states except Denmark and
Portugal, Eurostat said.

<HEADLINE> 600 People Knocked Out of Power in Canada's Nunavut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- An overnight fire has knocked homes
of more than 600 people out of power in a freezing Hudson Bay
community in northern Canada's Nunavut Territory.
</P>
<P>
The government of Nunavut declared a state of emergency Monday
in Sanikiluaq on the northern tip of the Belcher Island, where
local firefighters put out the blaze which destroyed the municipal
generating station.
</P>
<P>
"They're without heat and power and people can call out on
battery phones, but we can't call in," said Nunavut press
secretary Annette Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
The entire population of 630 in the community relies on a
municipal steam heating system. With temperatures dipping down
below zero in the region at night, the Nunavut government is
concerned about the welfare of community elders, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Nunavut government is requesting the help of the Canadian
military to transport a generator with a capacity large enough to
meet the community's needs. It will take five days to restore
power to the community fully, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The fire was linked to an electrical problem and has caused no
injuries.

</P>
<P>
They reportedly include 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two South
Africans, two French, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino.
They were moved to the southern Philippine island province of Sulu
on the following day.

<HEADLINE> Former Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham
Van Dong, one of the most revered and longest-serving Vietnamese
leaders, has died at the age of 94, an official communique
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique was jointly issued by the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of Vietnam, the National Assembly, the
president, the government and the Central Committee of the Vietnam
Fatherlerland Front.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Dong died on Sunday, on the eve of
Vietnam's celebration of the 25th anniversary of its victory in
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1906 in the central Vietnamese province of Quang Ngai,
Dong quickly developed an intense anti-colonial bearing.
</P>
<P>
He joined revolution in 1925 and was imprisoned by French
authorities for seven years. After his release from jail in 1936,
he resumed revolutionary activities and became a founder of the
Revolutionary League for the Independence of Vietnam in 1941.
</P>
<P>
Dong was elected an alternate member of the Indochinese
Communist Party Central Committee in 1947 and promoted to a member
of the committee in 1949.
</P>
<P>
From 1951 to 1986, he was a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and prime
minister from 1955 to 1981, chairman of council of ministers from
1981 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
He was an advisor to the CPV Central Committee and Political
Bureau from 1986 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese authorities declared two days of national
mourning for the death of Dong, and announced that a state funeral
would be held at Mai Dich cemetery in Hanoi on May 6. During the
two days, flags would be flown at half-mast and all entertainment
activities suspended.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial to Start Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, The Netherlands, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited
trial of two Libyan suspects accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103
more than 11 years ago is set to start on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Court officers, all from Scotland, said that they would keep
the trial as routine as possible but the families of the victims,
the relatives of the accused, hundreds of journalists and tight
security have all made the trial unusual.
</P>
<P>
The trial is already unusual in that it starts at a Scottish
court sitting on Dutch soil.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are
charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and endangering aircraft
safety in the December 21, 1988 bombing of the New York-bound
flight originating from London.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, after interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting
180,000 pieces of evidence in the biggest murder investigation in
history, were convinced that they had had the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said the court would hold sessions almost daily
through July 28 before adjourning until August 22. The trial is
estimated to last at least one year and cost some 3 million U.S.
dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The mid-air bombing of the Boeing 747 airliner killed 259
people aboard and 11 others on the ground in the Scottish village
of Lockerbie. Most of the bombing victims were Americans.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation led to the issuance of arrest
warrant for the two Libyans who had worked in the Libyan Arab
Airline in Malta, from where they were alleged to have transferred
the bomb onto the Pan Am flight.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, the United States and Britain accepted a Libyan
offer of a trial in the Netherlands under the Scots Law and the
two accused Libyans surrendered themselves to the Dutch police in
April the following year.
</P>
<P>
Three judges plus an additional judge were appointed in
November last year. The usual Scottish court procedure has a 15-
member jury while the Lockerbie trial has no jury but has three
judges to decide the case.
</P>
<P>
On April 27, the presiding judge of the Lockerbie trial court
rejected a demand from the prosecutor to delay the start of the
trial once again.
</P>
<P>
The start of the trial has already been delayed twice, both at
the demand of the defense. By the start of the trial on Wednesday,
the two Libyans would have remained in pre-trial custody for an
unprecedented 422 days. The usual pre-trial custody under the
Scots Law is 110 days.

<HEADLINE> Want a Divorce? Get Counseling First (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Money issues are a leading cause of conflict in Chinese
marriages nowadays, Zhang said. Many troubles result because of
low income, but some divorce cases involve a number of the
upstarts whose drastic income growth has led to extramarital
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people now are free to seek a happy marriage, but they
really need experts to tell them how such a thing is achieved,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Donglin, chief official in charge of the Nankai district
counseling program, said that the purpose of the programs is to
improve the quality of people's family life by providing them with
legal, psychological and other help.
</P>
<P>
One couple, who has a two-year-old child, applied for divorce
months ago because each suspected the other of having an affair.
But after a month in the program, they regained their trust in
each other and canceled their divorce petition.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth quarter of last year, about 130 couples
participated in the counseling sessions, and 20 percent stopped
divorce proceedings. Those who did eventually divorce said they
were better educated about the problems that exist in marriage and
would know how to handle them in the future.
</P>
<P>
Similar programs are now available in Beijing, Shanghai, and
Changchun. Chinese psychologists have said that such counseling
makes up for the lack of education on marriage and family life in
China.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Unhappy spouses heading for divorce
court in the Nankai district of Tianjin, north China, are required
to complete a month of marriage counseling before they start legal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
During the sessions, psychologists urge them to open up about
their marital problems, the balance between marriage and family,
their sexual relationship, and some legal issues such as division
of property and child custody.
</P>
<P>
The program started about seven years ago and receives 50 to 60
people each month.
</P>
<P>
New statistics show that China has entered its third divorce
wave since 1949, with 13 percent of all couples divorcing in 1999,
compared with three percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qibo, a therapist with the program, noted that China has
had three periods of high divorce rates in the 20th century, all
of them reflecting enormous changes in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
The first rise in divorces came in the 1950s, when the feudal
practice of arranged marriages was smashed, and the second was in
the 1970s, during the Cultural Revolution, when couples who
initially came together for political reasons started splitting up,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is also a researcher and the executive director of the
Tianjin Society for the Study of Marriage and Family.
</P>
<P>
In the current third tide, spouses who in the past had
concentrated almost exclusively on caring for their child or their
elderly parents are now turning their attention to the quality of
their marriage -- and don't like what they see.

<HEADLINE> Labor Day Celebrated in Disaster-Struck Area in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Residents of a poor county in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, which was nearly
flattened by a terrifying landslide last month, celebrated
International Labor Day Monday by rebuilding their homes.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Monday, trucks carrying relief materials
wound down a 1.5-km simple road leading to the disaster area in
Powo County. At a temporary dock at a nearby lake, farmers and
solders of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) were loading bags of
flour and rice onto two speed boats which were heading for the
townships devastated by the landslide.
</P>
<P>
The April 9 slide sent nearly 500 million cubic meters of mud
and rock down the mountain slope and blocked the Yigong River,
pushing the water level at the upper reaches above the danger zone.
More than 4,000 residents in two nearby townships were stranded.
They had been removed to safe area by April 17 with the help of
PLA solders.
</P>
<P>
Captain Wang Jun, a driver of one of the speed boats, said that
relief workers have rescued more than 1,000 people and transported
30 tons of relief materials in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a resettlement spot, villagers were paving a rural road and
helping each other set up temporary housing, while children were
studying in a makeshift school nearby.
</P>
<P>
In front of a newly-built wood shed in another village stood a
new henhouse occupied by more than 20 hens. One villager showed
off his clean home with new furniture and 25 bags of flour and
rice stacked in a corner.
</P>
<P>
"Although we endured a great calamity, we believe we will
eventually get over the difficulties and live a better life," said
the villager.

<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve its foreign-
related taxation system which will target at not only overseas-
funded firms in China, but also Chinese enterprises starting
business overseas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Taxation said that
the taxes on domestic enterprises which invest overseas as well as
the Chinese working outside the country should be restructured.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 Chinese companies so far have invested overseas,

</P>
<P>
At present, taxes levied on foreign-funded enterprises and
foreign employees in China are ensured by legislation which does
not apply to Chinese companies overseas.

The amount of foreign-related taxes surpassed 160 billion yuan
(19.3 billion U.S. dollars) last year, a rise of more than 40
billion yuan over the 1998 figure and accounting for 16 percent of
China's total industrial and commercial tax revenue.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministry Bans Hardline Protest March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Ministry on Tuesday
banned a hardline demonstration against the moderate Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani who is under
attack of the conservatives for his open-mind policies on the
press.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that it denied the
permit to the Basiji (volunteers) students to hold a demonstration
in consideration of the disagreement expressed by Tehran's Security
Council, the Intelligence Ministry and the Student Committee of the
State Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Basiji students, who are under the command of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), had previously announced to
march on Tuesday from Tehran University to Mohajerani's ministry in
downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The students intended to express their protest against
Mohajerani's policies and their support for the latest move by the
judiciary to close down a number of reformist papers, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary closed down almost all the reformist
newspapers in an intensified crackdown on the reformist allies of
President Mohammad Khatami last month, leaving the reformists
without a voice in the ongoing campaign for the runoff of the
February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The runoff is to be held on Friday in 52 constituencies for 66
seats of the 290-seat new parliament, which will be handed over on
May 28 to the reformists, who won a landslide victory over the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Basiji students have accepted the decision of the Interior
Ministry, which is responsible for domestic administration and
security affairs, but blamed the decision as "illegal."
</P>
<P>
They announced to exert utmost effort to hold an authorized
protest march on May 9 against Mohajerani, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a close ally of President Khatami, has been
frequently attacked by the conservatives for his policies to defend
the freedom of press and expression.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said recently that the outgoing conservative Majlis
(parliament) intended to lodge an impeachment against him. He
survived an impeachment May last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Majlis Speaker Nateq Nouri said on Tuesday that the
parliament would unlikely to impeach any ministers under current
sensitive situation.

Pervez Musharraf Tuesday promised to protect the interests of
laborers but urged them to support the government's efforts to
revive the country's economy, which he said is the key to the
solution of all problems.
</P>
<P>
"It is the upper class, not the labor who has plundered the

industrial relations here.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he is committed to making Pakistan "rise for all
times to come," so that no one could ever retard its way to
progress.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to put an end to all forms of unfair
practices including child labor, the chief executive said, adding
that it is committed to improving the conditions of both the
peasants and workers.

CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia remained low-key Tuesday
over its mid-air encounter with Indonesian Air Force jets.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister John Moore said Tuesday that it was a
miscalculation by Indonesia, Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Two armed Indonesian planes reportedly flew within seven meters
of five unarmed Australian aircraft last Wednesday, which
Indonesia said invaded its territorial airspace.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the incident was clearly the result of
misunderstanding and he denied that the interception was linked to
strains in the relationship between the two countries in the wake
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had an official explanation, no, but my anticipation
was that it was just a miscalculation," he said. "We had full
diplomatic clearances there, so there's a bit of a miscue
somewhere."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Howard said last week in Paris
that after Australia's involvement in East Timor the relationship
between his country and Indonesia "will never be the same and that
's not necessarily a bad thing."

NEW DELHI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Index (Sensex)
crashed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Tuesday in the wake of

The BSE 30-share Sensitive Index opened on a strong footing at

<P>
YANGON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The first one-day meeting of the
economic ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN) with their counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea
ended here Tuesday evening with a joint press statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers recognized the importance of cooperation and
collaboration in industry, trade, investment and other economic
areas among ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea against the
background of the deepened economic interdependence in the region
spurred by globalization and the rapid development of information
and communications technology (ICT), the statement said.

valuable opportunity for further collaboration, promote a cohesive
response to the challenges of globalization and recover the region
's role as a growth center in the world, it stated.

The ministers discussed international economic issues, aimed at
promoting coordination and cooperation among ASEAN plus 3 in
international and regional economic fora such as the World Trade
Organization, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Asia-
Europe Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted the large flow of trade between ASEAN and
the three Northeast Asian countries, which in 1998 totaled 122
billion U.S. dollars. They agreed that with the sustained economic
recovery of the region, there is a huge potential for further
expanding trade and investment flows among the countries of East
Asia.
</P>
<P>

the meeting include trade, investment and technology transfer,
information technology and e-commerce, development of growth areas
including the Mekong River Basin, human resources development,
agriculture, industry and tourism, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed the importance of equal partnership as a
basis of cooperation between ASEAN and the three countries, the
importance of further improving the investment environment in the
region and the importance of human resources development in ICT,
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and supporting
industries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers tasked their senior officials to take the
necessary follow-up actions to ensure that concrete outcomes could
be achieved, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN plus 3 economic ministers meeting was held under the
mandate of the leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea at

between ASEAN and the three Northeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish Leaders Bid for N.Irish Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland were stepping up
their efforts to revive the flagging Ulster peace process on
Tuesday but with little chance for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern were meeting the main Northern Ireland political
parties at Downing Street in a further effort to break the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said the
British and Irish prime ministers were bringing new ideas to the
separate meetings with the main parties.
</P>
<P>
Although he said the proposals would be something that "both
sides could buy into", he was cautious about the possibility of a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Since Northern Ireland devolution was suspended on February 11,
the two governments have been meeting the parties, but the impasse
between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein over Irish Republican
Army arms and sharing power has remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the government was seeking a way forward which
would give assurances to unionists, nationalists and republicans.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC Radio "I don't want to raise expectations about
what is going to be achieved but I think we can go further in
reducing differences between the parties."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is worth preserving and persevering in this," he
said. "There is no secret that the key issue and the stumbling
block for us ...is that of arms, of decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish prime ministers were meeting separately
with the leaders of the pro-agreement parties Sinn Fein, the
Ulster Unionist Party, and the main nationalist party the Social
Democratic and Labor Party throughout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before their meeting with the prime ministers, Sinn
Fein assemblywoman Bairbre de Brun said: "Sinn Fein's commitment
today is to saving the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
But she made it clear that gaining the progress sought on the
arms issue by unionists, was not high on Sinn Fein's agenda.
</P>
<P>
She added that the delegation wanted to get "clarity and
certainty about the intentions of the British government".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, political ally of the Irish Republican Army
guerrillas, blamed the London government. Britain in February
suspended Northern Ireland's fledgling Protestant-Catholic
coalition government because it said the IRA had shown no
commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern were struggling to turn the high hopes of the
1998 Good Friday accord into reality by getting parties to agree
on a formula to take guns out of the political arena and build a
power-sharing government of Roman Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Blair may hold more talks in Northern Ireland later this week
if progress is made on Tuesday, political sources said.

NANNING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 180 billion yuan (
21.7 billion U.S. dollars) in building highways this year,
according to Li Juchang, vice-minister of communications.

<P>
Last year, China built 73,200 km of highways, increasing the
country's total highway mileage to 1.35 million km.
</P>
<P>
China will make great efforts to build up a comprehensive

</P>
<P>
Interprovincial highways and roads in rural areas will be a
major part of a ten-year construction plan. By the end of 2010,
eight highways will run from the east to the west, and 195,000-km

million U.S.dollar as part of the current phase of the oil for food
program.
</P>
<P>

KHARTOUM -- Inflation in Sudan declined during last March by 2.9
percent to reach 11.9 percent against 14.8 percent during the same
month in 1999, and against 13.5 percent in February and 41.7
percent in January from the same year.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Sudanese Central Agency For
Statistics indicated that inflation dropped by 13.7 percent in the
first four months of the current year, compared with about 16.2
percent during the first four months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM not Against Village Handover to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli deputy prime minister
Binyamin Ben Eliezer said here on Tuesday that he has never heard
of Foreign Minister David Levy's opposition to the transfer of Abu
Dis, a village next to Jerusalem, to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Eliezer said Prime Minister
Ehud Barak coordinated his diplomatic moves with Levy.
</P>
<P>
Eliezer made the remarks in response to a report in the Israeli
daily Ha'aretz Tuesday that Levy is against the planned handover of
Abu Dis to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking on the radio, Knesset (parliament) Member of the
opposition Likud Party Dan Naveh proposed Barak do what is good for
Israel and Jerusalem and change his mind about giving Abu Dis to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister revealed last week that he intended to
transfer Abu Dis and two other villages, Azariya, and Swahara, east
of Jerusalem as a good-will gesture to the Palestinians prior to
the final Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which is slated for June.
</P>
<P>
The intended transfer of the three villages, now marked as Area
B which is under Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control,
is deemed as Barak's territorial down payment and has drawn severe
criticism from rightist parties.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz said Tuesday that Levy is against "down payment" until
the Palestinian Authority shows "flexibility".
</P>
<P>
Meeting with his visiting Australian counterpart on Sunday,
Barak said that the Palestinians must have territorial congruity so
that there is a separation between them and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to criticism that his intended transfer
of three villages east of Jerusalem to the Palestinian control
might weaken Israel's control of Jerusalem as its capital, Barak
said one should not confuse the villages Azariya and Abu Dis as
being part of Jerusalem toward which all Jews pray.
</P>
<P>
The intended good-will gesture, however, has been turned down by
the Palestinian side for fear that the gesture will sacrifice a
larger territorial compromise in the final status agreement.

<HEADLINE> 8 Injured in Missile Attacks in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were injured in guided
missile attacks against residential areas in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
All the injured have been rushed into hospitals for emergency
treatment, a well-informed source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A number of mercenaries, who infiltrated into Iraq and attempted
to spread terror among innocent people, fired six guided missiles
on Monday evening at residential areas of Iraqi and Arab citizens,
leading to the injury of eight people and damage of several houses,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi security authorities have launched an immediate
investigation into the incident and "found the equipment used by
the mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has condemned "this criminal act" and held the Iranian
regime responsible for the attack, stressing that Iraq has full
rights to retaliate against such acts at a suitable time.
</P>
<P>
For years, Iraq and Iran, the two Gulf neighbors who fought a
bloody war from 1980-1988, have been trading accusations against
each other for harboring each other's opposition groups engaged in
terrorist activities, hampering the normalization of bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> HKMA Annual Report for 1999 Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- An annual report for 1999,
explaining the HKMA's work and achievements over the past year and
setting out the challenges and objectives for the year ahead, was
published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) here today.
</P>
<P>
"During this year of stability and recovery the HKMA focused
its energies on reviewing and strengthening its policies,
particularly in the light of the lessons learned during the
financial crisis, and on preparing the ground for major reforms in
the years ahead," said Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, in
his Statement on the Annual Report.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that in 1999, the recession that had afflicted Hong
Kong for 15 months lifted and the economy began to grow again.
Against a background of market stability and renewed confidence,
the recovery gathered momentum towards the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Having weathered the financial storms of the
preceding two years without serious damage, Hong Kong's banking
sector enjoyed a better year in 1999 than it had in 1998," and "
Banks as a whole saw improved results for the year, and some
enjoyed remarkable growth in profits."
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that the assets of the Exchange Fund rose by 10
percent during the past year. He said much of the increase had
come from windfall gains on the Hong Kong equity portfolio
acquired during the market operation of August 1998. But, he added,
"a windfall of this kind is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
"
</P>
<P>
Yam pointed out that the year saw a number of further reforms
to the Currency Board System aimed at increasing transparency and
further entrenching rule-based, non-discretionary principles.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures to improve the transparency and stability
of the monetary arrangements within Hong Kong were echoed in the
international sphere by the HKMA's strong advocacy of greater
disclosure and better risk management in the global financial
market.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the HKMA initiated a program of supervisory reforms
aimed at supporting the development of Hong Kong's banking sector
into the 21st century. Yam said the process of reform would
continue in 2000 and 2001, with the role of the HKMA being to
facilitate -- but not to direct -- the development of Hong Kong's
banking sector in a rapidly changing, increasingly competitively
local and global environment.
</P>
<P>
Yam noted that preparatory work had been carried out by the
HKMA in the second half of 1999 for the introduction of an
advanced U.S. dollar clearing system in Hong Kong. Expected to be
brought to fruition in 2000, Yam said the major infrastructure
project promised to mark an important stage in Hong Kong's
development as a financial center.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his statement on the 1999 Annual Report, Yam said
that he looked forward to new opportunities on a number of fronts
for Hong Kong's further development as an international financial
center.
</P>
<P>
But, he cautioned, "We should be mindful of the risks and
uncertainties that accompany these opportunities. The main risk is
that, in our enthusiasm for innovation or in our complacency with
things as they are, we cease to see clearly the weaknesses in our
global financial system and fail to take the measures to remedy
them."

<HEADLINE> Australia Optimistic About Chinese Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals from China to
Australia are increasing considerably since Australia signed the
Approved Destination Status Agreement with China one year ago,
said an official with the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC)
today.
</P>
<P>
"In 1999, arrivals from China grew 30 percent and the latest
monthly data indicates a 55 percent increase in arrivals in
February," said John Morse, managing director of ATC, at a media
briefing during the on-going 49th Pacific Asia Travel Association
Annual Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said China's potential for Australia is significant and ATC
is committed to working closely with the Chinese authorities to
ensure the market development at a sustainable and steady rate.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 50 million international travelers forecast to visit
Australia in the next nine years, around 2.5 million will come
from China, injecting around 6.5 billion Australian dollars (3.8
billion U.S. dollars) into the economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Morse said the tourist arrivals from China to Australia is
expected to hit 100,000 this year, and the real growth may exceed
expected levels.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia is set to become the hottest destination on
earth, thanks to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and tourism
industry change.
</P>
<P>
To promote tourism, ATC launched the program, Australia 2000 --
fun and games, which was designed to motivate consumers to travel
to Australia this year.
</P>
<P>
"If we get 2000 right, I believe we will, Australia will have
set itself up for a decade in which tourism will be the driving
force of the Australian economy and will secure our position on
the global stage," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Home to 230,000 Holocaust Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- About 230,000 people who lived
between 1933 and 1945 in Nazi Germany or in countries under the
Nazi rule have found home in Israel, the local daily Ha'aretz
quoted a report by the Central Statistics Bureau as saying on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Holocaust survivors account for more than 30 percent of Israel's
population of adults who are 60 years old or older, and more than
40 percent of those who are 75 years old or older.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the 70-74 age bracket claimed the greatest number of
Holocaust survivors in Israel, constituting more than 30 percent of
camp survivors. Survivors of this group were 18-22 years old when
World War II ended.
</P>
<P>
Natives of Romania are the largest subgroup of survivors in
Israel, followed by natives of the Soviet Union and Poland. People
from these countries account for 78 percent of the total number of
survivors in Israel.
</P>
<P>
About 42 percent of the survivors arrived in Israel during the
mass immigration in the country's first years.
</P>
<P>
A significant minority, 18 percent, arrived here before the
Jewish state was established in 1948. A similar number, 17 percent,
immigrated to Israel much later, particularly during the 1990s, in
the context of huge waves of Jewish immigration from lands of the
former Soviet Union during the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Two-minute Silence for Holocaust Memorial Observed in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- At exactly 10 a.m. local time (7 a.
m. GMT) Tuesday morning, sirens were sounded throughout Israel for
honoring the six million Jewish victims of Holocaust perpetrated by
the Nazi regimes during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The whole nation came to a standstill for two minutes, and
traffic stopped with drivers going out of their cars and standing
in silent tribute.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the sirens, a memorial program named "Unto every
person there is a name" was held in the Knesset (Parliament) and at
the Remembrance Hall of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In the program, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, his cabinet
ministers, chief Jewish Rabbis, Knesset members and representatives
from the general public recited the names of Holocaust victims one
by one.
</P>
<P>
There is a series of commemoration projects throughout the
country to mark the Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day,
which officially began Monday night with an hour-long ceremony at
Yad Vashem's Warsaw Ghetto Square in the presence of Barak and
President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Places of entertainment are closed down from Monday night to
Tuesday night, while sport events were postponed until the end of
the memorial day.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio and television stations also adopted a traditional
programming policy to broadcast documentaries, discussions and
movies about the Holocaust only.
</P>
<P>
During the World War II, the Nazi regimes deliberately carried
out a systematic liquidation of the Jewish community in Europe, in
which some 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children, were
slaughtered.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repatriates over 4,100 Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,158 Afghan refugees were
repatriated recently from Iran under an agreement with the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the UNHCR in Iran's northeastern Khorasan
province, Toshiro Odashima, told the agency that some 3,400 Afghan
refugees who took shelters in the provincial city Mashhad returned
to their homeland over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan refugees returned to their country via the Dowgharoun
border point voluntarily, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 758 Afghan refugees who resided in the central
Isfahan province also returned home as part of a voluntary
repatriation program, head of the provincial bureau for alien and
foreign immigrants affairs Morteza Lotfollah Khajou said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of agreements reached with the UNHCR, Afghan
refugees will return home at the rate of 3,000 per week from all
over the country," he said, adding that some 100,000 Afghan
nationals are to return home in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Iran started the repatriation work on April 13 after reaching an
agreement with the UNHCR. An Iranian Interior Ministry official
said on Monday that 7,700 Afghan refugees left Iran during the past
20 days.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Labor Minister Hossein Kamali complained on Sunday that
some 2 million refugees, nearly 1.5 million of whom them are
Afghans, are working without work permits.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the refugees must leave Iran, giving more
work chances to the Iranian young generation.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always complained about the lack of international
assistance on hosting the refugees.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unveils New Measures to Beef Up Debt Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Tuesday announced new initiatives to further boost
the growth of the Singapore Government Securities (SGS) market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Asian Financial Markets Conference held here,
Second Minister for Finance, Lim Hng Kiang, said MAS will adopt a
three-pronged strategy to strengthen the market-making mechanism
and improve price transparency in the SGS market.
</P>
<P>
MAS' initiatives include measures to boost the repo (Repurchase
Agreement) market, build larger benchmark issue sizes and improve
price transparency.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, SGS held under reverse-repos by a
bank will be allowed to qualify as minimum liquid assets
regardless of the tenure and type of counterparty.
</P>
<P>
Offshore banks will be allowed to engage in SGS repo
transactions with nonbank customers and MAS will introduce an SGS
repo facility that will be available to primary dealers.
</P>
<P>
MAS said it will raise the average benchmark sizes of SGS from
the current typical sizes of about 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (
about 882.35 million U.S. dollars) to at least 2.0 billion
Singapore dollars (about 1.18 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
MAS will cease performing the role of an SGS broker for primary
dealers in order to make the price discovery process more
transparent and efficient.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the above initiatives to grow the SGS market, MAS said
it will continue to look at other areas to broaden and deepen debt
market activities in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that rapid advances in electronic-bond technologies
will offer tremendous leverage for Asian debt markets to augment
their pace of development.
</P>
<P>
He said electronic bond trading system in the U.S. and Europe
will soon find their way to Asia, and it is important for Asian
market participants to anticipate these developments.
</P>
<P>
MAS is looking into how to facilitate the introduction of e-
bond trading in Singapore, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the development of a sound market infrastructure for
e-bond activities, MAS will look into establishing an appropriate
regulatory regime for the setting up of cyber bond exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said MAS is also encouraging financial institutions and
other dot.com entities to establish e-bond technology and cyber
bond trading systems in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Study Payment Gateways Proposal to Facilitate E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic Ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to
study the possibility of developing payment gateways to facilitate
the development of e-commerce in the region, Malaysia's Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has proposed for the study which is to be undertaken
by a Task Force originally set up in Singapore last September to
develop information and communication technology competencies in
ASEAN, the ministry said in a statement on the outcome of the
Sixth ASEAN Economic Ministers Retreat in Yangon, Myanmar Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Economic Ministers mandated the Task Force,
comprising high level representatives from the public and private
sectors of the 10 ASEAN countries, to develop capacity building
program in the ICT (information and communications technology)
area to reduce the gap between new member countries and other
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia fully supports the work plans under the e-ASEAN
initiative, such as those involving the enhancement of
interconnectivity and interoperability through the ASEAN
Information Infrastructure backbone, and other work plans
including the facilitation measures for e-commerce through
regional standards and code of practices; facilitating free flow
of trade in goods, services and investment for ICT sector; Mutual
Recognition Arrangements for telecommunications equipment; and
programs in human resources development in the ICT sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also supported the pilot projects identified,
including the Global School Network, ASEAN SchoolNet and Teachers
Online.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Malaysia suggested that member countries
consider the possibility of further liberalization of the
Information Technology Agreement which included a wider product
coverage and accelerated tariff reduction on Information
Technology products.
</P>
<P>
It said the ASEAN Economic Ministers also agreed to undertake a
further study by the Task Force concerned on the proposed AFTA-CER

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's GDP Expects to Grow by 5.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's gross domestic product (
GDP) was expected to grow by 5.5 percent this year, up from 4.3
percent last year, the Central Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Economic growth rate of 4.3 percent for 1999 was
higher than the developing country average growth rate of 3.3
percent, Central Bank Governor A.S. Jayawardena said in a news
conference held here.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's industrial production and export activities showed
clear signs of recovery during the second half last year.
Inflation declined steadily throughout the year. Consumer price
inflation declined to 4.7 percent in 1999 from 9.4 percent in 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy had shown considerable resilience despite
a staggering defense expenditure, said the governor, adding that
the country is currently shopping for new arms following a spate
of military reversals in the war against Tamil rebels in the north
and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's Inflation last year had declined sharply to 4.7
percent from the previous year's 9.4 percent, signifying a decline
in the prices of essential commodities such as rice, vegetables,
fish and textiles.
</P>
<P>
He said unemployment had also reduced to 8.4 percent from the
previous year's 9.5 percent and the budget deficit had also
declined to 7.5 percent from 9.2 percent recorded in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Private capital inflows has increased to 555 million U.S.
dollars from 296 million dollar in 1998 and the Balance of
Payments had declined by 10 percent despite a 6 percent increase
in export volumes.
</P>
<P>
The rupee rate, however, declined by 6 percent mainly due to a
decline in export earnings and adverse economic conditions in
several other countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Huge Sections of Nigeria Become Seismically Active: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Recent earth tremors recorded in
southwest of Nigeria indicate that the huge sections of the
country are becoming seismically active and they could experience
earthquakes or more violent and destructive natural disasters, an
expert has warned.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Tuesday quoted
renowned geologist Femi Dada as saying that the area "starting
from the country's Ondo State, through most of the south-west
states, looping under the Niger into Kaduna and the other northern
states" is the most earthquake-prone.
</P>
<P>
The other area that could be as active as the south-west axis
is the highlands of Plateau and Benue trough into Southern Borno,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the claim that Nigeria does not fall into the world's
earthquake area could not be geologically proved because the
abundant deposit of oil and bitumen in the country is a pointer to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
The expert suggested a total overhauling of building codes in
areas prone to earthquakes so that the damage of such occurences
could be minimized.
</P>
<P>
Earth tremors, though on a lower and non-destructive scale,
were recorded in some locations of the country, particularly in
Ibadan, Abeokuta, Okuku, Akure and the riverine area of Ondo State
respectively on November 6 last year and March 7 this year.

<HEADLINE> FAO Voices Concern Over Zimbabwean Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe faces an unfavorable
food situation mainly resulting from the on-going land crisis and
economic problems, the United Nation's Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said in a report released here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said the combined effect of adverse weather, serious
economic problems and the current unrest related to land had
adversely affected agricultural activities on large-scale
commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
It said that the invasion by groups of so called independence
war veterans over the past two months of white-owned farms had
resulted in attacks on farm owners and their employees.
</P>
<P>
There is growing concern that if the violence continued, there
would be a serious drop in food production and supply,
jeopardizing national food security, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The invasions resulted in killings, serious injuries being
inflicted on many people, and fields of crops as well as stores
being burnt.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said the recent events had taken place at a time when
the farmers should have been harvesting, processing and marketing
their crops, particularly maize, the country's staple food, and
Zimbabwe's top foreign exchange earner, tobacco.
</P>
<P>
It is also the time for farmers to start preparing for the
planting of the wheat crop in June-July, a crop that is almost
entirely produced by large-scale commercial farmers under
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
While the impact of the disturbances on the food supply
situation may be significant this year, it may be felt more
severely next year, it warned.
</P>
<P>
Floods in late February caused extensive crop damage in the
eastern and southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
A disruption of agricultural activities at this time could have
serious repercussions for Zimbabwe's food security and the economy
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of foreign exchange is also seriously disrupting
industrial production due to erratic power supply and inadequate
supply of raw materials, due to the blocking of credit lines to
the country's firms.
</P>
<P>
Thus, should there be a large drop in food production
necessitating substantial amounts of imports, Zimbabwe's
currently low import capacity would seriously constrain its
ability to cover the shortfall commercially, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Reserves Predicted to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
according to a just-concluded survey of economists.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed economists predicted gross reserves of 49 billion
rand (7. 27 billion U.S. dollars) and the net open foreign
currency position (NOFP) coming in at 10 billion dollars. In
March these stood at 48.5 billion rand (7.19 billion dollars) and
10.3 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Predictions for gross reserves after March ranged between 47
billion rand (6.97 billion dollars) and 50 billion rand (7.41
billion dollars), while those for NOFP ranged between 9.8 billion
dollars and 10.3 billion dollars. The South African Reserve Bank
will release the data on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the rand value of reserves would be boosted by
the weaker rand-dollar exchange rate, but would be hampered by the
outflows of capital from bond and equity markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rand weakness would slow the pace at which the
forward book was being reduced. This could negatively affect
foreign investor sentiment as the NOFP was seen as one of the
South African economy's major structural weaknesses.

Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU in November 1998.
</P>

BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy has bottomed out
and is recovering to a new growth path without any sign of a
possible repetition of the economic crisis, Thai Finance Ministry
affirmed here Tuesday.

<P>
A statement from Thai Finance Ministry said that economic
indicators had shown that the Thai economy had passed its lowest

</P>
<P>
The economic indicators, measuring the development of domestic

there was not any alarming sign of the repetition of the country
worst economic turmoil in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country's public debts were also manageable without any
affect to the economic recovery, though it now accounted for
around 20 percent of the gross domestic product, the statement
stressed.
</P>
<P>
It said that the proportion of the country public debts of 20
percent to the GDP was actually lower than many other countries.

BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate of Thailand
fell to 4.7 percent in February from 5.2 percent of the same month
last year, indicating the country's economic recovery is
continuing,according to the National Statistics Office (NSO) of
Thailand Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
"For the fiscal year 2000 (April-December) the government
targeted an earnings of 6.5 trillion rupiah (930 million U.S.

the government's privatization program.

"We will carry out (the selling) transparently. And we expect
that the program will complete by November or December," Munir
added, citing that the number of shares which will be sold will be
under 51 percent.

<P>
Meanwhile, Nyoman Tjager, a Munir's deputy, told reporters that
the government will issue the procedures on the privatization

<HEADLINE> Two Australians Face Charges for Offenses on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Australians have been charged
over posting false financial information on the Internet and will
appear for mention at the Melbourne Magistrates Court next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, the two,
separately from Victoria and Queensland, face 19 criminal charges
for spreading false information on a United States company called
Rentech Inc. in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Rentech is a technology company involved in the development of
processes that convert gaseous and solid compounds containing
carbon into liquid hydrocarbon. On or around May 8-9, 1999,
messages relating to Rentech stock were posted on Internet web
boards in the U.S. At the same time, about 4 million unsolicited
Internet e-mail messages, colloquially referred to as spam, were
received in the United States, Australia and other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
They alleged on their message that the price of Rentech stock
would increase sharply. As a result, On the first NASDAQ trading
day after the transmission of the spam and the web board postings,
the price of Rentech stock doubled on trading volume more than ten
times the previous month's average.
</P>
<P>
Australia security officials began their investigations after
receiving information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Likely to Begin Selling Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is soon
to begin selling off part of its gold reserves, after a new
currency and payments law came into force Monday, according to
Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The SNB plans to sell some 1,300 tons of gold over the next
five years. Switzerland's decision to formally abandon the gold
standard means that the bank will sell off a maximum of 400 tons
of gold each year until the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The SNB is one of 15 central banks, which set this ceiling last
September in an effort to maintain gold price stability.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as possible, we will start with the sale of part of
our gold reserves that can be used in the future for other public
means," bank president Hans Meyer told the annual shareholders
meeting in Berne last week.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be decided what will happen to the 17 billion
Swiss francs (about 10 billion U.S. dollars) that the sales are
expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has said it wants the income from the sale
of 500 tons of the gold to finance the planned Solidarity
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and sub-divisional finance directors all have
their own ideas on how to spend the money. These include using the
money for the old-age pension scheme, to finance training and to
ease public debt.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak criticized his top
negotiator Oded Eran on Monday for saying the inevitable outcome of
the peace process is a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Barak has never publicly referred to a Palestinian "state",
preferring instead the term "entity".
</P>
<P>
Following Monday's recess for the Holocaust Memorial Day, the
ongoing Israeli-Palestinian talks in the Israeli Red Sea port city
of Eilat are to resume Tuesday evening in the presence of U.S.
special Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. Negotiators on both sides say
they have made no progress on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'arez
</P>
<P>
-- There were fewer anti-Semitic attacks in 1999. 32 involving
firearms were recorded compared to 36 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, by Tel Aviv University in Israel, also notes a shift
away from Moslem extremist attacks toward right-wing extremist
racist violence, especially
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitic incidents around the world decrease slightly in
1999, according to an annual report released for Holocaust Memorial
Day by Tel Aviv University's Anti-Semitism Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The report said the year 1999 witnessed 32 physical attacks
involving firearms that were the result of anti-Semitism. The year
before that saw 36 such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Holocaust survivors talk of an infinite memory reinforced by
time 55 years after the last of the concentration camps were
liberated in the winter of 1945.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Holocaust was not removed form the agenda of
western culture, they say, is because it left behind a terrible and
eternal uncertainty. There are still doubts that genocide could
never happen again.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is a distribution hub of pirated optical media
products, says a report by the United States Trade Secretary. This
has put the country again on the United States' priority watch list
of countries that fail to abide by intellectual property
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Israel was relegated last year from the watch list, issued on an
annual basis. This year's list places Israel alongside with
Ukraine, Malaysia, Korea, Poland, Argentina, Peru, Egypt, India,
Russia, Turkey, and the Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks to Normalize Relations with Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugur Ziyal, Deputy Undersecretary of
Turkish Foreign Ministry, started on Monday a three-day visit to
Libya, which Ankara has severed talks with for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
This move signals that Turkey has taken another step to warm its
relations with countries, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Libya suspended relations in October 1996 after then
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the banned
Islamic Welfare Party, paid a visit to Libya, during which Libya
leader Muammar Gaddafi created a diplomatic scandal with
provocative speeches.
</P>
<P>
Ziyal's visit, the first by a high-level Turkish official since
Erbakan's, could be a real and serious leap forward to revitalizing
the dormant relations with Libya, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Although Ziyal's visit is not aimed at any concrete results, the
sources added, Turkey will decide whether to go ahead and bolster
relations or not in the light of Ziyal's report.
</P>
<P>
"The basic aim of his visit is to determine whether we can
revitalize our relations with Libya, a country we have deep
historical and cultural links with," said one Turkish diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry will make decisions on whether or not
to conduct high-level consultations with Libya on the basis of the
feedback Ziyal will provide.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be to hold a Joint Economic Commission
meeting, which means upgrading relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ziyal is also expected to ask for Libyan
support for Turkish Ambassador Yasar Yakis to act as the new
secretary-general for the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources indicated that Ziyal's visit to Libya may be
evaluated both in terms of Turkey's policy of opening up to the
Africa and its efforts to improve relations with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has made efforts to improve relations with its
neighboring countries including Syria, Iran and Iraq, in order to
develop economic cooperations and trade with these countries as
well as focus on domestic growth on the basis of stable regional
security.

<HEADLINE> Israel Dismisses Iranian Jew's Confession During Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli foreign ministry
dismissed the confession by one of the 13 Jews, who are currently
on trial in Iran, to spying for Israel as "ludicrous", Israel Radio
reported Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the ministry, spokesman Aviv Shiron
said that all attempts to portray the Jewish detainees in Iran as
spies is "cruel and pathetic", according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Israel repeats and stresses that all the detainees are innocent
and deserve to be released immediately," he added.
</P>
<P>
Menashe Amir, head of the Israel Radio's Persian-language
service, said that it is clear that the confession was extracted
from the Jew by force and should no be taken into account by any
fair court.
</P>
<P>
In an interview televised Monday night, Hamid Tefilin, one of
the defendant in the espionage case, confessed to passing "
sensitive information, including military secrets" to Israel's
intelligence agency Mossad since his trip to Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tefilin's mother, two sisters and a brother currently live in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The accused also admitted that he was working in a spy network,
implying that all of the other 12 Jews on trial are guilty of
espionage. He also confessed to drawing a regular salary of 500 U.
S. dollars from Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Tefilin's lawyer argued later that according to Iranian laws,
the confession should not be enough for conviction for spying. Only
when there is concrete evidence that information damaging to Iran
and beneficial to Israel was actually exchanged, can there be a
conviction, said the lawyer Shirzad Rahmani.
</P>
<P>
The confession added dramatic elements to the already
controversial trial, which is proceeding in an Iranian
revolutionary court in Shiraz, a city in the southern Fars province
and the center of Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The Jews were arrested there along with eight Iranian Muslims in
March and April last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that four of the suspects had already
confessed to their crimes at the first court hearing, but the
reports was later denied by the Jews' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries expressed grave concern over the trial and
demanded release of the Iranian Jews after the U.S. and Israel
denied any links between their intelligence services and the
accused.
</P>
<P>
Tehran, however, rejected any "foreign interference" in the
trial.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto's City Arrest Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's Office
(AGO) has extended the status of former president Soeharto's city
arrest for another 40 days as of May 3 to June 11, but possible to
be extended again for another 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The letter of extension was sent by Director of Corruption
Affairs of the AGO Ris Pandapotan Sihombing to Soeharto's
residence on Tuesday and was received by Soeharto's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after receiving the letter, one of
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said: "We regretted about
this extension. Moreover we regretted the decision of the AGO in
imposing the city arrest status on Mr. Soeharto."
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon further said that his side has been considering to
file a lawsuit against the AGO for its decision in imposing the
status.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to believe that the status was imposed in its
bid to prevent Mr. Soeharto of elimination of evidences,"
Tampubolon added, citing that his client is still in a bad healthy
condition "even getting worse and worse from the time to time."
</P>
<P>
The city arrest was imposed after prosecutors failed to
investigate Soeharto, although they had summoned him to appear for
questioning on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
Last week prosecutors seized documents belonging to the
Supersemar Foundation, a charity foundation led by Soeharto, but
delayed the confiscation of his commercial assets.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Hold Consultations With Burundian Armed Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Mandela, international
facilitator for Burundian conflict, will hold consultations with
leaders of armed rebel groups and senior officers in the Burundi
defense forces in South Africa later this month.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was former South African president, will meet
rebel leaders and army officers on May 23 before the next session
of the peace talks to be held in Tanzania's north town of Arusha,
Tuesday's Guardian newspaper quoted Burundian delegates as saying.
</P>
<P>
The date was agreed in Bujumbura, Burundi, last week so that 19
 Burundian delegations taking part in the talks might be briefed
on the position of the rebel groups and the Burundi army, the
delegates said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, a leader
of the splinter group of the National Council for Defense of
Democracy-Forces for Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD), and Kabura
Korsan, a leader of the Parti Pour la Liberation des Peuples
Hutu-Font pour la Liberation Nationale (PALIPEHUTU-FLN), are
expected to represent their rebel groups during the consultations
with Mandela on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Soon after holding consultations with leaders of rebel groups
and senior army officers, Mandela would fix a date for the next
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In his first, whirlwind visit to Burundi last Friday, Mandela
pressed the Tutsi-dominated army and legislators to support a
peace agreement, saying that with their backing an end to the
country's seven-year civil war would be near.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was taking up his role as mediator to help end the
civil war between the army and Hutu rebels that has left more than
200,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the past 22 months in Arusha have worked out
the outlines of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The latest conflict in the tiny central African state goes back
to October 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir
Ndadaye, a Hutu who won Burundi's first democratic elections. His
election caused panic among the Tutsis, who had controlled the
country's army, economy and government since it won independence
from Belgium in 1962.

BERLIN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Goalkeeper Hans-Joerg Butt is
expected to leave SV Hamburg for Bayer Leverkusen, but it depends
on the transfer fee whether he will make the move this summer or
next year, German media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Butt is gone," said the Bild daily. Kicker sports magazine
quoted Leverkusen officials as saying that negotiations were
underway and said the statements indicated "that Bayer have
reached an agreement with the keeper."
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Butt is Germany's number 3 goalkeeper. He
gained fame this season by converting SV Hamburg's nine Bundesliga
penalties and also saving six of the seven spot kicks the team
conceded.
</P>
<P>
However, Kicker said the Bundesliga front runners Leverkusen
were unwilling to pay up to 15 million marks (7.5 million U.S.
Dollars) Hamburg demand for a summer transfer. Butt can leave
Hamburg for free June 30, 2001, when his contract expires.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks OIC Secretary-General Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is stepping up its lobbying
efforts for its candidate to become Secretary-General of the 57-
member Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal, now
on a three-day visit to Libya, is expected to ask for Libyan
support for Turkey's candidate, Ambassador Yasar Yakis, in race for
OIC Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Yakis is reportedly leaving on Tuesday for Kuala Lumpur with a
letter from Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to his Malaysian
counterpart Sied Hamid Albar, explaining Turkey's position on the
OIC contest.
</P>
<P>
Yakis will then visit Iran with a similar message. He will also
tour OIC's African member states to seek their backing.
</P>
<P>
The OIC secretariat-general is a four-year post which rotates
among the three groups of countries within the OIC, namely the
Arab, Asian and African groups. Turkey is in the Asian group.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that under OIC standard practice, since the
outgoing Moroccan secretary-general is not seeking a second term,
it is now the Asian group's turn to assume the post.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was the first from the Asian group to announce its
candidacy for the post, naming its Parliamentary Speaker Humayun
Rasheed Choudhury.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, overwhelmingly Muslim but secular by the constitution,
has also entered the leadership race, appointing senior Ambassador
Yasar Yakis as candidate.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has got strong support from five Central Asian states as
well as Azerbaijan among the Asian group in such a race.
</P>
<P>
But since then, pressure has been exerted on Turkey by some
powerful members of the OIC to withdraw its candidate but Turkey
has made it clear that it is out of the question for it to quit
after receiving the backing of the majority of the Asian group of
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that in the selection of a new OIC secretary-
general, Saudi Arabia is an important factor as it makes a big
financial contribution to the body, which has its headquarters in
the Saudi capital of Jeddah. However, it has so far maintained
quiet, refraining from openly indicating a preference for a certain
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, stressing its determination to win the race, has already
told Bangladesh, its rival, that it will not withdraw its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The new secretary-general will be decided on at a foreign
ministerial meeting of the OIC due to be held on June 28, in the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. The selection will be made
through a process of consensus according to the rule.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Rescue Operation Enters 2nd Phase in Basilan, the Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops are
carrying out the second phase of rescue operations in the southern
island province of Basilan to recover at least 27 civilian
hostages abducted by the Abu Sayyaf, the military said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Southern Command (Southcom) chief Diomedio Villanueva said in a
radio speech that he is also verifying reports that the extremists
may have fled with their hostages to Lamitan, another town in
Basilan.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big possibility they have been able to bring them
out," Villanueva said, adding that it is possible that the
extremists led the hostages out of the bunker "two to three days"
before military troops overran the group's main camp in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
The military began rescue operations in Basilan on April 22 for
27 hostages abducted by the extremist Muslim rebel group of Abu
Sayyaf on March 20. Soldiers overran the Abu Sayyaf's camp on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But as of now, he pointed out, the hostages have not been
sighted, and this is the subject of the second phase of rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
"They started fanning out and different military units are
trying to locate the hostages and hostage takers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a separate radio
interview that the extremist group has been paralyzed in Basilan
following more than a week of military operations there.
</P>
<P>
"About 80 percent of their strength in Basilan has been reduced.
We have neutralized a lot of them," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
According to military reports, 10 soldiers were killed and 56
were wounded in action while at least 50 Abu Sayyaf members have
been killed or wounded.

<HEADLINE> No Specific Demand from Kidnappers: minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- No specific demand has been
received from the armed group which kidnapped 21 people from
Sipadan island off Sabah, East Malaysia, nine days ago, Foreign
Minister Syed Hamid Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"According to the latest report that I have received, there's
no specific demand," he told reporters when asked on the latest
situation relating to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police Norian Mai is
now in the Philippines for talks with his Filipino counterpart to
resolve the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Feedback from Norian would help him decide whether he would
also join in the negotiations to settle the problem, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for us to handle the crisis when it is not in
our territory, the kidnappers and their captives are in foreign
land," Syed Hamid said, adding whatever is being planned to defuse
the situation would require very close cooperation of the
Philippines government.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the authorities would exercise caution and
negotiate a solution to ensure safe release of the captives
including 10 Malaysians and 11 other foreign tourists -- three
Germans, two French nationals, two Finns, two South Africans, a
Lebanese and a Filipino.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Department to Play New Role Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
expects the Department of Finance (DOF) to continue playing a
major role in his administration's ongoing efforts to fight graft
and corruption, Philippine News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying in a speech delivered in the
presidential palace that while he is happy with the DOF's revenue
collection efforts for the first quarter of the year, he will not
tolerate any form of corruption within the ranks of its agencies.
</P>
<P>
Total collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the
Bureau of Customs (BOC) and the Bureau of Treasury (BOT) reached
114.5 billion pesos (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) for the January to
March period, an increase of 4.6 billion pesos (115 million
dollars) over their combined goals for the period.
</P>
<P>
"Continue the fight against graft and anomalies, especially in
the BIR and BOC. Let's erase this unsavory perception by some
sectors because it destroys public trust in the government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada advised officials and employees in the DOF and its
attached agencies not to give in to the temptation of receiving
bribes lest they find themselves his enemy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has also proven that his anti-graft campaign
does not spare his friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
"We will charge all corrupt officials, big and small, but
especially the big ones. I repeat, to those thinking of committing
anomalies in the BIR or BOC or any government agency, not to push
through with their corrupt practices. My campaign will not spare
my relatives or friends," he added.

<HEADLINE> Seven Kenyans Killed in Tribal Clash: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven people including four ethnic
Somalis and three policemen have been killed in a cattle rustling
occurring over the past three days in northern Kenya, police said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 armed Borana and Samburu tribesmen attacked a Somali
settlement in Eastern Province on Sunday, killing camels and
stealing 2,000 cattle and 500 goats, said a police spokesman here
at the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Security officers who raced to the scene on Monday were
overpowered by the raiders and after they fled from the
battlefield, they realized three of their colleagues were
missing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies were found late on Monday when the police were
continuing their pursuit of the raiders.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, only seven people were killed
because those are the only bodies counted by our officers on the
ground by 1:00 p.m. Monday," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Television Network Monday night reported that over 70
people had been killed in the clash, while Tuesday's Daily Nation
newspaper quoted a witness who escaped the fighting as saying that
he counted 40 bodies on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the law on land ownership, Trust Land
Act, drafted in the colonial era, has become archaic and poses a
time-bomb for any land dispute.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Kenya to Resume Aid Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A mission of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) will arrive in Kenya's capital Nairobi on
Thursday to resume aid talks with the Kenyan government, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
High on agenda will be discussions on the amended version of
Kenya's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the policy document
which lists the conditions that lenders want Kenya to meet.
</P>
<P>
The strategy paper has to be approved by the IMF board before
Kenya can access the organization's new Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility, the successor of the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the Structural Adjustment Facility with a sum
of 205 million U.S. dollars to Kenya in July 1997 for reasons of
its poor governance and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF is not expected to make any commitment on a
new program for Kenya at this stage, the report said, adding that
the approval of the policy document will initially allow the
Kenyan government to access some 100 million U.S. dollars in aid
from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The talks to start this week will surely help normalize the
relations between Kenya and donors.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Raise Minimum Wage by 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has promised a
6 percent increase in the minimum wage for workers this year, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu announced the decision here on
Monday at the Labor Day celebrations, but some disappointed
workers walked out of the gathering venue immediately.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this year's increase, one percentage point
lower than that for 1999, will translate to an additional 140
shillings (about two U.S. dollars) per month for every worker.
</P>
<P>
Hirji Shah, chairman of the Federation of Kenya Employers, said
the raise was "a fair return" since it did not include the
collective bargain agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan economy has been in the doldrums since 1997 when the
 International Monetary Fund suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar
loan to the east African country for reasons of its poor
governance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of Kenyan households now still live below
poverty line, according to Kenya's Central Organization of Trade
Unions.

CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Three soccer players have been
banned from playing for Samoa for an indefinite period after being
caught smoking marijuana while in camp, the Samoa Observer

"I have three rules while they are in camp; no smoking, no
women and in bed by the curfew, but drugs is the biggest no, no,
and I will not stand for that," coach Victor Fernandez said.
</P>

The punishment dished out by the Samoa Football Soccer
Federation was recommended by Fernandez. However, they did not

<P>
"I had no choice. If I let these guys off this would set a bad

But the newspaper says the senior of the three players is
considered one of the best in the country and was in the last
national team to the Polynesian Cup in 1998. Two players were in
the Olympic under-23 team that competed in the Oceania Olympic
Qualifying Tournament in Auckland, New Zealand last year.

BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A 29-year-old Thai man bounced a

Sam-ang Suwansri, pulled off the 15-hour stunt Monday at

performing traditional Thai dances and playing the kaen -- a Thai
flute instrument, and even eating noodles while he kept the ball
bouncing.
</P>
<P>
When nature called the Thai had to place the ball on his head
and use an improvised waist-high toilet that allowed judges to
monitor him. The rules were that he could use any part of his body
except his arms and hands to keep the ball off the ground.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Banks Perform Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- After a year of record
profitability in 1999, New Zealand registered banks can expect to
continue their strong performance during 2000, Chairman of KPMG's
Banking and Finance Group Andrew Dinsdale said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
KPMG is a famous New Zealand accountancy firm.
</P>
<P>
Dinsdale made the remarks when launching KPMG's 14th annual
Financial Institutions Performance Survey which reports and
comments on the performance of banks, finance companies and other
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance of financial institutions reflects the
fact that the New Zealand economy boomed over the second half of
last year, he said, expecting the economic recovery of New Zealand
to continue over the next 12 months, driven by improved export
growth.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, there is every prospect of further asset growth
for New Zealand financial institutions during 2000," Dinsdale said.
</P>
<P>
According to KPMG's annual survey, New Zealand registered banks
achieved a 10 percent improvement in underlying performance to 2.
24 billion NZ dollars (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, compared
with 2.03 billion NZ dollars (995 million U.S. dollars) in 1998
and 1.68 billion NZ dollars (823 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Total assets of New Zealand registered banks increased 8
percent to 150 billion NZ dollars (73.5 billion U.S. dollars) in
1999 from 139 billion NZ dollars (68.1 billion U.S. dollars) in
1998.

WELLINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Figures showing that more people
left New Zealand last year than came here to live have prompted
New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton to call for a

<P>
Statistics New Zealand released its population figures last

</P>

The government statistical body said the population increase of

average annual growth rate for the previous five years, as
permanent and long-term departures exceeded arrivals by 9,000.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand deputy prime minister called the country's
immigration policy "confused and inconsistent," saying that there
is "no clear population plan," when he was asked to comment on the
figures by local reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anderton said an immigration policy can be devised on obtaining
a preferential population for the country after a nationwide
debate is held on the size of the population that New Zealanders
think will be best.

<HEADLINE> Welshman Williams Wins World Snooker Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, England, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mark Williams became the
first Welshman to win the world snooker championship for 21 years
on Monday when he staged a brilliant recovery to beat compatriot
Matthew Stevens 18-16 in the final.
</P>
<P>
The left-hander trailed 10-6 overnight and saw Stevens extend
his lead to six frames in the 18th frame. Williams finally replied
with a break of 106, but he lost the next frame by a point after
finding himself out of position on the pink.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who came back from 15-11 down to beat John Higgins in
the semifinals, took the last four frames of the afternoon to cut
Stevens' advantage to 13-11 and set up a close final session. A
missed blue from Stevens in the opening frame of the final let in
Williams for a frame-winning break of 77.
</P>
<P>
Stevens went 14-12 up with a 67 break, but Williams won the
next two frames to be level at 14-14 at the interval. In the 29th
frame, Williams missed an easy red and Stevens went on to produce
a 120 clearance.
</P>
<P>
After going all-square again, Stevens looked poised to regain
the advantage. But with a lead of 66-32 in the 31st frame, he
missed a relatively easy red, allowing Williams in to snatch the
frame 70-66 with a 38 clearance.
</P>
<P>
Stevens drew level once more, winning a scrappy 32nd frame, but
Williams claimed the last two frames to seal his first world crown.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Steps Up Afforestation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 2 (Xinhua) --East China's Jiangsu Province will
continue its efforts to increase the area of vegetation coverage
to improve its environment and ecology, a local afforestation
official said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the province's afforestation efforts, the vegetation
coverage area in Jiangsu has steadily increased over the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
To date, Jiangsu has completed seven million mu (467,000
hectares) of afforestation, a 1.5-million-mu (100.000 hectares) of
coastal forest shelter, and 800-km long green corridors along the
province's highways.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has mobilized volunteers to
plant 2.2 billion trees.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu will focus on key afforestation projects in the next
five years. These projects will play a major role in helping the
province improve its eco-system and reduce logging and curb soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2005, the province will have increased its
vegetation coverage rate to 12 percent by adding 66,000 hectares
of vegetation coverage and turning 770,000 mu (55,000 hectares) of
farmland into afforested area and grassland.

<HEADLINE> Internet Development Hottest Tech Job Category in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Internet-intranet development
has replaced networking as the technology job category most in
demand in the United States, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three percent of chief information officers (CIOs) of U.
S. companies surveyed listed this skill as the leading growth area
with their information technology (IT) departments. Networking was
identified as the second most sought-after specialty, receiving 21
percent of the response.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,400 CIOs nationwide was made by RHI
Consulting, a leading U.S. specialized consulting services firm.
</P>
<P>
In a previous survey in August 1999, networking was listed as
the hottest technology job category in the United States. The
seven specialty areas experiencing the strongest growth in the U.S.
corporate IT departments, as ranked by CIOs, are Internet/intranet
development, networking, help desk/end-user support, applications
development, operations, project management, and system analysis.
</P>
<P>
"As more companies web-enable business systems, Internet
specialists will remain in strong demand," the report said. "In
addition, the growth of consumer and business-to-business
electronic commerce is creating a need for experienced
professionals with both solid technical skills and business acumen.
" The job titles most requested within this category include
webmaster, web developer and e-business strategist.
</P>
<P>
Networking, the number two ranked specialty, will remain
critical within most IT departments, the report said. In
particular, systems engineers and network architects who
specialize in security and bandwidth issues are highly marketable.
</P>
<P>
Within the technical support category, CIOs report the greatest
demand for help desk analysts and managers.

<HEADLINE> Americans Consume More Chicken Than Any Other Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chicken is the most popular food
at the center of Americans' dinner table and the boom in chicken
consumption in the United States in recent years still has room to
grow, according to a research released Monday by a U.S. trade
group.
</P>
<P>
At 81 pounds, chicken enjoys the highest per-capita consumption
of any of the major meats in the United States, said the National
Chicken Council, reporting results of a new survey of more than 1,
000 American consumers.
</P>
<P>
Beef is in second place at 69 pounds per person on a retail
weight basis. Pork is in third place with 52 pounds, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 89 percent of the respondents ate chicken
at least once a week. Some 36 percent of the respondents consumed
chicken three times per week or more. A net of seven percent of
consumers indicated they planned to eat even more chicken
purchased at supermarkets and food stores in the next 12 months,
thus setting the stage for further growth in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Chicken Council, chicken is popular
partly because it is convenient to purchase and prepare. "The
simple fact is that chicken fits, better than any other meat, the
hectic, harried, time-crunched lifestyle that so many people lead
today," the trade group said.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Rebels Escape Military Cordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was confirmed by Southcom Deputy chief of staff Col.
Ernesto Guzman late Monday afternoon, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation came after the military has finally conquered
the main lair of the Ab Sayyaf guerrillas where they were said to
be holding 27 civilian hostages who are mostly school children.
</P>
<P>
It was not sure whether the Abu Sayyaf have already brought
their hostages to Sulu to join the group of Commander Robot, the
PNA report noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, civilians from nearby town of Lamitan,
Basilan Monday informed local military officials that they have
seen several armed rebels bringing along with them their hostages.
</P>
<P>
Government soldiers who engaged the Abu Sayyaf rebels in a
fierce fire fight for eight days did not fid anyone in their main
camp after it fell to government hands around 5:00 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local military officials said the kidnappers could be
hiding from among the tunnels they found inside Camp Abdurajack.
They had planned to flush out the rebels from the said tunnels
with the use of tear gas, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, combined elements of the government forces
now in the area have been directed to pursue the enemies in any
part of the province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Abu Sabaya, spokesman of the extremist Muslim group
was reported as saying that the might opt to bring their hostages
to Sulu and join the 21 foreign captives now in the hands of the
other Abu Sayyaf leaders.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, a group of Abu Sayyaf members abducted 21 tourists
and staff members from a diving resort in Sipadan, Malaysia and
moved to Jolo Island in the southern Philippine Province of Sulu.

MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National
Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is planning to grant
nationwide telecommunications franchises as an incentive for
telecommunications companies who will merge, Philippine News
Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NTC commissioner Joseph Santiago was quoted as saying that the
nationwide franchise was one of the options being considered to
encourage mergers now that the bulk of the required lines under
the service area scheme have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
"We are targeting the smaller companies especially those that
were not able to comply with their requirements under the service
area scheme," Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
These included Philippine Global Communications, Inc,
Philippine Telegraph and Telephone co. (PT&AMP;T) and Pilipino
Telephone Company(Piltel).
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the proposed incentives were still on
the drawing board and would still be further studied by the

<P>
BERLIN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 neo-Nazis gathered Monday
in Berlin and other German cities, amid protests from the leftists,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Berlin, about 750 neo-Nazis held a rally and chanted
xenophobic slogans such as "Offer jobs to Germans first -- Germany
belongs to us Germans."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leftists, whose Berlin counter-demonstration had
been banned, paraded in the name of May Day celebrations to
protest against the neo-Nazi rally.
</P>
<P>
Berlin police enforced a close monitoring on the rallies and
the parade to avert street clashes. May Day has regularly seen
rioting between neo-Nazis and leftists in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The court had lifted a police ban on neo-Nazi rallies, although
restricted it to only one place, but banned left-wing counter-
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern cities of Dresden, Grimma and western cities of
Fuerth and Ludwigshafen, neo-Nazis held similar gatherings.
</P>
<P>
However, in the eastern cities of Weimar and Jena, May Day
rallies planned by radical rightists were banned by the court on
the ground that they would pose a threat to public order.

<HEADLINE> Poll Indicates Victory for Fujimori in Peruvian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Peru's presidential candidate Alberto
Fujimori would win the general elections with a 43.8 percent of
votes, according to an inquiry released Monday by Peruvian Company
of Investigation (CPI).
</P>
<P>
The CPI poll shows that Fujimori, who heads Peru 2000 alliance,
would overwhelm his rival Alejandro Toledo, who would only obtain
37 percent of the votes, at the second round of elections on May
28.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 2.5 percent of those interviewed said they would
vote with a blank or nullify their vote, while 16.7 percent
answered they'd have no preference for any of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
The result also shows Fujimori's support would mainly come from
lower and very low sectors, where he would collect 47.6 percent of
votes against Possible Peru's candidate Toledo's 33.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But he may only bag 26.4 percent of the ballot in the middle
and high levels, where Toledo has great acceptance and would net
52.2 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
The CPI poll indicates that Fujimori would get the support of
50 percent of females, while 42.9 percent of the males are
inclined for Toledo.
</P>
<P>
If only valid voting were taken into account, Fujimori, who is
running for his third reelection, would achieve 54.23 percent of
votes versus Toledo's 45.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CPI highlighted that 83.3 percent of people polled
expressed they had already decided their voting, and 16.7 percent
said they hadn't yet.

<HEADLINE> Doping Reports Worried Indonesian Sports Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Reports of Indonesian athletes
involved in illegal drug use have worried the National Sports
Council (KONI), and KONI will conduct urine tests prior to the
Olympics in September to confirm that their athletes are clean.
</P>
<P>
KONI Secretary General Rudolf Warouw said that the urine tests
were scheduled to take place before the centralized training
program began in March.
</P>
<P>
"I will check with the training executive director (Arie Sudewo)
on the schedule," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Warouw was responding to reports claiming that some soccer and
badminton players were allegedly taking illegal drugs, like PSM
striker (a soccer club in Makassar, South Sulawesi) Kuncoro.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked both the Soccer Association of Indonesia and the
Badminton Association of Indonesia to give us written reports on
the matter, but KONI has yet to receive them," Warouw added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Mahadi
Sinambela and the Indonesian Archery Association Chairman Hayono
Isman suspect that drug dealers are not only looking for profit
but are trying to undermine the nation's morale.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed with our soccer players using illegal
drugs. It is quite possible that some athletes want instant
results," Mahadi said.
</P>
<P>
Hayono said: "The government must get involved in the situation.
The athletes' who take illegal drugs illustrate how fragile
society is when it comes to deterring young people from taking
narcotics. Sports are synonymous with the ongoing development of
the nation's athletes, and needs support from the government. I
suspect a camouflage movement to discredit the government."
</P>
<P>
Boxer Hermensen Ballo, who is preparing to go to the Olympics,
claimed he was offered shabu-shabu (crystal methamphetamine)
gratis by persons staying at the Graha Wisata Motel in South
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why exactly the drugs were offered to me. But the
person said he would give them to me for nothing. But I turned him
away. I said 'I haven't gone insane. You better get out of here
before I get angry'," he added.

<HEADLINE> Polgar Unsure of Pro Career After Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Top women chess player Judit Polgar
of Hungary earned her Grand Master (GM) title in 1991 at age 14,
making her the youngest chess grand master in history.
</P>
<P>
Now, love came calling and soon she might have to consider her
future career as professional chess player.
</P>
<P>
The choice must be the toughest one for any woman chess player.
There have been seven women world chess champions but several of
them never married. Except for one, the others never gave birth
while they were world champion.
</P>
<P>
The exception was Judit's eldest sister Szuzsa Polgar. Szuzsa,
30, gave birth to a baby boy named Tom, at Beth Israel Hospital in
New York City in March, 1999, while she still held the world
champion title.
</P>
<P>
She lost her title to Grand Master Xie Jun of China three
months later. Judit's second sister Sofia, an International Master,
is married to grand master Yona Kosashvili, a Georgian.
</P>
<P>
"It's OK for women chess players to get married. But problems
arise when they have children, because they will have a lot of
responsibilities. It depends on whether you want to educate your
own child. But I guess I will want to spend a lot of time with my
kids," Judit told the Jakarta Post after competing in the eighth
round of the JAPFA Classic International Tournament 2000 in Bali,
Indonesia, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Judit recalls that her sister had to change her focus from
competing to raising her child.
</P>
<P>
"My sister has little opportunity to compete. It would be hard
for her to be concentrating in one place if her mind is in another
place," she said.
</P>
<P>
Judit, who is now the world's number 30 with an elo rating of 2,
658, said that she still wishes to be the women's world champion.
</P>
<P>
"But the main problem is that FIDE has no fixed competition
schedule," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Judit used to be accompanied by her parents when touring around
the world tournaments. But since 1998, she travels with her 30-
year-old boyfriend Dr. Gusztav Font. Judit's parents have
reportedly moved to Israel while she remains in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
When she was asked to name the date she will get married, she
said: "I don't know yet."
</P>
<P>
Judit plans to dedicate her life and ability to the development
of chess, even long after she quits playing the game.
</P>
<P>
"I will always want to do something in chess or around chess
even when I'm not going to compete anymore, like giving lectures,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Sees Results in Anti-Poaching Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's Yunnan
Province have seen positive results in the first days of their 15-
day campaign to protect rare wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Just a few days into the drive to crack down on the rampant
illegal marketing of endangered animals, police have already
uncovered 1,760 cases of poaching, smashed 6,000 illegal wildlife
markets, rescued more than 16,000 wild animals which have been
later released into forests, and seized 8,740 kg of animal
products and 1,300 furs.
</P>
<P>
The second "Operation South" was carried out by the provinces
of Guangdong, Fujian and Yunnan, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, areas known for their lush vegetation and abundant
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, known as the country's "animal and plant kingdom,"
lists 50 percent of its wild animals under state protection. It is
one of the world's richest areas of diverse animal and plant life.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-based multinational Honeywell
Corp. has indicated it will push the U.S. Congress to approve
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China and back China'

<HEADLINE> Private Companies Need Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital might give vital
support to China's private enterprises, which have been long
troubled with fund-raising difficulties, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has 92 venture capital companies with total funds of
four billion yuan (481 million U.S. dollars), said Di Weiping,
head of the Investment Banking Advisory Group at the China
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
But less than one billion yuan of the money has been invested
in the sort of young, private business that typically receive
venture capital in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Fan, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong-based
CVC Asia Pacific Ltd., called it "very challenging" to find smart
investment for venture capital in China. But he said there are
plenty of candidates.
</P>
<P>
About 28 percent of the direct foreign investment in China
last year went to private business.

<HEADLINE> Enthusiastic Response for T-bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the capital city
started buying some of the 60 billion yuan worth of treasury bonds
issued across China on Monday with apparent enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
"We are almost short of hands," said Zhang Lin, staff of the
Beixin'an savings house under the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's savings house issued 11 million yuan worth of the T-
bonds. "The tax-free T-bond with relatively higher interest are
extraordinarily attractive to wage earners and pensioners who have
limited channels to invest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The income tax law, which was amended last year, allows the
government to tax bank deposits interest. China imposed a 20
percent tax on proceeds from bank savings last November. However,
the interest on T-bonds is exempt from income tax.
</P>
<P>
The 60 billion yuan worth of T-bonds includes 12 billion yuan
in two-year term carrying an annual interest rate of 2.55 percent,
30 billion yuan in three-year term with an interest rate of 2.89
percent and 18 billion yuan in five-year term with an interest
rate of 3.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the interest rates run at 2.43, 2.7 and 2.88
percent for bank deposits of two, three and five years,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, China issued 50 billion yuan worth of T-bonds to
private investors. More than 45 billion yuan, or 90 percent of the
total, were sold within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of the T-bonds have to use their real names to comply
with the real name system China introduced in bank savings on
April 1 this year, a step aimed to promote the development of the
country's banking industry and eradicate corruption.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 60 billion yuan proceeds from the bond issues will
be incorporated into the central government budget while the rest
will go to local governments, sources from the National People's
Congress said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Endeavors for Fishery Development By Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, with half of its boundary as
coastline stretching as long as 2,276 kilometers and its extensive
river systems, is rich in both marine and fresh water fish
resources which play a very important role in its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The country's fishery sector is the third largest contributor
to its gross domestic product (GDP) after agriculture and forestry,
sharing 7.3 percent of the GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's rivers flow crisscross and fresh water fish, caught
in rivers, amount to 150,000 tons annually, while the output of
fish and prawn from breeding ponds, which cover 40,680 hectares,
goes to 90,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's average annual production of fish and prawn tops
910,000 tons, of which over 240,000 tons are fresh water fish and
prawn, and 670,000 tons are deep sea fish and prawn.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar annually exports 58,900 tons of fish and prawn, of
which fish accounts for 45,700 tons, while prawn represents 13,200
tons.
</P>
<P>
Export earning from them totals about 150 million U.S. dollars
annually with the sector standing as the third largest foreign
exchange earner after agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's annual per capita fish and prawn consumption is 18
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
To expand its sea fish and prawn market, Myanmar has planned to
build a new, modern and international-level fish wholesale center
in the coastal Myeik.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is boosting its fish and prawn production by
allowing joint venture operation between the government and
private and foreign entrepreneurs. So far, Myanmar has reportedly
formed five joint ventures with foreign companies including those
from Bangladesh, China, Germany, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted the open-door economic policy in late
1988,foreign investment injected into the fishery sector has
reached 197 million dollars in 11 projects.
</P>
<P>
In the field of regional cooperation in fishery, Myanmar formed
the Aquaculture Fisheries Federation (AFF) at national level in
December 1998 which later became a member of the AFF of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, working in cooperation
with other member nations in conservation of fishery resources and
exchange of information on the sector and seeking of more markets
for marine products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also cooperates with countries in Southeast and East
Asia in integrated coastal zone management in the region and
sustainable development of coastal and marine areas and their
resources at both local and national levels.
</P>
<P>
In conformity with the provisions contained in U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea and regarding the sharing of the surplus
fishery resources to neighboring states, Myanmar's Department of
Fishery has since 1990 started granting fishing rights and
initiated some joint fishery development programs.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Head-on Train Crash in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- At least four passengers were killed
and 37 others injured when a speeding train collided head-on with
another train in West Java, Indonesia, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The collision of the two diesel-powered trains occurred on a
single line track between Sudimara and Serpong stations, about 35
kilometers southwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
National newspapers Tuesday quoted officials from state railway
company PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) as saying that the accident
was still under investigation by police.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications Agum Gumelar said there's "suspicion
" that the accident was caused by sabotage.
</P>
<P>
He said an investigation headed by a team from his ministry was
now under way, and that sabotage could not be ruled out as a cause
of the collision.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that the accident was the result of
an act of sabotage," Agum was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But other officials, including Director General of Land
Transportation Santo Budiono and spokesman for KAI's greater
Jakarta area Zainal Abidin, concluded that the collision between
the two trains was mainly caused by mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
"The train signals used by dispatchers to inform drivers to
stop were damaged and stolen. The central traffic control system
at the railway firm's office in Manggarai, South Jakarta, which
usually takes over the work automatically was also broken," Santo
was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Monday's accident was the third in the past two weeks. The two
other train accidents occurred in Karawang, West Java, killing
four people, and in Manggarai in South Jakarta, injuring 24
persons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian AGO Extends Soeharto's City Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A team will go to Soeharto's resident Tuesday to hand him the
notification of the city arrest extension. If Soeharto is healthy,
he will be directly investigated. But if he is sick, we will ask
for a comprehensive (medical) check-up," Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was placed under city arrest for 20 days on April 13
and prohibited from leaving the country for a year. The ban will
expire on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was questioned twice last month, but both times
questioning was cut short after doctors insisted Soeharto was too
ill to continue.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old former ruler is suspected of abusing his power
and authority in issuing decrees and government regulations to
amass funds through seven tax-free charity foundations, which he
set up and chaired during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Following the restrictions placed on the former president, the
AGO summoned executives of the foundations, including two of
Soeharto's children. The office also confiscated documents
relating to the Supersemar Foundation and Dharmais Foundation as
evidence in the case.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Force Creates "Independent Judicial System" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's biggest guerrilla group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), announced
Monday the creation of an "independent judicial system" in
territories under their control.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Monday in Italian daily "Corriere
della Sera," the FARC's leader Manuel Marulanda said that at the
130 localities in the hands of the rebel forces tribunals were
installed for military affairs and a judicial apparatus
independent of the government was put into place.
</P>
<P>
It is also to set up a tax system that will be directed against
the rich, said Marulanda, whose true name is Antonio.
</P>
<P>
He noted the FARC will charge a tax of 10 percent over people
who own property worth one million U.S. dollars, while other
persons can make contributions of a voluntary amount. He
explained that "tariffs won't be imposed on those who have nothing
but it's evident that drug traffickers, coke dealers, and big land
owners will be treated according to our own fiscal system."
</P>
<P>
On the 18-month peace negotiations with the government,
Marulanda described the move as "a very, very important step."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader expected a possible military intervention by
the United States against the guerrillas under the pretext of
combating drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government and the guerrillas have sought to end
the decade-long civil war that has claimed thousands of lives, by
launching peace talks, but it seems the peace process has slid
into stagnancy.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday the FARC launched a political movement named
after 19th-century independence hero Somon Bolivas as Bolivarian
Movement, aiming at establishing a new Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Accelerates Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region is to invest 4.7 billion yuan (566 million U.S.
dollars) this year to build 16 key infrastructure facilities, 700
million yuan (84 million dollars) more than last year.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the local government's effort to improve
investment environment in response to the State's policy of
developing China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
Half of the investment will go to highways, water-control
facilities and urban construction sectors, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
This year, Ningxia will spend 2.6 billion yuan (31 million
dollars) on five key highway projects, including two expressways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government will also speed up the
construction of telecommunications. At present, an average of 100
people own eight telephones in Ningxia, exceeding the national
average.

<HEADLINE> Massive Fund for Green Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's forestry authorities will
pour a record 220 million yuan into a massive afforestation plan
aimed at turning the country's barren and arid western regions
into green areas.
</P>
<P>
"The funds granted for the plan will be used during the 2000-
2010 period, with priority given to new scientific methods in
afforestation," today's China Daily quoted Zhu Lieke, director of
the department of science and technology of the State Forestry
Administration (SFA), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made it clear that in the coming years investment in
afforestation technology will increase along with the growth of
afforestation funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he was confident that the plan featuring scientific
design, construction and management will increase the survival
rate of trees and grasses in the western region by at least 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of only keeping 45 to 75 percent of the planted trees
and grasses alive in western China as in previous years, more than
85 percent of the forest products are expected to be preserved by
adopting the package plan that encompasses scientific know-how and
practical afforesting techniques," he said.
</P>
<P>
New technologies will be applied to more than 50 percent of the
western forested areas, bringing more than 95 percent of the trees
and grass up to state standards.
</P>
<P>
During a pilot effort in western China this year, the state is
expected to plant trees on 343,300 hectares in 174 counties of 13
provinces along the upstream Yangtze River and the upper and
middle reaches of the Yellow River. The hope is to also enlist
millions of villagers to plant an additional 780,720 hectares of
vegetation and grassland.
</P>
<P>
However, harsh conditions make it difficult for trees and grass
to survive, experts said.
</P>
<P>
To boost the government-launched drive to green this mostly
arid western regions, SFA mapped out a plan to employ 187 new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the new technologies Zhu outlined include: selection of
drought-resistant trees; cultivation of good seedlings; water
containment in the soil; aerial afforestation and weather
modification, particularly, artificial rainfall; the use of flora-
accelerators; the control of insects; the control of forest fires;
and the projection and management of natural forests.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Sacked Olsen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Egil Olsen's troubled reign as
Wimbledon manager has come to an end, with Terry Burton appointed
caretaker manager until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
But the permanent job could go to a Dons cult hero, after
former frontman John Fashanu announced he was keen to take over.
</P>
<P>
The news of Olsen's removal came as no surprise, after the club
were defeated 3-0 at Bradford on Sunday - a loss that saw them
slip into the relegation zone with just two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
Olsen enjoyed great success with Norway's national side, but he
failed to see eye to eye with a number of players and his tactics
were also subject of increasing criticism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media conference on Monday, Wimbledon chairman
Bjorn Gjelsten said the priority must be to avoid relegation.
</P>
<P>
"Egil was hired for the right reasons, his results historically
speak for themselves - he took Norway into the world's top 10.
Egil has behaved very honestly and he's been hard working and
always did what he felt was best for Wimbledon Football Club," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"After the Bradford game we had a long talk and the decision
was made that a change is needed. Terry Burton is appointed as
manager with immediate effect," he added.
</P>
<P>
Burton will take charge for the remaining two games of the
season, but he admitted he would like to secure the post full-time.
</P>
<P>
However, Burton is likely to face stiff competition for the job.
</P>
<P>
Former Wimbledon striker John Fashanu was the first high-
profile to throw his hat into the ring.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided I am going to go for it," Fashanu said.
</P>
<P>
"If you cut me open I would read Wimbledon through and through.
I care passionately for the club - so passionately that I am going
to do something I have never considered before," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to put in an application for the manager's job -
and that is because I believe there are people out there who will
give me their support," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Goals from Carmaine Walker and Gemma
Hunt proved enough to secure Croydon the Women's FA Cup trophy
against six-times winners Doncaster Belles at Bramall Lane on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten National League leaders Croydon went ahead against the
run of play in the 23rd minute when Walker headed home her 24th
goal of the season from Emily Arnold's neat right-wing cross.
</P>
<P>
It was the south London team's only genuine chance of a first-
half in which they were out-played by the Belles.
</P>
<P>
Doncaster, who missed a string of early openings, drew level
through a header by Vicky Exley following Karen Walker's 37th
minute cross.
</P>
<P>
And the Belles should have gone ahead from the penalty spot
after the break, only for England goalkeeper Pauline Cope - who
gave away the spot-kick - to save from Karen Walker.
</P>
<P>
England Under-18 star Hunt then looped in the winner via a post
midway through the second half as Croydon lifted the trophy for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
A point against Aston Villa next week will secure Croydon the
league and cup double.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Drops Japan Hint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has pledged to stay at the club
until at least June 2002 but also dropped a massive hint that he
could still be on his way back to Japan in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, who has been openly head-hunted by the Japanese
Football Association -- co-host of the 2002 World Cup finals with
South Korea, admitted: "I love the country and especially the
people.
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed my two years there as a club manager and I
have already had offers to take over the national team, but I'm
not ready yet. At the moment my way is clear. I'm here (at Arsenal)
until 2002 and that's it. After that I don't know, but I've signed
a contract at this club and I respect it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are two years to go on it and in football even one week
is a long time to look ahead. In fact, I worry I might sound
disloyal even to speak about it at all.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm always in touch with Japan because I kept a strong
link. I loved it there and I love life in England, especially
with Arsenal, but you can find some qualities in Japan which you
maybe have missed in England.
</P>
<P>
"There is 100% dedication, a respect by people for one another
and a strong feeling of security.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I have no great feeling for being an
international manager but maybe at some stage later on it will
have an appeal for me," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wenger, 50, insists he is currently completely focused on
Arsenal, excited by the prospect of a new stadium for the club in
2003 and the opportunity to match the massive financial resources
of champions Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The Highbury boss is idolized by the fans after winning the
Premiership and FA Cup in his first full season and lifting an-
already successful if traditionally-prosaic team to new heights
with a new brand of stylish, continental football.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Journalists Vows to Protect Press Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Association of Journalists on
Tuesday vowed to protect the freedom of press, which is "best
defined and guaranteed" in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a communique marking the World Press Freedom Day, the
association said it will do its best to protect the freedom of
press, professional independence and job security of journalists as
defined by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
It added that it would make efforts to improve the environment
for free press based on the laws of the state, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The association expressed regret over the banning of 17
reformist publications by the conservative judiciary last week,
which was considered as part of the stepped-up effort of the
powerful conservatives to curb the country's reformist campaign.
</P>
<P>
The conservative move of banning 13 dailies and 4 periodicals
within a week left the reformist camp without a voice for the
second round of the parliamentary elections on May 5.
</P>
<P>
About 225 seats were decided in the first round of the sixth
parliamentary election on February 18, with reformers allied to
President Mohammed Khatami bagging more than 75 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis (parliament) has a total of 290 seats. As
stipulated by the election law, those candidates who did not get
the minimum 25 percent of votes went to the second round.
</P>
<P>
The freedom-seeking press played an important role in the
reformists' overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary
elections, which humiliated the powerful conservatives, who still
dominate most of the sensitive state organs including the judiciary
and the armed forces.

RIYADH, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on
Tuesday held talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah mainly on the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also discussed the bilateral
ties and the Islamic and international issues of common concern,
the Saudi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Defense and Aviation Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz discuss with Arafat in
Jiddah the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in Jiddah Tuesday morning, briefed the
minister on the results of the talks and the obstacles set by
Israel to evade the implementation of the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of evading its commitment to freezing the
Jewish settlement expansion activities, the Saudi daily Okazh
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government tender to build new housing units in the
Jewish West Bank settlement of Maaleh Adumim shows Israel's lack of
sincerity and seriousness, the daily quoted Arafat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministry of Housing announced on Sunday the tender
to build 174 units in the largest Jewish settlement in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to declare Palestinian statehood on September
13, thereby we need to intensify our consultations with the Saudi
brothers," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's entourage includes Secretary General of the Executive
Committee of Palestine Liberation Organization Mahmoud Abbas,
Speaker of the Legislative Council Ahmed Qurei and Minister of
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Arafat concluded his one-day visit to Saudi Arabia after the
talks.

<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Tuesday that he will fly to Syria on Wednesday to meet with
his Syrian and Saudi counterparts, Faruk Shareh and Saud Al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that he and Shareh and Al-Faisal will
review the latest developments in the Middle East peace process and
the present situation in the Arab world, especially the restoration
of Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a report from Syria quoted an unnamed official source
as saying that the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia will meet in Syria on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the ministers, whose countries play a leading role
in Arab politics, would coordinate their stand on the Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They would focus on the Syrian-Israeli land dispute and also
discuss other issues, including Israel's planned withdrawal from
south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have stalled since January due to
disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights the Jewish
state occupied from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, and control of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has decided to pull back from south Lebanon by
July even without a peace agreement with Syria and Lebanon. Israel
carved up a border strip in south Lebanon in 1985 as a security
zone to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Reveals Post-Withdrawal Stance on UNIFIL, SLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah has revealed its stance on
the role of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and
the fate of South Lebanon Army (SLA) after Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon, said a Middle East Report news bulletin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Hezbollah official said in a statement that "UNIFIL's
first order is to ascertain that Israel has withdrawn beyond the
internationally recognized border in strict conformity with U.N.
resolutions 425 and 426."
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the borderline needs no fresh
demarcation or field surveys to determine its existence, which is
verified and documented in maps lodged with the United Nations by
the truce observers when Lebanon and Israel made the armistice
agreement in 1949.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that UNIFIL will be an administrative tool pending
the Lebanese police deployment.
</P>
<P>
As for SLA, Israel's proxy militia in south Lebanon, the
official said " UNIFIL will not be legally able to protect them if
they are summoned to answer collaboration charges by Lebanese
courts."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas will not cause any problem if SLA
militiamen opt to stay behind as law-abiding Lebanese citizens, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"But they have to pay the price for their collaboration error at
Lebanese courts. If they stay behind as an armed group, we will
treat each of them as an Israeli soldier even if he is within the
zone of UNIFIL operations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the "security zone" which Israel carved out in south Lebanon
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, along with other guerrilla groups,
are waging a war of attrition to oust Israeli troops and the SLA
from south Lebanon, the last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Israel has notified the U.N. last month that it is determined to
pull out its troops from south Lebanon completely by July with or
without an agreement with Lebanon or Syria, which has 35,000 troops
deployed in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Ties With Gulf States Improved: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's relations with all Gulf states,
except Kuwait, have been improved a decade after the 1990 Gulf
Crisis, Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly Saadoun Hamadi said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi said that his country has restored diplomatic ties at the
ambassadorial level with Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
Bahrain, and its ties with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's staunch ally
during the Gulf Crisis, have also been improved to a certain
extent.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of
the ongoing 103rd conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
(IPU), which opened on Saturday to discuss world peace and security
as well as ways of promoting dialogue between different cultures
and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said Iraq had managed to improve people-to-people
relations with all the six Gulf states including Kuwait, and all
the people in these countries expected the United Nations to lift
its crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf Crisis,
which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Kuwait for what he termed as an inaction to
improve the Iraqi-Kuwaiti ties, and said currently "Kuwait only
knows to lash out at Iraq" even 10 years after the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the general debate of the IPU conference on
Monday, Hamadi blamed the decade-long U.N. sanctions on his country
as a war of massive slaughter, which has claimed the lives of some
1.3 million people, most of whom are children.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the U.N. sanctions had been more barbarous than
weapons of mass destruction, which also damaged basic
infrastructure in important economic sectors of Iraq, hence
hindering the development of his country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now has 144 members, is the largest
international parliamentary organization.
</P>
<P>
Its biannual conference serves as an important forum for
parliamentarians of countries under different political systems to
discuss global issues of common concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of 75 photos
vividly portraying the lives of Palestinian refugees and the work
of the special United Nations agencies established 50 years ago to
assist them will be on display at the United Nations Headquarters
in New York from May 3-31, 2000, the U.N. said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Public Information of the United Nations

Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East (UNRWA), which began its humanitarian operations on May 1,
1950.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA was set up by the United Nations General Assembly to
assist about three-quarters of a million Palestinians who
displaced from their homes and land during the first Arab-Israeli
war in 1948-49.
</P>
<P>
Today, the UNRWA provides basic education, health care, relief
and social services for more than 3.7 million registered refugees
living in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Congress "Unwise" If Normal Trade Relations With China Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Tuesday that it would be "very unwise" if the Congress denies
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remark in a speech at a conference of the
Independent Insurance Agents of America, three weeks before a
pivotal U.S. Congress vote on whether to grant China permanent
normal trade relations status.
</P>
<P>
"From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it is in the national security interest of the
United States and also necessary to keep the country's economy
going.
</P>
<P>
China is going to get in the World Trade Organization whether
the U.S. votes to give normal trade relations every year or not,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"There's 1.2 billion people over there and increasingly more
and more of them will be able to buy what Americans can sell," he
said.

<P>
LIMA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian health authorities have
decreed red alert in Bermejo city, bordering Argentina, where an
outbreak of Hanta virus caused the death of two persons.
</P>
<P>
A 36-year-old woman was dismissed last Wednesday after being
detected with symptoms of Hansa virus, said Armando Perez,
epidemology director of Tarija, the daily "El Comercio" reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two fatal victims were a 38-year-old man and another 75.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Health of Bolivia Jose Henricke said in la Paz
that doctors haven't confirmed another case of this being the
Hanta virus, transmitted by rodents and registering a 50 percent
mortality.
</P>
<P>
Henricke said the old man died due to a breathing problem and
ear haemorrhage and apparently didn't have any contact with
rodents nor outings to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The National Center of Tropical Diseases (CENETROP) confirmed
the Hanta virus was cause of these deaths, and health authorities
arranged acts to fight rodents carrying this sickness.

ROME, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Japan have assumed the same

when Italian Premier Giuliano Amato met with visiting Japanese
Prime Minister Yoishiro Mori Monday in Rome.
</P>

assured Amato of his intention to maintain political continuity
with the work of his predecessor for the running of the summit,
and for the imposition and principal themes to be dealt with at
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Among these, relations with emerging countries will be of

the part of G8 to facilitate their insertion in the world economy,
so as to overcome the discrepancies which risk to be accentuated
by the effects of the new technologies.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council is
scheduled to meet at 4:30 p.m. EST Tuesday on Sierra Leone where
17 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Former rebel fighters in Sierra Leone have taken 17 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage in the north and east of the West African
country, a U.N. spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL),
Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, told a press conference in the
Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown that 10 Kenyan members of the
force had been seized in one incident on Monday, and seven Indians
and a helicopter in another.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian U.N. peacekeeper wounded in a weekend shooting
incident by rebels in Sierra Leone has been sent home for
treatment, the U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the first of its kind since the force was
sent to police a peace deal signed by the warring parties in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
The attackers were supporters of the Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, a military movement which held power
briefly after toppling President Ahmad Kabbah in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK to Hold Talks in Rome on May 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will hold a new round
of talks in Rome on May 24, discussing issues concerning the
bilateral relations, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Boucher, the new spokesman for the State Department,
said the issues to be discussed includes the 1994 framework
agreement on DPRK's nuclear program and a visit to Washington by a
senior DPRK official.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 agreement, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea froze its nuclear program in exchange for promises that
Western countries would provide it with fuel oil and build two
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said that the two sides might discuss the
eventual shipment of spent fuel out of the DPRK and inspections of
its facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The visit by a senior DPRK official would be another important
issue on agenda as Washington still hoped that the visit,
originally scheduled in late March, could be realized.
</P>
<P>
In advance of the Rome meeting, delegations from the United
States, Japan and South Korea will meet in Tokyo on May 12 to
coordinate policy toward the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Talks End without Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All sides made clear that no breakthrough had been achieved but
made positive noises in varying degrees about future talks.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish prime ministers were to hold more talks
with the pro-agreement parties as the pace steps up to find a
breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern will travel to Belfast on Thursday for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a day of separate discussions with the
parties in London on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Northern Ireland devolution was suspended on February 11,
the two governments have been meeting the parties, but the impasse
between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein over IRA arms and
sharing power has remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's official spokesman, Alistair Campbell,
said that Blair believed that there was "some prospect of making
progress", but he admitted difficulties remained.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish prime ministers met separately with the
leaders of the pro-agreement parties Sinn Fein, the Ulster
Unionist Party, and the main nationalist party the Social
Democratic and Labour Party throughout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
denied that his party had been pressurized to make concessions at
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Adams said: "It isn't a matter of pressure. We don't come to
Downing Street to be pressurized. We have had a long day, we had a
number of discussions with the Taoiseach and the British Prime
Minister. None of us should underestimate the difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble challenged republicans to
meet the May 22 Agreement deadline for arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
In a strong statement,Trimble said there was still time for
decommissioning to be carried out, but he said the republican
movement needed to state what they were prepared to do about it,if
anything."
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern are struggling to turn the high hopes of the
1998 Good Friday accord into reality by getting parties to agree
on a formula to take guns out of the political arena and rebuild a
power-sharing government of Roman Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
The unionists refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political ally, unless the guerrilla group
disarms. The IRA equates disarmament with surrender.
</P>
<P>
It blames Britain for the current impasse, after it suspended a
fledgling power-sharing executive in February.

<HEADLINE> Annan Condemns Acts Against U.N. Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday condemned the "outrageous and criminal acts" against
U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, calling upon former rebel
leaders in the West African country "to cease these acts
immediately."
</P>
<P>
Annan voiced his condemnation in a statement issued here by
his spokesman just before the U.N. Security Council is scheduled
to meet at 4:30 p.m. EST on Sierra Leone, where former rebel
fighters have taken 17 U.N. peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General condemns these outrageous and criminal
acts against U.N. peacekeepers and calls upon the leadership of
the RUF (the Revolutionary United Front), in particular Foday
Sankoh, to cease these acts immediately and to cooperate in good
faith in the implementation of the commitment he freely entered
into under the Lome Peace Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet at 4:30 p.m.
EST Tuesday on Sierra Leone where 17 U.N. peacekeepers were taken
hostage in the north and east of the West African country, U.N.
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL),
Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, told a press conference in the
Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown that 10 Kenyan members of the
force had been seized in one incident on Monday, and seven Indians
and a helicopters in another.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is deeply disturbed by recent incidents
in Sierra Leone, during which fighters belonging to RUF have
physically obstructed the DDR (disarmament, Demobilization and
Rehabilitation) process, detained civilian and military personnel
of UNAMSIL and attacked UNAMSIL troops at Makeni and Magburaka,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian U.N. peacekeeper wounded in a weekend shooting
incident by rebels in Sierra Leone has been sent home for
treatment, the U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the first of its kind since the force was
sent to police a peace deal signed by the warring parties in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
The attackers were supporters of the Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, a military movement which held power
briefly after toppling President Ahmad Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The incidents took place as the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force, known as ECOMOG which halted Sierra Leone's
civil war and restored President Kabbah to power completed its
final withdrawal Tuesday, leaving the United Nations to police the
fragile peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL deployed in April to monitor the implementation of the
Lome Peace Agreement, signed by warring parties in Togo's capital
in July 1999. It is scheduled to reach its target strength of 11,
100, which would make it the world's largest U.N. peacekeeping
operation, by July this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
received laboratory equipment worth about 641,000 U.S. dollars
from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) to boost its mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
Handing over the equipment through the Southern and Eastern
African Mineral Center (SEAMIC) in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, the
UNIDO country representative Felix Ugbor said recent development
in many African countries especially in Tanzania showed that the
mineral sector can be a major contributor to the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
There may be other new areas in future that call for
collaboration between SEAMIC and UNIDO, said the UN official.
</P>
<P>
SEAMIC is an inter-governmental organization formally
established in 1977 under the sponsorship of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa in order to enable member states of
Eastern and Southern Africa to pool their resources together and
establish a capacity to accelerate the development of their
extensive mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
The objective is achieved through the provision of advisory,
laboratory, training, information and other specialized services
to maintain mining and mineral sectors of the member states which
comprises Angola, the Comoros, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania and
Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 180,000 people die of asthma
each year in Ghana despite the availability of adequate treatment,
the Ghana News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Audrey Forson, Organizing Secretary of the Ghana Asthma
Society, was quoted as saying in Ghana's capital Accra that over
150 million people in the world have been diagnosed with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Marking the World Asthma Day, which falls on May 3, Forson said
the incidence of asthma was increasing throughout the world,
adding the disease is a public health problem in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the celebration would highlight the need for every
person with asthma to have a timely diagnosis, receive appropriate
treatment, learn to manage their asthma in partnership with health
professionals, and reduce exposure to environmental factors that
make asthmatic attacks worse.
</P>
<P>
The World Asthma Day, which is being observed this year under
the theme that "Let every person breathe", is to increase
awareness of the disease as a global health problem, communicate
progress in treatment and involve public authorities, professional
organizations and patients in implementing effective management
programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Commonwealth action group, which held a meeting in London
on Tuesday, said McKinnon would relay their concerns to President
Robert Mugabe later this month.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, the ministers said
that McKinnon would convey the "deep concerns of the group" at the
unrest in Zimbabwe, a former British colony.
</P>
<P>
It said ministers "welcomed the willingness of the government
of Zimbabwe to accept international election observers and
confirmed the willingness of the Commonwealth to send such a team".
</P>
<P>
The eight foreign ministers, who make up the group, also
decided to send a substantial team of monitors to scrutinize the
forthcoming general elections in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers expressed their support for an environment in which
fair elections, free of intimidation and within the time schedule
prescribed by the constitution of Zimbabwe, can be held," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also welcomed Zimbabwe's acceptance of foreign
monitors.
</P>
<P>
The London meeting was the first by the Commonwealth
ministerial action group since the Zimbabwe crisis blew up.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook set the tone for the
meeting by saying the whole Commonwealth condemned the climate of
intimidation prevailing in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out economic sanctions or suspension from the
Commonwealth, but hinted that could change if President Mugabe
failed to hold elections.

<HEADLINE> British Court Orders Embassy Bomb Suspects to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A British court on Tuesday ordered
the extradition of two Egyptians to the United States in
connection with the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The extradition was ordered today," a Reuters report quoted a
court official at a Magistrates Court in London as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both suspects have the right to appeal against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the two suspects to face charges of
conspiracy to murder over the bombings on August 7, 1998, which
killed at least 215 people in Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the two were members of a militant
group called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, said to be affiliated
with Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Washington accuses bin Laden, who has been living in
Afghanistan as a guest of the ruling Islamic fundamentalist
Taleban movement, of masterminding the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called on the Taleban to expel bin Laden
but it has refused, saying there was no criminal evidence against
him.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Congress "Unwise" If Normal Trade Relations With China Denied (updates with Berger's remarks) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Tuesday that it would be "very unwise" if the Congress denies
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remark in a speech at a conference of the
Independent Insurance Agents of America, three weeks before a
pivotal U.S. Congress vote on whether to grant China permanent
normal trade relations status.
</P>
<P>
"From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it is in the national security interest of the
United States and also necessary to keep the country's economy
going.
</P>
<P>
China is going to get in the World Trade Organization whether
the U.S. votes to give normal trade relations every year or not,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"There's 1.2 billion people over there and increasingly more
and more of them will be able to buy what Americans can sell,"he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said that
rejecting normalized trade with China would have "serious and
substantial consequences" for U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting (normalized trade) is a risky proposition," Berger
said in a speech at Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Rejection will set off a downward spiral that could disrupt
stability in Asia, diminish the chance of dialogue across the
Taiwan Strait and deflate hopes for a more constructive
relationship between the U.S. and China," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Pass Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I urge Congress to pass this package now," Clinton told the
Council of Americas. The package was proposed by the Clinton
administration early this year and approved by the House in March.
The Senate will vote on it in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Colombians waging this campaign are fighting not just for
themselves, they're fighting for all of us, all of us in this room
and the hundreds of millions of people we represent," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Colombian President Andres Pastrana mapped a plan to
fight drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas in his country.
Colombia produces an estimated 80 percent of the world's cocaine
supply and provides more than 90 percent of cocaine in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"It's a comprehensive plan to seek peace, fight drugs, build
the economy, and deepen democracy. The plan costs about $7.5
billion. It includes contributions from the government of
Colombia, international financial institutions and other donors,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton indicated that helping Colombia is also helping the goal
of achieving a Free Trade Area of the Americas that would stretch
from Alaska and Patagonia by 2005, the target date set by the
United States and 33 other countries at a 1994 summit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
"We have to win in Colombia. We have to win the fight for the
free trade area in the Americas," he said.

<HEADLINE> 50 Million Americans Go Online in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Dial-up Internet service
provider (ISP) remains the most popular Internet access method in
the United States, despite growth in the emerging high-speed
access marketplace, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The method now accounts for nearly 46.7 million U.S. customers
in the first quarter of this year, up 10 percent since the end of
1999, according to Telecommunications Reports International, a U.S.
communications industry information service.
</P>
<P>
In total, more than 50 million consumers joined the online
world during the first quarter, an increase of 11 percent as
compared to the previous quarter. Among high-speed access
technologies, digital subscriber line (DSL) service registered the
highest growth rate, 183 percent, but captured less than 200,000
customers so far, while access via cable modems increased by 44
percent, capturing 2.3 million customers. Access via Internet TV
saw a slight decline in subscribers to just over 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Heated competition, mergers and acquisitions, and alternative
business models have continued to have an impact on the top-tier
ISP marketplace during the period. According to the report, the
six largest ISPs, led by America Online, now account for 73
percent of the total online audience in the United States. As more
customers turn to high-speed access, the report said, the dial-up
ISP market may see significant changes in its demographics and
services as premium customers and features move to the high-speed
platforms.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Voices Strongest Condemnation of Hostile Acts in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday condemned "in the strongest terms the hostile and
destructive actions" against U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone,
where 20 U.N. personnel were taken hostage by former rebel
fighters, and said that those responsible should be brought to
justice.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the 15-
nation Security Council for May, Wang Yingfan of China, said, "
Council members condemn in the strongest terms the hostile and
destructive actions of the RUF (the Revolutionary United Front)
against UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone) and other
international personnel, and strongly believe those responsible
should be brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
Council members, who met in an urgent closed-door session on
Tuesday afternoon, "expressed grave concern at turn of events in
recent days" in the war-torn country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded "the RUF release detained U.N.
and other international personnel immediately," and considered "
RUF's behavior criminal, and failure of Foday Sankoh to take
measures to stop is tantamount to violation of his obligations
under the Lome Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon Sankoh, a RUF leader, to "
give instructions to his followers to end these attacks, withdraw
immediately and fulfill his obligations under the Lome Agreement,"
signed by warring parties in July 1999, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is
currently on Africa tour, condemned the "outrageous and criminal
acts" against U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, calling upon
former rebel leaders in the West African country "to cease these
acts immediately."
</P>
<P>
Annan voiced his condemnation in a statement issued here by
his spokesman just before the U.N. Security Council is scheduled
to meet at 4:30 p.m. EST on Sierra Leone, saying that he "condemns
these outrageous and criminal acts against U.N. peacekeepers and
calls upon the leadership of the RUF, in particular Foday Sankoh,
to cease these acts immediately and to cooperate in good faith in
the implementation of the commitment he freely entered into under
the Lome Peace Agreement."
</P>
<P>
The commander of the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL),
Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, told a press conference in the
Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown that 10 Kenyan members of the
force had been seized in one incident on Monday, and seven Indians
and a helicopters in another.
</P>
<P>
Council members "commend UNASMIL troops and Force Commander
General Jetley for their courage and resolve in attempting to
bring this situation under control, and express full support for
the continued efforts being made to this end," said the Council
statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the same day, the U.N. spokesman, David Wimhust,
told a press conference here that UNAMSIL "is seeking to obtain
the rapid release of its personnel."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is trying to obtain the release of its
personnel "as rapidly as possible and as safely as possible,"
Wimhurst said, adding that there would be negotiations at "all
levels."
</P>
<P>
The recent events had created obstacles to the ongoing peace
process in the West African nation, which suffered a nine-year
civil war until last July.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian U.N. peacekeeper wounded in a weekend shooting
incident by rebels in Sierra Leone has been sent home for
treatment, the U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the first of its kind since the force was
sent to police a peace deal signed by the warring parties in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
The attackers were supporters of the Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, a military movement which held power
briefly after toppling President Ahmad Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The incidents took place as the Nigerian-led West African
intervention force, known as ECOMOG which halted Sierra Leone's
civil war and restored President Kabbah to power completed its
final withdrawal Tuesday, leaving the United Nations to police the
fragile peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL deployed in April to monitor the implementation of the
Lome Peace Agreement, signed by warring parties in Togo's capital
in July 1999. It is scheduled to reach its target strength of 11,
100, which would make it the world's largest U.N. peacekeeping
operation, by July this year.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Declaration on Nuclear Disarmament by 5 Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- France hailed on Tuesday the
declaration made by the five nuclear powers on their commitment to
a total elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry said that France has
actively contributed to the elaboration of this declaration which
stressed the commitment of the five nuclear powers to a full
implementation of the objectives of the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT) -- disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of
atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
The declaration recalls the unequivocal commitment by the five
powers to the final objectives of complete elimination of the
nuclear arms and a treaty of complete disarmament under strict and
effective international control, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The five powers also appealed to the conference of disarmament
to reach an agreement as soon as possible on a working program
aimed at starting negotiations immediately on the a treaty banning
the production of fissile materials for nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
France considers that such negotiations are essential for
strengthening the regime of nuclear non-proliferation and pushing
forward nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
France also hopes that the declaration by the five will have an
echo at the conference on the examination of the NPT being held in
New York, and that the countries participating in the conference
will give a ``decisive impulse'' to disarmament as they did in
1996 by creating the Complete Test Ban Treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Tuesday hosted a conference at the White
House on helping families raise "responsible, resourceful"
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
At the session, Clinton ordered a ban on discrimination against
parents in the federal work force out of concern that home life
will affect their work.
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or promote employees who have children at home,"
Clinton said at the session.
</P>
<P>
"The job they are doing at home is more important," he said,
adding that communication and family togetherness are crucial
factors in raising responsible, happy teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called for expanding family-leave legislation and
increasing funding for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind, was attended by parents,
teens, teachers, youth workers and others. The participants called
for more government steps to help parents and teens.
</P>
<P>
"Parents are still the most important adults in their teenagers
' lives," said first lady Hillary.
</P>
<P>
New research showed that early teen-age years are a crucial
step in brain development.
</P>
<P>
U.S. teenagers are facing major challenges of smoking, drug use,
pregnancy and gun violence.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Briefs Japanese PM France's Priorities at Okinawa Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
briefed Tuesday evening Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on
the priorities of France at the Group of Eight summit to be held
in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
The priorities France wishes to discuss with other attending
countries include a reinforcement of the legitimacy of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the reducing of debts of Third
World countries, and environment protection and fight against
global warming, a spokeswoman of the Elysee presidential palace
said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also assured Mori of full support by France to a success
of the Okinawa summit, said the spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
``In the financial field, France makes it a priority to
reinforce the legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund, whose
universalness and solidarity should be reinforced,'' Chirac was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
France wishes to see to a full respect of the ``codes of
conduct'' in international financial market and to harden the
fight against
financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
Paris also intends to push forward concertation of the three
great monetary zones in the world with the U.S. dollar, the
Japanese yen and the European single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he wishes the Okinawa summit will give a``
positive signal of confidence in the perspectives which the
technologies of information are opening.''
</P>
<P>
As for the reduction of debts for the world's poorest countries,
France will call for a quick implementation of the promises made
by the rich countries in Cologne in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized countries promised then to make``
generous and necessary decisions'' in favor of reducing the debts
of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
``The Okinawa summit should give an impulse to it.'' said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Mori arrived in Paris on Tuesday in the second leg of his tour
of the seven countries which will attend the Okinawa summit.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock fell broadly
Tuesday on fears of rising interest rates, AT&AMP;T's cautious profit
outlook and profit-taking in technology sector.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
80.66 at 10,731.12, eliminating all its gain of 77.87 points
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 172.63 at 3,785.45, its first drop in
four sessions, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 21.96 at 1,
446.29.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged as the latest surveys showed little evidence
of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and gave the Federal Reserve
Board reasons to raise interest rates again to cool off the nation
's hot economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that new home sales
rose in March to their second-highest level on record despite
rising mortgage rates. Meanwhile, the Conference Board said in a
report that its Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators
rose 0.1 percent in march after a drop in February, indicating a
continued growth.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times since last June
in an effort to ward off inflation and more hike in rates is
expected at its policymaking meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
The market was also hit by AT&AMP;T's earnings report. The company
said its earnings in the long-distance market will grow at 1.89 U.
S. dollars to 1.85 dollars a share in year 2000, less than the
previous estimate of 1.89 dollars to 1.94 dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
Investors drew some money out of the technology sector to lock
in profits from solid gains in the previous three sessions. The
move dragged the Nasdaq index lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.82 at 645.75 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 10.46 at 925.72. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 13.58 at 505.35.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,702 down, 1,313 up and 421
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.01 billion shares from 943.85
million in the previous session.
